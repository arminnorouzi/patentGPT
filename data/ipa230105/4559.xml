Indeed, certain terms may even be emphasized below; however, any terminology intended to be interpreted in any restricted manner will be overtly and specifically defined as such in this Detailed Description section. Both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the features, as claimed.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this disclosure, the term &#x201c;based on&#x201d; means &#x201c;based at least in part on.&#x201d; The singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context dictates otherwise. The term &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used in the sense of &#x201c;example&#x201d; rather than &#x201c;ideal.&#x201d; The terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; or other variations thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion such that a process, method, or product that comprises a list of elements does not necessarily include only those elements, but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such a process, method, article, or apparatus. Relative terms, such as, &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; and &#x201c;generally,&#x201d; are used to indicate a possible variation of &#xb1;10% of a stated or understood value.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the following description, embodiments will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. As will be discussed in more detail below, systems and methods for monitoring user-defined metrics are disclosed. Embodiments of the present disclosure may provide for an attribution engine that includes a system for monitoring business metrics designed around flexibility and ease of use by analysts. For example, a user may define a new monitoring metric through structured query language (SQL) commands submitted to the attribution engine. Upon submission, the entire scheduling and reporting pipeline may be automatically set up and users may retrieve historical reports on the defined metrics on-demand.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Embodiments of the present disclosure may also provide for a system architecture for the attribution engine. The system architecture may include three major components, including, for example, configuration, scheduling, and a data warehouse. Users may submit metric definitions (e.g., SQL commands to be run on the data warehouse) to the configuration component. The configuration component may store the definitions and may pass the definitions to the scheduling component. The scheduling component may submit the SQL commands to the data warehouse on a regular basis with user-defined frequencies and may store the results of the commands in the data warehouse itself. Copies of the results may also be routed to a separate database and/or cloud storage for diagnostic purposes.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The configuration component may consist of a REST API layer that receives user-input metric definitions (e.g., as SQL commands). For example, a user may submit the metric definitions to the configuration component via a user interface. The user interface may abstract away any operation beyond the metric definition, and may also expose (e.g., display) previously submitted metric definitions. Thus, users may use previously submitted metric definitions as needed, rather than submit entirely new metric definitions. Submitted metric definitions may be stored in a relational database.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The scheduling component may pick up the SQL queries from the relational database and may send the queries to the data warehouse. In some embodiments, the scheduling component may run on an Apache Airflow platform. The operations within the SQL queries may be processed in the data warehouse and the outcomes may be appended to a table of results within the data warehouse itself. Thus, users may access the results via the table of results displayed on the user interface. Programmatic consumption by applications may also be possible through copies of the results sent to cloud storage and/or a results database.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to the appended drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a system <b>100</b> for monitoring user-defined metrics. The system <b>100</b> may include a user device <b>110</b> operated by a user <b>105</b>, and a server system <b>120</b>. User device <b>110</b> and server system <b>120</b> may communicate through communication network <b>150</b>, which may be one or a combination of public networks (e.g., the Internet), local networks, and/or other networks.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">User <b>105</b> may be any person or plurality of persons who operate user device <b>110</b> to utilize metrics monitoring functionalities provided by server system <b>120</b>. The role of user <b>105</b> may depend on the usage context of system <b>100</b>. For example, if server system <b>120</b> is operated by an organization, such as a company, corporation, or other organization, user <b>105</b> may represent an analyst that utilizes server system <b>120</b> for monitoring metrics that are relevant to that organization.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this disclosure, the term &#x201c;metric&#x201d; is used broadly and expansively. For example, a &#x201c;metric&#x201d; may be a measure or evaluation of some aspect (e.g., activities and/or events) of interest. A metric may be, for example, a performance indicator that measures the performance of, for example, a process, a business operation, or a business or organization as a whole. In some embodiments, a metric may be a business metric that characterizes business-related event(s), such as customer-related activity. For example, a business metric may indicate a quantity, value (e.g., monetary value), and/or statistical characteristic of a certain type of customer activity, such as a number of weekly signups for a new product over a certain period of time. A business metric may also be referred to as a business performance indicator.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A &#x201c;metric&#x201d; may be a parameter whose value(s) are determined by data analysis. Such data analysis may be performed using database queries as described in this disclosure. For example, a metric may be a number of new customers per week for a certain line of business, and the values of such metric (e.g., 1500 new customers in week 1, and 1600 new customers in week 2) may be determined by database queries. The values of a metric may be associated with a certain time or time periods (e.g., week 1, week 2, etc.).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">User device <b>110</b> may be any suitable computer system, such as a laptop or desktop computer or a mobile computing device such as a smartphone, tablet, or wearable computable device. User device <b>110</b> may display a user interface (UI) <b>115</b> enabling user <b>105</b> to access metrics monitoring functionalities provided by server system <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, user interface <b>115</b> may be a graphical user interface of a webpage or web application wherein the webpage or web application may be executed in a web browser application of user device <b>110</b>. In additional applications, the user interface <b>115</b> may be part of a native application executed, or otherwise presented, on user device <b>110</b>. While a single user <b>105</b> and a single user device <b>110</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it is understood that system <b>110</b> may include a plurality of such user devices, including other user devices <b>111</b>, each operated by a respective user.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Server system <b>120</b> may monitor metrics based on configurations received from user devices, such as user device <b>110</b>. For example, user <b>105</b> may define a new metric and submit the metric to server system <b>120</b> through user interface <b>115</b>. A metric that is defined by the user in a manner usable by server system <b>120</b> may be referred to as a &#x201c;metric definition.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A metric definition may have any suitable form that permits server system <b>120</b> to run database queries based on the metric definition. In various embodiments, a metric definition may be a query definition that defines a database query to be executed. This database query may be defined by the query definition such that execution of the database query returns data constituting the metric. A query definition may specify one or more database statements, which may be specified in structured query language (SQL) format.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some cases, a query definition may include only explicit database statement(s), in which case the query definition may be executed without further modification. For example, the entire query definition may be an SQL query that is executable as-is. However, a query definition may also include interpreted code, such as code that indicates variables to be resolved at the time the database query is executed. Such variables may be used so as to allow the query definition to define a database query that is variable depending on the circumstances of execution, such as the time or date of execution. A query definition may be interchangeably referred to as a query template.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Server system <b>120</b> may have automated scheduling and reporting pipeline for handling queries. That is, upon receiving a query definition from user device <b>110</b>, server system <b>120</b> may automatically set up and execute a query in accordance with the query definition. Accordingly, user device <b>110</b> and other user devices <b>111</b> may retrieve historical reports, which are generated from execution of the defined metrics, on demand.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The functionalities of server system <b>120</b> for metrics monitoring may collectively constitute a metrics monitoring engine or an attribution engine. The metrics monitoring engine or attribution engine may include a configuration component, a scheduling component, and a data warehouse component, all of which may be software components executed on server system <b>120</b>. In general, user <b>105</b> may submit, to the configuration component, metric definitions (e.g., such as query definitions) that are to be executed by the data warehouse component. The configuration component may store the metric definitions and pass them to the scheduling component. The scheduling component may then submit query definitions to the data warehouse component on a regular basis with user-defined frequencies and may store the results of the queries executed according to the query definitions in the warehouse itself. Copies of the results may be also routed to a separate database and cloud storage for diagnostic purposes.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Server system <b>120</b> may be a computer system of any form that is suitable for performing the functionalities described in this disclosure. For example, server system <b>120</b> may have a cloud computing platform with scalable resources for computations and/or data storage, and may run one or more applications on the cloud computing platform to perform the functionalities attributed to server system <b>120</b> in this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The configuration component may include an application programming interface (API) <b>122</b> and metric definitions database <b>124</b>. API <b>122</b> may provide an API layer to which user device <b>110</b> may submit metric definitions (e.g., query definitions). Submission of metric definitions may be performed via user interface <b>115</b>, which may abstract away operations beyond metric definition. User interface <b>115</b> may additionally expose previously submitted metric definitions to user <b>105</b> so that user <b>105</b> may use them, if desired. Metric definitions received from user device <b>110</b> may be stored in metric definitions database <b>124</b>, which may be, for example, a relational database or other suitable data store.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The scheduling component may include scheduler <b>126</b>. For example, scheduler <b>126</b> may an Apache Airflow scheduler that runs on the Apache Airflow platform. Scheduler <b>126</b> may retrieve one or more metric definitions from metric definitions database <b>124</b> and determine a database query in accordance with the metric definition. In determining a database query in accordance with the metric definition, any variables in the metric definition may be resolved in order to generate the database query. After determining the database query, scheduler <b>126</b> may provide the database query to the data warehouse component for query processing.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The data warehouse component may be data warehouse <b>128</b>. Data warehouse <b>128</b> may perform the database query provided by scheduler <b>126</b>. The results of the query may be stored within data warehouse <b>128</b>. In some embodiments, the results may be appended to a table of results stored within data warehouse <b>128</b>.

The variables may include different values that are valid in different contexts, such as, for example, different environments, different dates, etc. Thus, the same query may be run in any different context, as defined by the variables. In the exemplary metric definition MD1, the variables may include, for example, target schema, table name, start date, and end date. Thus, the query for metric definition MD1 may be run in different contexts, including different target schema, different table names, and/or different start and end dates.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">After the events have been stored in metric definition database <b>124</b>, any event may be accessed by any user <b>105</b> via user device <b>110</b> and/or other user devices <b>111</b> for any type of campaign. For example, campaigns may include any number of events. Thus, different lines of business (LOBs) may utilize the metric definitions stored in metric definitions database <b>124</b> for various events as needed.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Measuring the efficacy of products and business initiatives through analytics is a function useful to a business. However, efficacy can be measured in a wide variety of metrics, some of which are more relevant to the business problem at hand than others. The attribution engine of the present disclosure provides analysts the ability to customize any metric they require, as long as the relevant data is available. In addition, the attribution engine of the present disclosure automatically sets up the entire monitoring process once the analyst has provided the SQL query to define the metric, saving hours or more of manual effort. Analysts can also re-use any metric that has been defined previously, saving them the trouble of creating a query from scratch. The reusability of queries is especially advantageous in the case of commonly used metrics, in that multiple analysts requiring the same metric can access the results of a single calculation instead of expending resources on running the same calculation per analyst.
