LC alignment is also a fundamental part of non-optical applications such as LC elastomer &#x2018;origami&#x2019;, controlled placement of colloidal particles, and control of active matter. Many of these applications benefit from or require the ability to control and pattern the azimuthal, or in-plane, orientation of the LC director. Of the many alignment techniques that have been developed, photoalignment, i.e. casting a thin film of organic material and exposing it to light, is an attractive method offering full control over the azimuthal angle by simply controlling the polarization state of the alignment exposure; this is typically accomplished through holography or direct-write methods. Control over the polar orientation, or LC pretilt, of the LC director, however, has proven more challenging since it requires manipulation out of the plane with respect to the substrate.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For nematic LC mixtures, alignment has been achieved using a variety of mechanical, chemical, and optical methods to manipulate the surface and induce long-range alignment of the LC&#x2014;both in the plane of the surface (azimuthal alignment) and out-of-plane (polar pretilt angle). Each alignment method has its advantages and drawbacks, but ultimately an ideal LC alignment layer should be achievable with minimal processing to provide uniform and user-defined control of the in-plane and out-of-plane LC orientation with strong surface anchoring.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Full control of the LC pretilt (0-90&#xb0;) has been achieved by several methods utilizing polyimides. These include altering the chemical structure of the polyimide, using a combination of polyimides that induce homeotropic (perpendicular to the substrate) and planar (parallel to the substrate) alignment, and modification of the polyimide film with focused ion beam. However, these methods retain the general drawbacks associated with using polyimides including buildup of static charge, surface contamination, a necessary high temperature imidization step, and difficulty in patterning azimuthal alignment</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One attractive alternative method for LC alignment control is photoalignment (PA), wherein a thin film of a particular material, typically incorporating one of more azo-chemical moieties, is deposited on the surface of interest and exposed to polarized light to induce a preferred molecular alignment of the film and, consequently, the LC material. These organic PA materials are documented to provide uniform LC alignment, strong surface anchoring, and minimal processing. Therefore, they are an attractive LC alignment layer for electro-optics research and applications.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A need exists for improved techniques for patternable out-of-plane photoalignment, particularly techniques that allow for in-situ rewriting for spatial and temporal control over LC.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a first embodiment, a method of photoalignment comprises applying an alignment film comprising brilliant yellow (BY) to a substrate; exposing the alignment film to a linearly polarized light source with a wavelength between 400-550 nm; and then exposing the alignment film to obliquely incident unpolarized light, thereby establishing a pretilt angle.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further embodiment includes the method of the first embodiment wherein the exposure to unpolarized light is made in situ in the presence of liquid crystal to create a pretilt angle therein.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another embodiment is a liquid crystal apparatus comprising a substrate, an alignment film of brilliant yellow (BY) in contact with the substrate, and liquid crystal molecules in contact with the alignment film, wherein the liquid crystal molecules have a re-writable pretilt angle anywhere in the range of 0&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The patent or application file contains at least one drawing executed in color.

A pretilt angle of 0&#xb0; (long axis of LC molecule parallel to the surface) is termed planar alignment and a pretilt of 90&#xb0; (long axis of LC molecule normal to substrate surface) is termed homeotropic alignment.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Overview</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As described herein, the azo-dye Brilliant Yellow (BY) operates as a superior photoalignment (PA) layer in a two-step exposure method to achieve a wide range of pre-tilt angles for liquid crystal (LC) materials at a user prescribed in-plane (azimuthal) orientation and out-of-plane (polar) pretilt, i.e., the angle that the LC director makes with respect to the LC-substrate interface. The degree of out-of-plane pretilt is user-defined by setting the angle of a second unpolarized exposure with respect to the substrate surface, and the full range of pretilt from 0&#xb0; to 90&#xb0; was demonstrated.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In voltage-tuned or switchable devices, the pretilt acts to optimize the reorientation of the nematic LC. For homogeneous planar alignment, such as after the first polarized exposure of BY film, the pretilt angle is effectively 0&#xb0; and results in degenerate lowest energy states when a voltage is applied across the LC. It may produce reverse tilt disclinations which serve as sources of scattering loss and, therefore, degraded performance. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate the use of LC pretilt in electro-optic applications. As illustrated in the schematic depiction on the left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, without pretilt, liquid molecules are oriented in a planar fashion flat on the surface when a &#x201c;voltage off&#x201d; condition exists. As a result, upon the application of voltage as seen in the images on the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, symmetry defects become manifest as disclinations or line defects, leading to problems such as scattering, surface memory, and the like. In contrast, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the presence of pretilt in the voltage off condition can reduce or even eliminate such defects.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Brilliant Yellow Processing and Exposure</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A thin layer of the photoaligning azodye brilliant yellow (BY) was deposited and processed on a substrate surface to induce LC alignment at a user-defined azimuthal orientation and polar pre-tilt angle.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Thin uniform films of BY on a surface are achieved by spincoating a dilute solution of the dye dissolved in a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide (DMF). Typical concentrations are 0.1%-3% BY by weight. Spincoating at 3000 rpm leaves very uniform films with thicknesses between 3 nm and 60 nm obtainable.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It was determined that a concentration of BY in DMF of about 0.6% served to optimize the BY layer thickness such that sufficient BY is deposited to induce uniform alignment on the substrate surface. The BY solution was passed through a 0.2 &#x3bc;m filter to remove particles that might contribute to scattering defects and degrade the quality of the LC alignment.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Once deposited on the substrate surface, the BY alignment layer was then exposed to a linearly polarized light source with a wavelength between 400-550 nm, which overlaps with the absorption spectrum of BY, and an intensity &#x2dc;10-100 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>for a period of five minutes.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> provides a schematic of one exemplary exposure system. The orientation of the polarized exposure may be user-defined at an arbitrary angle to impart uniform planar (azimuthal) alignment.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The BY photoalignment layer is also capable of imparting a controllable polar pretilt angle, i.e., the angle that the LC director makes with respect to the LC-substrate interface. The symmetry at the LC-BY interface can be broken by performing a second exposure to the BY film (either before or after the LC fill) at an oblique angle with an unpolarized light source (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The pretilt angle can be modulated by controlling the incident angle of this unpolarized exposure since the BY (and thus LC) molecules will orient out of the plane of the substrate surface and along the propagation direction of the unpolarized exposure. In general, it is noted that optimization of the light collimation and precision of the angular exposure results in greater uniformity while higher power and an optimized exposure power/time improve the quality of LC alignment.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment of a basic electro-optical device (a standard LC cell as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>), light is transmitted through the LC-filled cell, where the LC has been aligned in-plane and out-of-plane according to the BY exposure conditions. If an electrode is added to each surface, a voltage may be applied to the LC within the cell such that nematic LC reorients thereby modulating the optical properties with respect to the transmitted light. Removal of the voltage restores the LC to its previously aligned state as defined by the surface anchoring strength and in-plane and out-of-plane alignment conditions of the BY layer.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Exposure of BY Films in Contact with LC</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the establishment of pretilt, it was found exposure to obliquely incident unpolarized light with the LC already in contact with BY, a greater range of pretilt was obtainable.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A BY alignment layer was coated onto glass as described above. Substrates were then assembled into cells utilizing 5 &#x3bc;m silica sphere spacers and Norland Optical Adhesive 65 (Norland Products, Inc.). After assembly, the optical adhesive was cured by a localized UV exposure to prevent damaging of BY film.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">After cell-assembly the initial photo-alignment was performed by exposure to a linearly polarized 435 nm source at an intensity of 25 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>for 5 minutes utilizing a Luxeon Rebel Tri-Star LED (Luxeon Star LEDS). Following exposure, the cells were filled with E7 (Merck KGaA) in the isotropic phase at 80&#xb0; C. by capillary action and cooled slowly to room temperature in the nematic phase. Next, samples were exposed to obliquely incident unpolarized light at an intensity of 100 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>for 10 minutes. The oblique exposure was performed utilizing a 415 nm ThorLabs Solis LED source.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Samples were characterized by collecting polarized absorbance spectrum of the BY films as well as pretilt measurements of the filled cells after oblique exposure. Polarized absorbance spectrum were collected using an Ocean Optics USB4000 Spectrometer and a Glan-Thompson prism to control the input polarization. The pretilt angle was determined by measuring the retardation of the sample for varying angles of incidence utilizing the Senarmont technique as described in Bloss (1981). The birefringence data was then fit to the theoretical prediction for the angular-dependent retardation of an LC sample with arbitrary pretilt angle as described in Gwag (2003).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> provide comparative data for photoalignment techniques. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is adapted from Chigrinov et al. (2005) using the azo-dye SD1, showing that pretilt angles limited to no greater than <b>6</b> degrees could be when using SD1. In contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> provides data using BY as a photoalignment layer, either exposed without the presence LC or in situ (meaning with BY in contact with LC molecules), showing the achievability of greater pretilt angles, up to nearly 90 degrees in the case of the in situ exposure.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The ability to pattern a broad range of pretilt angle with a single BY alignment film is shown in the images provided in the polarized optical microscopy images in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, the central region received unpolarized exposure near normal incidence and the cell exhibits both homeotropic (90&#xb0; pretilt) and planar (0&#xb0; pretilt) alignment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, central regions received oblique exposure at two different angles of incidence and the cell exhibits planar alignment with zero pretilt, 60degree pretilt, and 50 degree pretilt. Note the orientation of crossed polarizers in each row of the figure is indicated in the upper left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It was further found that the pre-tilt angle was re-writable, such that a second additional exposure to obliquely incident unpolarized light could establish a new pre-tilt angle.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> shows sample that first received an exposure with angle of incidence (&#x3b8;<sub>i</sub>)=10&#xb0; followed by an exposure with &#x3b8;<sub>i</sub>=40&#xb0;; the pretilt angles measured after these exposures were 77&#xb0; and 68&#xb0;, respectively. This demonstrates the potential to re-write the pretilt angle while retaining a uniform LC texture. The experiment was also conducted in the reverse order with an initial exposure at &#x3b8;<sub>i</sub>=40&#xb0; and a subsequent exposure at &#x3b8;<sub>i</sub>=10&#xb0;. The pretilt angle measured after these exposures was 60&#xb0; and 79&#xb0;, respectively. The ability to easily re-write the LC pretilt in situ with a second exposure (and likely even more exposures) provides another advantage.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further Embodiments</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In various aspects, one or more electrodes configured to apply a voltage to the LC molecules are included in an apparatus as described herein.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is expected that the advantages provided by in situ exposure technique could be expanded to any number of electro-optic devices including, but not limited to refractive waveguides, optical modulators, optical switches, and optical displays.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As an alternative to BY, the photoalignment material could be another organic material able to induce the contactless alignment of LC materials following exposure to light.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The photoalignment material may be deposited in any manner that produces a thin film.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The liquid crystal material may be any nematic or higher-order phase material providing optical modulation.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Advantages</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The photoalignment method on substrate surfaces disclosed here offers several improvements: contact-free processing, highly uniform LC alignment with control of the azimuthal and polar alignment of the LC at a user-defined orientation, strong surface anchoring conditions (resulting in faster LC switching speeds), and the ability to easily control the planar orientation and pretilt angle. Combined, these lead to significant improvements in device performance and throughput efficiency</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The use of a single material, BY, as a photoalignment layer represents a significant advantage over prior art techniques that require multiple materials.
