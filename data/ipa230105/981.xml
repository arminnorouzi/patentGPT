However, in the case that primary cancer metastasizes to other organs, surgery is not possible, so anticancer drug therapy is widely used. An anti-cancer agent used for the drug therapy is mainly used by synthesizing a single molecular substance by an organic or inorganic method. This type of traditional drug therapy is accompanied by many side effects, one of which is that the substance used as a drug is an artificially synthesized ex vivo substance and that the action point of an anticancer substance targets already overexpressed proteins.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">&#x2018;Cancer&#x2019; refers to a group of diseases characterized by excessive cell proliferation and invasion into surrounding tissues in the case that the normal balance of apoptosis is disrupted. Among them, breast cancer in particular accounts for 25.2% incidence rate of female cancers worldwide, and the incidence rate of breast cancer between 2008 and 2012 continued to rise and increased by about 20%. In Korea, the incidence rate is 52.1%, which is one of the highest rates of breast cancer among OECD countries. It is widely known that treatment methods for breast cancer differ depending on the expression of receptors that respond to hormones. In order to treat such breast cancer, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and hormone therapy are used in parallel depending on the progression.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Until now, many natural and protein or peptide anti-cancer agent and chemical synthetic anti-cancer agent have been developed and used, but most of them not only show serious side effects that affect normal cells in vivo, but also usually do not have the same therapeutic effect depending on the type of cancer or depending on the patient even for the same type of cancer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In particular, as a method for treating cancer, radiation therapy is an essential treatment method for various cancers, but acquisition of radiation resistance of cancer cells and damage to normal tissues during high-dose radiation therapy are continuously pointed out as problems that reduce the efficiency of radiation therapy. Accordingly, there is an increasing need for substances capable of increasing the effect of radiation therapy in the method for treating cancer cells.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, as a new concept anticancer drug that solves the above problems worldwide, there is a need for a lot of research to develop an anticancer drug that can selectively remove only cancer cells without affecting normal cells in vivo, and further increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical

This classification method has been reported by Jerry R. Williams et al. in their papers (Acta Oncologica, 46, 628-638, 2007). As used herein, the term &#x201c;radiosensitivity&#x201d; means a cell having a characteristic that the slope value is in the range of 0.00 to 0.30, and &#x201c;radioresistance&#x201d; refers to a cell having a characteristic included in the range of 0.31 to 1.00.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0089">The cancers of the present invention may be selected from the group consisting of brain tumor, benign astrocytoma, malignant astrocytoma, pituitary adenoma, meningioma, brain lymphoma, oligodendroglioma, intracranial tumor, ependymoma, brain stem tumor, head and neck tumor, laryngeal cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, nasal/sinus cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, salivary gland cancer, hypopharyngeal cancer, thyroid cancer, chest tumor, small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, thymus cancer, mediastinum tumor, esophageal cancer, breast cancer, male breast cancer, abdominal tumor, stomach cancer, liver cancer, gallbladder cancer, biliary tract cancer, pancreatic cancer, small intestine cancer, colorectal cancer, anal cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, male genital tumor, penile cancer, urethral cancer, prostate cancer, female genital tumor, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine sarcoma, vaginal cancer, external genital cancer, female urethra cancer, skin cancer, myeloma, leukemia, and malignant lymphoma, but may preferably be prostate cancer including breast cancer, lung cancer or stomach cancer, and most preferably, breast cancer, but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0090">The radiosensitizer pharmaceutical composition for treating cancer with radiotherapy according to the present invention may be used in combination with radiation therapy.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0091">The radiation therapy used in the present invention is a local treatment method that damages the DNA of malignant cells. Normal cells have a greater capacity to repair this damage than tumor cells, and the radiation therapy is known to take advantage of this difference.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0092">The radiation therapy may include external beam radiation (x-rays, y-rays, protons and neutrons), brachytherapy, and radioactive material implantation, and may be administered by 2-D, 3-D, confocal, intensity-modulated (IMRT) and image-guided (IGRT) approaches. The standard radiation therapy that can be used in the cancer treatment of the present invention may be a method of providing a total dose of about 60 Gys (50-70 Gys) at 2.5 Gy/day. However, those skilled in the art may select the desired radiation dose based on the particular subject, device, and tumor type.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0093">The radiosensitizer pharmaceutical composition for treating cancer with radiotherapy according to the present invention constitutes an improvement over the existing radiation therapy by increasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation. For example, the use of the radiosensitizer pharmaceutical composition for treating cancer with radiotherapy of the present invention causes cancer cells to have sensitivity of at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% or more to radiation. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;sensitivity&#x201d; and &#x201c;radiosensitivity&#x201d; refer to the number of viable cells based on radiation dose. Accordingly, an increase in radiosensitivity may mean a decrease in the number of cells surviving at a certain radiation dose, a decrease in the radiation dose required for a lethal dose, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0094">Since the radiosensitizer pharmaceutical composition for treating cancer with radiotherapy of the present invention can increase the sensitivity not only for radiotherapy of cancer cells but also for chemotherapy, the radiosensitizer of the present invention can be used as a sensitizer for increasing sensitivity in chemotherapy. The use case may also fall within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0095">As used herein, the term &#x201c;administered in combination&#x201d; means administering radiation irradiation together in an anticancer process for treating various types of cancer cells. Specifically, it may be one in which radiation therapy is concurrently treated in an anticancer process for treating cancer cells such as solid cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck cancer, and brain cancer.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">MODES FOR CARRYING OUT INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0086" num="0096">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail through examples.
