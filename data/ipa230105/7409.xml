However the frequencies around 900 MHz are not allocated for worldwide coverage. In addition frequencies above 900 MHz are absorbed by human tissue such that a body shadow effect must be accounted for when computing the link budget for ear to ear and ear to body worn electronics. Magnetic links below 30 MHz work well for ear to ear communication and ear to body worn devices since these frequencies are not absorbed significantly by human tissue. Magnetic links also have the advantage of world-wide regulatory acceptance. Frequencies from 100 MHz to 400 MHz have been shown to propagate on the skin of the body and exhibit a loss that is less than that of free space when worn on or near the human body. In addition, legacy narrow band analog FM assisted listening devices exist that have a frequency allocation in the 164-217 MHz band throughout the world.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of a hearing assistance device <b>100</b> with a communications module <b>160</b> including a multi-mode radio <b>150</b> according to one embodiment of the present subject matter.

In various applications the wireless communications are between a hearing assistance device and any other wireless device. In various applications, the hearing assistance device communicates with a second device that is a wireless audio controller. Some examples of wireless audio controllers are found in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2006/0274747, titled: COMMUNICATION SYSTEM FOR WIRELESS AUDIO DEVICES, and PCT Application Publication WO 2006/133158, titled: COMMUNICATION SYSTEM FOR WIRELESS AUDIO DEVICES, which are both hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In various applications, the second wireless device can be any wireless device, and the examples provided herein are intended to demonstrate the present subject matter, but not to limit it to the examples provided herein.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The present subject matter provides various communications, including, but not limited to, one or more of: ear-to-ear communications; ear-to-remote device communications; wireless programming, configuration and data logging; streaming audio; bi-directional audio, and/or remote control. It is understood that these communications can be unidirectional, bidirectional, or combinations of both. Such communications can also include far field communications (e.g., radio frequency communications), or combinations of near field (e.g., inductive link using substantially the magnetic field) and far field communications. Several modes of modulation and demodulation are possible and the examples given herein are demonstrative and not intended to be exclusive or limiting.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In various embodiments the wireless communications can include standard or nonstandard communications. Some examples of standard wireless communications include link protocols including, but not limited to, Bluetooth&#x2122;, IEEE 802.11 (wireless LANs), 802.15 (WPANs), 802.16 (WiMAX), cellular protocols including, but not limited to CDMA and GSM, ZigBee, and ultra-wideband (UWB) technologies. Such protocols support radio frequency communications and some support infrared communications. Although the present system is demonstrated as a radio system, it is possible that other forms of wireless communications can be used such as ultrasonic, optical, and others. It is understood that the standards which can be used include past and present standards. It is also contemplated that future versions of these standards and new future standards may be employed without departing from the scope of the present subject matter.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The wireless communications support a connection from other devices.

In various embodiments, uch connections include all past and present link protocols. It is also contemplated that future versions of these protocols and new future standards may be employed without departing from the scope of the present subject matter.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In various embodiments a protocol is used, such as the protocol described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2006/0274747, entitled: COMMUNICATION SYSTEM FOR WIRELESS DEVICES, and PCT Application Publication WO 2006/133158, titled: COMMUNICATION SYSTEM FOR WIRELESS AUDIO DEVICES, which are both hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

For example, in various countries operation can be performed by multiple bands such as 902-928 MHz in the US and 863-865 MHz in Europe. The present subject matter also allows for legacy narrow band analog FM receivers used for assistive listening to be successfully received by the same radio in certain embodiments. When one band of frequencies has interference, then another band of frequencies may be free of interference. Thus, a multiband radio provides communication redundancy in the face of interference.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In various embodiments the present approach provides a radio transceiver that has dual, triple, or other modes and bands of operation. For example, a 900 MHz transceiver can be built to operate at 200 MHz as well. In various embodiments, the radio has a mode that supports communication using a carrier that is less than about 30 MHz for ear-to-ear or ear-to-body worn device communication. In various embodiments, a system that has an RF front end capable of 900 MHz operation is built as a single or dual conversion radio having an internal frequency (IF) that is less than about 30 MHz and that can be adapted to transmit and receive a signal directly at frequencies below 30 MHz, thus bypassing the RF front end of the transceiver. In various embodiments the transceiver uses similar modulation schemes at both frequencies so that the demodulator and modulator sections of the transceiver can be used for both frequencies of operation. Alternatively, the transceiver may use a different modulation (multi-mode) scheme at each of the frequencies that best satisfies the link budget and power budget for that band of frequencies. In various embodiments the transceiver incorporates a narrowband analog FM demodulator as part of the receiver for receiving analog FM signals from assisted listening devices in the 169-217 MHz RF spectrum.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The present subject matter provides, among other things, in various embodiments a multi-band transceiver capable of sending and receiving digital or analog information over an RF link using multiple carrier frequencies for use in a hearing aid. The IF frequency of the transceiver can be used to directly receive and transmit information at a different frequency by bypassing the RF front end. In other variations an alternate front end tuned to operate at multiple frequency bands is used. Such a system can use an IF frequency consistent with analog FM assisted listening devices in the 200 MHz region and has an RF front end capable of operating at higher frequencies such as 900 MHz or 2.4 GHz. Variations of the present subject matter include in various embodiments a radio system that uses an IF frequency consistent with magnetic induction (frequencies less than 30 MHz) by bypassing or retuning the front end receiver and transmitter.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present subject matter provides, among other things, in various embodiments a multi-mode transceiver capable of sending and receiving digital or analog information over an RF link using multi-modes of operation each mode being adapted for use at a different frequency band of operation.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">It is understood that variations in communications protocols, antenna configurations, and combinations of components may be employed without departing from the scope of the present subject matter.
