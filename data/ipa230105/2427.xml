id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0001">The present invention relates to an iridium complex compound, and more particularly, to an iridium complex compound useful as a material of an emission layer of an organic electroluminescent (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as &#x201c;organic EL&#x201d;) element, an iridium-complex-compound-containing composition containing the compound and a solvent, an organic electroluminescent element containing the compound and a method for producing the same, and an organic EL display device and an organic EL illuminator having the organic electroluminescent element.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0002">Various electronic devices using an organic EL element, such as an organic EL illumination and an organic EL display (display device), are being put to practical use. Organic electroluminescent elements are low in applied voltage and in power consumption, and are capable of emitting light of three primary colors, and therefore have started to be applied not only to large-sized display monitors but also to medium-sized displays represented by mobile phones and smartphones.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0003">The organic electroluminescent element is manufactured by superposing a plurality of layers such as an emission layer, a charge injection layer, and a charge transport layer. Currently, most of organic electroluminescent elements are manufactured by depositing an organic material under vacuum, but the vacuum deposition method has a complicated deposition process and is inferior in productivity. In an organic electroluminescent element manufactured by a vacuum deposition method, it is extremely difficult to increase the size of a panel of an illumination or a display. Therefore, in recent years, as a process for efficiently manufacturing an organic electroluminescent element that can be used for a large-sized display or illumination, a wet-process film formation method, which is a coating method, has been actively studied. The wet-process film formation method has an advantage of being able to easily form a stable layer as compared with the vacuum deposition method, and thus is expected to be applied to mass production of displays and illuminators and large devices.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0004">In order to manufacture an organic electroluminescent element by a wet-process film formation method, all materials to be used must be dissolved in an organic solvent to be used as an ink. When a material to be used is poor in solvent solubility, the material may be deteriorated before use because an operation such as heating for a long time is required. Furthermore, when a uniform state cannot be maintained for a long period of time in a solution state, precipitation of a material from the solution occurs, and film formation by an inkjet device or the like becomes impossible. In other words, materials used in the wet-process film formation method must be soluble in two ways: the materials must dissolve quickly in organic solvents, and the materials must maintain a uniform state without precipitation after dissolution.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0005">In the organic EL display, high luminescent efficiency is required to be realized in addition to a long driving life and a wide color gamut, that is, a high color reproduction rate. In particular, a considerably deep red color having an x coordinate of 0.68 to 0.71 in XYZ color system coordinates of CIE (International Commission on Illumination) is required for a red region. In order to develop deep red color, it is necessary to set the maximum emission wavelength of a luminescent material to a longer wavelength, for example, a wavelength of 615 nm or more. Since human visibility also decreases greatly as the wavelength becomes longer in the red region, a larger emission intensity is required in the deep red region.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0006">As a multilayer structure for an organic EL display, there are two types that differ in a direction of light extraction. A bottom emission type in which the manufacturing process is relatively simple is a type in which light of organic molecules is extracted from below a thin film transistor (TFT) substrate side, but has a drawback that the light use efficiency of the organic molecules is low. On the other hand, in a top emission type, since light is extracted from above a sealing glass having no pixel circuit or the like, it is possible to efficiently extract emitted light to the outside. However, in the case where the top emission type is used, light having a wavelength other than a specific wavelength is reflected, cancelled, and quenched in the multilayer structure, so that the light does not go out of the laminated structure. Therefore, when a half width of the luminescence spectrum of the luminescent material is large, light having a wavelength other than the specific wavelength does not go out of the multilayer structure, and as a result, the luminescent efficiency decreases. Therefore, it is preferable to narrow the half width of the luminescence spectrum as much as possible in order to widen the color gamut and increase the luminance of the display, which is a target of extremely important technology development.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">As described above, a red luminescent material is required to have the following properties: 1. high solubility in solvents, 2. high luminescent efficiency, and 3. narrow half width of the luminescent spectrum. With regard to the above 1., there has been known techniques in which a relatively long-chain alkyl group is introduced without making the structure excessively rigid such as increasing the number of condensed rings in a ligand. With regard to the above 2., since a so-called &#x201c;energy gap law&#x201d; is dominant in the red region, a ratio of dissipation to heat increases as the wavelength becomes longer, and thus there is an upper limit in a quantum yield at a specific wavelength. On the other hand, in recent years, techniques such as using a phosphorescent material which is originally high in efficiency, eliminating a substituent which impairs the quantum yield of these materials, increasing the symmetry of the structure, increasing the metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) property and increasing the phosphorescence emission rate have become clear.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">As a red luminescent material, an iridium complex compound utilizing phosphorescence emission has been used. In particular, there has been known an iridium complex compound having a ligand in which a triazine-type substituent is introduced into phenyl-pyridine as disclosed in Patent Literatures 1 to 3. Patent Literature 1 discloses an iridium complex compound having a specific structure. Similarly, Patent Literatures 2 and 3 also disclose an iridium complex compound having a specific structure.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0009">Patent Literature 1: WO2015/105014</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0010">Patent Literature 2: US Patent Application Publication No. 2016/359122 specification</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0011">Patent Literature 3: WO2016/015815</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">On the other hand, it cannot be said that the knowledge on the problem of narrowing the half width of the luminescence spectrum of above 3. is still sufficient.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, Patent Literature 1 discloses an iridium complex compound having a structure in which two aromatic rings are bonded to triazine, but there is room for improvement in the half width.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A so-called heteroleptic iridium complex disclosed in Patent Literature 2, in which the ligand is asymmetric, also has a problem that the half width is widened.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Patent Literature 3 discloses an iridium complex compound emitting red light having a relatively narrow half width, but it is considered that improvement is still required.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">An object of the present invention is to provide an iridium complex compound in which a half width is as narrow as possible, and at the same time, high solubility in a solvent and high luminescent efficiency are not impaired.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An iridium complex compound that solves the above problems is, for example, as follows.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">[1] An iridium complex compound represented by the following formula (1).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="70.10mm" wi="60.37mm" file="US20230002428A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">[In formula (1), Ir represents an iridium atom, R<sup>5 </sup>to R<sup>14</sup>, R<sup>21</sup>, and R<sup>22 </sup>each independently represent a hydrogen atom, D, F, Cl, Br, I, or a substituent, the groups adjacent to each other may be further bonded to each other to form a ring, and any one of R<sup>12 </sup>and R<sup>13 </sup>is a substituent represented by the following formula (2).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="20.74mm" wi="51.56mm" file="US20230002428A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0023" num="0020">[In formula (2), a broken line represents a bond to formula (1).

The reason for this is presumed as follows.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0094">Patent Literature 1 discloses an iridium complex having a structure in which a triazine ring is bonded to a fluorene-pyridine ligand and two aromatic rings are bonded to the triazine ring. It is considered that since two aromatic rings are bonded to triazine, a rotational motion between these rings and LUMO also expand to an aromatic ring site, and thus the half width tends to increase. Meanwhile, for the iridium complex compound according to formula (1), it is limited to R<sup>32 </sup>when the aromatic ring is bonded to the triazine, which is thought to have allowed the narrowing of the half width.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0095">The LUMO is located on the triazine ring, but the LUMO spreads on the aromatic ring as well when the aromatic ring is bonded so that a &#x3c0;-electron system is conjugated, so that the rotational motion of the bond between the triazine ring and the aromatic ring has a considerable influence on a shape of the spectrum and widens the half width. This effect is remarkable when the triazine ring is substituted with two aromatic rings. Meanwhile, when the triazine ring is substituted with one or more alkyl groups or (hetero)aralkyl groups, in which the &#x3c0;-electron conjugated system does not spread, an effect of effectively blocking an interaction with a solvent molecule in the case of an external environment, that is, in a solution state, or with a host molecule in the case of an emission layer of an organic EL element is also produced, and thus the half width can be further narrowed.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0096">A ligand structure of the complex in the present embodiment is obtained by substituting a specific site of the pyridine ring with the triazine ring represented by formula (2) with respect to a main framework of fluorene-pyridine. It is considered that the LUMO is localized on the triazine ring, and a decrease in MLCT property due to a decrease in involvement of an iridium atom is compensated by the fact that the fluorene-pyridine has a linear structure and an overlap between HOMO and the LUMO on a ligand is considerably large, so that the quantum yield does not decrease.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0097">When the involvement of iridium atoms is reduced, the contribution of ligand centered (LC) luminescence increases, so that the spectrum is not widened, and a main peak having a relatively narrow half width is strongly observed although the spectrum is accompanied by a vibrating structure. (See: Photochemistry of Metal Complexes in Society of Complex Chemistry Library 2 edited by Yoichi Sasaki and Osamu Ishitani, pp. 83-98, published by Sankyo Shuppan Co., Ltd., 2007)</p><p id="p-0110" num="0098">It is not easy to synthesize a so-called heteroleptic iridium complex in which ligands are asymmetric as disclosed in Patent Literature 2. Since the ligands are asymmetric, the heteroleptic iridium complex has more vibration modes than those of a homoleptic iridium complex having high symmetry, and further, the distributions of the HOMO and the LUMO are spread between the ligands different from each other, or a sub-ligand interferes with a main ligand involved in luminescence, and as a result, the half width is widened.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0099">Meanwhile, in the iridium complex compound represented by formula (1) according to the present embodiment, the half width can be narrowed by forming a homoleptic complex (L<sub>3</sub>Ir) in which all three ligands are the same for trivalent iridium.
