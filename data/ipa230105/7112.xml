The flexible display unit <b>151</b> may be a display unit capable of maintaining a flat state like a conventional flat panel display and capable of warping, bending, folding, twisting, or rolling like paper. The flexible display unit <b>151</b> refers to a display which is manufactured on a thin and flexible substrate and is thus lightweight and robust as not to be easily broken.

Since the size of the flexible display unit <b>151</b> is determined and the flexible display unit <b>151</b> is formed of one continuous body, an area of rear face of the display unit <b>151</b> decreases as an area of the front face of the display unit <b>151</b> increases.
