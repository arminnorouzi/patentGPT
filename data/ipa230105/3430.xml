Ice makers within icemaker appliances are plumbed to a water supply, and water from the water supply may flow to the ice maker within the icemaker appliances. Icemaker appliances are frequently cooled by a sealed system, and heat transfer between liquid water in the ice maker and refrigerant of the sealed system generates ice.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In certain icemaker appliances, for instance, clear ice makers, water may be continually sprayed onto a chilled mold to form ice without dissolved solids which result in cloudy ice. Commonly, the icemaker appliances are plumbed to an external drain (e.g., connected to a municipal water system) to dispose of the excess water that is not frozen during an icemaking process (e.g., excess water containing dissolved solids). While effective for managing the excess water, external drain lines have drawbacks. For example, external drain lines can be expensive to install. In addition, external drain lines can be difficult to install in certain locations. Additionally, cleaning such icemaker appliances can be burdensome and time consuming.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further, certain icemakers utilize potable municipal water in an icemaking process. This municipal water contains certain levels of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). During some icemaking processes, only the water containing sufficiently low levels of TDS will freeze into clear ice cubes. The leftover water then contains a higher concentration of TDS, which is too high to form clear ice. Thus, leftover water remains within the icemaker, requiring removal by the user in order to continue the icemaking process.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, an icemaker appliance with features for operating without an external drain line would be useful. In particular, an icemaker appliance that uses leftover water from a clear ice cycle would be useful.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one exemplary aspect of the present disclosure, an icemaker appliance is provided.

As discussed in greater detail below, icemaker appliance <b>100</b> includes features for generating or producing clear ice. Thus, a user of icemaker appliance <b>100</b> may consume clear ice stored within icemaker appliance <b>100</b>. As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, icemaker appliance <b>100</b> defines a vertical direction V.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Icemaker appliance <b>100</b> includes a cabinet <b>110</b>. Cabinet <b>110</b> may be insulated in order to limit heat transfer between an interior volume <b>111</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of cabinet <b>110</b> and ambient atmosphere. Cabinet <b>110</b> extends between a top portion <b>112</b> and a bottom portion <b>114</b>, e.g., along the vertical direction V. Thus, top and bottom portions <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> of cabinet <b>110</b> are spaced apart from each other, e.g., along the vertical direction V. A door <b>119</b> is mounted to cabinet <b>110</b> at a front portion of cabinet <b>110</b>. Door <b>119</b> permits selective access to interior volume <b>111</b> of cabinet <b>110</b>. For example, door <b>119</b> is shown in a closed position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and door <b>119</b> is shown in an open position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. A user may rotate door between the open and closed positions to access interior volume <b>111</b> of cabinet <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, various components of icemaker appliance <b>100</b> are positioned within interior volume <b>111</b> of cabinet <b>110</b>. In particular, icemaker appliance <b>100</b> includes an ice maker <b>120</b> disposed within interior volume <b>111</b> of cabinet <b>110</b>, e.g., at top portion <b>112</b> of cabinet <b>110</b>. Ice maker <b>120</b> is configured for producing clear ice. Ice maker <b>120</b> may be configured for making any suitable type of clear ice. Thus, e.g., ice maker <b>120</b> may be a clear cube ice maker, as would be understood.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Icemaker appliance <b>100</b> may also include an ice storage compartment or storage bin <b>102</b>. Ice storage compartment <b>102</b> may be provided within interior volume <b>111</b> of cabinet <b>110</b>. In particular, ice storage compartment <b>102</b> may be positioned, e.g., directly, below ice maker <b>120</b> along the vertical direction V. Thus, ice storage compartment <b>102</b> is positioned for receiving clear ice from ice maker <b>120</b> and is configured for storing the clear ice therein. It will be understood that ice storage compartment <b>102</b> may be maintained at a temperature greater than the freezing point of water. Thus, the clear ice within ice storage compartment <b>102</b> may melt over time while stored within ice storage compartment <b>102</b>. Icemaker appliance <b>100</b> may include features for recirculating liquid meltwater from ice storage compartment <b>102</b> to ice maker <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, ice storage compartment <b>102</b> may include a first ice storage compartment <b>1021</b> and a second ice storage compartment <b>1022</b>. For instance, a compartment divider <b>162</b> may be provided within ice storage compartment <b>102</b>. Compartment divider <b>162</b> may demarcate ice storage compartment <b>102</b> into first ice storage compartment <b>1021</b> and second ice storage compartment <b>1022</b>. In detail, compartment divider <b>162</b> may be a planar wall removably inserted within interior volume <b>111</b> of ice storage compartment <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> for example, compartment divider <b>162</b> may extend along the transverse direction T from a front of ice storage compartment <b>102</b> to a rear of ice storage compartment <b>102</b>. However, an orientation of compartment divider <b>162</b> may vary according to specific embodiments. As will be described in more detail below, first ice storage compartment <b>1021</b> may store a first ice (e.g., a first style of ice) and second ice storage compartment <b>1022</b> may store a second ice (e.g., a second style of ice).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> provides a schematic view of certain components of icemaker appliance <b>100</b>. As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, ice maker <b>120</b> may include an ice mold <b>124</b> and a nozzle <b>126</b>. For instance, ice mold <b>124</b> may include a plurality of ice molds for forming a plurality of ice cubes at one time. Liquid from nozzle <b>126</b> may be dispensed toward ice mold <b>124</b>. For example, nozzle <b>126</b> may be provided below ice mold <b>124</b> within a first reservoir <b>128</b> and may dispense liquid water upward toward ice mold <b>124</b>. As discussed in greater detail below, ice mold <b>124</b> is cooled by refrigerant. Thus, the liquid water from nozzle <b>126</b> flowing across ice mold <b>124</b> may freeze on ice mold <b>124</b>, e.g., in order to form clear ice cubes on ice mold <b>124</b>. Further, as described below, ice mold <b>124</b> may include a plurality of first ice molds <b>1241</b> and a plurality of second ice molds <b>1242</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">To cool ice mold <b>124</b>, icemaker assembly <b>100</b> includes a sealed system <b>170</b>. Sealed system <b>170</b> includes components for executing a known vapor compression cycle for cooling ice maker <b>120</b> and/or air. The components include a compressor <b>172</b>, a condenser <b>174</b>, an expansion device (not shown), and an evaporator <b>176</b> connected in series and charged with a refrigerant. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, sealed system <b>170</b> may include additional components, e.g., at least one additional evaporator, compressor, expansion device, and/or condenser. Additionally or alternatively, the placement of the components (e.g., compressor <b>172</b>, condenser <b>174</b>, etc.) may be adjusted according to specific embodiments. Thus, sealed system <b>170</b> is provided by way of example only. It is within the scope of the present subject matter for other configurations of a sealed system to be used as well.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Within sealed system <b>170</b>, refrigerant flows into compressor <b>172</b>, which operates to increase the pressure of the refrigerant. This compression of the refrigerant raises its temperature, which is lowered by passing the refrigerant through condenser <b>174</b>. Within condenser <b>174</b>, heat exchange with ambient air takes place so as to cool the refrigerant. A fan <b>178</b> may operate to pull air across condenser <b>174</b> so as to provide forced convection for a more rapid and efficient heat exchange between the refrigerant within condenser <b>174</b> and the ambient air.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The expansion device (e.g., a valve, capillary tube, or other restriction device) receives refrigerant from condenser <b>174</b>. From the expansion device, the refrigerant enters evaporator <b>176</b>. Upon exiting the expansion device and entering evaporator <b>176</b>, the refrigerant drops in pressure. Due to the pressure drop and/or phase change of the refrigerant, evaporator <b>176</b> is cool, e.g., relative to ambient air and/or liquid water. Evaporator <b>176</b> is positioned at and in thermal contact with ice maker <b>120</b>, e.g., at ice mold <b>124</b> of ice maker <b>120</b>. Thus, ice maker <b>120</b> may be directly cooled with refrigerant at evaporator <b>176</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">It should be understood that ice maker <b>120</b> may be an air-cooled ice maker in alternative example embodiments. Thus, e.g., cooled air from evaporator <b>176</b> may refrigerate various components of icemaker appliance <b>100</b>, such as ice mold <b>124</b> of ice maker <b>120</b>. In such example embodiments, evaporator <b>176</b> is a type of heat exchanger which transfers heat from air passing over evaporator <b>176</b> to refrigerant flowing through evaporator <b>176</b>, and fan may circulate chilled air from the evaporator <b>176</b> to ice maker <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, icemaker appliance <b>100</b> may further include a cleanout line <b>162</b>. Cleanout line <b>162</b> may include an additional reservoir (e.g., a third reservoir) which may collect meltwater from ice storage compartment <b>102</b>. In one example, cleanout line <b>162</b> is connected directly to ice storage compartment <b>102</b>. Accordingly, liquid within ice storage compartment <b>102</b> may flow out of ice storage compartment <b>102</b> through cleanout line <b>162</b>. A second end of cleanout line <b>162</b> may be exposed outside of icemaker appliance <b>100</b>. Liquid flowing through cleanout line <b>162</b> may be released from icemaking appliance <b>100</b> via the second end. In other embodiments, liquid flowing through cleanout line <b>162</b> may be resupplied to first reservoir <b>128</b>. In still other embodiments, cleanout line <b>162</b> may be omitted entirely, such that icemaker appliance <b>100</b> is drainless.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Icemaker appliance <b>100</b> may also include a controller <b>190</b> that regulates or operates various components of icemaker appliance <b>100</b>. Controller <b>190</b> may include a memory and one or more microprocessors, CPUs or the like, such as general or special purpose microprocessors operable to execute programming instructions or micro-control code associated with operation of icemaker appliance <b>100</b>. The memory may represent random access memory such as DRAM, or read only memory such as ROM or FLASH. In one embodiment, the processor executes programming instructions stored in memory. The memory may be a separate component from the processor or may be included onboard within the processor. Alternatively, controller <b>190</b> may be constructed without using a microprocessor, e.g., using a combination of discrete analog and/or digital logic circuitry (such as switches, amplifiers, integrators, comparators, flip-flops, AND gates, and the like) to perform control functionality instead of relying upon software. Input/output (&#x201c;I/O&#x201d;) signals may be routed between controller <b>190</b> and various operational components of icemaker appliance <b>100</b>. As an example, the various operational components of icemaker appliance <b>100</b> may be in communication with controller <b>190</b> via one or more signal lines or shared communication busses.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Icemaker appliance <b>100</b> may include first reservoir <b>128</b>. First reservoir <b>128</b> may be provided within ice storage compartment <b>102</b>. For example, first reservoir <b>128</b> may be located at or near top portion <b>112</b> of interior volume <b>111</b> of ice storage compartment <b>102</b>. First reservoir <b>128</b> may define a receiving space that holds liquid (e.g., water) to be formed into ice. For example, an inner volume of first reservoir <b>128</b> may be smaller than interior volume <b>111</b> of ice storage compartment <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, first reservoir <b>128</b> may hold other liquids, such as cleaning solutions, for example.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Ice maker <b>120</b> may be provided within first reservoir <b>128</b>. In detail, evaporator <b>176</b> and ice mold <b>124</b> may be located within first reservoir <b>128</b>. In some embodiments, ice maker <b>120</b> is provided above first reservoir <b>128</b> (e.g., along the vertical direction V). First reservoir <b>128</b> may extend along the vertical direction V from a bottom end <b>202</b> to a top end <b>204</b>. Ice maker <b>120</b> may be mounted at the top end <b>204</b> of the first reservoir <b>128</b>.

Second reservoir <b>138</b> may be provided within ice storage compartment <b>102</b>. For example, second reservoir <b>138</b> may be immediately adjacent to first reservoir <b>128</b>. Second reservoir <b>138</b> may define a receiving space that holds water to be formed into ice. For example, an inner volume of second reservoir <b>138</b> may be smaller than interior volume <b>111</b> of ice storage compartment <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, second reservoir <b>138</b> may hold other liquids, such as cleaning solutions, for example. Second reservoir <b>138</b> may be in fluid communication with first reservoir <b>128</b>. For instance, liquid contained within first reservoir <b>128</b> may be selectively diverted to second reservoir <b>138</b>. Second reservoir <b>138</b> may be lower than first reservoir <b>128</b> (e.g., along the vertical direction V).

Conduit <b>154</b> may be any suitable length, and the disclosure is not limited in size or material used. Additionally or alternatively, a valve <b>156</b> may be provided on conduit <b>154</b>. For instance, valve <b>156</b> may allow conduit <b>154</b> to be selectively opened and closed. Valve <b>156</b> may receive input signals from controller <b>190</b> to selectively open and close to allow liquid from first reservoir <b>128</b> to pass through conduit <b>154</b> into second reservoir <b>138</b>.

Icemaker appliance <b>100</b> may then perform a first icemaking cycle or operation, forming clear ice. The leftover water remaining within first reservoir <b>128</b> may contain levels of total dissolved solids (TDS) above a level permitted for forming clear ice.

The first concentration of TDS may be between about 100 parts per million (ppm) and about 200 ppm, for example. As discussed above, throughout the icemaking cycle by first circulation system <b>139</b>, the concentration of TDS may increase within first reservoir <b>128</b>. Accordingly, liquid level sensor <b>134</b> may additionally or alternatively detect or sense a level of TDS of the liquid within first reservoir <b>128</b>, e.g., at predetermined time intervals. Upon detecting the TDS level to be above a predetermined concentration level via sensor <b>134</b>, controller <b>190</b> may instruct valve <b>156</b> to open to allow the liquid within first reservoir <b>128</b> to transfer to second reservoir <b>138</b>. For instance, the predetermined TDS level may be between about 280 ppm and about 350 ppm. In one example, the predetermined TDS level is about 300 ppm.
