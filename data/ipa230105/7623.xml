id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A radio apparatus communicating with a first and a second network, and having a first connection to the first network, may receive a page from the second network and determine to form a second connection with the second network, and notify the first network of the selection. The first network may then notify the apparatus to release or suspend the first connection. The apparatus may send release and/or suspension preferences to the first network, such as a preference to be treated in an idle or inactive mode, paging preferences, and a preferred identifier of the apparatus. The apparatus may then form the second connection, and monitor for paging from the first network, e.g., during a given paging occasion and paging frame.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure

A variety of techniques may be used. For example, a device may be configured to communicate with a first network and then receive a trigger to establish an RRC connection with a second network. The UE may then transmit an RRC message to the first network to release or suspend the RRC connection with the first network. The UE may then receive an RRCRelease message to release or suspend the RRC connection with the first network and do so, then establish an RRC connection with a second network.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0038">The request to release or suspend sent from the UE may correspond to transmission of a UE assistance information message related to release preference information, wherein, for example, a preferred RRC state is set to &#x201c;idle&#x201d; or &#x201c;inactive&#x201d;. The UE assistance information message may also include an indication of a paging preference.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0039">The UE may also send Release Assistance Information (RAI) to the first network, and also receive a &#x201c;negotiated&#x201d; configuration from the first network, whereby releasing or suspending the RRC connection with the first network further comprises applying the negotiated configuration. The RAI may be sent separately or with other UE assistance information such as paging preference information and/or preferred RRC state, for example.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0040">The negotiated configuration may include a suspension configuration including an inactivity time value, and applying the configuration may include starting a timer accordingly. At the expiry of the timer, the UE may release a suspended RRC connection with the first network.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0041">Similarly, the UE may receive a trigger to release or suspend the RRC connection with the second network, stop the inactivity timer, and resume the RRC connection with the first network.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0042">The behavior and configuration of a multi-USIM UE may be adapted such that the monitoring occasions and transmission opportunities associated with the AS procedures performed by one USIM do not overlap in time with the monitoring occasions and transmission opportunities associated with the AS procedures performed by another USIM. For example, a device may be configured to detect an event triggering PO skipping activation with a network and transmit an RRC message to activate PO skipping with the network. The device may then receive an RRC Release message including a suspension configuration from the network, and suspend the RRC connection with the network and activate PO skipping with the network. The device may then detect an event triggering PO skipping deactivation with the network and deactivating PO skipping with the network.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0043">The device may be adapted such that the event triggering PO skipping activation corresponds to a number of events, such as: determination that collisions will occur based on the UE configuration for the multiple USIMs; detection of one or more paging collisions; commencement of an AS procedure for another USIM; a transition to RRC_CONNECTED state for another USIM; a transition to RRC_INACTIVE state for another USIM; a transition to RRC_IDLE state for another USIM; or a configuration of DC for another USIM.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0044">The request from the device to activate PO skipping may include a resume cause set to &#x201c;po-SkippingActivation,&#x201d; for example.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0045">The event triggering PO skipping deactivation may be completion of an AS procedure for another USIM, a transition from RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE for another USIM, or a release of DC for another USIM, for example.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0046">A suspension instruction may trigger the starting of a timer corresponding to the time interval during which PO skipping is activated, wherein the starting value of the timer is signaled via the suspension configuration. The event triggering PO skipping deactivation may be expiration of the timer.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0047">Paging monitoring may be performed using an extended PO. For example, a device may be configured to receive a paging configuration in an RRC message that includes an indication of a plurality of PDCCH monitoring occasions for paging, and selecting a PDCCH monitoring occasion for paging that does not experience a collision. The device may then monitor for paging during the selected PDCCH monitoring occasion for paging, and receive a page during the monitored PDCCH monitoring occasion for paging.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0048">The device may be further adapted to send multi-USIM assistance information to the network, and to receive a paging configuration via RRC messaging that includes a paging configuration. For example, the device may receive an RRC message configures an extended PO with, for example, an additionalMonitoringOccasionOfPO parameter with a value greater <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0049">Devices may be configured to send requests to the network to stop paging of a UE. For example, a first apparatus may be configured to communicate with a second apparatus in a first network, and to receive a page from a third apparatus in a second network. The first apparatus may determine to continue communication with the second apparatus in the first network, and transmit an RRC message to the third apparatus in the second network with an indication to suspend paging for the first apparatus. The first apparatus may then receive an RRC message from the third apparatus in the second network acknowledging the indication to suspend paging, and continue communication with the second apparatus in the first network.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0050">The first apparatus may further determine to continue communication with the second device in the first network based on a &#x201c;paging cause&#x201d; received in a page.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0051">These operations may occur while the first apparatus is in RRC_INACTIVE mode, where the third apparatus of sends a NAS message to a fourth apparatus in the second network that includes an indication to suspend paging for the first apparatus. By way of example, the first apparatus may be a UE, the second apparatus and the third apparatus may be gNBs, and the fourth apparatus may be an AMF.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0052">The first apparatus may be further adapted to resume paging with second network and transmit an RRC message to the third apparatus that includes an indication to resume paging for the first apparatus. The first apparatus may then receive an RRC message from the third apparatus in the second network acknowledging the indication to resume paging, and monitor for paging from a third apparatus in the second network.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0053">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

describes many of the abbreviations used herein.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Multi-USIM Overview</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0095">A Multi-USIM UE is a UE with two or more SIMs. Dual-SIM: UE with two SIMs. The term Multi-USIM and Dual-SIM are used interchangeably in this document.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0096">Multi-USIM devices have been more and more popular in different countries. The user may have both a personal and a business subscription in one device or has two personal subscriptions in one device for different services (e.g. use one individual subscription and one &#x201c;family circle&#x201d; plan). However, support for multi-USIM within a device is currently handled in an implementation-specific manner without any support from 3GPP specifications, resulting in a variety of implementations and UE behaviors (e.g. Passive Dual SIM, Dual SIM Single Standby, Dual SIM Dual Standby, Dual SIM Dual Active, etc.). Such situation may cause increased complexity for UE vendors, unexpected UE behavior for network vendors or operators, and degraded user experience.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0097">Current UE implementations typically support dual SIM configurations where the UE time multiplexes operations between each installed USIMs, which is referred to as TDM-ing or time division multiplexing. Dual SIM Dual Standby (DSDS) UEs, as they are called, operate in this manner and allocate time for each USIM to communicate with their respective Mobile Network Operators, or MNOs. The USIMs may belong to the same or different MNOs. These multi-USIM UEs share common radio and baseband components with some common software to enable the UE to switch operations between the two USIMs. One main issue with having shared Rx and Tx components is the UE is not able to monitor for DL traffic or send UL traffic for both USIMs at the same time.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0098">Some dual SIM UEs have dual Rx components (one for each USIM) and a shared, single Tx component where the dual SIM UE TDM UL transmissions. By having dual RX components, these UEs are able to continuously monitor DL traffic but the UEs still must TDM UL traffic due to the shared Tx component. These UEs are not as common as the single Rx, single Tx UEs due to the added cost of an additional Rx component.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0099">There is yet another class of multi-USIM UEs in which dedicated transceivers are available for each installed USIMs. These UEs are called Dual SIM Dual Active (DSDA) UEs but they are not too common due to the increased cost of having dual Rx and dual Tx components in the UEs. The DSDA UEs operate as two UEs but contain some common software to provide operational configurability to the user.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">NR Paging (Release 15)</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Discontinuous Reception for Paging</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0100">The UE may use Discontinuous Reception (DRX) in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE state in order to reduce power consumption. The UE monitors one paging occasion (PO) per DRX cycle. A PO is a set of PDCCH monitoring occasions and can consist of multiple time slots (e.g. subframe or OFDM symbol) where paging DCI can be sent. See 3GPP TS 38.213, Physical layer procedures for control (Release 15), V15.7.0. One Paging Frame (PF) is one Radio Frame and may contain one or multiple PO(s) or starting point of a PO.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0101">In multi-beam operations, the UE assumes that the same paging message and the same Short Message are repeated in all transmitted beams and thus the selection of the beam(s) for the reception of the paging message and Short Message is up to UE implementation. The paging message is same for both RAN initiated paging and CN initiated paging.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0102">The UE initiates RRC Connection Resume procedure upon receiving RAN initiated paging. If the UE receives a CN initiated paging in RRC_INACTIVE state, the UE moves to RRC_IDLE and informs NAS.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0103">The PF and PO for paging are determined by the following formulae:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0104">SFN for the PF is determined by:</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0091" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(<i>SFN+PF</i>_offset)mod <i>T</i>=(<i>T </i>div <i>N</i>)*(<i>UE</i>_<i>ID </i>mod <i>N</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?><ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0105">Index (i_s), indicating the index of the PO is determined by:</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0092" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>i</i>_<i>s</i>=floor(<i>UE</i>_<i>ID/N</i>)mod <i>Ns </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0093" num="0106">The PDCCH monitoring occasions for paging are determined according to pagingSearchSpace as specified in 3GPP TS 38.213 Release 15, and firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO if configured as specified in 3GPP TS 38.331 Release 15, Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol specification (Release 15), V15.7.0.

However, when AS procedures for multiple USIMs need to be performed simultaneously, &#x201c;collisions&#x201d; may occur, which can result in the AS procedures being delayed, being performed sub-optimally or even failing. Herein, we consider the impacts such &#x201c;collisions&#x201d; will have on AS procedures performed by a UE in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE mode and propose solutions to resolve them.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0172">For example, to maintain a connection with the NW, a UE in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE is required to perform the SI Acquisition and Paging procedures. When performing these procedures, the UE monitors the downlink at specific times to receive the SI or Paging DCI. In multi-beam operation, a set of PDCCH monitoring occasions is used for SI acquisition and paging reception. A collision may occur for one or more of the PDCCH monitoring occasions in the set of PDCCH monitoring occasions; e.g., a partial or full collision. When a collision occurs, the UE will be unable to receive the downlink during one or more of the PDCCH monitoring occasions in this set, which may result in the UE being unable to acquire the SI or receive the Paging DCI.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0173">In the case of SI acquisition, collisions can increase the latency associated with obtaining the SI. A UE that is unable to perform the SI Acquisition procedure quickly and reliably may be unable to establish/resume an RRC connection when it is triggered due to having invalid SI. Delaying the RRC Connection/Resume procedure until valid SI is acquired may be unacceptable depending on the event that triggered the procedure. Another impact that can result is selection of a suboptimal cell when performing the Cell (Re-)Selection procedure. If a UE is unable to acquire the MIB or SIB1 for a candidate cell when performing the Cell Reselection Evaluation process, the UE may erroneously consider the cell as &#x201c;barred&#x201d; for up to 300 seconds. This can result in selection of weaker cell, which may require the UE to continue to perform the Cell Reselection Evaluation process; or selection of a cell where the UE can only obtain limited service; e.g., originate emergency calls and receive ETWS and CMAS notifications.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0174">In the case of paging, collisions can cause the UE to miss Mobile Terminated (MT) calls. This can result in the NW erroneously assuming a failure has occurred, which can lead to the NW taking corrective actions unnecessarily and a distortion of the call statistics maintained by the NW. For example, the NW may attempt to page the UE in a wider area, thereby increasing the signaling load. And if subsequent paging attempts also fail, the state machines maintained by the NW may transition to a different state, thereby resulting in state machine mismatches between the UE and NW. In addition, since PWS notifications and SI change indications are signaled in the Short Message, which is transmitted via the Paging DCI, a UE that is unable to monitor for paging may miss important ETWS or CMAS messages in the case of missing a PWS notification; or may be unaware of an SI change in the case of missing an SI change indication.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0175">Collisions may be isolated or systemic in nature. For example, for the scenario where two USIMs are in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE mode, collisions with the PDCCH monitoring occasions for SI acquisition can be considered isolated, since the events triggering an SI acquisition procedure are aperiodic and will not persist for an extended period of time; e.g. upon cell (re-)selection, upon receiving a PWS notification or SI change indication, etc. Scenarios where such collisions may occur include when attempting to simultaneously perform SI Acquisition procedures for multiple USIMs, when attempting to perform an SI Acquisition procedure for one USIM and Idle Mode measurements for another USIM, or when attempting to simultaneously perform an ST Acquisition for one USIM and a Paging procedure for another USIM.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0176">On the other hand, systemic collisions may persist indefinitely. If we again consider the scenario where two USIMs are in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE mode, such collisions may occur when the paging configurations for each USIM are such that the PDCCH monitoring occasions for paging collide. Since a PO is by definition periodic, the collisions will occur repeatedly, which can lead to failure of the Paging procedure for one or both USIMs. Systemic collisions may also occur for the scenario where one USIM is in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE mode and the other USIM is in RRC_CONNECTED mode. If the traffic pattern for the USIM in RRC_CONNECTED mode results in a high utilization of the shared components, collisions will likely occur when any AS procedure is initiated for the other USIM, regardless of the periodicity or duration of the AS procedure. This can lead to a disruption in the call established for the USIM in RRC_CONNECTED mode and/or failure of the AS procedures for the USIM in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE mode.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0177">Support for multi-USIM UEs is currently handled in an implementation-specific manner without support from the 3GPP specifications. This leads to a variety of UE behaviors when handling collisions that can be unreliable and power inefficient. With the increased complexity of 5G-capable UEs and the growing demand for multi-USIM UEs in the market, leaving multi-USIM support to implementation is no longer practical. Therefore, to ensure multi-USIM UEs can operate reliably and efficiently in 5G networks, there is a need to standardize the UE behavior associated with TDM sharing of common baseband and radio components; and to define new NW behavior/actions in support of the new UE behavior. For UEs in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE mode, this will require enhancements to the SI and Paging procedures that will allow a UE to avoid collisions when possible; and to resolve them in a predictable and reliable manner if and when they do occur.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="2">Collision Avoidance Solutions</heading><p id="p-0147" num="0178">A UE may determine that collisions are likely to occur based on the UE configuration for the multiple USIMs; e.g. Paging configuration, SMTC configuration, SI-SchedulingInfo configuration, C-DRX configuration, etc.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0179">Collisions may then be avoided by reconfiguring the UE such that the monitoring occasions and transmission opportunities associated with the AS procedures performed by one USIM do not overlap in time with the monitoring occasions and transmission opportunities associated with the AS procedures performed by another USIM.

When using this alternative, UE signaling to facilitate enabling/disabling of paging repetition is required.

For example, start and stop SFNs for PO monitoring may be defined such that if the PF falls within this range, the PO is monitored; and if the PF falls outside this range, the PO is skipped.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0291">SFN-based PO skipping may be used to avoid paging collisions between multiple USIMs by defining non-overlapping PO monitoring regions for each USIM. The UE would determine the region where the POs should be skipped/monitored such that paging collisions would not occur, and signal this info to the network. Alternatively, the UE may provide paging configuration info to the network and the network may determine regions where the POs should be skipped/monitored. In the general case, SFN synchronization cannot be assumed between networks, therefore the SFN offset should be considered when determining the appropriate start/stop SFNs for a given network.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0292">For example, we can consider the scenario where a multi-USIM UE has two USIMs, the SFN space is partitioned in two and the SFN offset between NW<sub>1 </sub>and NW<sub>2 </sub>is 117, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. If we use the SFN numbering for NW<sub>1 </sub>as the reference, the start and stop SFNs for PO monitoring for NW<sub>1 </sub>may be defined as <b>0</b> and <b>511</b> respectively; and the start and stop SFNs for PO monitoring for NW<sub>2 </sub>may be defined as <b>512</b> and <b>1023</b> respectively.

The UE would also signal SFN start/stop values to NW<sub>2 </sub>to indicate the SFN range when PO monitoring would be performed. However, rather than signaling the values <b>512</b> and <b>1023</b> directly, the UE would add the SFN offset and perform a modulo 1024 operation on the result to translate the start/stop SFNs to the SFN numbering for NW<sub>2</sub>, which in this case would result in signaling the values (512&#xf7;117) mod 1024=629 and (1023+117) mod 1024=116 to NW<sub>2 </sub>to indicate the SFN range when PO monitoring would be performed.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0293">In another embodiment of the solution, the SFN space may be partitioned such that there are multiple regions where the PO is monitored for a given USIM. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is an illustration of a scenario where a multi-USIM UE has two USIMs and the SFN offset between NW<sub>1 </sub>and NW<sub>2 </sub>is 117, and there are 2 PO monitoring regions defined for each USIM.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0294">In the above examples, SFN-based PO skipping is used to avoid paging collisions between multiple USIMs. However, SFN-based PO skipping may also be used to avoid collisions for other AS procedures that may be performed for another USIM. For example, while POs are being skipped for a first USIM, SI acquisition, idle mode measurements, etc. may be performed for another USIM without the risk of colliding with the monitored POs for the first USIM.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0295">The SFN-based PO skipping may be triggered by a UE making a request to either the gNB or the CN that includes an SFN PO Skipping indication and also the number of SFN regions to divide the POs. This mechanism can be used for NW<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, which provides the SFN reference timing.

Instead of focusing on PO skipping, the concept may be envisioned as SFN-based PO region selection. The CN or RAN node may define PO regions within SFNs and assign different regions to each of the USIMs in a UE. This mechanism allows a UE to request different SFN PO regions for each of the USIMs installed to avoid paging collisions. If the USIMs belong to the same MNO, then a single SFN timing reference may be used. However, if the USIMs belong to different MNOs, then the SFN offset needs to be applied by the UE.</p><heading id="h-0027" level="2">H-SFN-Based PO Skipping</heading><p id="p-0268" num="0297">H-SFN-based PO skipping may be used to define hyper frames where POs are skipped. An H-SFN is broadcast by the cell and increments by one when the SFN wraps around. In addition to calculating the PO and PF, a UE may calculate a Paging Hyperframe (PH), that refers to the H-SFN in which the UE monitors for paging. The PH may be determined based on a formula that is known by the UE and network as a function of the DRX cycle, which may correspond to an extended DRX cycle that is greater than 1024, and the UE identity.

If a collision occurs for the selected PDCCH monitoring, the UE may select a PDCCH monitoring occasions for the same beam in another sweep. For example, we can consider the extended PO shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>.

Since the POs are periodic, requesting a change to a DRX cycle on its own may not avoid all paging collisions. But changing the DRX cycle may allow some of the POs to occur without a collision. Requesting a longer DRX cycle may also be used to provide the UE with more options for selecting a different PF to monitor; e.g., choosing a value for the offset parameter used in the equation above.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0321">Using the methods described herein, the UE may request modification to one or more of the paging configuration parameters. Which parameter(s) the UE is requesting to modify may be indicated to the network using explicit signaling; e.g. RRC signaling. The value of a parameter in the current paging configuration may be assumed for parameters that aren't explicitly included in the paging modification request. The paging modification request may be signaled in a separate message; e.g. PagingModificationRequest.

The RAI may include preferred values for one or more paging configuration parameters; e.g. a preferred PagingCycle, a preferred UE_ID to use in the PO/PF calculations, an index i_s corresponding to the preferred PO to monitor in the PF, an offset to be used in the calculation of the PF.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0346">The reception of preference information may be treated by the network as a command, in which case the network applies the values of the preferred parameters when it receives the RRC connection release/suspend indication.

The UE may therefore ignore those parameters which are not applicable; e.g.full-RATI, shortl-RNTI, ran-PagingCycle, ran-NotficationAreaInfo, t380 and nextHopChainingCount. Alternatively, a &#x201c;negotiated&#x201d; ReleaseConfig that only includes parameters applicable for a UE transitioning to RRC_IDLE may be defined. Code Example 5 shows an example &#x201c;negotiated&#x201d; ReleaseConfig.</p><p id="p-0321" num="0349">In some scenarios, the UE may be unable to perform AS procedures such as paging monitoring, RAN-based Notification Area Update (RNAU), etc. after transitioning to RRC_INACTIVE due to activity on the other USIM. This can result in the network erroneously assuming a failure has occurred, which can lead to the network taking corrective actions unnecessarily and a distortion of the call statistics maintained by the network. To prevent this from happening, we propose that the RRC_INACTIVE configuration is released if the UE does not resume the connection within a configured time duration. In one example, this time duration corresponds to the value of the timer t380. If the UE is does not resume the connection before t380 expires, the UE releases the RRC_INACTIVE configuration and transitions to RRC_IDLE. The UE state machine maintained by the network also transitions to RRC_IDLE. In another example, a separate timer, inactivityTimer, may be defined for this purpose and signaled to the UE as part of the &#x201c;negotiated&#x201d; SuspendConfig.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0350"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> is an illustration of a scenario where a multi-USIM UE in RRC_CONNECTED mode for NW<b>1</b>, receives a trigger to establish an RRC connection with NW<b>2</b>, that requires the UE to autonomously release/suspend the RRC connection with NW<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0351">In step 1 of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>, the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with NW<b>1</b> and is performing UL/DL transmission and reception.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0352">In step 2, the UE signals RAI to NW<b>1</b> to indicate its preference for one or more parameters to be applied when it performs an autonomous RRC release/suspend.

For example, the RRC message transmitted in step 1 of this procedure may optionally include a value for this timer. If the timer value is not included, the network assumes paging filtering is enabled until the UE sends an RRC message to disable the paging filtering. When the timer is configured, the UE may send an RRC message to disable the paging filtering before the timer expires.</p><p id="p-0365" num="0404">In step 10, the gNB may send an N2/NAS message to disable the paging filtering if it was previously enabled.</p><heading id="h-0039" level="2">Collision Resolution Solutions</heading><p id="p-0366" num="0405">In this section, we define a class of solutions that may be used for collision resolution. The solutions are applicable for scenarios where the UE determines that a collision has occurred (or is about to occur). A UE may determine when a collision has occurred or is about to occur based on the UE configuration for the multiple USIM e.g. Paging configuration, SMTC configuration, SI-SchedulingInfo configuration, C-DRX configuration, etc., and/or feedback from lower layers that access the common radio and baseband components. The proposed solutions include descriptions of the behavior the UE take to resolve the collision; e.g., determine which AS procedure to execute, as well as descriptions of the subsequent UE actions that may be taken to gracefully recover from the collision. The collision resolution solutions described in this section may be used on their own or in combination with the collision avoidance solutions described herein.</p><heading id="h-0040" level="2">Rule-Based Collision Resolution</heading><p id="p-0367" num="0406">For scenarios where a collision has occurred or is about to occur, a rule-based collision resolution method may be used. When a collision occurs, the UE uses a set of rules to determine which AS procedure to perform. The rules may be defined per the standards, user preference and/or network configuration.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0407">For example, a priority may be assigned to the different AS procedure types. When a collision occurs, the UE performs the AS procedure with the higher priority. Table 6 of the Appendix&#x2014;Prioritization Based on AS Procedure, is an example that shows how the AS procedures for a UE in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE could be prioritized. In this example, the measurements and reading of the MIB/SIB1 that is performed as part of the Cell (Re-)Selection and PLMN Selection procedures is determined based on the priority of the corresponding procedure.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0408">Alternatively, priority could be based on the action that the UE is performing regardless of the procedure for which it is being performed. For the example shown in Table 7 of the Appendix&#x2014;Prioritization Based on UE Action, reading of the MIB/SIB1 that is part of the Cell (Re-)Selection procedure is given the same priority as when performing SI acquisition for the serving cell; and all measurements are performed with the same priority, regardless of the procedure for which they are being performed.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0409">Priority may also be based on the USIM for which the procedure was triggered. A USIM's priority may be determined based on user preference; e.g. assigned by the user via a UE application, or based on the physical slot the USIM is inserted into. USIM based priority may be used on its own or in combination with the other prioritization solutions described herein.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0410">For example, an iterative approach may be performed where procedure-based prioritization is first to be performed. And in the event procedures with the same priority are being performed for multiple USIMs simultaneously, USIM-based prioritization may be used to break the tie as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref></p><p id="p-0372" num="0411">Prioritization may be based on the RRC state of the USIM for which the AS procedure was executed. For example, an AS procedure performed for a USIM in RRC_CONNECTED state may be given priority over AS procedures performed for a USIM in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE state. Different priorities may also be assigned for the RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE states, thereby allowing AS procedures performed for a USIM in RRC_INACTIVE mode to be prioritized over a AS procedure performed for a USIM in RRC_IDLE mode, or vice versa.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0412">And in yet another aspect of the solution, AS procedures requiring a transition to RRC_CONNECTED mode; e.g. RRC Connection Establishment/Resume, may be given priority over the Idle Mode procedures; e.g. Paging, SI Acquisition, PLMN Selection, Cell (Re-) Selection. If the other USIM is already in RRC_CONNECTED mode, the priority of service for which an RRC connection is being established or resumed may be considered when determining which USIM/AS procedure to give priority to. For example, an RRC Connection Establishment procedure with an EstablishmentCause equal to &#x201c;emergency&#x201d; or &#x201c;highPriorityAccess&#x201d; may be prioritized over an AS procedure for a USIM in RRC_CONNECTED.</p><p id="p-0374" num="0413">The RAT for which the AS procedure is being performed may also be considered. For example, an NR procedure may be given priority over LTE, WCDMA, GSM, etc. as shown in Table 8 of the Appendix&#x2014;Prioritization Based on RAT.</p><p id="p-0375" num="0414">Following a collision, the UE may take actions to recover from the collision. For example, if an SI acquisition procedure is not performed due to a collision, the UE may perform the RACH-Based SI Acquisition procedure described herein. For scenarios where a PO is missed due to a collision, the UE may perform the Short Message Acquisition procedure described herein to ensure the UE does not miss PWS notification and/or ST change indications. An On-Demand Paging procedure may also be performed to ensure the UE does not miss a MT call and/or data.</p><heading id="h-0041" level="2">RACH-Based SI Acquisition</heading><p id="p-0376" num="0415">If a UE is unable to monitor the DL during an SI window due to a collision, a RACH-Based SI Acquisition procedure may be used where the requested SIB(s) are provided in the RACH response; e.g. Msg4, Msg2 or MsgB. The UE may trigger the RACH-Based SI Acquisition Procedure when the AS procedure of the other USIM completes. The UE configuration for the multiple USIMs; e.g. Paging configuration, SMTC configuration, SI-SchedulingInfo configuration, C-DRX configuration, etc., may be used to determine when the RACH-Based SI Acquisition should be performed to avoid colliding with the monitoring occasions and transmission opportunities associated with the AS procedures performed for another USIM.</p><p id="p-0377" num="0416">In one example, the 4-step RACH procedure is used, where Msg3 includes an indication of the requested SIB(s). The indication may be included in an RRC message that is transmitted as part of Msg3. The Msg4 response provided by the network then includes the requested the requested SIB(s).</p><p id="p-0378" num="0417">In another example, the 4-step RACH procedure is used, however only steps 1 and 2 are used. A mapping between SIB(s) and preambles and/or RACH occasions allows Msg1 to be used to provide an implicit indication of the requested SIB(s), which are provided by the network in the Msg2 response. Alternatively, the mapping may be between SI Messages and preambles and/or RACH occasions. In which case the Msg2 response includes the SIB(s) configured for the requested SI Message(s).</p><p id="p-0379" num="0418">And in yet another example, the 2-step RACH procedure is used, where MsgA includes an indication of the requested SIB(s), which are provided by the network in the MsgB response.</p><heading id="h-0042" level="2">Short Message Acquisition</heading><p id="p-0380" num="0419">The Short Message is used to provide a UE with an indication about SI modifications that will occur in the next modification period. A UE may miss this indication if it is unable to monitor the Paging DCI during its PO due to a collision. Depending on the UE and network configuration, a modification period may be comprised of multiple DRX cycles, where the UE monitors one PO per DRX cycle as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0381" num="0420">From the network perspective, additional POs may be configured and monitored by other UEs. If the UE is unable to monitor the Paging DCI during its configured PO due to a collision, it may monitor a PO configured for another UE to receive the Short Message.</p><p id="p-0382" num="0421">Repetitions of an SI change indication may occur within a preceding modification period. If the network is configured such that an SI change indication is repeated in all POs during the preceding modification period, the UE will be able to receive the SI change indication provided it can monitor at least one of its configured POs during the modification period to receive the Short Message.</p><p id="p-0383" num="0422">To prevent the UE from monitoring additional POs unnecessarily, the UE may only monitor an additional PO if it is unable to monitor all of its POs that occur during a modification cycle. In this scenario, the UE may choose to monitor any PO that occurs after its last configured PO in the modification period. If the UE is unable to monitor any of the POs during a modification period to receive the Short Message, then the UE shall acquire SIB1 to obtain the valueTags for the SIBs being broadcast in the Serving Cell to ensure the SI it has is still valid; e.g., the valueTag for the SIBs broadcast by the Serving Cell and the valueTags for the SIBs being used by the UE match. If the valueTag for a given SIB does not match, then the UE shall acquire the modified SIB from the network.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0423">If the network is configured such that an SI change indication may not be repeated in all POs during the preceding modification period, then if the UE misses any PO during the modification period it may miss an SI change indication. In this scenario, the UE may choose to monitor any PO that occurs after a missed PO. And if the UE is unable to monitor any PO that occurs during a DRX cycle, the UE shall acquire SIB1 to obtain the valueTags for the SIBs being broadcast in the Serving Cell to ensure the SI it has is still valid, and subsequently acquire any modified SIB from the network.</p><p id="p-0385" num="0424">The Short Message is also used to provide a UE with PWS notifications. ETWS or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE are required to monitor for indications about PWS notification in its own paging occasion every DRX cycle. If a PO is missed due to a collision, the UE may monitor for a PWS notification in any PO that occurs after a missed PO in its DRX cycle.</p><heading id="h-0043" level="2">On-Demand Paging</heading><p id="p-0386" num="0425">To ensure a UE does not miss a MT call and/or data, the UE may perform an on-demand paging procedure, where the UE (re-)establishes an AS connection with the network for a USIM when a configured number of POs are missed due to a paging collision. The network may configure on-demand paging for a UE based on an indication that the UE is configured with multiple USIMs or an explicit request from the UE. The number of missed POs that is used to control when an on-demand paging procedure is performed may be cell-specific and broadcast as part of the SI or UE-specific and signaled using dedicated signaling.</p><p id="p-0387" num="0426">When (re-)establishing an AS connection for on-demand paging, a new EstablishmentCause/ResumeCause e.g. onDemandPaging could be used indicate this to the network. Upon (re-)establishing the connection, the network would commence with UL/DL transmission if there is MT data pending for the UE. If not, the network may release or suspend the RRC connection.</p><heading id="h-0044" level="2">User Interface</heading><p id="p-0388" num="0427">A user interface is proposed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, which can be used by a user to configure the UE for MUSIM operation. For example, the user interface may be used to enable/disable a given USIM. In one example, a check box is used to indicate the enabled/disabled status of a given USIM. The user interface may also be used to assign a priority to a USIM, wherein the assigned priority may be used to determine when to ignore a page for a given network or to perform rule-based collision resolution as described herein. In one example, a text box may be used to assign the priority for a given USIM. The priority may be assigned as a numerical value, e.g. 1, 2, 3, as an enumerated value; e.g. High, Medium, Low, etc.</p><p id="p-0389" num="0428">The user interface may also be used to provide the user with a notification when an MT or a MO call needs to be resumed/established for a given USIM; and the user can provide a response to accept or reject the request to resume/establish the call. The notification may also include meta-data related to the MT/MO call; e.g. to inform the user of the associated service, the paging cause, etc. For example, if a UE communicating with network <b>1</b> via USIM<b>1</b> receives a page for network <b>2</b> via USIM<b>2</b>, a notification informing the user of the call on USIM<b>2</b> may be provided to the user as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>. The user can then accept or reject the incoming call for USIM<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0390" num="0429">In another example, if a UE is communicating with network <b>1</b> via USIM<b>1</b> and an application running on the UE needs to send/receive data to network <b>2</b> via USIM<b>2</b>, a notification informing of the user of the need to establish/resume a connection for USIM<b>2</b> may be provided to the network. A notification similar to the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> may be used to allow the user to accept/reject the call for USIM<b>2</b>.</p><heading id="h-0045" level="2">Example Environments</heading><p id="p-0391" num="0430">The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) develops technical standards for cellular telecommunications network technologies, including radio access, the core transport network, and service capabilities&#x2014;including work on codecs, security, and quality of service. Recent radio access technology (RAT) standards include WCDMA (commonly referred as 3G), LTE (commonly referred as 4G), and LTE-Advanced standards. 3GPP has begun working on the standardization of next generation cellular technology, called New Radio (NR), which is also referred to as &#x201c;5G&#x201d;. 3GPP NR standards development is expected to include the definition of next generation radio access technology (new RAT), which is expected to include the provision of new flexible radio access below 6 GHz, and the provision of new ultra-mobile broadband radio access above 6 GHz. The flexible radio access is expected to consist of a new, non-backwards compatible radio access in new spectrum below 6 GHz, and it is expected to include different operating modes that may be multiplexed together in the same spectrum to address a broad set of 3GPP NR use cases with diverging requirements. The ultra-mobile broadband is expected to include cmWave and mmWave spectrum that will provide the opportunity for ultra-mobile broadband access for, e.g., indoor applications and hotspots. In particular, the ultra-mobile broadband is expected to share a common design framework with the flexible radio access below 6 GHz, with cmWave and mmWave specific design optimizations.</p><p id="p-0392" num="0431">3GPP has identified a variety of use cases that NR is expected to support, resulting in a wide variety of user experience requirements for data rate, latency, and mobility. The use cases include the following general categories: enhanced mobile broadband (e.g., broadband access in dense areas, indoor ultra-high broadband access, broadband access in a crowd, 50+ Mbps everywhere, ultra-low cost broadband access, mobile broadband in vehicles), critical communications, massive machine type communications, network operation (e.g., network slicing, routing, migration and interworking, energy savings), and enhanced vehicle-to-everything (eV2X) communications, which may include any of Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Communication (V21), Vehicle-to-Network Communication (V2N), Vehicle-to-Pedestrian Communication (V2P), and vehicle communications with other entities. Specific service and applications in these categories include, e.g., monitoring and sensor networks, device remote controlling, bi-directional remote controlling, personal cloud computing, video streaming, wireless cloud-based office, first responder connectivity, automotive ecall, disaster alerts, real-time gaming, multi-person video calls, autonomous driving, augmented reality, tactile internet, and virtual reality to name a few.
