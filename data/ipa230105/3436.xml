Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A vacuum adiabatic body and a refrigerator are disclosed herein.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A vacuum adiabatic body is a product for suppressing heat transfer by vacuumizing an interior of a body thereof. The vacuum adiabatic body may reduce heat transfer by convection and conduction, and hence is applied to heating apparatuses and refrigerating apparatuses. In a typical adiabatic method applied to a refrigerator, although it is differently applied in refrigeration and freezing, a foam urethane adiabatic wall having a thickness of about 30 cm or more is generally provided. However, an internal volume of the refrigerator is therefore reduced.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to increase the internal volume of a refrigerator, there is an attempt to apply a vacuum adiabatic body to the refrigerator.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">First, Korean Patent No. 10-0343719 (Reference Document <b>1</b>) of the present applicant has been disclosed. According to Reference Document <b>1</b>, there is disclosed a method in which a vacuum adiabatic panel is prepared and then built in walls of a refrigerator, and an exterior of the vacuum adiabatic panel is finished with a separate molding as Styrofoam. According to the method, additional foaming is not required, and adiabatic performance of the refrigerator is improved. However, fabrication cost is increased, and a fabrication method is complicated. As another example, a technique of providing walls using a vacuum adiabatic material and additionally providing adiabatic walls using a foam filling material has been disclosed in Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2015-0012712 (Reference Document <b>2</b>). According to Reference Document <b>2</b>, fabrication cost is increased, and a fabrication method is complicated.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As further another example, there is an attempt to fabricate all walls of a refrigerator using a vacuum adiabatic body that is a single product. For example, a technique of providing an adiabatic structure of a refrigerator to be in a vacuum state has been disclosed in U.S. Patent Laid-Open Publication No. US2040226956A1 (Reference Document <b>3</b>). However, it is difficult to obtain a practical level of an adiabatic effect by providing a wall of the refrigerator with sufficient vacuum. In detail, there are limitations in that it is difficult to prevent a heat transfer phenomenon at a contact portion between an outer case and an inner case having different temperatures, it is difficult to maintain a stable vacuum state, and it is difficult to prevent deformation of a case due to a negative pressure of the vacuum state. Due to these limitations, the technology disclosed in Reference Document <b>3</b> is limited to a cryogenic refrigerator, and does not provide a level of technology applicable to general households.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present applicant had filed Korean Patent Application No. 10-2015-0109727 in consideration of the above-described limitations. In the above document, a refrigerator including a vacuum adiabatic body is proposed. Particularly, a resin material that is adequate for a material for forming a supporting unit of the vacuum adiabatic body is proposed. Even in this document, there is a limitation that a shape of the supporting unit is different from that of the design, and it is difficult to manufacture and handle the supporting unit, and yield of the product is low.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments provide a vacuum adiabatic body, in which a shape of a supporting unit is maintained in a designed shape, and a refrigerator. Embodiments also provide a vacuum adiabatic body, which is easy in manufacturing and handling, and a refrigerator. Embodiments also provide a vacuum adiabatic body, in which defective factors occurring when a supporting unit is manufactured are reduced to improve yield of a product, and a refrigerator.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to allow a shape of a supporting unit provided in a vacuum adiabatic body to be maintained in a designed shape, the supporting unit may include one side support plate and the other side support plate, which respectively support plate members, and the one side support plate may be provided by coupling at least two plates to each other so that the member has a small size. In order to easily manufacture and handle the supporting unit, a partial plate may have a rectangular shape, and a female coupling structure and a male coupling structure may be provided on the edge of the partial plate.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to improve yield of the supporting unit, at least one of the one side support plate and the other side support plate may be provided by coupling at least two members having the same shape, which are separated from each other in an extension direction of the corresponding plate member. Also, a large-sized plate member may be cut to be used.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to embodiments, there may be an advantage that the shape of the supporting unit is manufactured correctly, and a finish and reliability of the product are improved. Also, parts may be shared to reduce stock. According to embodiments, small parts manufactured and transported to be assembled so as to manufacture a large-sized part, so that manufacturing and handling of the supporting unit are simple and easy. According to embodiments, it is possible to improve production yield of the supporting unit by applying the parts even if moldability, i.e., the resin having poor melt mobility is used. Further, even in the case of defective molding, only the parts need to be discarded, so that production yield of the supporting unit may be improved.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the following drawings in which like reference numerals refer to like elements, and wherein:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a refrigerator according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a view schematically showing a vacuum adiabatic body used in a main body and a door of the refrigerator;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref> are views illustrating various embodiments of an internal configuration of a vacuum space part;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating results obtained by examining resins;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates results obtained by performing an experiment on vacuum maintenance performances of resins;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref> are results obtained by analyzing components of gases discharged from polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) and low outgassing polycarbonate (PC);</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates results obtained by measuring maximum deformation temperatures at which resins are damaged by atmospheric pressure in high-temperature exhaustion;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>C</figref> are views showing various embodiments of conductive resistance sheets and peripheral parts thereof;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a view illustrating any one side portion of a supporting unit according an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a plan view of a partial plate;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is an enlarged view of a portion A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is an enlarged view of a portion B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is an enlarged view of a portion C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a view for explaining coupling between one side support plate and the other side support plate;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is an enlarged view of a portion D of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line XVI-XVI&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a view of a supporting unit according to another embodiment;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> illustrates graphs showing changes in adiabatic performance and changes in gas conductivity with respect to vacuum pressures by applying a simulation;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a graph illustrating results obtained by observing a time and a pressure in a process of exhausting the inside of the vacuum adiabatic body when a supporting unit is used; and</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is a graph illustrating results obtained by comparing a vacuum pressure with gas conductivity.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

Also, the supporting unit <b>30</b> is to have a low outgassing rate and a low water absorption rate so as to maintain the vacuum state. Further, the supporting unit <b>30</b> is to have a low thermal conductivity so as to reduce heat conduction between the plate members. Furthermore, the supporting unit <b>30</b> is to secure the compressive strength at a high temperature so as to endure a high-temperature exhaust process. Additionally, the supporting unit <b>30</b> is to have an excellent machinability so as to be subjected to molding. Also, the supporting unit <b>30</b> is to have a low cost for molding. A time required to perform the exhaust process takes about a few days. Hence, the time is reduced, thereby considerably improving fabrication cost and productivity. Therefore, the compressive strength is to be secured at the high temperature because an exhaust speed is increased as a temperature at which the exhaust process is performed becomes higher. The inventor has performed various examinations under the above-described conditions.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">First, ceramic or glass has a low outgassing rate and a low water absorption rate, but its machinability is remarkably lowered. Hence, the ceramic and glass may not be used as the material of the supporting unit <b>30</b>.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the present inventor has examined various resins, and most of the resins cannot be used because their outgassing rates and water absorption rates are remarkably high. Accordingly, the present inventor has examined resins that approximately satisfy conditions of the outgassing rate and the water absorption rate. As a result, polyethylene resin (PE) is inappropriate to be used due to its high outgassing rate and its low compressive strength. Polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE) is not used due to its remarkably high price. Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) is inappropriate to be used due to its high outgassing rate. Accordingly, it is determined that that a resin selected from the group consisting of polycarbonate (PC), glass fiber PC, low outgassing PC, polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), and liquid crystal polymer (LCP) may be used as the material of the supporting unit. However, an outgassing rate of the PC is 0.19, which is at a low level. Hence, as the time required to perform baking in which exhaustion is performed by applying heat is increased to a certain level, the PC may be used as the material of the supporting unit.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The present inventor has found an optimal material by performing various studies on resins expected to be used inside the vacuum space part.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, there is illustrated a graph showing results obtained by fabricating the supporting unit using the respective resins and then testing vacuum maintenance performances of the resins. First, a supporting unit fabricated using a selected material was cleaned using ethanol, left at a low pressure for 48 hours, exposed to air for 2.5 hours, and then subjected to an exhaust process at 90&#xb0; C. for about 50 hours in a state that the supporting unit was put in the vacuum adiabatic body, thereby measuring a vacuum maintenance performance of the supporting unit.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It may be seen that in the case of the LCP, its initial exhaust performance is best, but its vacuum maintenance performance is bad. It may be expected that this is caused by sensitivity of the LCP to temperature. Also, it is expected through characteristics of the graph that, when a final allowable pressure is 5&#xd7;10-3 Torr, its vacuum performance will be maintained for a time of about 0.5 year. Therefore, the LCP is inappropriate as the material of the supporting unit.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">It may be seen that, in the case of the glass fiber PC (G/F PC), its exhaust speed is fast, but its vacuum maintenance performance is low. It is determined that this will be influenced by an additive. Also, it is expected through the characteristics of the graph that the glass fiber PC will maintain its vacuum performance will be maintained under the same condition for a time of about 8.2 years. Therefore, the LCP is inappropriate as the material of the supporting unit.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">It is expected that, in the case of the low outgassing PC (L/O PC), its vacuum maintenance performance is excellent, and its vacuum performance will be maintained under the same condition for a time of about 34 years, as compared with the above-described two materials. However, it may be seen that the initial exhaust performance of the low outgassing PC is low, and therefore, fabrication efficiency of the low outgassing PC is lowered.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">It may be seen that, in the case of the PPS, its vacuum maintenance performance is remarkably excellent, and its exhaust performance is also excellent.

The first and second plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> may be made of a stainless material capable of preventing corrosion and providing a sufficient strength. The stainless material has a relatively high emissivity of 0.16, and hence a large amount of radiation heat may be transferred.

In the embodiment, a configuration of the vacuum adiabatic body has been found by considering that its total heat transfer amount is smaller than that of a typical adiabatic structure formed by foaming polyurethane.

A heat transfer amount by solid conduction heat defined as a sum of the surface conduction heat and the supporter conduction heat is largest. For example, the heat transfer amount by the solid conduction heat may reach 75% of the total heat transfer amount. A heat transfer amount by the radiation transfer heat is smaller than the heat transfer amount by the solid conduction heat but larger than the heat transfer amount of the gas conduction heat.

The sum of the gas conduction heat, and the radiation transfer heat may be obtained by subtracting the surface conduction heat and the supporter conduction heat from the heat transfer amount of the entire vacuum adiabatic body. A ratio of the gas conduction heat, and the radiation transfer heat may be obtained by evaluating radiation transfer heat when no gas conduction heat exists by remarkably lowering a vacuum degree of the vacuum space part <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">When a porous material is provided inside the vacuum space part <b>50</b>, porous material conduction heat may be a sum of the supporter conduction heat and the radiation transfer heat. The porous material conduction heat may be changed depending on various variables including a kind, and an amount, for example, of the porous material.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">According to an embodiment, a temperature difference &#x394;T1 between a geometric center formed by adjacent bars <b>31</b> and a point at which each of the bars <b>31</b> is located may be provided to be less than 0.5&#xb0; C. Also, a temperature difference &#x394;T2 between the geometric center formed by the adjacent bars <b>31</b> and an edge portion of the vacuum adiabatic body may be provided to be less than 0.5&#xb0; C. In the second plate member <b>20</b>, a temperature difference between an average temperature of the second plate and a temperature at a point at which a heat transfer path passing through the conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> or <b>63</b> meets the second plate may be largest. For example, when the second space is a region hotter than the first space, the temperature at the point at which the heat transfer path passing through the conductive resistance sheet meets the second plate member becomes lowest. Similarly, when the second space is a region colder than the first space, the temperature at the point at which the heat transfer path passing through the conductive resistance sheet meets the second plate member becomes highest.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">This means that the amount of heat transferred through other points except the surface conduction heat passing through the conductive resistance sheet should be controlled, and the entire heat transfer amount satisfying the vacuum adiabatic body may be achieved only when the surface conduction heat occupies the largest heat transfer amount. To this end, a temperature variation of the conductive resistance sheet may be controlled to be larger than that of the plate member.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">Physical characteristics of the parts constituting the vacuum adiabatic body will be described. In the vacuum adiabatic body, a force by vacuum pressure is applied to all of the parts. Therefore, a material having a strength (N/m2) of a certain level may be used.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">Under such circumferences, the plate members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> and the side frame <b>70</b> may be made of a material having a sufficient strength with which they are not damaged by even vacuum pressure. For example, when the number of bars <b>31</b> is decreased so as to limit support conduction heat, deformation of the plate member occurs due to the vacuum pressure, which may negatively influence the external appearance of refrigerator. The radiation resistance sheet <b>32</b> may be made of a material that has a low emissivity and may be easily subjected to thin film processing. Also, the radiation resistance sheet <b>32</b> is to ensure a sufficient strength not to be deformed by an external impact. The supporting unit <b>30</b> is provided with a strength sufficient so as to support the force of the vacuum pressure and endure an external impact, and is to have machinability. The conductive resistance sheet <b>60</b> may be made of a material that has a thin plate shape and may endure the vacuum pressure.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">In an embodiment, the plate member, the side frame, and the conductive resistance sheet may be made of stainless materials having the same strength. The radiation resistance sheet may be made of aluminum having a weaker strength that the stainless materials. The supporting unit may be made of resin having a weaker strength than the aluminum.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">Unlike the strength from the point of view of materials, analysis from the point of view of stiffness is required. The stiffness (N/m) is a property that would not be easily deformed. Although the same material is used, its stiffness may be changed depending on its shape. The conductive resistance sheets <b>60</b> or <b>63</b> may be made of a material having a strength, but the stiffness of the material is low so as to increase heat resistance and minimize radiation heat as the conductive resistance sheet is uniformly spread without any roughness when the vacuum pressure is applied. The radiation resistance sheet <b>32</b> requires a stiffness of a certain level so as not to contact another part due to deformation. Particularly, an edge portion (edge) of the radiation resistance sheet may generate conduction heat due to drooping caused by self-load of the radiation resistance sheet. Therefore, a stiffness of a certain level is required. The supporting unit <b>30</b> requires a stiffness enough to endure a compressive stress from the plate member and an external impact.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">In an embodiment, the plate member and the side frame may have the highest stiffness so as to prevent deformation caused by the vacuum pressure. The supporting unit, particularly, the bar may have the second highest stiffness. The radiation resistance sheet may have a stiffness that is lower than that of the supporting unit but higher than that of the conductive resistance sheet. Lastly, the conductive resistance sheet may be made of a material that is easily deformed by the vacuum pressure and has the lowest stiffness. Even when the porous material <b>33</b> is filled in the vacuum space part <b>50</b>, the conductive resistance sheet may have the lowest stiffness, and the plate member and the side frame may have the highest stiffness.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">The vacuum space part <b>50</b> may resist heat transfer by only the supporting unit <b>30</b>. A porous material <b>33</b> may be filled within the supporting unit <b>30</b> inside of the vacuum space part <b>50</b> to resist heat transfer. The heat transfer to the porous material <b>33</b> may resist without applying the supporting unit <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">In the above description, as a material suitable for the supporting unit, a resin of PPS has been proposed. The bar <b>31</b> is provided on the support plate <b>35</b> at intervals of 2 cm to 3 cm, and the bar <b>31</b> has a height of 1 cm to 2 cm. These resins often have poor fluidity of the resin during molding. In many cases, the molded article does not have design value. Particularly, a shape of a molded product, such as a bar having a short length, is often not provided properly due to non-uniform injection of resin into a part far from a liquid injection port. This may cause damage to the supporting unit or a defective vacuum adiabatic body later.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">The supporting unit <b>30</b> is a substantially two-dimensional structure, but its area is considerably large. Therefore, if a defect occurs in one of the portions, it is difficult to discard the entire structure. This limitation becomes even more pronounced as refrigerators and warming apparatus are becoming larger in size to meet the needs of consumers.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">Hereinafter, a supporting unit for solving the above-described limitation will be described.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a view illustrating any one side portion of the supporting unit according an embodiment. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, one (first) side support plate <b>350</b> is provided with at least two partial plates coupled to each other. In other words, partial plates having a small rectangular shape are coupled to each other to provide one side support plate <b>350</b> having a large rectangular shape. For example, in the drawings, a second partial plate <b>352</b> and a fourth partial plate <b>354</b> are coupled to lower and right sides of a first partial plate <b>351</b>. The second partial plate <b>352</b> and the fourth partial plate <b>354</b> are coupled to left and upper sides of a third partial plate <b>353</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">In an embodiment, the partial plates may have a same shape. Thus, a size of one side support plate <b>350</b> may reach four times the size of the partial plate. When varying the number of partial plates <b>351</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>353</b> and <b>354</b>, which have the same shape and structure to be coupled to each other, the size of the one side support plate <b>350</b> may be changed. It is easily guessed that the size of the one side support plate <b>350</b> is differently provided depending on a size of the vacuum adiabatic body.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">According to this configuration, the partial plate may be manufactured using resin having a poor fluidity when the partial plate is a liquid such as PPS, and the partial plate may be coupled. As the partial plate is small in size, defects may be prevented during molding, and even if a molding failure occurs, only the corresponding partial plate is discarded, so that it is not necessary to discard the whole support plate.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">After producing the small partial plate, it is assembled at an assembly site of the vacuum adiabatic body and then put into the vacuum adiabatic body. Thus, there is an advantage that handling and transportation are convenient. In addition, it may be possible to prevent damage which may occur during handling of the large parts.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">A plurality of small partial plates may be produced, and various types of supporting units having a desired area may be obtained.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a plan view of the partial plate.

The male coupling structure (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>) may be provided with a holding part <b>358</b> which is held at the end of the one base <b>355</b>. A holding part <b>358</b> may be provided with a recess <b>359</b> at the end of the branch. The shape of the recess <b>359</b> may be provided in a shape corresponding to the insertion part <b>357</b>.

Thereafter, when the insertion part <b>357</b> is moved in the vertical direction to the recess <b>359</b>, coupling between the partial plates may be completed. The vertical direction may be a direction perpendicular to the plane of a corresponding plate member.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0097">For example, right and lower side male coupling structures of the first partial plate <b>351</b> are coupled to the male coupling structure of the fourth partial plate <b>354</b> and the male coupling structure of the second partial plate <b>352</b>. This coupling structure may be the same for other partial plates.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">The male coupling structure and the female coupling structure of the partial plates allow for use of as small a quantity of resin as possible and are intended to enable coupling while reducing size as much as possible. Movement in one direction, i.e., up and down direction, is permitted to be coupled. However, movement in the two-dimensional direction, i.e., in the area direction is not allowed, so that the coupling is performed.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099">The male coupling structure and the female coupling structure do not need to be completely fitted to each other, e.g., they are coupled to each other. This is because not only the movement in the two-dimensional direction but also the vertical movement of the respective partial plates is permitted, but the vertical movements are fixed later by a separate member. Also, this is because of characteristics of resin having poor liquid fluidity, it is necessary to make it easy to couple slight loose coupling through movement in the up and down direction through the coupling. That is, this is because a numerical value of the coupling structure for press-fitting may lead to damage to the partial plate at the time of coupling.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">This structure reduces an amount of resin as much as possible to reduce an amount of outgasing so as not to cause the limitation in vacuum maintenance of the vacuum space part and to prevent molding of the male coupling structure and the female coupling structure from being difficult even if the resin having poor formability is used.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is an enlarged view of a portion C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.

According to the present embodiment, it may be seen that the cost is reduced by more actively sharing components with respect to vacuum heat insulating bodies of various shapes and sizes.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0128">Hereinafter, vacuum pressure of the vacuum adiabatic body will be described.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> illustrates graphs showing changes in adiabatic performance and changes in gas conductivity with respect to vacuum pressures by applying a simulation. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, it may be seen that, as the vacuum pressure is decreased, i.e., as the vacuum degree is increased, a heat load in the case of only the main body (Graph 1) or in the case where the main body and the door are joined together (Graph 2) is decreased as compared with that in the case of the typical product formed by foaming polyurethane, thereby improving adiabatic performance. However, it may be seen that a degree of improvement of the adiabatic performance is gradually lowered. Also, it may be seen that, as the vacuum pressure is decreased, gas conductivity (Graph 3) is decreased. However, it may be seen that, although the vacuum pressure is decreased, a ratio at which the adiabatic performance and the gas conductivity are improved is gradually lowered. Therefore, the vacuum pressure is decreased as low as possible. However, it takes a long time to obtain excessive vacuum pressure, and much cost is consumed due to excessive use of a getter. In the embodiment, an optimal vacuum pressure is proposed from the above-described point of view.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a graph illustrating results obtained by observing a time and a pressure in a process of exhausting the inside of the vacuum adiabatic body when a supporting unit is used. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, in order to create the vacuum space part <b>50</b> to be in the vacuum state, a gas in the vacuum space part <b>50</b> is exhausted by a vacuum pump while evaporating a latent gas remaining in parts of the vacuum space part <b>50</b> through baking. However, if the vacuum pressure reaches a certain level or more, there exists a point at which the level of the vacuum pressure is not increased any more (&#x394;T1). After that, the getter is activated by disconnecting the vacuum space part <b>50</b> from the vacuum pump and applying heat to the vacuum space part <b>50</b> (&#x394;T2). If the getter is activated, the pressure in the vacuum space part <b>50</b> is decreased for a certain period of time, but then normalized to maintain a vacuum pressure of a certain level. The vacuum pressure that maintains the certain level after activation of the getter is approximately 1.8&#xd7;10-6 Torr.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0131">In the embodiment, a point at which the vacuum pressure is not substantially decreased any more even though the gas is exhausted by operating the vacuum pump is set to a lowest limit of the vacuum pressure used in the vacuum adiabatic body, thereby setting a minimum internal pressure of the vacuum space part <b>50</b> to 1.8&#xd7;10-6 Torr.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is a graph obtained by comparing a vacuum pressure with gas conductivity. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, gas conductivities with respect to vacuum pressures depending on sizes of a gap in the vacuum space part <b>50</b> are represented as graphs of effective heat transfer coefficients (eK). Effective heat transfer coefficients (eK) were measured when the gap in the vacuum space part <b>50</b> has three sizes of 2.76 mm, 6.5 mm, and 12.5 mm. The gap in the vacuum space part <b>50</b> is defined as follows. When the radiation resistance sheet <b>32</b> exists inside of the vacuum space part <b>50</b>, the gap is a distance between the radiation resistance sheet <b>32</b> and the plate member adjacent thereto. When the radiation resistance sheet <b>32</b> does not exist inside of the vacuum space part <b>50</b>, the gap is a distance between the first and second plate members.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0133">It was seen that, as the size of the gap is small at a point corresponding to a typical effective heat transfer coefficient of 0.0196 W/mK, which is provided to an adiabatic material formed by foaming polyurethane, the vacuum pressure is 2.65&#xd7;10-1 Torr even when the size of the gap is 2.76 mm. It was seen that the point at which reduction in adiabatic effect caused by gas conduction heat is saturated even though the vacuum pressure is decreased is a point at which the vacuum pressure is approximately 4.5&#xd7;10-3 Torr. The vacuum pressure of 4.5&#xd7;10-3 Torr may be defined as the point at which the reduction in adiabatic effect caused by gas conduction heat is saturated. Also, when the effective heat transfer coefficient is 0.1 W/mK, the vacuum pressure is 1.2&#xd7;10-2 Torr.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0134">When the vacuum space part <b>50</b> is not provided with the supporting unit but provided with the porous material, the size of the gap ranges from a few micrometers to a few hundreds of micrometers. In this case, the amount of radiation heat transfer is small due to the porous material even when the vacuum pressure is relatively high, i.e., when the vacuum degree is low. Therefore, an appropriate vacuum pump is used to adjust the vacuum pressure. The vacuum pressure appropriate to the corresponding vacuum pump is approximately 2.0&#xd7;10-4 Torr. Also, the vacuum pressure at the point at which the reduction in adiabatic effect caused by gas conduction heat is saturated is approximately 4.7&#xd7;10-2 Torr. Also, the pressure where the reduction in adiabatic effect caused by gas conduction heat reaches the typical effective heat transfer coefficient of 0.0196 W/mK is 730 Torr.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0135">When the supporting unit and the porous material are provided together in the vacuum space part, a vacuum pressure may be created and used, which is in the middle between the vacuum pressure when only the supporting unit is used and the vacuum pressure when only the porous material is used.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0136">In the description of embodiments, a part for performing the same action in each embodiment of the vacuum adiabatic body may be applied to another embodiment by properly changing the shape or dimension of foregoing another embodiment.
