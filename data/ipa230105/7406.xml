THD defines the combination of all orders of harmonic distortion. When an audio amplifier circuit amplifies a single frequency tone, say at a frequency of 1 kHz, the output signal will typically contain the amplified signal at 1 kHz with distortion energy at different orders, namely 2 kHz, 3 kHz, 4 kHz, 5 kHz, etc. While the harmonic distortion energy generally decreases with increasing order, many amplifiers reduce THD by using an amplifier circuit design that reduces the second order that contains the greatest amount of energy. These types of amplifiers have relatively greater odd orders of harmonic distortion than even orders.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Amplifiers with lower THD specification are typically regarded as best. Various techniques are employed to further reduce an amplifier's fundamental THD measurement thereby providing a lower THD specification for publication. Depending on the magnitude of the techniques employed to lower the THD of an amplifier, it is questionable whether a corresponding improvement in subjective quality is ever achieved. In fact, quite often the subjective quality actually degrades as a result of these techniques. THD specifications as a measure of subjective sound quality therefore are unreliable.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Vacuum tube amplifiers with their predominantly even order THD spectrum typically sound warm and smooth. Solid-state amplifiers with their predominantly odd order THD spectrum sound less so by comparison. Hybrid amplifiers comprised of both vacuum tube and solid-state technology have a mixture of both tube and solid-state orders of harmonic distortion and therefore have combined subjective sound quality of both vacuum tubes and solid-state. It is very subjective whether vacuum tube, solid-state or hybrid sound is best but the harmonic distortion spectrum of each technology is very unique and identifiable.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Harmonic distortions spectrums associated with each stage of production, post-production and reproduction of an audio media file combine to form a complex spectrum of harmonic distortion at the final output. Production of the master media file includes harmonic distortions associated with the recording equipment. Post-production includes the production harmonic distortions as well as those associated with the mixing and manufacturing of the final analogue or digital media file. Reproduction of the media file includes all of the aforementioned harmonic distortions but also those associated with the equipment utilized for playback including the transducers utilized for creating the final acoustic interface. Wired or wireless transmission technology in any of the stages also contributes unique harmonic distortions to the overall compound spectrum of harmonic distortion.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The THD formula accounts for the quantum of the overall compound spectrum of harmonic distortion but not the nuances of the structural relationship between one order of harmonic distortion and another. To properly understand the perceived quality of an audio signal, one needs to know the quantum of each order of harmonic distortion in the spectrum comprising the THD. Once this structural relationship is understood and presented along with the THD measurement, a more meaningful and reliable indication of perceived quality can be made.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The sound quality of a reproduced audio signal is a combined function of the harmonic distortion of the audio signal, the employed transmission technology, the circuit topology of the amplifier including the cumulative effect from all of the amplifiers in the chain of reproduction. Distortions formed and recorded in the original master file combine with the harmonic distortion of the transmission technology and amplifying circuits to produce a compound harmonic distortion spectrum. These compound harmonic distortions contribute to the overall distortion of the system and are responsible for the overall sonic signature and the resultant perceived quality of sound. These distortions can be measured as individual orders of harmonic distortion which are multiples of the audio signal being reproduced. Typically, the 2nd, 3rd, 4th &#x26; 5th harmonics of distortion of an audio signal contribute the most to the sonic signature of an amplifier but there are cases where higher orders of distortion above the 5th order can as well.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Different technologies exhibit different spectrums. For example, vacuum tube amplifiers are dominant in even order harmonics but also have diminished odd order harmonics. Solid-state amplifiers are dominant in odd order harmonics but also have diminished even order harmonics. Amplifiers with predominate even order harmonics are typically smoother sounding subjectively and more natural sounding as a result. Solid-state amplifiers with predominate odd order harmonics are less so. The composition of the harmonic distortion spectrum requires both even and odd harmonic orders to be present and in a structured order to achieve what is considered balanced sound.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A balanced spectrum of harmonic distortion adheres to certain principles but is also somewhat subjective and personal as it depends on the physiology of one's hearing system and the normal age-related changes that occur over time. Having the ability to shape the harmonic distortion spectrum allows subjective changes based on the physiology of the target listener but also for amplifier designs to have a perceived sonic character that is not limited strictly to the technology of the amplifier as it is today. As an example, a vacuum tube amplifier's harmonics of distortion can be made to sound like a solid-state amplifier and vice versa. The benefit of this is very compelling as the reliability and energy efficiency of a solid-state amplifier can now perform like a vacuum tube amplifier.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Applicant's embodiment called a Harmonic Balancing Amplifier (HBA) is an adaptive harmonic spectrum amplifier used to adjust the spectrum of the fundamental orders of harmonic distortion. Input impedance loadings within the circuit produce an output impedance load on the audio signal which provides various spectrums of harmonic distortion having a compound effect on the overall spectrum. A single HBA circuit can produce an adjustable harmonic spectrum and a multiple HBA circuit can provide additional complex adjustability.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">HBAs can be cascaded or paralleled using multiple circuits to further customize a best fit harmonic distortion spectrum. The output gain of a single or multiple HBA can be configured as either an audio source, preamplifier or power amplifier or in unity gain as part of an amplifier or standalone amplifier to provide preconditioning or post conditioning for a system and audio signal.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A further embodiment provides overall harmonic reduction to the audio signal which lowers all orders of harmonic distortion to allow greater flexibility in using the adjustability of single or multiple HBA circuits.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Certain embodiments can be better understood by way of the appended drawings and discussion.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the typical Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the output signal of an ordinary Class AB solid-state audio signal amplifier using the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) uniform test tone criterion of 1 kHz.
