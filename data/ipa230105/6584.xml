Brushless direct current (BLDC) motors are electronically commutated, wherein solid-state switching replaces the brushes and segmented commutators of traditional permanent magnet DC motors. In some BLDC motors, the rotor is or includes a permanent magnet. These permanent magnet BLDC motors operate by sequentially energizing the windings to attract or repel the permanent magnet rotor into rotational motion. Sensor-less BLDC motors often rely on back electromotive force (BEMF) detection to determine the angular position of the permanent magnet rotor.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In one example, a motor controller is operable to control a motor.

The rotor <b>108</b> includes a permanent magnet and is configured to rotate about an axis <b>110</b>. The stator <b>106</b> includes a plurality of conductive windings <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>(e.g., a first winding <b>112</b><i>a</i>, a second winding <b>112</b><i>b</i>, and a third winding <b>112</b><i>c </i>that are spaced apart from one another, for example, by 120 degrees).

For example, six windings can be spaced apart from one another by 60-degrees, though other configurations are also possible.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">To control the motor <b>102</b>, the motor controller <b>104</b> includes an angular velocity transmission path <b>115</b>, a current generator <b>124</b>, an angular velocity feedback path <b>148</b>, and an angular position feedback path <b>150</b>. The angular velocity transmission path <b>115</b> extends between an input <b>134</b> and a velocity-torque input <b>125</b> of the current generator <b>124</b>. The angular velocity transmission path <b>115</b> includes an angular velocity comparator <b>114</b>, a velocity controller <b>116</b>, first switching circuitry <b>118</b>, a current comparator <b>120</b>, and a torque controller <b>122</b>, which are operably coupled as shown. The angular velocity feedback path <b>148</b>, which includes an angular velocity estimator <b>132</b>, is coupled between a motor feedback terminal (e.g., current feedback terminal <b>144</b> and/or voltage feedback terminal <b>146</b>) and a first location <b>149</b> on the angular velocity transmission path <b>115</b>, which can correspond to the angular velocity comparator <b>114</b>. The angular position feedback path <b>150</b>, which includes an angular position estimator <b>130</b> and second switching circuitry <b>128</b>, extends between the motor feedback terminal (current feedback terminal <b>144</b> and/or voltage feedback terminal <b>146</b>) and an angular position input <b>127</b> of the current generator <b>124</b>. A comparator <b>126</b> is coupled to control terminals of the first and second switching circuities <b>118</b>, <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">During operation, angular velocity transmission path <b>115</b> provides a motor control signal v<sub>control </sub>(e.g., a motor voltage control signal) based on a target angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>target</sub>. Based on the motor control signal v<sub>control</sub>, the current generator <b>124</b> provides a motor drive signal i<sub>drive </sub>to a motor drive terminal <b>142</b> (in some embodiments the motor drive signal includes one signal for each winding and is provided to the motor on one or more conductors&#x2014;in some embodiments, the number of conductors is same as the number of windings) to control an angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>r </sub>of the rotor <b>108</b>. Thus, the motor controller <b>104</b> receives the target angular velocity signal &#x3c9;<sub>target </sub>on input <b>134</b>, and the current generator <b>124</b> controls the motor drive signal i<sub>drive </sub>passing through the windings <b>112</b> of the stator <b>106</b> based on the target angular velocity signal &#x3c9;<sub>target</sub>. This motor drive signal i<sub>drive </sub>passing through the windings <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>exerts an electromagnetic force on the magnet of the rotor <b>108</b> and forces the rotor <b>108</b> to rotate at an angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>r</sub>, which can correspond to the target angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>target</sub>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As the rotor rotates at angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>r</sub>, the angular velocity estimator <b>132</b> measures the motor current i<sub>motor </sub>and/or motor voltage v<sub>motor </sub>and determines an estimated angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>est </sub>based on the measured motor current and/or the measured motor voltage. The angular position estimator <b>130</b> similarly determines an estimated angular position &#x3b8;<sub>est </sub>based on the measured motor current and/or the measured motor voltage. In some embodiments, the motor current i<sub>motor </sub>and/or motor voltage v<sub>motor </sub>are measured from two or more phases of the motor <b>102</b>. In some other embodiments, the motor voltage v<sub>motor </sub>is instead reconstructed based on a DC voltage of the motor <b>102</b>. Ideally, the estimated angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>est </sub>is equal to the target angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>target</sub>, but in practical cases there may be some difference, from time-to-time, between these two values. Hence, the angular velocity feedback path <b>148</b> is coupled to the angular velocity comparator <b>114</b>, and the angular velocity comparator <b>114</b> generates an angular velocity error signal &#x3c9;<sub>error </sub>that is used to adjust the motor drive signal i<sub>drive </sub>that drives the motor <b>102</b>. Thus, if the angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>r </sub>of the rotor <b>108</b> gets slightly out of sync with the target angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>target</sub>, the angular velocity error signal &#x3c9;<sub>error </sub>&#x201c;tunes&#x201d; the motor drive signal i<sub>drive </sub>provided to the windings <b>112</b> of the motor to get the rotor <b>108</b> back in sync with the target angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>target</sub>. Similarly, the estimated angular position &#x3b8;<sub>est </sub>can be used to adjust the motor drive signal i<sub>drive </sub>through the angular position feedback path <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Despite the angular velocity feedback path <b>148</b> and the angular position feedback path <b>150</b> generally keeping the angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>r </sub>in sync with the target angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>target</sub>, in some instances the motor controller <b>104</b> may still experience challenges when controlling the motor <b>102</b> at low angular velocities and/or when reversing the angular velocity of the motor <b>102</b>. In particular, the angular position estimator circuitry <b>130</b> and the angular velocity estimator circuitry <b>132</b> may be inaccurate when operating the motor <b>102</b> at low angular velocities and/or when reversing the angular velocity of the motor <b>102</b>, and it becomes more likely that the motor <b>102</b> may lose synchronization and/or the motor may stall under these conditions.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Thus, the comparator <b>126</b> is configured to determine whether a magnitude of the target angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>target </sub>is less than a magnitude of a predetermined threshold angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>th </sub>from terminal <b>138</b>, and outputs a switching signal SW to control terminals of the first and second switching circuitry <b>118</b>, <b>128</b> to change between an open loop mode and a closed loop mode. More particularly, when the target angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>target </sub>is greater than the predetermined threshold angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>th</sub>, the first switching circuitry <b>118</b> has its output coupled to first switching position <b>118</b><i>c </i>and concurrently the second switching circuitry <b>128</b> has its output coupled to third switching position <b>128</b><i>c</i>, thereby putting the motor controller in &#x201c;closed loop&#x201d; mode. During this closed loop mode, the angular velocity transmission path <b>115</b>, current generator <b>124</b>, and angular velocity feedback path <b>148</b> make a closed angular velocity loop with the motor <b>102</b>; and concurrently the current generator <b>124</b> and angular position feedback path <b>150</b> make a closed angular position loop with the motor <b>102</b>. Thus, during this closed loop mode, the estimated angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>est </sub>and the estimated angular position &#x3b8;<sub>est </sub>are used to ongoingly &#x201c;tune&#x201d; the drive current to keep the angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>r </sub>in sync with the target angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>target</sub>. In contrast, when the target angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>target </sub>is less than or equal to the predetermined threshold angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>th</sub>, the first switching circuitry <b>118</b> has its output coupled to second switching position <b>118</b><i>o </i>and concurrently the second switching circuitry <b>128</b> has its output coupled to fourth switching position <b>128</b><i>o</i>, thereby putting the motor controller in &#x201c;open loop&#x201d; mode. In open loop mode, the angular velocity transmission path <b>115</b> and current generator <b>124</b> drive the motor <b>102</b> based on a forced target current i<sub>forced-target</sub>, and not based on the estimated angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>est </sub>(e.g., the angular velocity estimator <b>132</b> is de-coupled so the previously closed angular velocity loop is now &#x201c;open&#x201d;); and concurrently the current generator <b>124</b> drives the motor <b>102</b> based on the forced angular position &#x3b8;<sub>forced </sub>and not based on the estimated angular position &#x3b8;<sub>est </sub>(e.g., the angular position estimator <b>130</b> is de-coupled so the previously closed angular position feedback loop is now &#x201c;open&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Because the first and second switching circuitries <b>118</b>, <b>122</b> can selectively decouple the angular position estimator circuitry <b>130</b> and the angular velocity estimator circuitry <b>132</b> from the current generator <b>124</b> while the motor <b>102</b> is operating at low angular velocities and/or while reversing the velocity of the motor <b>102</b>, the open loop mode for motor controller <b>104</b> prevents the inaccuracies associated with the angular position estimator circuitry <b>130</b> and the angular velocity estimator circuitry <b>132</b> from adversely affecting the operation of the motor <b>102</b>. Further, the first switching circuitry <b>118</b> and the second switching circuitry <b>128</b> are configured to selectively couple the forced target current terminal <b>136</b> and the forced angular position terminal <b>140</b> to the current generator <b>124</b>, respectively, while the motor <b>102</b> is operating at low angular velocities and/or while reversing the velocity of the motor <b>102</b>. Hence, while operating the motor <b>102</b> at low angular velocities and/or while reversing the velocity of the motor <b>102</b>, the current generator <b>124</b> is configured to generate the motor drive signal i<sub>drive </sub>based on the forced target current i<sub>forced-target </sub>received from the forced target current terminal <b>136</b> and based on the forced angular position &#x3b8;<sub>forced </sub>received from the forced angular position terminal <b>140</b> instead of based on the estimated angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>est </sub>and the estimated angular position &#x3b8;<sub>est</sub>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">By selectively switching from exciting the motor <b>102</b> based on the estimated angular position &#x3b8;<sub>est </sub>and the estimated angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>est </sub>to exciting the motor <b>102</b> based on the forced target current i<sub>forced-target </sub>and the forced angular position &#x3b8;<sub>forced </sub>while operating the motor <b>102</b> at low angular velocities and/or while reversing the angular velocity of the motor <b>102</b>, the motor controller <b>104</b> no longer drives the motor based on the potentially inaccurate estimated angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>est </sub>and/or estimated angular position &#xb0; est at low velocities and/or during velocity reversal. As a result, the angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>r </sub>of the rotor <b>108</b> may experience less deviation from the target angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>target </sub>while the motor <b>102</b> is operating at low velocities and/or during velocity reversal. Thus, a likelihood that the motor <b>102</b> may lose synchronization may be decreased. In short, a performance and/or a reliability of the operation of the motor <b>102</b> at low velocities and/or velocity reversal may be improved.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thus, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, at larger angular velocities (e.g., angular velocities with magnitudes that are greater than a magnitude of a threshold angular velocity, &#x3c9;<sub>th</sub>) the motor is driven in closed loop mode based on the estimated angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>est </sub>and the estimated angular position &#x3b8;<sub>est </sub>(see curves <b>202</b>, <b>208</b> during <b>212</b>). Thus, at target angular velocities having a magnitude greater than a threshold angular velocity (e.g., &#x2025;&#x3c9;<sub>target</sub>|&#x3e;|&#x3c9;<sub>th</sub>|), the closed loop mode keeps the angular velocity of the rotor generally in sync with the target angular velocity, with minor feedback corrections such that the angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>r </sub>may exhibit small ripples that remain within +/&#x2212;5% of the target angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>target</sub>. At lower angular velocities (e.g., |&#x3c9;<sub>target</sub>|&#x2264;|&#x3c9;<sub>th</sub>|), if the motor were still driven in closed loop mode, non-linearities could cause the actual angular velocity of the rotor &#x3c9;<sub>r </sub>to get out of sync with the target angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>target </sub>(see curve <b>204</b>). Thus, when the magnitude of the target angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>target </sub>is less than the threshold angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>th</sub>, the motor <b>102</b> is driven in open loop mode. In open loop mode, the motor drive signal i<sub>drive </sub>is not based to be driven based on the forced target current i<sub>forced-target </sub>and the forced angular position &#x3b8;<sub>forced</sub>, which are predetermined values for various target angular velocities. For example, the forced target current i<sub>forced-target </sub>can be a predetermined fixed value based on a target torque, and the forced angular position &#x3b8;<sub>forced </sub>at a given time can be predetermined based on the target angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>target </sub>over time. In particular, in some examples the target angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>target </sub>can follow equation 1 and/or equation 2 below, and the forced angular position &#x3b8;<sub>forced </sub>at a given time can be based on an integral of the target angular velocity &#x3c9;<sub>target </sub>over time. As shown by curve <b>206</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, under the open loop operation, the actual angular velocity still accurately tracks the target angular velocity even at low velocities during <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further still, the motor controller of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also includes a current feedback path <b>152</b> coupled between the motor feedback terminal <b>144</b> and a second location <b>151</b> on the angular velocity transmission path <b>115</b>.

For example, some such motor systems may provide a forced voltage to a current generator and a forced angular position to the current generator, and the current generator may generate a motor drive signal based on the forced voltage and the forced angular position. However, a challenge with some &#x201c;open-loop voltage control&#x201d; systems is that because a power of the motor may decrease as velocity approaches and/or crosses zero, and because the voltage is forced (e.g., fixed), the current of the motor <b>102</b> is decreased (e.g., because P=IV). Thus, the torque generated by the motor is decreased. In some cases, the torque generated by the motor may be reduced to below a load torque or to zero. As a result, the motor may lose synchronization and/or the motor may stall. Thus, the performance and/or the reliability of &#x201c;open-loop voltage control&#x201d; systems may be reduced when operating at low velocities and/or during velocity reversal.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In contrast, by using the &#x201c;open-loop current control&#x201d; when operating the motor <b>102</b> at low velocities and/or during velocity reversal in accordance with examples of the present description, the current of the motor <b>102</b> (e.g., the forced target current i<sub>forced-target </sub>and/or the motor current i<sub>motor</sub>) can be independently controlled, and hence the motor controller <b>104</b> can prevent the torque generated by the motor <b>102</b> from dropping below a load torque. As a result, a likelihood that the motor <b>102</b> may lose synchronization and/or stall at low velocities and/or during velocity reversal may be reduced. Thus, motor performance and/or reliability may be improved.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In place of the angular velocity estimator circuitry <b>132</b> and/or the angular position estimator circuitry <b>130</b>, some other motor systems may use one or more sensors (e.g., magnetic field sensors) to directly measure the angular velocity and/or angular position of a rotor.
