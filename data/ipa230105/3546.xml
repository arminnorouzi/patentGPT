The accuracy of navigation and positioning are the most important factor in selecting an in-vehicle navigation device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A vehicle positioning system in the related art generally relies on global positioning system (GPS) signals or network signals. A positioning module of the vehicle positioning system can obtain positioning results merely through GPS signals or network signals. However, when the vehicle travels to a location without GPS signals or network signals such as a tunnel or an underground garage, the vehicle cannot acquire positioning data through the GPS or network, and therefore cannot implement accurate positioning, and can only estimate a positioning track based on the speed of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, the related art vehicle monitoring system has two technical deficiencies. On one hand, when a moving vehicle enters an area where a vehicle positioning signal is weak or there is no vehicle positioning signal, the moving vehicle is in a &#x201c;temporary lost&#x201d; state, and accurate positioning of the moving vehicle cannot be performed because the accurate vehicle positioning signal cannot be obtained. On the other hand, due to the relatively poor positioning accuracy of a positioning chip used by an in-vehicle navigation terminal, a vehicle monitoring center inevitably receives drifting positioning data (that is, the vehicle location data, the current position of the vehicle indicated by which is offset from the actual position of the vehicle), which eventually leads to an offset of a vehicle driving curve on a monitoring interface of a vehicle travelling track monitoring system from the actual vehicle travelling track. Consequently, a vehicle driver is misled and the navigation experience of a user is reduced.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For the foregoing problems, no effective solutions have been provided.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One or more embodiments of the disclosure provide a method and an apparatus for reconstructing a motion track, a storage medium, and an electronic device, to solve at least the technical problem of relatively low accuracy of vehicle motion track reconstruction in the related art.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an aspect of an example embodiment, a method for reconstructing a motion track is provided, including: obtaining a data set, the data set including positioning data obtained by positioning a target object; performing data fitting on target data in the data set to obtain a plurality of segments of first curves, the target data being positioning data obtained by performing noise filtering on the data set; and determining a motion track of the target object based on the plurality of segments of first curves.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an aspect of an example embodiment, an apparatus for reconstructing a motion track is provided, including: at least one memory configured to store program code; and at least one processor configured to read the program code and operate as instructed by the program code, the program code including: first obtaining code configured to cause at least one of the at least one processor to obtain a data set, the data set including positioning data obtained by positioning a target object in a moving process of the target object; fitting code configured to cause at least one of the at least one processor to perform data fitting on target data in the data set to obtain a plurality of segments of first curves, the target data being positioning data obtained by performing noise filtering on the data set; and first determining code configured to cause at least one of the at least one processor to determine a motion track of the target object based on the plurality of segments of first curves.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect of an example embodiment, a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium is provided, including a computer program stored therein, the computer program, when executed by at least one processor, causing the at least one processor to perform: obtaining a data set, the data set including positioning data obtained by positioning a target object; performing data fitting on target data in the data set to obtain a plurality of segments of first curves, the target data being positioning data obtained by performing noise filtering on the data set; and determining a motion track of the target object based on the plurality of segments of first curves.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an aspect of an example embodiment, an electronic device is provided, including at least one memory, at least one processor, and a computer program that is stored in the at least one memory and executable by the at least one processor to cause at least one of the at least one processor to perform: obtaining a data set, the data set including positioning data obtained by positioning a target object; performing data fitting on target data in the data set to obtain a plurality of segments of first curves, the target data being positioning data obtained by performing noise filtering on the data set; and determining a motion track of the target object based on the plurality of segments of first curves.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The accompanying drawings described herein are used for providing further understanding of the disclosure, and form a part of the disclosure.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the server <b>101</b>, connected to the terminal <b>103</b> through a network, may be configured to provide a service (such as a game service, an application service, a map service or an automatic drive service) for the terminal or a client installed on the terminal. A database <b>105</b> may be provided on the server or independently of the server, and used for providing a data storage service for the server <b>101</b>. The foregoing network includes, but is not limited to, a wide area network, a metropolitan area network, or a local area network, and the terminal <b>103</b> is not limited to a PC, a mobile phone, a tablet computer, or the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The method for reconstructing a motion track of an embodiment of the disclosure may be performed by the terminal <b>103</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart of an optional method for reconstructing a motion track according to an embodiment of the disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the method may include the following operations S<b>202</b>, S<b>204</b>, S<b>206</b>:</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Operation S<b>202</b>. The terminal obtains a data set, the data set including positioning data obtained by positioning a position of a target object in a moving process of the target object (e.g., by positioning a target object that is movable).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The foregoing terminal is an intelligent terminal that follows (or tracks) the target object, and the target object may be a movable object such as a vehicle, a person, an airplane, and the like. For ease of description, the following description is provided by using an example in which the target object is a vehicle and the intelligent terminal is an in-vehicle terminal.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The elements stored in the data set are the positioning data, such as positioning data of a global positioning system (GPS) and inertial guidance data that are obtained by positioning a vehicle. For example, in a process of driving a vehicle, a position of the vehicle may be positioned in a manner of timing (such as every other second), that is, positioning data of a plurality of points on a motion track of the vehicle may be acquired without the need to continuously position the vehicle. For example, the position of the vehicle may be obtained in a certain unit of time (e.g., in a certain time interval such as every other second). Accordingly, energy efficiency of a positioning device (e.g., a GPS) is improved and the hardware consumption of the in-vehicle device in the positioning process is reduced.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Operation S<b>204</b>. The terminal performs data fitting on a part of the positioning data in the data set to obtain a plurality of segments of first curves, the first curves being obtained by fitting a plurality of pieces of positioning data acquired at adjacent times, and a proportion of noise data in another part of the positioning data of the data set being higher than that of noise data in the part of the positioning data of the data set.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">When the plurality of segments of first curves are obtained by performing data fitting on a part of the positioning data in the data set, the positioning data including no noise data or relatively less noise data is used, and the data may also be referred to as target data. The target data is the positioning data obtained by merely filtering noise from the data set, which is equivalent to filtering the positioning data in the data set before track reconstruction is performed. The target data is obtained to filter out the positioning data (that is, another part of data) that is the noise data, and identify and use the data (that is, the part of the positioning data) that is more accurate. The another part of the data includes a substantial portion of the noise data, and the part of the positioning data includes no or little noise data. In an embodiment, the proportion (e.g., 100% or close to 100%) of the noise data in the another part of the data is much greater than the proportion (e.g., 0% or close to 0%) of the noise data in the part of the positioning data. That is, the technical solution of the disclosure is to reconstruct the motion track of the target object in segments based on filtering so that the impact of GPS noise and data loss may be greatly reduced, an error between the restored track and the actual travelling data may reach a desired level (e.g., industrial-level quality), the data is adaptively segmented and the volume of to-be-processed data is effectively reduced.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">During an implementation, the terminal may separately determine whether the positioning data in the data set is the noise data. It is to be understood that some attributes, such as a frequency spectrum, of noise data and non-noise data are different. Accordingly, whether the positioning data is noise data may be determined by identifying attributes such as the frequency spectrum of the positioning data. For any positioning data in the data set, when it is determined that the positioning data is the noise data, the noise data is filtered out from the data set. The remaining positioning data in the data set may be used as the target data. The curve fitting refers to using a continuous curve to approximately depict or simulate a functional relationship between coordinates (that is, points indicated by the positioning data) represented by a group of discrete points on a plane, and is a method for approximating discrete data with an analytical expression. A colloquial expression of the curve fitting is to &#x201c;pull the curve&#x201d;, that is, a representation method in which the existing data is substituted into a math equation through a mathematical method. For example, several pieces of discrete positioning data are obtained by methods such as sampling and experiment. According to the positioning data, a continuous function (that is, the curve) or a more dense discrete equation is found, so that the positioning data and a curve of the equation can be coincided to the greatest extent.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Operation S<b>206</b>. The terminal determines the motion track of the target object based on the multiple segments of the first curves.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the foregoing embodiments, description is provided by using an example in which the method for reconstructing a motion track according to an embodiment of the disclosure is performed by the terminal <b>103</b>. The method for reconstructing a motion track according to an embodiment of the disclosure may further be performed by the server <b>101</b>, and the difference from the foregoing embodiments is that the entity that executes the method for reconstructing a motion track is changed from the terminal <b>103</b> to the server <b>101</b>. The method for reconstructing a motion track according to an embodiment of the disclosure may further be jointly performed by the server <b>101</b> and the terminal <b>103</b>, e.g., one or two of the operations (such as operation S<b>202</b>) are performed by the terminal <b>103</b>, and the remaining operations (such as operation S<b>204</b> and operation S<b>206</b>) are performed by the server <b>101</b>. The method for reconstructing a motion track in an embodiment of the disclosure performed by the terminal <b>103</b> may alternatively be performed by the client (such as the client of a map application or the client of an application with a built-in map service) installed on the terminal <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Through the foregoing operation S<b>202</b> to operation S<b>206</b>, noise filtering is performed on the positioning data in the data set before the track reconstruction. Data fitting is performed, based on the positioning data obtained after noise filtering, on the plurality of pieces of positioning data acquired at adjacent times, to obtain the plurality of first curves, and the motion track of the target object may be determined based on the first curves. The filtered data that is less disturbed by noise is used in a process of the track reconstruction, so that the reconstructed motion track may be closer to an original motion track, and the technical problem of relatively low accuracy of vehicle motion track reconstruction in the related art may be solved, thereby achieving the technical effect of accurately reconstructing the vehicle motion track.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the technical solutions of the disclosure, a segmented Euler transition curve (that is, the first curve) may be obtained by using a filtering solution such as the Kalman filtering, to adaptively restore a travelling track line (that is, the motion track) and effectively reconstruct a complex straight geometrical locus, a curve turning geometrical locus and a driving geometrical locus connecting two states under urban road conditions. The solutions of the disclosure may greatly reduce impact of the GPS noise and the data loss on the track reconstruction. The GPS noise herein is mainly GPS positioning information obtained by positioning at locations (such as a garage, a densely built-up area of a city, an underpass and the like) with weak GPS signals, and the data loss is caused by failure in obtaining GPS positioning information in places where GPS signals are weak or non-existent (for example, when passing through a plurality of caves in sequence, the GPS positioning information cannot be acquired in the caves, and only a small amount of the GPS positioning information can be acquired between the caves). In the related art technologies, relatively large errors may exist in the reconstructed track when there is GPS noise data, and in a case of lacking the GPS information, a travelling track cannot be restored due to the relatively small amount of the positioning data. However, the technical solutions of the disclosure may be implemented to reconstruct the travelling track even in a case where the positioning signals such as GPS signals and the like are relatively weak or missing. For example, the positioning data that is the noise data is filtered out when there is a relatively large amount of noise data, and only the positioning data that is relatively accurate is used for track reconstruction. Due to a relatively small amount of the positioning data used in the segmented reconstruction of the disclosure, a small amount of GPS positioning data and inertial guidance data (the position of the vehicle after entering a cave may be deducted from the GPS positioning data before entering the cave and the acceleration measured by a inertial guidance unit of the vehicle) may be used for implementing the track reconstruction in a case of no GPS signals being acquired in a location such as a cave. Therefore, the problem of track reconstruction in the related art when GPS and other positioning signals are relatively weak or missing is solved. The error between the reconstructed track line and the actual travelling data may reach a desired level and/or industrial-level quality, the data may be adaptively segmented and the volume of data to be processed may be effectively reduced.

Generally, for a mapping vehicle with high precision, a GPS base station may further be erected near the mapping road, and some auxiliary positioning services may further be used for improving the positioning precision. According to the vehicle position, the driving information and the auxiliary positioning information, a position of the vehicle in the mapping process may be restored to some discrete vehicle track points.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0076">According to the discrete vehicle track points, which are often polluted by GPS observation noise, the Kalman filtering is used for modeling a state space equation to the vehicle travelling track, and the impact of the noise is reduced by constraints of a motion equation. Then, the observation noise is further reduced by using the curve fitting under a principle of least square and constraints of a curve geometric such as continuity and smoothness, and the track line of the vehicle is reconstructed.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0077">The curve for fitting may be a combined curve of a straight line and a circle, or a third order Bessel segmented curve and a third order B-spline curve. A fitting method or an iterative trying method is used, that is, data points are fitted, one by one, by using fitting elements of different parameters, and the fitting error under a sense of the least square is investigated. The fitting result is obtained after a fitting error or a quantity of iterative operations is reached. Another fitting method is to use all data points as observation points, calculate the least square error between the corresponding points on the fitting curve and the observation points, and obtain the fitting curve under the least square error by adjusting the parameter of the fitting curve as the fitting result.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0078">It may be seen that in the related art, the travelling track point is calculated according to GPS, inertial navigation IMU and wheel encoder information, the GPS observation error is first reduced by the Kalman filtering, and the least square method is used for fitting and reconstructing the travelling track line. The fitting curve may be a segmented curve of a combination of a circle and a straight line, a third order Bessel segmented curve or a third order B-spline curve. Due to the complex road conditions and short and variable road geometry in an urban environment, sudden turning due to space constraints is very common, and requirements for flexibility of the fitting curve are high, causing a relatively large quantity of segments of the fitting curve or a relatively large quantity of control points on the curve to be processed, resulting in a relatively large amount of data to be processed. In addition, it is often difficult for the least square fitting algorithm to ensure the reliability and precision due to more shading, weaker GPS signal strength, more noise and loss of the vehicle track points of urban roads.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0079">There are problems in three aspects in the related art. First, the fitting algorithm uses all the data as fitting data, leading to introduction of noise, and the problem of data loss due to the urban environment and poor quality of the GPS signal is not considered. Consequently, the reliability and precision of the fitting result are relatively low. Second, the urban road environment is complex. Affected by the surrounding buildings, vegetation, terrain and special artificial factors, the road geometry consistency is relatively poor and the sudden turning and variation are sharp. Consequently, the common fitting curve has a relatively large quantity of segments and a large amount of data, and the quality of fitting is not fixed, the flat part may be of relatively good quality but the sharp mutation part is of relatively poor quality, and the fitting error performance is not fixed. Third, the least square fitting algorithm may only ensure that mathematical expectation of the fitting error is relatively low, but the variance of the fitting error is relatively large, that is, the fitting precision is sacrificed to ensure the stability of fitting.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0080">In the solution of the disclosure, the segmented Euler transition curve assisted by the Kalman filtering is used for adaptively restoring the travelling track, and the problems in the above three aspects are solved effectively. First, the fitting algorithm adaptively selects points in the data to participate in the fitting, and adopts a principle similar to random sampling consistency (RANSAC) to adaptively remove impact of points with relatively large errors on the fitting. Second, an element of fitting is the Euler transition curve with high flexibility, and a straight line and a circle are special cases of the curve. The Euler transition curve may fit complex road geometry without a combination of a relatively large quantity of segmented curves, so that the amount of data after fitting is small. Third, the fitting error is defined by using a Euclidean distance directly projected from the fitting data to the fitting curve and directly corresponds to a final fitting error. A process of fitting optimization directly reduces the fitting error and improves the fitting precision.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0081">This solution is suitable for vehicle track reconstruction in high precision map acquisition in the urban environment and vehicle track modeling in automatic driving in the urban environment.
