As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the network system includes a terminal <b>11</b>, an intermediary device <b>12</b>, and a network device <b>13</b>, where the terminal <b>11</b> may be User Equipment (UE) or another terminal side device, for example, a mobile phone, a tablet personal computer, a laptop computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a Mobile Internet Device (MID), a wearable device, a robot, or another terminal side device. It should be noted that a specific type of the terminal <b>11</b> is not limited in the embodiments of the present disclosure. The intermediary device <b>12</b> may be a Large Intelligent Surface (LIS) or another device made of a new metamaterial, a backscatter, a Wi-Fi device, a relay device (for example, a layer <b>1</b> relay, an amplify-and-forward relay, or a transparent forwarding relay), or the like. The network device <b>13</b> may be a network device, a Wi-Fi device, or a terminal device. The network device may be a base station in 4G or a base station in 5G or later releases, or a base station in other communications systems, or is referred to as a Node B, an evolved Node B, a Transmission Reception Point (TRP), an Access Point (AP), or another term in the field. As long as the same technical effect is achieved, the network device is not limited to a specific technical term. In addition, the network device <b>13</b> may be a Master Node (MN) or a Secondary Node (SN).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this embodiment of the present disclosure, the terminal <b>11</b> may communicate with the network device <b>13</b> via the intermediary device <b>12</b>. For example, the intermediary device <b>12</b> may forward a signal sent by the terminal <b>11</b> to the network device <b>13</b>, and may forward a signal sent by the network device <b>13</b> to the terminal <b>11</b>. The forwarding performed by the intermediary device <b>12</b> may be direct forwarding, transparent forwarding, amplify-and-forward, sending the signal after frequency conversion or modulation, or the like. This is not limited. In this embodiment of the present disclosure, the signal transmitted between the terminal <b>11</b> and the intermediary device <b>12</b> may be a signal that needs to be transmitted between the terminal <b>11</b> and the intermediary device <b>12</b>, that is, this scenario may not include the network device <b>13</b>. In addition, the terminal <b>11</b> may communicate with the network device <b>13</b> directly.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition, in this embodiment of the present disclosure, an LIS is a device made of a new man-made material. An LIS can adjust electric and magnetic properties of the LIS dynamically/semi-statically to affect reflection/refraction of electromagnetic waves that are incident upon the LIS, for example, change a frequency, an amplitude, a phase, a direction of polarization, and spatial energy distribution of beams of a reflected/refracted signal. The LIS can control reflected/refracted signals of electromagnetic signals to implement functions such as beam scanning/beam forming.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart of a signal transmission method according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The method is performed by a first device. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the method includes the following steps:</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Step <b>201</b>: obtaining operating parameter indication information of a second device.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The operating parameter indication information may be obtained by receiving from the first device or by receiving from the second device.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The operating parameter indication information may be used to indicate operating information of the first device in a cell and/or a specific operating parameter of the first device.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Step <b>202</b>: transmitting/receiving a first signal to/from a third device based on the operating parameter indication information.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">To transmit/receive a first signal to/from a third device includes transmitting/receiving the first signal to/from the third device via the second device, or to transmit/receive a first signal to/from a third device includes transmitting/receiving the first signal to/from the third device directly.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The transmitting/receiving the first signal to/from the third device via the second device may be that the first device sends the signal to the third device via the second device, or that the first device receives the signal that is sent by the third device to the first device and that is forwarded by the second device.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In step <b>202</b>, whether the first signal is transmitted/received to/from the third device via the second device or transmitted/received to/from the third device directly may be determined based on the operating parameter indication information. For example, when it is indicated that there is no second device in a cell or a non-operating resource of the second device is used, the first signal may be transmitted/received to/from the third device directly; or when it is indicated that there is the second device in a cell or an operating resource of the second device is used, the first signal may be transmitted/received to/from the third device via the second device.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the first signal may be a signal that needs to be transmitted with assistance from the second device or that needs to be forwarded by the second device in order to ensure reliable signal quality of the signal.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this embodiment of the present disclosure, the first device may include a network device, a Wi-Fi device, or a terminal. The second device may include an LIS, a backscatter, a Wi-Fi device, or a relay device. The third device includes a terminal, a Wi-Fi device, or a network device. In a case in which the first device is a terminal, the third device may be a network device. In a case in which the first device is a network device, the third device may be a terminal. It may alternatively be that in a case in which the first device is a terminal, the third device is also a terminal, and in a case in which the first device is a network device, the third device is also a network device.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further, the first signal may be a signal sent by the first device to the third device. For example, a terminal receives the first signal forwarded by the second device, and the first signal is sent by a network device to the terminal.

In addition, a plurality of channel measurement results as described above may include measurement results at a plurality of different times in a plurality of operating states of the second device, for example, a measurement result obtained by the first device when forwarding the first signal in an operating state determined according to a training sequence. In this way, the terminal can determine, based on corresponding relationships between measurement results at different times and operating states of the second device, a change of a channel, and then determine the sending information based on modulation manner indication information. For example, when the manner of modulation is differential modulation, the sending information is determined by comparing a channel measurement result at a current time granularity with a channel measurement result at a previous time granularity. In some embodiments, the change of the channel may be determined based on a difference between the measurement results, and the sending information is further determined.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In this implementation, because the sending information used by the second device for the first signal may be determined, the first signal sent by the second device to the terminal can be precisely obtained based on the sending information.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">As an optional implementation, the operating parameter indication information includes:</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">received operating parameter indication information;</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">operating parameter indication information determined according to a pre-defined operating rule of the second device; or</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">operating parameter indication information determined based on a Quasi Co-Location (QCL) relationship.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The received operating parameter indication information may be sent by the network device.

For example, when the second device has an independent wireless communications module, the first device may send the operating parameter indication information of the second device to the terminal, for example, send the operating parameter indication information of the second device by sidelink or Device-to-Device (D2D) communication.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The operating parameter indication information determined according to the pre-defined operating rule of the second device may be that an operating parameter is determined according to an operating rule of the second device pre-defined in a protocol, where a relationship between the operating rule and the operating parameter may be pre-configured or obtained by the terminal by inferring according to the operating rule.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The operating parameter indication information determined based on the QCL relationship may be that the first device determines an operating parameter of the second device according to the QCL relationship between the different configured ports over different slots. For the third device, signals transmitted over a same port in different time resources have a QCL relationship, so that in different time resources, the second device is in a same operating state for transmitting signals over a same port. Therefore, forwarded signals also have a QCL relationship. In this way, for a same port, the first device may determine, based on operating parameter indication information in an earlier time resource, operating parameter indication information in a subsequent time resource, for example, use the operating parameter indication information in the earlier time resource as the operating parameter indication information in the subsequent time resource. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the third device and the second device communicate with each other over ports N, N+1, and N+2 separately, and the second device may operate in different operating states for ports N, N+1, and N+2.
