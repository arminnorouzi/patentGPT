num="0001">The present invention relates to a drug delivery device for delivering a predefined plurality of fixed doses. The present invention especially relates to such a drug delivery device wherein the expelling of the fixed doses is driven by a pre-strained torsion spring.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Drug delivery devices for self-administration of different liquid drug formulation presently exist in various shapes and sizes. Some are adapted for connecting to an infusion set, and some are connectable or integrated with an injection needle. The latter type is referred to as injection devices. Some are durable devices comprising a cartridge with a drug reservoir, wherein the cartridge can be changed. Others are disposable devices that are discarded when the cartridge is empty. Disposable devices can be either multi-dose devices, in which the user can set the desired dose size prior to each injection, or single dose devices, capable of administering only a single dose of a given size. The latter exists with so-called &#x201c;Shield activation&#x201d;, where the cannula is covered by a shield in the front of the device that releases the dose when pressed. The cannula is then exposed only to enter the skin, when the user presses the device against the skin, and thereby depresses the shield, and releases the dose. These injection devices are disposed after a single injection.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fixed dose devices are preferable to some users, since they may not feel comfortable with or be capable of operating the device to adjust the correct dose each time. When devices for instance are used by children or older people, simplicity and ease of use is important to avoid user error leading to over- or under dosing. In other cases, the treatment regimen prescribes a fixed dose of e.g. a GLP-1 type of drug.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the device itself is responsible for a considerably part of the costs of the unit, not to mention the amount of materials used and thus necessary to dispose. It would therefore be desirable to make a fixed dose device capable of delivering multiple doses of a fixed volume.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In existing multi-dose devices, the motor consists of a spring being wound up when adjusting the dose. One solution is to make a normal multi-dose device where the maximum dose size is limited, so it is only possible to dial up to the fixed dose size. This would however introduce a risk that the user does not dial up sufficiently and thus gets a smaller dose than expected, this problem has been solved in WO2020089167 filed by Novo Nordisk, wherein a ratchet tube is locked to the housing until the full dose has been set and the drive mechanism has been released.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another fixed dose device is disclosed in WO2019/09179 filed by Sanofi-Aventis. The disclosure relates to an injection device with a longitudinally displaceable dose tracker, providing an automated dose setting in accordance to a preselected size of a dose. The disclosed injection device comprises an elongated housing <b>10</b> extending along a longitudinal axis (z), a piston rod <b>20</b>, <b>120</b> to operably engage with a piston <b>7</b> of a cartridge <b>6</b> filled with the medicament. The injection device further comprises a dose tracker <b>60</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>350</b>, <b>450</b>, <b>550</b> selectively operably engageable with the piston rod <b>20</b>, <b>120</b>, wherein the dose tracker is proximally displaceable relative to the housing <b>10</b> from an initial position (i), see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, towards at least a first activation position (a), see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>, for setting of the dose and wherein the dose tracker is distally displaceable relative to the housing (<b>10</b>) from the activation position (a) towards the initial position (i) for dispensing of the dose. The injection device comprises a spring <b>80</b>, <b>144</b> to urge the dose tracker in the proximal direction. The injection device further comprises an interlock <b>84</b>, <b>184</b>, <b>284</b>, <b>584</b> to lock the dose tracker in the initial position (i), and a release member <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>190</b>, <b>290</b>, <b>590</b> to release the interlock <b>84</b>, <b>184</b>, <b>284</b>. For example, if the release member <b>190</b> is activated in order to liberate or to release the dose tracker <b>150</b> the dose tracker <b>150</b> starts to rotate relative to the housing under the action of the relaxing spring <b>144</b>. An alternative fixed dose device wherein the size of the fixed dose can be selected is disclosed in WO 2017/106221 filed by Merch Sharp &#x26; Dohme Corp. However, enabling the possibility of selecting between different sizes of fixed doses adds to the complexity of the device and the selection functionality is not always desirable. The functionality of providing different fixed dose sizes can, alternatively, be obtained with a set of two or more different fixed dose devices.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An alternative fixed dose device is disclosed in WO2018/007259 filed by Copernicus. The disclosure relates to an injection device for delivering a defined number of equal doses of a fluid substance. The disclosed injection device comprises a housing <b>1</b> with an arming mechanism and a dose delivery mechanism arranged along the longitudinal axis of the housing. The housing is coupled to an enclosure <b>3</b> for receiving a reservoir with the fluid substance. The arming mechanism comprises a setting sleeve <b>5</b>, which is axially non-displaceable. The arming mechanism is rotatable about the axis of the housing in two opposite directions by a defined setting angle (a). The setting sleeve <b>5</b> is coupled with a torsion spring <b>10</b>, which is strained by the rotation of the setting sleeve <b>5</b> during arming of the device. The dose delivery mechanism comprises a screw ring <b>6</b> and a piston rod <b>4</b> which is non-rotatable and axially displaceable within the setting sleeve <b>5</b>. When the piston rod <b>4</b> cooperates with the screw ring <b>6</b>, during arming of the device, the screw ring <b>6</b> and the piston rod <b>4</b> are immobilized. During delivery of each dose, the piston rod <b>4</b> is displaced along the housing <b>1</b> by a defined distance due to unwinding of the spring <b>10</b> and rotation of the screw ring <b>6</b>. Displacement of the piston rod <b>4</b> causes the fluid substance to be discharged from the reservoir. As appears, to enable ejection of a dose the torsion spring must be strained. An alternative design utilizing the compression of a spring is described in WO 2017/098460 also filed by Copernicus. Another alternative device also utilizing the compression of a spring before each fixed dose is disclosed in WO94/26331 filed by Owen Mumford. However, arming the device between each dose is not always desirable, as it requires that the user can provide enough force to arm the device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An alternative fixed dose device is disclosed in WO2013/034651 filed by Menarini. The disclosure relates to a device for the automatic injection of two doses of a medicament at two successive times. The disclosure describes an automatic injection device comprising a sliding sheath <b>30</b> which, when depressed with its front end <b>3</b> against the injection site, interacts with cam means <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> to activate the triggering of a plunger <b>8</b>, controlling the delivery of a drug dose. Plunger guide means <b>44</b> are provided on the inner surface of an outer housing <b>1</b> for controlling the triggering sequence and a dose knob <b>4</b> is used for arming or setting the device in the dose delivery condition. The device is adapted for automatic needle re-sheathing and resetting of a lock-out condition after each dose is delivered are provided.

Therefore, the distal end of an injection device is defined in a context, where a user holds the device in a ready to inject position, whereby the end with the injection needle will be the distal end and the opposite end will be the proximal end. Furthermore, distal and proximal ends of individual components of the device is also defined in that context.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0099">As used herein, a trailing edge and a front edge is used to describe the edges of a structure moving relative to another structure. The front edge is the edge in the moving direction and the trailing edge is the opposite. In this way, the front edge and the trailing edge defined according to the direction of the relative movement between structures.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0100">As used herein, rotational symmetry, is a property of a structure when it appears the same or possess the same functionality after some rotation by a partial turn. A structure's degree of rotational symmetry is the number of distinct orientations in which it appears the same for each rotation. Rotational symmetry of order n, wherein n is 2 or more, is also called n-fold rotational symmetry, or discrete rotational symmetry of the n<sup>th </sup>order, with respect to a particular point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D), which means that rotation by an angle of 360&#xb0;/n does not change the object. The property of the structure may both relate to the visible appearance and the functional capability of structural feature.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0101">As used herein, the term clockwise direction is used to describe the direction that the hands of a clock rotate as viewed from in front. Therefore, the clockwise rotation of the injection device is the clockwise rotation observed, when viewing the device from in front of the distal end. Counterclockwise or anticlockwise rotation is defined as the opposite direction.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0102">As used herein, a proximal face is a face of the device as viewed from the proximal end and in the distal direction, wherein a distal face is the face of the device as viewed from the distal end and in the proximal direction.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0103">As used herein, a positive axial or longitudinal direction is defined from the proximal end towards the distal end. A positive axial direction and a distal direction are used interchangeably with the same meaning. Similar, the definitions a negative axial direction and proximal direction are used interchangeably with the same meaning. A central axis of the device is defined through the centre of the injection device in the positive axial direction, which is also referred to as a longitudinal axis, with the same meaning.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0104">As used herein, a positive radial direction is defined along a radial axis originating at the central axis and with a direction perpendicular to the central axis.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105">A positive circumferential or positive angular direction is defined for a point positioned at a radial distance from the central axis, wherein the circumferential direction is counter-clockwise and perpendicular to the axial and radial direction. A direction can as used in the present disclosure be both positive and negative. For example the term axial direction covers the positive axial direction from the proximal end towards the distal end and the negative axial direction, which is in the opposite direction.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0106">Both the radial and the circumferential direction are herein referred to as transverse directions, as they are transverse normal to the axial direction. The transverse plane is herein defined as a plane spanned by two vectors in the radial and circumferential direction, for a given coordinate along the axis, and with the central axis as the normal vector.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0107">As used herein, axial movement of a structure is used to describe a movement, wherein the displacement vector of the structure has a component in the axial direction. A translational movement is used to describe a uniform motion in the axial direction only. A pure, strict or uniform axial movement is the same as a translational movement and the terms are used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0108">Radial movement of a structure is used to describe a movement, wherein the displacement vector of the structure has a component in the radial direction. A pure or strict radial movement is used to describe a uniform motion in the radial direction only. Thus a pure, strict and uniform radial movement is the same and the terms are used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0109">Circumferential, angular or rotational movement of a structure is used to describe a movement, wherein the displacement vector of the structure has a component in the circumferential direction. A pure or strict circumferential movement is used to describe a uniform motion in the circumferential direction only. Thus a pure, strict and uniform circumferential movement is the same as pure, strict and uniform angular or rotational movement, and these terms are used interchangeably. The definition of rotational movement for a structure also encompasses the special case, wherein the structure comprises a central axis defining the axis of rotation. In this special case, all the positions of the structure, which are off the central axis, are subject to a circular circumferential movement, whereas the displacement vector of the positions on the central axis is zero. Therefore, a structure rotating about its own central axis and moving in an axial direction is said to perform a rotational movement.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0110">A helical movement of a structure is used to describe a combined axial and angular or rotational movement, wherein the displacement vector of the structure comprises a circumferential and an axial component. The definition of helical movement for a structure also encompasses the special case, wherein the structure comprises a central axis defining an axis of rotation. In this special case, all the positions of the structure, which are off the central axis, are subject to a helical movement, whereas the displacement vector of the positions on the central axis only comprises an axial component. Therefore, a structure rotating about its own central axis and moving in an axial direction is said to perform a helical movement.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0111">In this context pure, strict and uniform movements are abstract mathematical definitions, and these terms are used to describe an ideal or abstract movement of the devices. Therefore, a structure in a real device should not be expected to exhibit this ideal behaviour, rather such a structure should be expected to move in a pattern approximating such an ideal movement.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0112">As used herein a right-handed thread or helical portion is a thread or helix portion whose helix moves in the positive axial direction, when the screw is turned clockwise. A screw with a right handed-thread is by convention the default thread, and is screwed in the positive axial direction by counterclockwise rotation usually performed by the right hand. Similar, a screw with a left-handed thread is screwed in the positive axial direction by clockwise rotation, and can thus be performed with the left hand and mirror the movement of the right hand operating a right handed thread.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0113">The embodiments of the present disclosure, wherein the injection device is adapted for providing a plurality of predefined fixed doses, are described in detail in relation to an injection device comprising a reusable integrated needle cannula with a cleaning chamber.

As explained in detail later in the application, upon initialization the needle shield is adapted to be guided in a proximal helical movement. As the cleaning chamber housing is fixed to the needle shield, the pushing tab <b>121</b>.<b>2</b> performs a proximal helical movement relative to the rotationally fixed needle hub, in response to initialization. The needle hub is axially movable between a distal and a proximal position. As the needle hub is axially movably positioned on the cartridge holder <b>130</b>, the pushing tab <b>121</b>.<b>2</b> of the chamber housing forces the needle hub from the distal to the proximal position, in response to the needle shield moving from the initial to the locked position. Furthermore, during the axial movement of the shield, the pushing tab <b>121</b>.<b>2</b> has also rotated from the initial to the locked angular position together with the shield. In the locked angular position, the push tab <b>121</b>.<b>2</b> is angularly aligned with a cut-out <b>125</b>.<b>5</b> in the tubular portion <b>125</b>.<b>13</b> of the needle hub, and it is aligned with the axial stop surface <b>128</b>.<b>2</b>.

Between the initial and the locked angular position of the shield, the hub has been moved a proximal distance to connect the proximal end of the needle cannula <b>124</b> with the reservoir of the cartridge <b>135</b>. The proximal movement of the hub has further provided a rotation of the cartridge engaging structure, whereby the tabs <b>126</b>.<b>2</b>, having cam surfaces, has been rotated and forced into the axial clearance between the distal surface of the distal end of the cartridge and the proximal surface of the circumferentially extending flange <b>134</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>).

Minimization of the air gap ensures that the drug is expelled from the reservoir, in response to moving the piston rod <b>109</b> in the distal direction.

In embodiments comprising the thread connection <b>106</b>.<b>2</b>, <b>154</b>.<b>2</b> between the nut and the housing, the advancement of the piston rod relative to the housing is compensated or counteracted by the proximal movement of the adjustment nut relative to the housing.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0162">The rotation of the adjustment nut is preferably done by using a special tool in the production line which is adapted to engage the adjustment nut and transfer a rotation to the adjustment nut. In one preferred example, the piston rod <b>109</b> is arranged in engagement with the adjustment nut to provide a subassembly, and the subassembly is then arranged in the inner tubular portion <b>154</b> of the housing. Hereafter, electronic computerized equipment is used to detect the relative position of the piston <b>136</b> in the cartridge <b>135</b> to be used for that specific injection device.

The ratchet arm <b>181</b><i>c </i>thus prevents rotation of the piston rod <b>109</b> in the clockwise direction. In the illustrated example the drive tube comprises two ratchet arms <b>181</b><i>c, </i><b>181</b><i>d </i>arranged in 2-fold rotational symmetry. The ratchets arms <b>181</b> provides a dose clicking sound during expelling, in response to the drive tube <b>180</b> and the piston rod <b>135</b> rotating in the counter clockwise direction.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0169">The engagement between the piston rod <b>109</b> and the drive tube <b>180</b> prevents relative rotation. Therefore, as the adjustment nut <b>106</b> during zero-point adjustment is rotated in the clockwise direction, the nut induces a distal translation of the piston rod <b>109</b>, since the drive tube is locked against rotation in the clockwise direction.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0170">The torque delivering drive spring <b>108</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, is in an embodiment according to the disclosure arranged inside the drive tube <b>180</b>, and at each end fixedly attached to the drive tube and the spring base <b>165</b>.

The drive spring is winded up or strained during assembly, and thereby stores energy to rotate the drive tube with a sufficient torque and thereby deliver the plurality of doses without further straining.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0171">Incorporating a torsion spring in the drive mechanism provides several advantages. The inventors of the present invention realized that for an embodiment constructed with a compression spring, the compression spring advances into the cartridge as it releases energy. If the injection device is designed without allowing the compression spring advancing into the cartridge, the overall length of the device will increase. Therefore, in a construction of limited length the diameter of the spring is limited by the diameter of the cartridge. The inventors of the present invention found that as a torsional spring does not have to extend into the cartridge in order to limit the overall length of the device. Therefore, the torsional drive spring is not limited by the diameter of the cartridge or the piston rod and is advantageous in a construction of limited length.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0172">The torsional drive spring according to an embodiment of the present disclosure is arranged proximal to the cartridge and on the outside of the piston rod <b>109</b>. Thereby, the torsional drive spring allows the spring to enclose a larger volume, and thereby increase the mass, i.e., the amount of spring material (e.g. steel). In other words, as the used material or mass can be increased, the performance relating to long term storage and dosing can be improved. With increased mass, internal stress of the spring can be reduced, and/or the spring profile can be flatter thus minimizing the variation in dose time between the first and last dose of the device. The inventors of the present invention also found that if the maximum internal stress of the spring is reduced, the stress induced in the plastic components supporting the spring is also reduced, which is necessary in order to allow long term storage.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0173">The inventors of the present invention further found that in an embodiment, wherein the torsional drive spring is arranged inside the drive tube, the drive tube can be adapted to provide dose clicks and allows an increase of the number of dose clicks by increasing the diameter. Therefore, the number of dose clicks can be increased without extending the axial length of the device.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0174">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the outer surface of the drive tube comprises a dose click providing structure adapted to provide dose clicks, e.g., a ratchet arm riding over teeth provided on a surrounding structure. Alternatively, the ratchet arm is provided on the surrounding structure and the teeth on the drive tube. As the circumference of the outer surface of the drive tube <b>180</b> increases with the diameter of the drive tube, so does the number of dose clicks. In the case of a rotational drive tube, the number of dose clicks is determined as the relation between the circumference of the drive tube and the distance between the dose click providing structures, e.g., distance between the teeth (number of dose clicks=2*pi*radius/distance between teeth). Therefore, the number of dose clicks can be increased by increasing the radius, but without increasing the length of the spring and thereby the device. In contrast, in order to increase the number of dose clicks for a piston driven by a compression spring arranged in the piston, the length of the compression spring has to be increased. In the case of a compression spring, the number of dose clicks is determined by the axial extension of the spring divided by the distance between the teeth (number of dose clicks=axial extension/distance between teeth).</p><p id="p-0178" num="0175">Furthermore, the inventors of the present invention found, that the required energy to release a triggering mechanism, i.e., the activation energy, is a function of the internal stress of the drive spring. Therefore, activation of the dose engine enabled with a torsional drive spring requires less force than a similar design based on a compression spring.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0176">In addition, the inventors found that an embodiment comprising a drive mechanism based on a torsional drive spring is easier to assemble than an embodiment based on an equivalent compression drive spring. Compared to the compression spring, the torsional spring is relatively short and is thus easier to handle.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0177">The rotating drive tube is easily adapted to function with an electronic dose capturing device, which register a rotating structure during dosing, as described in WO 2019/110494, titled &#x201c;Drug delivery system with multipolar magnet and sensor system&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0178">Housing Insert Portion</p><p id="p-0182" num="0179"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref> illustrate two different perspective views of the housing insert portion <b>160</b> to be fixedly mounted at the distal end of the elongate housing structure <b>110</b>, via alignment structures and snap structure <b>160</b><i>c.</i><b>3</b>.

Thereby, the front edge <b>189</b><i>d.</i><b>1</b> is moved proximally along the axial surface portion <b>182</b><i>d </i>until it passes a proximal end of the axial surface portion and reaches the starting point <b>157</b><i>d.</i><b>1</b> of the helical dosing track. Due to the counterclockwise bias of the drive tube <b>189</b>, the drive tube <b>189</b> rotates in the counterclockwise direction, and due the distal bias the front edge <b>189</b><i>d.</i><b>1</b> is forced into contact with the helical dose track of the inner tubular portion <b>154</b>. Hereafter, the drive tube with the front edge <b>189</b><i>d.</i><b>1</b> travels along the helical dose track in a distal helical movement until it reaches the ending point <b>157</b><i>d.</i><b>2</b>.

The injection device can be stored and delivered in a secondary packaging, and in the out-of-pack state (A<b>1</b>) the injection device has been unpacked from the secondary packaging.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0214">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, when the user desires to take a first fixed dose, the injection device is unpacked and thereby provided in the out-of-pack state (A<b>1</b>). Thereafter the injection device is initiated by the user. Initiation can be done by grapping a main portion <b>102</b> of the device with the right hand and the cap <b>105</b> with the left hand. Hereafter, the user turns the cap in the counterclockwise direction (for the illustrated example). Hereby, the cap snaps off the cap snap <b>161</b>.<b>1</b> of the housing assembly and engages the needle shield, whereby the needle shield follows the rotation of the cap <b>105</b> until the cap <b>105</b> has been turned to the rotational stop <b>161</b>.<b>4</b>. Due to the step-wise helical guide <b>112</b> of the shield and the proximal guide <b>162</b> of the housing assembly, the needle shield is subject to a combined proximal and rotational movement, in response to the user turning the cap. Furthermore, by this initial rotation of the cap and the combined rotational and proximal movement of the needle shield, the needle cannula <b>124</b> pierces the septum of the cartridge <b>135</b>, and thereby establishes fluid communication with a drug reservoir in the cartridge <b>135</b>. Furthermore, in this operation the cartridge <b>135</b> is proximally displaced and pushed against the piston rod <b>109</b> or the piston washer <b>104</b>. As the cannula has established fluid connection, and as the piston is arranged in abutment with the piston rod, the integrated needle is primed, as will be explained in detail later. As the cap reaches the rotational stop, the injection device is positioned in the cap unlocked and initiated state (B<b>1</b>), wherein the cap is unlocked and positioned to be taken off. The initiated state is also shown in cross section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0215">In the following step the user pulls the cap <b>105</b> of, whereby the injection device is arranged in the cap-off state (C<b>1</b>), and wherein the shield is locked against axial translation.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0216">Hereafter, the user manually turns the shield in the counterclockwise direction, whereby the device is arranged in a shield unlocked state (D<b>1</b>), the shield is arranged in an unlocked position and can be pressed proximally into the housing. Due to the guides between the shield and the housing <b>112</b>, <b>162</b>, the shield is subject to a combined proximal and rotational movement when operated between the cap-of state and the shield unlocked state. During the rotational unlocking movement of the needle shield, the needle shield uncovers the cartridge inspection window <b>141</b> in the housing, whereby the drug in the cartridge can be inspected. In addition, the piston <b>136</b> is also visible in the inspection window <b>141</b>, and the position of the piston <b>136</b> relative to a fixed dose scale on the housing indicates the progression of the piston during use, and thereby indicates the remaining number of fixed doses in the reservoir. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, in the shield unlocked state (D<b>1</b>), the piston <b>136</b> is arranged in the initial position and <b>4</b> doses are remaining in the reservoir. During the proximal movement of the needle shield, the distal end of the needle tip protrudes through the septum at the distal end of the cleaning assembly <b>120</b>, whereby any excess pressure in the needle is released.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0217">Hereafter, the user presses the needle shield against the injection site, whereby the shield and the connector <b>170</b> is proximally displaced against the force of the shield return spring <b>107</b>. Hereby, the needle is inserted into the skin or subcutaneous layer of a patient. By this operation, the axial movement of the shield triggers the drive mechanism, and a fixed dose is delivered through the needle cannula in a dosing state (E<b>1</b>). At the end of dose, the piston <b>136</b> has moved to the next position, which is indicated by the fixed dose residual scale on the housing, and the injection device can be removed from the injection site. The cut-out window of the residual scale shows the piston in the next position. As the piston <b>136</b> progresses under the dosing state it can be useful to define to substates for a respective dosing state: an initial dosing state (E<b>2</b>.<b>1</b>) and a final dosing state (E<b>2</b>.<b>2</b>), wherein the piston is in a pressurized proximal position and a relaxes distal position, respectively.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0218">After the dose has been completed, the user removes the device from the skin, and the pressure is thereby released from the shield. Consequently, the shield moves in the distal direction due to the action of a return spring <b>107</b>. Due to guides <b>112</b>, <b>162</b> between the shield and the housing, and guides <b>114</b>, <b>142</b> between the shield and the connector <b>170</b>, the shield is subject to a distal movement followed by a combined distal and rotational movement, whereby the shield automatically returns to a relocked state (F<b>1</b>).</p><p id="p-0222" num="0219">Hereafter, the user puts on the cap <b>105</b> by an axial movement to put the device in a cap-on state (G<b>1</b>), which is the last state shown in the sequence shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>.

Furthermore, in state (A<b>2</b>) the cartridge contains a dosage less than in state (A<b>1</b>). As the user turns the cap to take a subsequent dose, the cap is turned to the cap unlocked position without rotating the shield, as the shield is already turned to the initiated but axially locked position. The cap unlocked state (B<b>2</b>) differs from the cap unlocked state (B<b>1</b>) in that in state (B<b>2</b>) the cartridge contains a dosage less than in state (B<b>1</b>), and a corresponding difference can be observed between C<b>1</b>-C<b>2</b>, D<b>1</b>-D<b>2</b> . . .

Due to the proximal movement of the shield the connector has been moved proximally relative to the initial axial position and against the biasing force of the spring <b>107</b>. The connector is still rotationally locked.

The step-wise helical guide portion comprises a front edge and a trailing edge defined according to the direction of the relative movement between shield and housing. Due to the relative movement, the area of the abutment becomes progressively smaller until the trailing edge of the first distal helical guide portion <b>112</b>.<b>8</b> reaches the proximal edge of the helical portion <b>162</b>.<b>1</b>. At this position of minimum abutment, the abutment between the step-wise helical guide and the housing is shifted from abutment between helical portions to abutment between transverse portions, whereby the shield is guided in a pure rotation, in response to further counterclockwise rotation.

The arrangement for guiding pure rotational movement is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>J</figref>. By the proximal rotational movement of the shield <b>110</b> relative the housing <b>140</b>, the shield <b>110</b> is moved relative to the connector <b>170</b>, and the shield moves the connector relative to the housing. The right-handed helical portion <b>172</b>.<b>2</b> slides from the first right-handed helical portion <b>114</b>.<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>H</figref>) along the second right-handed helical portion, until the trailing edge of the helical portion <b>172</b>.<b>2</b> reaches the proximal edge of the second right-handed helical portion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>J</figref>). As the trailing edge is passed, a new abutment is established between the second left-handed helical portion <b>114</b>.<b>4</b> and the left-handed helical portion <b>172</b>.<b>1</b> of the connector, as the locking structure <b>171</b> of the distal guide of the connector moves into engagement with the locking structure <b>115</b> of the proximal guide of the shield (FIG. <b>16</b>K<b>1</b>).

By the proximal movement of the shield, the shield has moved the interlocked connector <b>170</b>. The connector abutting the drive tube <b>180</b>, has moved the drive tube <b>180</b> from a distal stationary position, wherein the drive tube is rotationally locked by the housing, to a proximal rotational position, wherein the drive tube will rotate relative to the housing. By the proximal movement the torsionally strained drive spring <b>109</b> has been compressed and brought into a compressed state. From the first arrangement of the device in the dosing state (FIG. <b>16</b>L<b>1</b>) to the last illustrated arrangement in the dosing state (FIG. <b>16</b>N<b>1</b>), the drive tube has turned 360 degrees during a distal helical movement, i.e., a full rotation, and returned to the initial position in the housing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A</figref> and <b>13</b>N<b>3</b>), wherein the drive tube is rotationally locked to the housing, and whereby a fixed dose has been expelled. By the rotational movement of the drive tube, the drive tube with the front edge of the distal helical surface portion <b>189</b> has travelled from a start dosing position illustrated in FIG. <b>16</b>L<b>3</b>, in the counterclockwise direction along the proximal helical surface portion <b>157</b> of the inner tubular portion <b>154</b> of the housing, to an intermediate shield unlocking position illustrated in FIG. <b>16</b>M<b>3</b> and <b>16</b>M<b>4</b>, wherein the axial portion <b>183</b>.<b>2</b> hits and abuts the axial portion <b>178</b>.<b>2</b> of the tab <b>178</b>, as indicated on FIG. <b>16</b>M<b>2</b>.

The drive spring is rotated by the torsionally pre-strained drive spring <b>108</b>, and the helical surface portion of the drive tube is kept in contact with the helical surface portion <b>157</b> of the housing, as the compressed drive spring <b>108</b> expands during unwinding. Hereby, the drive tube has returned to the initial position, which corresponds to that the drive tube has reached a stop dosing position, and further counterclockwise rotation has been prevented, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref> and N<b>3</b>. In this position the activation tab <b>178</b> can be moved proximally through the transverse opening in the outer helical structure <b>184</b>, in response to the release of the axial and proximally oriented force on the shield, i.e, the pressure on the shield tip <b>119</b> is released as the device is lifted from the skin. As appears for the drive tube being in the start dosing position, the intermediate shield unlocking position and the stop dosing position, defines three different sets of angular and axial positions: three different angular coordinates and three different axial coordinates.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0252">Initialization of Automatic Relock Mechanism</p><p id="p-0256" num="0253">During the rotation of the drive tube <b>189</b> from the intermediate shield unlocking position to the stop dosing position the drive tube has provided a torque to the connector, which exceeds the release threshold torque.

The drive tube comprises a ratchet mechanism <b>281</b>, <b>265</b>.<b>1</b> ensuring rotation in a dosing direction and blocking in a non-dosing direction. The drive tube is axially splined with the piston rod, whereby relative axial movement is allowed, and relative rotation is prevented. The drive tube is adapted to advance the piston rod, in response to rotating the drive tube in the dosing direction, and due to the threaded connection with the housing, the piston rod is adapted to advance the piston <b>236</b> in the cartridge <b>235</b> to expel a fixed dose. The drive mechanism is adapted to be activated, by changing the drive tube from a distal position, wherein the drive mechanism is in a stationary mode, to a proximal position, wherein the drive mechanism is in a dosing mode. In the distal position, the drive tube is rotationally locked to the housing. In the proximal position, the drive tube is rotationally unlocked from the housing, and the provided torque can rotate the drive tube a predetermined angel to expel the fixed dose. In the stationary mode of the drive mechanism, the piston rod is rotationally and axially locked, and the piston rod is rotationally locked to the housing through the splined connection with the drive tube <b>280</b>, and axially locked through the threaded connection with the housing.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0311">The torsion spring <b>208</b> is pre-strained to deliver the plurality of doses without restraining during use.

An unengaged position defined by an unengaged angular position and a corresponding unengaged axial position. An engaged distal position defined by an engaged angular position and a corresponding distal engaged axial position. An engaged proximal position defined by the engaged angular position and a corresponding proximal engaged axial position. In the initial position, the shield is adapted to allow a counterclockwise movement. In the unengaged position, the shield is adapted to prevent clockwise movement and to allow clockwise movement. The shield is not engaged with the connector, in the sense that a proximal movement of the shield is not transferred to a proximal movement of the connector, whereby the shield cannot activate the drive tube in this position. In the engaged distal position, the shield is adapted to prevent counterclockwise and distal movement of the shield, and further adapted to allow proximal movement. In the engaged distal position, the shield is further adapted to allow a clockwise rotation, if the applied torque exceeds a predefined threshold. For the shield being in the initial position and the unengaged position the needle tip is covered by the shield. In the engaged position, the shield is adapted to be moved from the engaged distal position, wherein the needle tip is uncovered by the shield and wherein pressure in the reservoir can be released, and proximally to the engaged proximal position, wherein the needle tip extends further from the shield and can be inserted into the subcutaneous layer of a subject. In this position further proximal movement may be prevented by the shield tip <b>119</b> being blocked against the needle hub <b>125</b>. The shield can be manually operated between the different positions by the user.

As the radial guide <b>212</b> of the shield engages the step-wise helical track <b>274</b> of the connector <b>270</b>, during the proximal helical movement of the shield from the initial to the unengaged position, the radial guide <b>212</b> abuts a proximal surface of the distal helical guide portion <b>274</b>.<b>2</b> of the step-wise helical track. In the unengaged position the radial guide rests on the middle transverse portion <b>273</b>.<b>4</b>, wherein there are no proximal sides on the track <b>274</b>. During the proximal helical movement of the shield, the shield has moved the relock tube <b>279</b> proximally against the biasing force of the return spring <b>208</b>, and in the unengaged position the axially extending portions <b>279</b>.<b>2</b> of the relock tube has moved into the cut-out <b>214</b>.<b>5</b> whereby a rotational lock is provided. For the shield being in the unengaged position, the right-handed helical portion <b>279</b>.<b>7</b> of the relock tube abuts the right-handed helical guide portion <b>214</b>.<b>6</b> of the cut-out, and the right-handed helical portion <b>214</b>.<b>3</b> of the proximal guide, and thereby urges the shield in the distal direction. The distal force is transferred from the shield to the connector, through the abutment between the radial guide <b>212</b> and the track <b>274</b>, whereby the connector is also biased in the distal direction. Therefore, in the following states the relock tube <b>279</b>, the shield <b>210</b> and the connector are distally biased. On <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref> it appears that the shield does not extend to the spring base and therefore not is compressed. However, eventhough the illustrated embodiment is a little imprecise, the shield is at least slightly compressed in this state.

During the helical movement of the shield, the first transverse surface portion <b>214</b>.<b>1</b> of the proximal guide of the shield and the transverse surface portion <b>272</b>.<b>1</b> are brought into abutment, and during the pure rotational movement the shield slides relative to the connector until abutment between the axial portion <b>276</b>.<b>1</b> of the axially extending portion <b>276</b> and the axial portion <b>214</b>.<b>2</b> of the proximal guide.
