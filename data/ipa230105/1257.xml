SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an adjustable weight lifting device.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">My U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,206,274, 8,529,415, 8,715,143, 8,784,283, 8,932,188, 9,452,312, 9,566,465, 9,616,271, 9,669,252, 9,889,331, 9,974,994, 10,232,214, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/861,069 show features of adjustable weight lifting devices and are incorporated by reference. A common feature of these adjustable weight lifting devices is that a handle assembly is seated in a rack and, upon rotation of a portion of the handle assembly relative to another portion of the handle assembly, pins can be extended from the handle assembly to lock weight disks to the handle assembly, or can be retracted from the weight disks to unlock weight disks from the handle assembly.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">I have discovered that it is desirable to improve the manner in which weight disks are secured to a handle assembly in such adjustable weight lifting devices. It is, additionally, desirable to permit greater numbers of weight disks to be secured to a handle assembly. I have further discovered that it is desirable to provide a simple, inexpensive technique for indicating how much weight is being held on a handle assembly, and, further to permit indication of how much weight is being held on the handle assembly even though a rotating portion of the handle is rotated through more than 360 degrees.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to an aspect of the present invention, an adjustable weight lifting device comprises a tube, a pin movably disposed inside the tube, the pin comprising an external thread, and one or more driving knobs extending radially inward relative to an inner wall of the tube and engaging with the external thread, wherein the external thread comprises at least one portion having a first helix angle and at least one portion having a second helix angle, the second helix angle being smaller than the first helix angle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to another aspect of the present invention, an adjustable weight lifting device, comprises a tube, a housing having an axially inner portion nonrotatably attached to the tube at a first end of the tube and an axially outer portion that is rotatable relative to the axially inner portion, the axially inner portion comprising an axially inner portion face gear facing the axially outer portion and the axially outer portion having an axially outer portion face gear facing the axially inner portion, an index ring comprising an exterior surface provided with indicia and an inner surface, and one or more gears or cogwheels mounted on the inner surface of the index ring for rotation about one or more corresponding radially extending axes, each radially extending axis being perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the index ring and each gear or cogwheel meshing with the axially inner portion face gear and the axially outer portion face gear.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to another aspect of the present invention, an adjustable weight lifting device, comprises a tube, a cylindrical member disposed in the tube, the tube and the cylindrical member being rotatable relative to each other and axially fixed relative to each other, a first housing having an axially inner portion nonrotatably attached to the tube at a first end of the tube and an axially outer portion nonrotatably attached to the cylindrical member at a first end of the cylindrical member, and a second housing having an axially inner portion nonrotatably attached to the tube at a second end of the tube and an axially outer portion nonrotatably attached to the cylindrical member at a second end of the cylindrical member.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of

invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The illustrated weight lifting device <b>21</b> is a dumbbell; however, the weight lifting device may alternatively be a device such as a barbell. The weight lifting device <b>21</b> includes a handle assembly <b>23</b>, a plurality of weight disks <b>25</b> removably attachable to the handle assembly, a pair of butterfly weight disks <b>27</b> removably attachable to the handle assembly, and a rack <b>29</b> in which the weight disks, butterfly weight disks, and handle assembly are adapted to be supported.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i></figref>, the handle assembly <b>23</b> comprises a tube <b>31</b> that is intended for a user to grip as a handle. An exterior surface of the tube <b>31</b> is typically knurled for improved grip. A first pin <b>33</b> is movably disposed inside the tube <b>31</b> and comprises an external thread <b>35</b>. A second pin <b>37</b> is also movably disposed inside the tube <b>31</b> and comprises an external thread <b>39</b>. The first pin <b>33</b> has a first hand and the second pin <b>37</b> has a second hand opposite the first hand. As illustrated, the first pin <b>33</b> has a left-hand thread <b>35</b> and the second pin <b>37</b> has a right-hand thread <b>39</b>. The external threads <b>35</b> and <b>39</b> can each comprise at least one portion <b>35</b>&#x2032; and <b>39</b>&#x2032;, respectively, having a first helix angle and at least one portion <b>35</b>&#x2033; and <b>39</b>&#x2033;, respectively, having a second helix angle, the second helix angle being smaller than the first helix angle. Ordinarily, there will be a plurality of such portions with different helix angles, with one thread portion with one helix angle succeeding another thread portion with the other helix angle repeating over the length of the external threads.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The first pin <b>33</b> and the second pin <b>37</b> each have a recess <b>41</b> along at least a majority of a length of each of the first pin and the second pin. A cylindrical member <b>45</b> is disposed in the recesses <b>41</b> of the first pin <b>33</b> and the second pin <b>37</b>. The first pin <b>33</b> and the second pin <b>37</b> are ordinarily half-circular along the majority of the lengths of their exteriors, and the recesses <b>41</b> are also ordinarily half-circular and formed in a flat face <b>47</b> and <b>49</b>, respectively, of the first pin and the second pin, respectively. The cylindrical member <b>45</b> is ordinarily circular or of any other suitable shape, typically matching a shape of the recesses <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">One or more driving knobs <b>51</b> (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>) extend radially inward relative to an inner wall of the tube <b>31</b> and engage with the external threads <b>35</b> and <b>39</b>. Preferably, four driving knobs <b>51</b> are provided for engaging with external threads <b>35</b> on the first pin <b>33</b> and four driving knobs are provided for engaging with external threads <b>39</b> on the second pin <b>37</b>.
