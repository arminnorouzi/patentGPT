Conventional blenders generally include a base with a motor, a mixing container with an operable mixing blade disposed therein. A blender lid is adapted to cover the mixing container. A user inserts contents within the mixing container to be mixed by the rotation of the blade. The container is positioned on the base as a user controls the operation of the motor within the base to rotate the mixing blade within the container to mix the contents therein.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It may be desirable to generally prevent the mixing blades from rotating when the blender lid is completely removed from the container. Interlock systems may be utilized to attempt to prevent the mixing blades from rotating when the blender lid is not positioned on the container. These interlock systems generally prevent the operation of the rotation of the mixing blade unless the blender lid is covering the mixing container. Known blending interlock systems have been disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 8,403,556 to Wu to include a latch cover mechanism with a link rod and a compression spring in communication with a power circuit control switch in the base of the blender. Additionally, U.S. Pat. No. 8,702,300 to Audette discloses a blending apparatus having a container, a lid for covering the container, and an attachment within the container. The attachment engages the lid and a drive member at the base of the blender to actuate a motor once the lid is secured to the container.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, known blender interlocks require a physical connection between the lid and the motor. These interlocks generally include a system of mechanical arms, links, springs or other attachments that prevent the user from operating the motor to rotate the mixing blade unless the blender lid is secured onto the container. Generally, known blender system interlocks are subject to damage or failure caused by the vibrations of the operating motor, normal ware, users, or the like. These interlock mechanisms can fail and cause a false actuation, giving a signal the blender lid is in place when, in fact, it is not. Further still, these mechanical systems may be difficult to clean.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, mechanical interlock systems take up extra space for mechanical connection paths and these connection paths may not allow for sufficient vibration isolation or damping.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, traditional blender systems may be designed to utilize a particular blending container with a particular blending base. For example, a blender base may have a dedicated blending container that is designed to attach to the blender base. If a user attaches the wrong blending container to the blender base, then the blender may not function properly. This can lead to spilled contents, excess noise, improper functioning of the blades, or the like.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, a need exists for improved blender systems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A blender system may include a blender base and a container that is operably engaged with the base, where the container includes an open end. A lid may be configured to be selectively attached to the container to cover the open end. The blender base may include a motor that operatively engages a blade assembly disposed within the container. The container may comprise a near field communications (NFC) chip that may receive power and communicate with an NFC component of a blender base when the container and the blender base are interlocked.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A method for operating a blender system is described herein. The method may include providing a blender base with a first NFC component disposed therein, and providing a container with a second NFC component disposed therein. The method may further include determining whether the container and the blender base are interlocked based on identifying whether the first NFC component receives a response from the second NFC component. In another aspect, the method may include receiving instructions from the second NFC component for operation of a motor of the blender base.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present teachings may be better understood by reference to the following detailed description taken in connection with the following illustrations, wherein.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a front view of an embodiment of a blender system in a non-interlocked state in accordance with the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a front view of the blender system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> in an interlocked state in accordance with the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a front view of a blending system including a container comprising an NFC component in accordance with various disclosed aspects;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a function block diagram of a blending system including one or more sensors disposed within a container in accordance with various disclosed aspects;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is front view of a blending system including a lid comprising an NFC component in accordance with various disclosed aspects;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is front view of a blending system including one or more visual display elements coupled to an NFC component in accordance with various disclosed aspects;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is front view of a blending system including one or more reed switches in accordance with various disclosed aspects;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is front view of a blending system including one or more NFC components arranged in series in accordance with various disclosed aspects;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a partial, cross-sectional view of a blending system including a container NFC component, a base NFC component, and a motor;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a method of operating a blender system in accordance with various disclosed embodiments;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a method of operating a blender system comprising container, base, and lid in accordance with various disclosed embodiments; and</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is front view of a blending system including a single serving container comprising an NFC component in accordance with various disclosed aspects.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the present teachings, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

The blending container may be powered in any appropriate manner, such as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/213,557, entitled Powered Blending Container, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, while blending of &#x201c;ingredients,&#x201d; &#x201c;contents&#x201d; or &#x201c;foodstuffs&#x201d; is described by various embodiments, it is noted that non-food stuff may be mixed or blended, such as paints, epoxies, construction material (e.g., mortar, cement, etc.), and the like. Moreover, blending of ingredients may result in a blended product. Such blended products may include drinks, frozen drinks, smoothies, shakes, soups, purees, sorbets, butter (nut), dips or the like. Accordingly, such terms may be used interchangeably unless context suggests otherwise or warrants a particular distinction among such terms. Further, such terms are not intended to limit possible blended products and should be viewed as examples of possible blended products.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In embodiments, the blending systems may include any household blender and/or any type of commercial blending system, including those with covers that may encapsulate or partially encapsulate the blender. Commercial blending systems may include an overall blending system, such as a modular blending system that may include the blender along with other components, such as a cleaner, foodstuff storage device (including a refrigerator), an ice maker and/or dispenser, a foodstuff dispenser (a liquid or powder flavoring dispenser) or any other combination of such.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As used herein, the phrases &#x201c;blending process,&#x201d; &#x201c;blending program,&#x201d; and the like are used interchangeably unless context suggest otherwise or warrants a particular distinction among such terms. A blending process may comprise a series or sequence of blender settings and operations to be carried out by the blending device. In an aspect, a blending process may comprise at least one motor speed and at least one time interval for the given motor speed. For example, a blending process may comprise a series of blender motor speeds to operate the blender blade at the given speed, a series of time intervals corresponding to the given motor speeds, and other blender parameters and timing settings. The blending process may further include a ramp up speed that defines the amount of time the motor takes to reach its predetermined motor speed. The blending process may be stored on a memory and recalled by or communicated to the blending device.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A blending system with interlocking capabilities is described herein. In an aspect, embodiments generally include a blender base (housing a motor), a near field communication (NFC) component(s), a container, and a lid. In an aspect, the blender system can determine whether the blender base, container, and lid are &#x201c;interlocked&#x201d; (e.g., they are in an operative position whereby a user is prevented from contacting the blades). The NFC components disposed in at least one of the blender base, container, or lid. When the blender system is fully connected, the near field communication components may interact with each other. The interaction may allow operation of a motor and rotation of the blades within the container.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The terms &#x201c;identification tag,&#x201d; &#x201c;chip,&#x201d; &#x201c;NFC component,&#x201d; and the like may be used interchangeably, unless context suggests otherwise or warrants a particular distinction among such terms. Such may refer to an NFC component or tag, which may be capable of sending/receiving a signal. It is noted that embodiments may utilize other radio frequency identification (RFID) devices, transponders, or tags. Accordingly, embodiments reference NFC for brevity, but such embodiments may utilize other RFID devices, methods, or systems. It is further noted that RFID tags may be chosen based on a frequency (e.g., low frequency RFID tags for close communication). Identification tags may comprise printable RFID tags, NFC tags, tags including microchips, or the like. Identification tags can contain stored information, such as in a memory (e.g., read-only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), or various other types of memory). In another aspect, an identification tag may be powered by electromagnetic induction from magnetic fields produced by a reader. For instance, an identification tag may include an NFC component that uses induction between two loop antennas located within the container's near field, effectively forming an air-core transformer. The antennas may comprise various materials, such as copper. While an air-core transformer is described, various other antenna formations may be utilized.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an example, an NFC component may include an NFC tag and an NFC emitter. The NFC tag and NFC emitter may each include one or more antennas. For instance, the NFC tag may include a loop antenna and the NFC emitter may include another loop antenna. It is noted that the loop antennas may or may not be substantially similar to each other. The NFC tag antenna and NFC emitter antenna may be operatively coupled via an electromagnetic field. The coupling may form or represent an air-core coil or transformer. The NFC emitter may generate an alternating current that may be received by the NFC emitter antenna. The current may induce an electromagnetic field through the air or another carrier medium. The electromagnetic field may induce a current in the NFC tag antenna. The received current may provide power to various components of the NFC tag.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In various embodiments, an NFC tag may include the antenna (e.g., inlay), a processor, and a memory device. The memory device may include various types of memory, such as electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) and the likes. When the NFC tag is powered (e.g., current induced by the electromagnetic field), the NFC tag may generate a response that may be received by the NFC emitter.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As described herein, the identification tag may be a passive transponder that collects energy from interrogating radio waves and/or may include a local power source such as a battery.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As such, an identification tag and a reader may be configured as a passive reader active tag (PRAT) system, active reader passive tag (ARPT) system, an active reader active tag (ARAT) system, or the like.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In another aspect, an identification tag may power various components or devices. For example, an NFC component may power a digital display and/or interface of a container. In embodiments, the identification tag may be configured to operate and/or communicate with a reader when within a threshold distance. For instance, an identification tag may communicate with a reader when the identification tag is less than or equal to j units from the reader, where j is a number and the unit is a unit of distance. In an example, the identification tag may operate when it is less than or about six centimeters from the reader, when it is less than or about one meter from the reader, etc.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Some traditional blender systems include a container that interlocks with a blender base via mechanical actuators. For example, a push rod or arm of a container may physically press a button of, or lock with, the blender base. Such blender systems may be prone to damage and failure. Additionally, the added mechanical actuators add to the size of blender systems.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In another aspect, containers may have an expected lifetime. The lifetime may be based on the amount of blending cycles, the total time spent blending, or the like. Traditional blender systems have no way of determining or tracking this information. For example, a restaurant may own multiple containers that may be utilized for a blender base. This allows the restaurant employees to make drinks or other products in one container, then make a drink in a different container while the first container is being cleaned. Traditional blending devices cannot determine if multiple containers are utilized. Thus, users cannot know the amount of use associated with a container. This may be beneficial if a container needs to be serviced after a pre-determined number of cycles&#x2014;keeping track of the cycles may allow a notification to be produced to service the applicable container.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Aspects of systems, apparatuses or processes described herein generally relate to blending or mixing systems include a blending container that may comprise an NFC component. The NFC component may be embedded into the container, attached to the container, or otherwise coupled with the container. The container may be placed on or connected to a blender base. The blender base may communicate and/or power the NFC component. Powering the NFC component may allow the NFC component to communicate with a processor within the blender base. For example, the processor may communicate with the NFC component to determine whether the container and blender base are interlocked, determine a container identification (ID) and/or characteristics (e.g., make/model), etc.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, there depicted is a front view of a blending system <b>100</b> in a non-interlocked state <b>102</b> and an interlocked state <b>104</b>. The blending system <b>100</b> may primarily include a base <b>110</b>, a container <b>120</b>, and a lid <b>130</b>. The base <b>110</b> may be any appropriate size and configuration. The base <b>110</b> may house and generally protect the operative components of the blending system <b>100</b>, such as a motor, fan, controllers, circuitry, human interfaces (e.g., touch screen, LED or LCD displays, lights, buttons, knobs, dials, or other actuators), and the like. As illustrated, the base <b>110</b> may include a control panel <b>114</b> positioned on a face of the base <b>110</b> such that a user may interact with the control panel <b>114</b>. The control panel <b>114</b> may be of any appropriate configuration and may allow a user to set the operative condition of the blending system <b>100</b>. It will be appreciated that the control panel <b>114</b> may include one or more human interfaces.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Container <b>120</b> may include and/or be coupled with an agitator or blade assembly <b>122</b>. The blade assembly <b>122</b> may be of appropriate configurations and may operatively rotate within the container <b>120</b> (e.g., via a motor). For instance, a user may place foodstuff in the container <b>120</b> to allow blade assembly <b>122</b> to chop, mix, blend, or otherwise interact with the foodstuff.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In interlocked state <b>104</b>, the container <b>120</b>, base <b>110</b>, and lid <b>130</b> may be interconnected in an appropriate manner. For instance, lid <b>130</b> may be attached or coupled to an open end <b>124</b> of container <b>120</b>. According to an embodiment, the lid <b>130</b> may be press-fit (e.g., friction fit) within or about the open end <b>124</b>, twisted (e.g., via threaded members), latched, or otherwise connected with the open end <b>124</b>. It is noted that lid <b>130</b> and container <b>120</b> may be coupled via various other means, including magnetic means, VELCRO, mechanical fasteners, or the like.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Furthermore, container <b>120</b> may be attached to or otherwise operatively engaged with the base <b>110</b>. In at least one embodiment, base <b>110</b> may include protrusions <b>112</b> that guide the alignment of container <b>120</b>. It is noted that the container <b>120</b> may be attached to the base by threaded members, fasteners, press-fit geometries, magnetic means, or the like. In at least one embodiment, the weight of container <b>120</b> may provide sufficient force to maintain a connection between base <b>110</b> and container <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Blade assembly <b>122</b> may include a splined shaft that operatively engages with a splined coupling of the base <b>110</b>. For instance, when the container <b>120</b> is operatively placed on base <b>110</b>, the splined coupling receives the splined shaft, which depends downwardly from the bottom of the container <b>120</b>. A motor may drive the splined coupling that, in turn, drives the splined shaft. Driving of the splined shaft causes rotation of the blade assembly <b>122</b> within the container <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the non-interlocked state <b>102</b>, the container <b>120</b> is not operatively connected to at least one of the lid <b>130</b> or base <b>110</b>. It is noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts the container <b>120</b> as not operatively connected to both the lid <b>130</b> and base <b>110</b>. According to embodiments, the blending system <b>100</b> may prevent or prohibit operation of the motor when in the non-interlocked state <b>102</b> and may allow or enable operation of the motor when in the interlocked state <b>104</b>. Alternatively or additionally, when in the interlocked state <b>104</b>, the blade assembly <b>122</b> may be prevented from rotating.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Embodiments will be described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>. It is noted that the configurations of base <b>110</b>, container <b>120</b>, and lid <b>130</b> are provided for reference and example. As such, various other configurations are within the scope and spirit of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, there is a front view of a blender system <b>200</b> that may comprise an NFC interlocking mechanism in accordance with various disclosed aspects. The blender system <b>200</b> may include a blender base <b>210</b> and a container <b>230</b>. The blender base <b>210</b> and the container <b>230</b> may comprise NFC component <b>214</b> and NFC component <b>234</b>, respectively. As described herein, NFC components <b>214</b>/<b>234</b> may comprise transceivers, receivers, memory devices, a processor or the like.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Container <b>230</b> and blender base <b>210</b> may each include one or more NFC components. For instance, the blender base <b>210</b> may include k NFC components and container <b>230</b> may include i NFC components, where k and i are numbers. While embodiments may refer to one or more NFC components for brevity, it is noted that container <b>230</b> may comprise i, and blender base <b>210</b> may comprise k NFC transmitters and/or receivers that are coupled to an NFC component. Moreover, an NFC component may be comprise on one or more silicon wafers, printed circuit boards, flexible circuit boards, or the like.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In at least one embodiment, the NFC component <b>214</b> may be disposed at various locations of the blender base <b>210</b>. For instance, blender base <b>210</b> may include a body <b>220</b>, an attachment member <b>224</b> (e.g., pedestal, attachment pad, etc.) that may include one or more protrusions <b>226</b>, and a control panel <b>228</b>. The NFC component <b>214</b> may be disposed in one or more of the body <b>220</b>, attachment member <b>224</b>, and/or control panel <b>228</b>. It is noted that that NFC component <b>214</b> may be disposed in a position that may be proximal to the NFC component <b>234</b> when the container <b>230</b> is operatively coupled with the blender base <b>210</b>. It is further noted that NFC components <b>214</b> and <b>234</b> may comprise antennas that may span a distance to allow for multiple interlocked positions. For example, NFC component <b>234</b> may comprise a loop antenna that generally circumvents a blade assembly and NFC component <b>214</b> may comprise a loop antenna that generally circumvents a coupler and/or attachment member <b>224</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">NFC component <b>234</b> may be disposed at various locations, such as at apron <b>240</b>, closed end <b>242</b>, retainer nut <b>244</b>, wall <b>246</b>, and/or within blade assembly <b>250</b>. It is noted that NFC component <b>234</b> may be disposed in other locations such as handle <b>248</b> or the like. In another aspect, NFC component <b>214</b> may be disposed within blender base <b>220</b> at a location selected such that the NFC component <b>214</b> and NFC component <b>234</b> may communicate. For instance, one or more protrusions <b>226</b> may comprise one or more NFC components <b>214</b>, and container <b>230</b> may comprise one or more NFC components <b>234</b> in apron <b>240</b>, such that the NFC components <b>214</b> and <b>234</b> may be proximal to each other when container <b>230</b> is operatively coupled to the blender base <b>210</b>. In an aspect, at least two protrusions <b>226</b> may each comprise an NFC component <b>214</b> and container <b>230</b> may comprise at least two NFC components <b>234</b>. This may ensure that container <b>230</b> is properly attached to the blender base <b>210</b> such that each of the NFC components <b>214</b> detect an NFC component <b>234</b> of the container <b>230</b>. Detecting multiple NFC components <b>234</b> may allow container <b>230</b> to be attached to blender base <b>210</b> in various operable positions.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is noted that the NFC component may be disposed in a separate device that is operatively attachable to container <b>230</b>, base <b>210</b>, and/or other portions of blender system <b>200</b>. By way of a non-limiting an example, NFC component <b>234</b> may be disposed in a disc that is selectively engageable with the retaining nut <b>244</b>. In these embodiments, the disc may be selectively attached with the retaining nut <b>244</b> (or any other appropriate portion of the container <b>230</b>) and may communicate as described herein with the NFC component <b>214</b>. This may allow an existing container to be retrofitted with the NFC component <b>234</b> to communicate with the base <b>210</b>. In examples, NFC component <b>214</b>/<b>234</b> may be embedded within a material, adhered to a material, sealed on a surface, disposed on a surface, may be removable, or the like. For example, the disc may be molded into the retaining nut <b>244</b> or a portion thereof In embodiments, sealing may include providing a protective barrier to isolate the NFC component <b>214</b>/<b>234</b> from an external atmosphere or environment, including, without sealing the NFC component <b>214</b>/<b>234</b> such that it is capable of withstanding a dish washer. For instance, exposure may allow for damage from fluid, foodstuff, or other contaminants that may corrode or otherwise harm the NFC component <b>214</b>/<b>234</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to embodiments, at least one of the NFC components <b>234</b> may be disposed near closed or proximal end <b>236</b> of container <b>230</b>. For instance, the NFC component <b>234</b> may be disposed within or proximal to apron <b>240</b> of the container <b>230</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the NFC component <b>214</b> may be proximal NFC component <b>234</b> when the container <b>230</b> is interlocked with the blender base <b>210</b>. The sensitivities and/or communication ranges of NFC component <b>214</b> and NFC component <b>234</b> may be selected such that NFC components <b>214</b> and <b>234</b> will communicate (e.g., are within range of each other) when the container <b>230</b> and blender base <b>210</b> are operatively interlocked as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, and will not communicate (e.g., are outside the range of each other) when the container <b>230</b> and blender base <b>210</b> are not interlocked, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">NFC component <b>214</b> may receive power from a power source (e.g., power mains, battery, etc.) coupled to the blender base <b>210</b>. For instance, NFC component <b>214</b> may receive power when the blender base <b>210</b> is plugged into an outlet and/or switched on. NFC component <b>214</b> may transmit a signal that may operatively excite or power the NFC component <b>234</b> when the container <b>230</b>. It is noted that the signal may be configured to excite the NFC component <b>234</b> only when the NFC component <b>234</b> is within a determined distance, such as when the container <b>230</b> is operatively interlocked with the blender base <b>210</b>. For instance, a transmitter of NFC component <b>214</b> may provide a signal at a given frequency, wherein the signal may be received by a receiver of NFC component <b>234</b>. Excitement of the NFC component <b>234</b> may elicit a response from NFC component <b>234</b> and NFC component <b>214</b> may receive the response. When the NFC component <b>214</b> receives the response, it may allow for operation of a motor. If no response is received and/or a weak response is received, the container NFC component <b>214</b> may prevent or prohibit operation of the motor. It is noted that the NFC component <b>234</b> may comprise its own power source and/or may receive power from a disparate source.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">More over, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> describes a pitcher-style container and blade assembly, it is noted that other containers may be utilized in accordance with the disclosed aspects. For instance, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, there is a blending system <b>1100</b> that may include base <b>210</b>, which may operatively receive a single serving container <b>1130</b> that may be operatively attached with a blade base <b>1140</b>. The blade base <b>1140</b> may comprise at least one NFC component <b>1134</b>, and the container <b>1130</b> may comprise an NFC component <b>1136</b>. It is further noted that the base <b>210</b> may comprise an NFC component <b>1114</b> disposed in a position that allows it to communicate with at least one of NFC component <b>1134</b>, or <b>1136</b>. In at least one embodiment, NFC components <b>1134</b> and/or <b>1136</b> may be replaced with a switch and actuator (e.g., reed switch and magnet). Moreover, system <b>1100</b> may or may not include NFC component <b>1134</b> and/or <b>1136</b>. It is noted that a &#x201c;single serving&#x201d; container does not indicate a limited use for the container, but rather refers to a differently configured container that may be attached to a blade base. Such containers may have a closed end that is generally distal from a blender base when the container, blade base, and blender base are interlocked.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, with reference to the other disclosed figures, there is a functional block diagram of a blender system <b>300</b>. It is noted that like-named components of systems <b>300</b> and <b>200</b> may comprise similar aspects and/or functionality. For instance, base <b>210</b> and base <b>310</b> may comprise similar aspects and/or may comprise the same base. It is further noted that system <b>300</b> may comprise other or additional components, such as a second container.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Base <b>310</b> may comprise a memory <b>302</b>, a processor <b>304</b>, an NFC component <b>314</b> and a motor <b>312</b>. The motor <b>312</b> may operatively drive a blade assembly (e.g., blade assembly <b>250</b>). Memory <b>302</b> may store computer executable instructions. Processor <b>304</b> may facilitate execution of the computer executable instructions. According to embodiments, memory <b>302</b> may store blender processes or programs. For example, a user may select a desired blending program via control panel <b>226</b>, such as a &#x201c;soup&#x201d; program. The memory <b>302</b> may store the blending program, which may comprise blender settings and operations to be carried out by the motor <b>312</b> to make a soup. The processor <b>304</b> may receive the blending program from memory <b>302</b> and may generate instructions for the motor <b>312</b> and/or other components (e.g., a display&#x2014;not shown) based on the blending program. It is noted that the memory <b>302</b> may store any number of blending programs, including user-defined programs.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to one or more embodiments, the base <b>310</b> may include NFC component <b>314</b> that may communicate with NFC components of one or more other devices. For instance, NFC component <b>314</b> may communicate with NFC component <b>334</b> of container <b>330</b>, an NFC component of user device <b>320</b>, or the like. When NFC component <b>334</b> is within a predefined range (e.g., distance) from NFC component <b>314</b>, the base <b>310</b> and container <b>330</b> may communicate. As described herein, the NFC component <b>334</b> may be configured such it is within an operable range when container <b>330</b> and base <b>310</b> are interlocked, and it is outside the operable range when the container <b>330</b> and the base <b>310</b> are not interlocked. When in the operable range, NFC component <b>314</b> may power NFC component <b>334</b> to elicit a response, such as to indicate whether the system is interlocked or to request data.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In at least one embodiment, NFC component <b>334</b> may comprise a memory device that may store blending program(s) and/or instructions associated with blending programs (e.g., instructions modifying blending programs). These blending programs may be specific to container <b>330</b>. For example, a single serving container may be associated with different blending programs than a full sized container (e.g., container <b>230</b>, pitcher-type container). Identification of the container may ensure that system <b>300</b> does not run blending programs designed for a full sized for a single serving container and vice versa. In another aspect, when a user interlocks container <b>330</b> with base <b>310</b>, the NFC component <b>334</b> may provide the program to NFC component <b>314</b>. In an aspect, processor <b>304</b> may facilitate storage of the program in memory <b>302</b> and/or may instruct the motor <b>312</b> to execute the program directly from the received instructions/program (e.g., without storing the program in memory <b>302</b>). It is noted that the NFC chip <b>334</b> may store information that identifies compatible programs without storing the program itself. Such programs may be stored within base <b>310</b>, and base <b>310</b> may enable/disable the availability of programs based on information received from NFC chip <b>334</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In an example, base <b>310</b> may be configured to interact with a certain make/model of a container <b>330</b>. For instance, at some point after a user initially acquires blender system <b>300</b>, a new blade or container shape may be created. A user may purchase the new blade/container for use with the base <b>310</b>. The new blade/container may be designed for specific blending programs, which may be different from blending programs stored by the base <b>310</b>. For instance, the new blade/container may allow for completion of a blending process in less time than previous blending programs. Once purchased, the user may place the new container on the base <b>310</b> and the new container (e.g., via an NFC component) may provide one or more programs and/or sets of instructions to the base <b>310</b>. The base <b>310</b> (e.g., via processor <b>304</b>) may alter previous blending programs, add new blending programs, or otherwise update stored blending programs based on the new instructions/blending programs. It is noted that the base <b>310</b> may update the blending programs upon detecting container <b>330</b> and/or in response to user instructions. For example, the base <b>310</b> may automatically update programs (e.g., without user intervention) or may update the programs when a user instructs the base <b>310</b> to do so. Further, the new container may include a new and/or different blade assembly from the previous version used with the base <b>310</b>. The new container (e.g., via an NFC component) may provide one or more programs and/or sets of instructions to the base <b>310</b> based upon the blade assembly being utilized.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to another aspect, the base <b>310</b> may identify container <b>330</b>. Identifying container <b>330</b> may include identifying a make, model, a particular container (e.g., via a unique identifier), blade assembly utilized in the container, or the like. In an example, identifying the container may include determining a match between received data and data stored in memory <b>302</b>. For example, a set of identifiers may be stored in a table or other data structure in memory <b>302</b>. The NFC component <b>314</b> may receive an identifier from NFC component <b>334</b> and/or decode data received therefrom to determine an identifier. The identifier may then be compared to stored identifiers. It is noted that blender base <b>314</b> may communicate with user device <b>320</b> to access a communication network (e.g., a cloud) and/or components of the user device <b>320</b>. For instance, the user device <b>320</b> may store container IDs.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In embodiments, a container ID may be associated with a container profile. The container profile may include characteristics or parameters of a blending container. For instance, the container profile may include information such as make and model of the blending container, weight of the blending container (e.g., with and without a lid, attachments, and the likes), compatible blender bases, size of the blending container (e.g., capacity, height, volume, etc.), interlock of the blending container, blades utilized with the container, color, name of the blending container, date purchased, date profile was created, and the likes. The container profile may store a history of use associated with a blending container as described herein.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In another aspect, the base <b>310</b> (or another receiver device) may verify whether the container <b>330</b> is compatible with the base <b>310</b> based on information received from the NFC component <b>334</b>. For instance, the NFC component <b>334</b> may store a list of blenders (e.g., makes, models, etc.) to which container <b>330</b> is compatible, parameters of the container <b>330</b> (e.g., make/model), or the like. Base <b>310</b> (e.g., via processor <b>304</b>) may receive the parameters and/or query the NFC component <b>334</b> to determine whether the container <b>330</b> is compatible with the base <b>310</b>. If the container <b>330</b> is compatible with base <b>310</b>, then base <b>310</b> may allow operation of motor <b>312</b>. If the container <b>330</b> is not compatible with the base <b>310</b>, then the base <b>310</b> may disable or prevent certain operations, such as activation of a motor <b>312</b> and/or a blade assembly. In at least one embodiment, the base <b>310</b> may determine whether container <b>330</b> is properly attached, such as by determining a proximity of the container <b>330</b> and the base <b>310</b>. Thus, a blender system may prevent spillage of contents, improper functioning of the blades, or the like.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In another aspect, the system <b>300</b> may prevent use of improper or undesirable container and base combinations. It is noted that identification of a container <b>330</b> may allow base <b>310</b> to verify the container to prevent improper containers (e.g., counterfeit) from being utilized, determine whether processes are compatible with a container, or the like. For example, if an authorized or improper container is detected by the base <b>310</b>, the motor <b>312</b> may be prevented from operating, which in turns prevents the blades from turning.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">System <b>300</b> may track a history of use associated with container <b>330</b>. Traditional systems do not track use of a container. Some systems may track use of a blender base, but users may utilize different containers for a given blender base. Tracking the use of a blender base does not indicate the use of the containers as the containers may be interchanged with blender bases. In commercial kitchens, users typically utilize multiple containers for one or more blender bases. This allows the user to prevent cross contamination of ingredients from different blending processes and may allow the users to make multiple products quicker than they could with only one container per blender base. Disclosed embodiments may track the use of each container and/or use of each blender base. For instance, NFC component <b>334</b> may store information associated with run time, cycles used, last date/time of use, types of programs run, or the like. The NFC component <b>334</b> may monitor the use and facilitate storage of the use via a memory device. In an example, when the NFC component <b>334</b> is powered, it may keep track and store on-time or run-time as a flag can be set when the motor <b>312</b> is running. It is noted that base <b>310</b>, user device <b>320</b>, or another device may additionally or alternatively store use information associated with the containers.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In another example, the blender base <b>330</b> (e.g., via processor <b>304</b>) may provide instructions to the NFC component <b>334</b> to facilitate updating (e.g., replacing) the historical use data. For instance, the blender base <b>330</b> may transmit, via NFC component <b>314</b>, instructions or data that may cause NFC component <b>334</b> to update historical data stored on the container upon occurrence of a triggering event. A triggering event may include the end of each blending process, at intervals during a blending process, prior to container <b>330</b> being removed, when container is placed on the base <b>310</b>, or upon user action (e.g., user manually changes a blending process, etc.).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In at least one described embodiment, user device <b>320</b> may receive usage data associate with container <b>330</b>. The usage data may be received via NFC communication, such as from container <b>330</b> and/or base <b>310</b>. In some embodiments, the base <b>310</b> may communicate with user device <b>320</b> via other wireless or wired communication mechanisms (e.g., Wi-Fi, hard-wired, BLUETOOTH&#x2122;, etc.). For instance, base <b>310</b> may send container usage data to user device <b>320</b>. In an example, user device <b>320</b> may be a tablet, computer, or other device of a commercial kitchen (e.g., restaurant, caf&#xe9;, bistro, etc.). A worker of the commercial kitchen may receive the usage statistics and may select a container having less use compared to other containers. This may allow the commercial kitchen to prevent or manage overuse of a certain container. In another aspect, it may allow the users to determine when to replace a container.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As described herein, user device <b>320</b> may communicate with base <b>310</b> and/or container <b>330</b>. For instance, user device <b>320</b> may comprise an NFC component disposed therein. A user may tap (e.g., place within a coverage area) the user deice <b>320</b> with container <b>330</b> and/or base <b>310</b>. As an example, the NFC component of the user device <b>320</b> may communicate with the container <b>330</b> and may receive usage data, container parameters (e.g., type, make, model, etc.), or other appropriate data. As an illustrative example, a user may wish to order a replacement container or a replacement part for a container, such as a replacement tamper. Traditionally, the user would have to know a make/model of the container to order the replacement. Here, the user device <b>320</b> may communicate with the container <b>330</b> and the user device <b>320</b> may automatically direct a user to a website or provide instructions that enable the user to order replacement parts. Thus, the user need not know the make/model of the container.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In another aspect, a user device <b>320</b> may update information stored by the container <b>330</b> and/or base <b>310</b>. For instance, a user may download, create, or otherwise access a recipe via the user device <b>320</b>. The user may utilize the user device <b>320</b> to instruct the container <b>330</b> and/or base <b>310</b> to update blender programs or identification information. As another example, the user may alter identification information associate with the container <b>330</b> and/or base <b>310</b>. For instance, the user may identify a specific container <b>330</b> as containing, having contained, or utilized for nuts. When a user places the container <b>330</b> on the base <b>310</b>, the base <b>310</b> may recognize the container <b>330</b> and display (e.g., via a screen, LED, etc.) information identifying the container as containing, having contained, or utilized for nuts.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, with reference to the other figures, there is a blender system <b>400</b> that may include a container with an NFC component and one or more sensors. It is noted that like-named components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b></figref> may comprise similar or identical aspects. For example, blender base <b>210</b> and blender base <b>410</b> may comprise the same or a similar blender base.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">System <b>400</b> may include container blender base <b>410</b>, container <b>430</b>, and lid <b>460</b>. As illustrated, container <b>434</b> may include NFC component <b>434</b> that may be configured to communicate with NFC component <b>414</b> of blender base <b>410</b>. In an aspect, NFC component <b>444</b> may be disposed within retainer nut <b>444</b> and NFC component <b>414</b> may be disposed within attachment member <b>424</b>. NFC component <b>434</b> may be coupled with one or more sensors <b>432</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>432</b><sub>2</sub>. Sensors <b>432</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>432</b><sub>2 </sub>may be disposed within various portions of container <b>430</b>. It is noted that any number of sensors may be utilized and/or comprised within various components. For instance, a first sensor <b>432</b><sub>1 </sub>may be disposed within blade assembly <b>450</b> and a second sensor <b>432</b><sub>2 </sub>may be disposed within a wall <b>446</b> of container <b>430</b>. It is further noted that the sensors <b>432</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>432</b><sub>2 </sub>may be coupled to NFC component <b>434</b> via a wired connection, such as bus <b>454</b>. In another aspect, the sensors <b>432</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>432</b><sub>2 </sub>may be coupled to the NFC component <b>434</b> (and/or NFC component <b>414</b>) via a wireless connection. According to an example, the sensors <b>432</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>432</b><sub>2 </sub>may comprise NFC components that may be powered (e.g., directly or indirectly) by NFC component <b>414</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The sensors <b>432</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>432</b><sub>2 </sub>may include temperature sensors, motions sensors, audio sensors, or the like. NFC component <b>434</b> may receive data from the sensors <b>432</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>432</b><sub>2 </sub>and may transmit the sensor output to the blender base <b>410</b>, such as via NFC component <b>414</b>. In an example, one or more of sensors <b>432</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>432</b><sub>2 </sub>may measure temperature of a mixture from inside of the container <b>430</b>. The temperature may be communicated to the NFC component <b>414</b>. When then temperature reaches a desired threshold or temperature range, the blender base <b>410</b> may advance a blending program. For instance, a user may add ingredients for a soup recipe. The user may then select a soup setting (and/or a desired temperature). As the ingredients are blended and/or heated, the one or more sensors <b>432</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>432</b><sub>2 </sub>may measure the temperature within the container <b>430</b>. When a desired temperature is reached, the blender base <b>410</b> may end the blending process.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In another example, the blender base <b>410</b> may utilize the temperature in the container in a feedback loop to control the speed, fluid shear and friction heating. This may be used to keep a mixture at a certain temperature. For example, in response to determining that a mixture exceeds a threshold or temperature limit (e.g., maximum, minimum, etc.), the blender base <b>410</b> may alter (e.g., reduce, increase, etc.) the speed of the blade assembly <b>450</b>. The altered speed may result in altered friction heating to allow for temperature control of the mixture. It is noted that the blender base <b>410</b> may receive multiple temperature readings from different sensors. The blender base <b>410</b> may utilize the multiple readings to determine a temperature (e.g., average, etc.).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">One or more of sensors <b>432</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>432</b><sub>2 </sub>may include motion sensors (e.g., gyroscopes, accelerometers, etc.), sound sensors, or the like. Such sensors <b>432</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>432</b><sub>2 </sub>may be utilized, for example, to determine the end of a blending program and/or a stage in a blending program. According to an embodiment, blender base <b>410</b> may determine to advance in a blending program when sensors <b>432</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>432</b><sub>2 </sub>reach a steady state indicating that a blending program may advance. For instance, during a blending process, a mixture within the container <b>430</b> may transition through several stages or states. These states may be associated with particular motions (or set of motions), sounds, or the like. In an example, a user may add ingredients to the container <b>430</b>. When the user adds ingredients, the blade assembly <b>450</b> may chop or otherwise blend the ingredients. This may result in audio spikes, sudden changes in movement, or the like. In an example, a user making a soup may add a carrot into the container <b>430</b>. The blade assembly <b>450</b> will produce a chopping noise and/or cause a sudden-chop motion. These noises and/or motions may be represented by a particular output of audio and/or motion sensors (e.g., spikes, peeks, dips, etc.). As the carrots are blended with other foodstuff, the output of the sensors <b>432</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>432</b><sub>2 </sub>will eventually normalize (e.g., reach a steady or semi-steady state). When the output normalizes, the blender base <b>410</b> may determine that that a blending program may advance.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Blender system <b>400</b> may include lid <b>460</b> that may be operatively coupled to an open end <b>438</b> of container <b>430</b>. Lid <b>460</b> may include a cap <b>462</b> that may be removably attached thereto. For instance, a user may remove cap <b>462</b> to add ingredients to container <b>430</b> during a blending process. According to embodiments, lid <b>460</b> may include one or more NFC component(s) <b>464</b>. The NFC component <b>464</b> may be configured to communicate with an NFC component of the container <b>430</b> and/or blender base <b>410</b>. In an aspect, the NFC component <b>464</b> may communicate with an NFC component <b>474</b> disposed within the container <b>430</b>. It is noted that NFC component <b>464</b> may include or otherwise communicate with sensors (e.g., temperature, motion, etc.) as described herein. As described herein, embodiments may utilize various devices or methods to determine whether lid <b>460</b> is operatively coupled to container <b>430</b>, such as reed switches, magnets, or the like.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In another aspect, when container <b>430</b>, blender base <b>410</b> and lid <b>460</b> are operatively interlocked, the NFC component <b>414</b> may provide power to NFC component <b>434</b>. The NFC component <b>434</b> may be coupled to NFC component <b>474</b>, such as via bus <b>454</b>, to provide power and/or otherwise communicate therewith. Likewise, NFC component <b>464</b> may receive power from NFC component <b>474</b>. In at least one embodiment, the blender base <b>410</b> may determine whether the lid <b>460</b> is operatively coupled to the container <b>430</b>. In response to determining that the lid is not interlocked with the container, the blender base <b>410</b> may disable or otherwise prevent operation of a motor (e.g., motor <b>312</b>). Likewise, in response to determining that the lid is interlocked with the container, the blender base <b>410</b> may allow operation of the motor.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">NFC component <b>464</b> may communicate directly with NFC component <b>414</b>. For instance, NFC component <b>414</b> may be configured to power NFC component <b>464</b> when NFC component <b>464</b> is within a determined range. In an aspect, the range may be based on the height of container <b>430</b>. Thus, when lid <b>460</b> is attached to container <b>430</b>, and the container <b>430</b> is attached to base <b>410</b>, NFC component <b>414</b> may detect NFC component <b>464</b> without the need for other NFC components (e.g., NFC component <b>434</b>, <b>474</b>, etc.).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In at least one embodiment, NFC component <b>414</b> may be configured to broadcast signals at various frequencies and/or to detect NFC components at various distances.

If NFC component <b>434</b> is detected (e.g., container <b>430</b> is interlocked with blender base <b>410</b>), then NFC component <b>414</b> may broadcast a signal to power NFC component <b>464</b> (e.g., lid <b>460</b> is interlocked with the container <b>430</b>). If the lid <b>460</b> is detected, then NFC component <b>414</b> may enter a monitoring process that monitors whether the lid <b>460</b> is removed and/or is no longer within the desired range. If the lid <b>460</b> is removed from the desired range, NFC component <b>414</b> will not be able to communicate with the lid <b>460</b> and system <b>400</b> may determine that the lid <b>460</b> is not interlocked with the container <b>430</b> and/or the container <b>430</b> is not interlocked with the blender base <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, there is a blender system <b>500</b> comprising NFC communication capabilities, in accordance with various described aspects.
