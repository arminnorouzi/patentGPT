According to certain embodiments disclosed are systems that include an AR component that presents information or a stimulus and provides cranial nerve fiber stimulation (CNFS) at strategic times to reduce or otherwise modulate anxiety/arousal of a subject during user activity or scenarios and/or to reinforce learning. According to certain embodiments, scenarios are repeated or rehearsed in substantially the same manner over multiple sessions and can be performed in conjunction with measurement of physiological behavior, e.g. reduced heart rate variability (HRV, similar to hf-HRV, RSA, SDNN, RSDNN, etc.), which is reflective of anxiety or cognitive effort. The physiological response during that session can be used to determine when stimulation/modulation techniques such as vagus nerve stimulation (invasive or non-invasive) or similar methods such as trigeminal stimulation should be deployed to provide for 1) modulation of that anxiety/arousal response or 2) to facilitate neuroplasticity/learning of the less aroused state while the stimulation is applied. During subsequent sessions following an initial session, stimulation is delivered (as indicated by prior sessions physiological behavior (e.g. reduced HRV)) and is recorded and used to inform future sessions. In one example, administering central nerve fiber stimulation prior to recorded arousal time pertains to initiating central nerve fiber stimulation at a time within 1-30 mins, within 1-15 mins, or within 1-5 mins before the recorded arousal time.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">This method has advantages over closed loop approaches in the ability to deploy stimulation before arousal/anxiety manifests, i.e. in anticipation rather than in response to it.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As will be explained further herein, CNFS can be deployed in Bodyscan meditation (BM)/Progressive relaxation (PR), Guided relaxation and related methods, and also in performance enhancement applications such as sports performance (e.g. rehearsal of golf putting), defense related applications (e.g. rehearsal of shooting a rifle), as well as in the treatment of phobias (e.g. during rehearsed visualization or Virtual reality exposure therapy for fear of flying, heights, public speaking, substance abuse, etc).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="2">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The term &#x201c;cranial nerve fiber stimulation&#x201d; or &#x201c;CNFS&#x201d; refers to stimulation of one or more cranial nerves. In specific embodiments, the cranial nerve stimulated pertains to the vagus nerve, trigeminal nerve and/or hypoglossal nerve. CNFS may be applied to afferent fibers (i.e., fibers sending signals to the central nervous system (CNS)) and/or efferent fibers (i.e. fibers sending signals away from the CNS, such as to a target organ. Both peripheral and central effects can be achieved. The physiological indicators of the periphery reflect the behavior of brain systems that regulate them. Directly modifying function of peripheral systems via efferent stimulation will contribute to communication of a relaxed state to the central nervous system. Stimulation of the afferent path will influence the behavior of the brain systems that regulate the peripheral signals. Further, the CNFS can involve both sensory subthreshold and suprathreshold stimulation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The term &#x201c;autonomic nervous system&#x201d; or &#x201c;ANS&#x201d; refers to a neural control system that acts largely unconsciously and regulates bodily functions such as the heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, pupillary response, urination, and sexual arousal. The autonomic nervous system is divided into three parts: the sympathetic nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system and the enteric nervous system.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The term &#x201c;augmented reality&#x201d; or &#x201c;AR&#x201d; as used herein refers to computer controlled sensory information presented to a user. AR may comprise visual, auditory, vestibular, haptic, gustatory, olfactory, pain, temperature, kinesthetic or other sensory stimulation, secondary activities, thought processes, visual thinking, verbal thinking, emotions, medications, chemicals, physiological manipulations, neurofeedback, psychotherapy, videoconferencing, video recordings, social interaction, virtual reality (&#x201c;VR&#x201d;), or guided imagery. Typically, AR will involve simulation of a real-life event or activity and will involve provision of information via one or multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and/or olfactory.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The term &#x201c;AR component&#x201d; refers to any device that is capable of providing AR to a user. Examples of AR components may include a visual display, speaker, haptic devices including but not limited to gyroscope or vibrator component, temperature generator, pressure generator, and the like, and combinations thereof. In a specific embodiment, the AR component may comprise a biofeedback component.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The term &#x201c;biofeedback&#x201d; as used herein refers to a signal, such as electrical, audible, visual, or sensory, that is delivered to a user in response to a previous action taken by the user. Biofeedback is typically utilized in an effort to train the user to exert some level of control over an involuntary body function such as heart rate, brain waves, anxiety and muscle tension, or other physiological functions.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The term &#x201c;biofeedback component&#x201d; is a component that provides biofeedback to a user.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The term &#x201c;physiological parameter&#x201d; refers to any measurable or detectable physiological indicator of a subject. Examples of physiological parameters include, but are not limited to heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), temperature, neural activity (e.g. EEG, ECG), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), galvanic skin response (GSR) respiratory hippus variability (RHV) and gastric movement, e.g.,via use of electrogastrography (EGG) or other techniques to determine gut motility. Physiological parameters may also include respiration, respiratory variability, blood pressure, blood pressure variability, pulse wave size, slope, etc, pulse variability, body tonicity (alteration in body movement), tremor/repetitive motor activity, pilo-erection, reproductive organ behavior, EGG: Electrogastrogram (and other measures of gastric movement), fMRI, EEG and other measures of direct neural behavior. Physiological parameters can also include skin temperature change or skin conductance.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The term &#x201c;physiological parameter monitoring component&#x201d; as used herein refers to any sensor and/or device that is capable of detecting and/or monitoring a physiological parameter. Examples of physiological parameter monitoring components include, but are not limited to, a pulse oximeter, photoplethysmography sensor, ECG/EKG sensor, EEG sensor, EMG sensor, respiratory sensor, acoustic sensor (e.g. microphone), camera, EGG sensor, accelerometer, thermometer, electrodes, and the like.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The term &#x201c;user activity output&#x201d; refers to any activity of the user that is not a physiological parameter. Examples of user output include user movement, user sounds, spatiotemporal positioning, and/or timing and accuracy of the foregoing. Such user activity output may include activity in response to a prompt, question, trigger, etc. whether from system (e.g. AR component) or third party, or derived indices (e.g. reaction time variability or accuracy) related to generation of a response.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The term &#x201c;user activity output monitoring component&#x201d; as used herein refers to any device and/or sensor that is capable of detecting user output. Examples of a user output monitoring component include, but are not limited to a camera, a microphone, spatiotemporal sensors, accelerometers, gyroscope, thermometer, or ultrasound.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term &#x201c;vagus stimulation&#x201d; pertains to a specific embodiment of CNFS and refers to stimulation of afferent or efferent or both fiber types of the vagus nerve. Vagus stimulation may be conducted transcutaneously ((t)VNS) or internally, i.e. implanted.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The term &#x201c;user&#x201d; refers to any human or non-human mammal to which CNFS is applied according to the teachings herein.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The term &#x201c;controller&#x201d; as used herein refers to any computing device that is capable of being programmed to conduct operative functions, as well as receiving, processing and sending electrical signals, either via wires or wirelessly. A controller may further include a timer component.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The term &#x201c;aroused state&#x201d; as used herein refers to a state where change in the physiological parameter has occurred. In some domains (e.g. RSA) normative data may exist and be used, however this may also be established in the individual based on baseline (pre-task or at another time/location) measurement of the physiological parameter. Accordingly, an aroused state may be state specific, e.g., supine, seated or standing specific; that is the measures or determination of an &#x201c;aroused state&#x201d; may vary based on body position, even when &#x201c;resting&#x201d;, which can be detected using various sensors such as accelerometer(s), gyroscopes, etc. These changes may be characterized as exhibiting a predefined range of a detected physiological parameter value, or by the magnitude or rate of change. An aroused state may also be determined by observing decreases in RSA/hf-hrv/etc., or increases in sympathetic nervous system activity (e.g. pulse amplitude, skin conductance, heart rate, measures derived from impedance cardiography&#x2014;such as pre-ejection period, blood pressure), or even subjective or behavioral indication of aroused state. In one example, administering central nerve fiber stimulation prior to recorded time of an aroused state pertains to initiating central nerve fiber stimulation at a time within 1-30 mins, within 1-15 mins, or within 1-5 mins before the recorded arousal time.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Description of Illustrated Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles and operation of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same.

System embodiment <b>400</b> strategically administers CNFS as a function of a predetermined user activity output, that does not necessarily involve AR. For example, system <b>400</b> can be especially adapted for inducing sleep or increasing quality of sleep. The user activity output monitoring component <b>24</b>&#x2032; can take the form of a tilt sensor or accelerometer or other sensor whether or not physically attached to the user (such as a sensor on a mat or bed or via non-contact sensors) that can detect the position of the user, namely whether the user <b>12</b> is in a supine position. The user activity output monitoring component <b>24</b>&#x2032; may pertain to a sensor to detect sleep initiation, time of day, light sensor, polysomnography, electroencephalograph (EEG), or subject interaction with interface to initiate sleep mode. The user <b>12</b> via a user interface <b>26</b> associated with the controller <b>20</b> can initiate the session such that the controller <b>20</b> begins sensing the position of the user <b>12</b>. Upon sensing that the user <b>12</b> is in a supine position, the controller <b>20</b> will initiate CNFS by the CNFS component <b>14</b> at a predetermined time (e.g. 10-25 min) following supine positioning. The controller <b>20</b> can be programmed to administer CNFS for predetermined time frame, or series of time frames.

Optionally, BM/PR may be assisted under guidance of another practitioner.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A user is instructed to focus on or relax successive regions of their body (e.g. head-&#x3e;face-&#x3e;neck-&#x3e;shoulders, etc.). The instructions may be pre-recorded or preprogrammed, and may provide instructions in a predetermined sequence and time sections addressing different body regions Autonomic behavior (e.g. HRV, RSA, GSR) during this behavior is monitored and biofeedback may be provided to the user. Note, autonomic activity, particularly RSA, reflect the behavior of several brain networks. Stimulation with tVNS influences these brain networks, and changes in autonomic features may reflect brain network modification. Thus autonomic behavior hereafter refers to both peripheral and brain elements. Biofeedback may or may not be provided via a biofeedback component such as a visual display of a body (avatar) that indicates ANS behavior on the avatar (see unyte.com for an example of existing software programs that involve avatar representation meditative states). This demonstrates desirable vs. not autonomic nervous system (ANS) behavior, reflecting a desired neurophysiological state. During future sessions of BM/PR, (t)VNS is applied during the guided activity bm/pr at strategic times when focus on body regions resulted in less desirable ANS responses were generated in previous sessions. In conjunction with this, the user can also identify body regions that they believe are tight or unrelaxed (e.g. pelvic region, lower back, shoulders . . . ). The (t)VNS can involve both sensory subthreshold and suprathreshold stimulation. The (t)VNS provides a tool to assist the user to relax, with the goal of eventually achieving similar relaxed states without (t)VNS.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram depicting implementation of a method for applying (t)VNS in relation to bodyscan meditation implementation. RSA is recorded <b>1000</b> over time <b>1001</b> as the subject is guided via a time coordinated guided meditation to focus on different parts of their body as indicated by <b>1002</b>. As can be seen in <b>1000</b>, the RSA drops below 5.5 In(ms)<sup>2 </sup>while the subject is focusing on their chest <b>1003</b> and their pelvic region <b>1004</b>. Also, as can be seen when the subject is guided to focus on their lower limbs the RSA curves upward back to 5.5 In(ms)<sup>2</sup>. A deviation of RSA below 5.5 In(ms)<sup>2 </sup>indicates anxiety. Based on the recording <b>1000</b>, a stimulation program is customized to address the subject's anxiety.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In session 2, <b>1005</b> shows that (t)VNS stimulation will be administered at min 4 until min 6, and at min 8 until min 15, for example. In the graph shown in <b>1006</b>, the bodyscan meditation is executed with the (t)VNS stimulation, which shows that the RSA profile is dramatically improved. The RSA is above 5.5 In(ms)<sup>2</sup>at min 4-5 and almost back above 5.5 In(ms)<sup>2 </sup>at mins 9-11.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In Session 3, the stimulation program is adjusted based on the recorded RSA results of the Session 2, where stimulation has been narrowed down to 8-11 min as shown in <b>1007</b>. As the bodyscan meditation is executed in Session 3, it can be seen in graph <b>1008</b> that the RSA levels at min 8-9 has been further improved and is above the first standard deviation below normative value (e.g. 5.5 In(ms)<sup>2</sup>). Thus, this example shows how cranial nerve stimulation coordinated with bodyscan meditation can treat people who have suffered psychological and physical trauma affecting parts of their body, such as in sexual assault situations or combat injury situations.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 2: Performance Enhancement</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The above generally described systems and methods may be provided with the goal of increasing performance of a user, and not necessarily for treating illness, pathology, disease, etc. This may be to reduce nervousness that is experienced in conjunction with certain activities such as sport activities, public speaking, or even in military training such as sniper/shooting training. It may be used for medical training to improve performance of conducting surgical procedures. Note, autonomic behavior is also affected by effort. When people have more difficulty learning or are exerting greater cognitive control (as in controlled versus autonomic processing&#x2014;see attention literature) tVNS has a learning component and may assist in acquisition of new skills. Thus, detecting signs of effortful control as indicated by reduced RSA (e.g.), may enable a learning enhancement deployment at the appropriate time of need.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In a specific example relating to sports performance, one hypothetical involves a golfer that has developed erratic putting due to pressure and fear of failure. In this situation, any of systems <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> or <b>400</b> may be implemented. The golfer is instructed to conduct their pre-shot routine while the controller tracks t<b>0</b> when the golfer starts their preshot routine and t<b>1</b> when the golfer initiates the putt. In a subsequent session, the golfer then repeats the preshot routine and the controller administers (t)VNS at a time between t<b>0</b> and t<b>1</b>. The duration of the (t)VNS can be modified to suit the routine of a given performer. The (t)VNS helps train the golfer to reduce their anxiety while they are about to initiate putts. Over the course of several sessions, the (t)VNS is reduced or ceased while the golfer is performing their preshot routine and initiating the shot. Ultimately, the golfer will be able to control their anxiety without the need for (t)VNS and utilize this during real life competition.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">It will be understood that that the system implemented for performance enhancement can incorporate any further components or substitute components described herein as needed, such as the AR component, user activity output component, and/or physiological parameter monitoring components. For example, using the golfer situation, the AR component could display a golf green, spectators, and/or competitors, as well as noises from each that would be typically experienced during competition. A user activity output component in the form of a camera could be implemented to monitor spatiotemporal positioning of the golfer during the preshot routine and initiation the shot. The controller could initiate (t)VNS via an CNFS component at a strategic time based on the motion or positioning of the golfer during their preshot routine and shot initiation. For further accuracy, a physiological parameter monitoring component could be implemented to determine at what stage of the preshot routine the golfer begins to experience an aroused state. The controller could then strategically time provision of (t)VNS to reduce arousal before the golf shot is performed.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The above golfer example is one of numerous examples where the systems described herein can be implemented to increase performance of an activity. The operation of the system can be tailored to assist performance enhancement for a given activity such as public-speaking, shooting free-throws, military shooting, or for reducing phobias such a fear of heights, swimming, entering enclosed spaces, etc.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The systems and embodiments described herein can be applied to any *regimented* relaxation practice. Not just BM/PR. For example, any guided relaxation that is based on a pre-established timeframe (e.g. a recording). It has the advantage of not simply being responsive to ANS shifts, but prospectively. The prospective nature of this stimulation delivery means that 1. It can be deployed before the shift in ANS. 2. It can be deployed without requiring multiple seconds of data to be collected for RSA/HRV measurement to be derived that would then drive CNFS. The systems and embodiments herein may be applied to address certain triggers of an aroused state, including temporal-spatial triggers. For example, If a subject is aroused as they get near an airport gate (fear of flying), the system can be deployed based on geographic information or location. The same approach could be applied to a subject who is trying to quit alcohol as they approach an alcohol serving location.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">It should be borne in mind that all patents, patent applications, patent publications, technical publications, scientific publications, and other references referenced herein are hereby incorporated by reference in this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art to which the present invention pertains.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">It is important to an understanding of the present invention to note that all technical and scientific terms used herein, unless defined herein, are intended to have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.
