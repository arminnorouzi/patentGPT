A hydrofoil operates in the same way as a wing-shaped air foil to create a lifting force and can have a similar cross-section. As a hydrofoil-equipped watercraft increases in speed, the hydrofoil elements below the hull develop enough lift to raise the hull out of the water, which greatly reduces hull drag. This provides a corresponding increase in speed and fuel efficiency, as less propulsive force is required to drive the vessel.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When used as a lifting element on a hydrofoil boat, the upward force exerted by the hydrofoil lifts the body of the vessel clear of the water, thereby decreasing drag of the hull and increasing the speed of the vessel. The lifting force eventually balances with the weight of the craft, reaching a point where the hydrofoil no longer lifts out of the water but remains in equilibrium. Since wave resistance and other impeding forces such as various types of drag on the hull are eliminated as the hull lifts clear, turbulence and drag act increasingly on the much smaller surface area of the hydrofoil, and decreasingly on the relative larger area of the hull, creating a marked increase in speed. In the case of fixed hydrofoils, the lifting force will be dependent on the speed of the vessel. Alternatively, hydrofoils can be provided with control surfaces in the same way as an aircraft wing, whereby the control surfaces can be angled to increase or decrease the lifting force. Once the hull is lifted clear of the water, the effect of the reduced drag can be used for increased speed, while maintaining the output of the propulsion system. Alternatively, the reduced drag can be used for increased fuel economy, while reducing the output of the propulsion system to a lower level once the hull is lifted clear of the water.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 4,335,671 discloses a vessel comprising fixed hydrofoils. A problem with this solution is the increased draft created by the hydrofoils which makes it impossible for these vessels to navigate in shallow waters. A further problem is the increased drag experienced by fixed hydrofoil vessels when travelling at speeds where the hull is in contact with the water.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various solutions have been suggested to overcome the above problems relating to drag and draft. U.S. Pat. No. 2,984,197 discloses a vessel comprising front and rear hydrofoils which are retractable into contact with the hull of the vessel. A problem with this solution is that the retracted hydrofoils extend outside the envelope of the submerged hull when the hydrofoils are stowed. Compared to fixed hydrofoil vessels, the draft is reduced but the drag created by the retracted hydrofoils at low speed is still substantial.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A further problem relating to the above-mentioned solutions is that the fitting of a hydrofoil system often requires a substantial modification of the hull of a vessel. In the case of retractable hydrofoils, as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 2,984,197, this is a particular problem for rear hydrofoils which are located in a part of the vessel which also has to accommodate a propulsion unit as well as space for both passengers and storage compartments. This causes problems both for packaging of the hydrofoil system and its control means, and for accessibility when performing subsequent maintenance and repair.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention provides an improved arrangement aiming to solve the above-mentioned problems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the invention is to provide an auxiliary hull unit for a vessel, which hull unit solves the above-mentioned problems.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The object is achieved by an auxiliary hull unit comprising a hydrofoil system and a marine vessel comprising such an auxiliary hull unit according to the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the subsequent text, the term &#x201c;water line&#x201d; is defined as the level around the hull reached by the surrounding water when the vessel is at rest. The term &#x201c;longitudinal axis&#x201d; is defined as an axis extending between the bow and the stern of the vessel in line with the keel. With respect to the foldable hydrofoils, the term &#x201c;stowed position&#x201d; refers to a position where the hydrofoils are inoperative and fully retracted. Similarly, the term &#x201c;deployed position&#x201d; refers to a position where the hydrofoils are operative and fully deployed. The terms &#x201c;front&#x201d;, &#x201c;forward&#x201d;, &#x201c;rear&#x201d;, &#x201c;rearward&#x201d; and similar directional terms are to be taken in the longitudinal direction of the vessel and in its main direction of travel. The term &#x201c;lateral direction&#x201d; is intended to describe a direction that is substantially transverse or at right angles to the longitudinal direction of the marine vessel and the auxiliary hull unit. Further, the term &#x201c;power source&#x201d; is intended to denote a source of mechanical, hydraulic or electric power for operating different parts of the vessel or the auxiliary drive unit. A mechanical power source can be an internal combustion engine (ICE) operated on a suitable fossil fuel or an alternative fuel, such as a biofuel or hydrogen. A hydraulic power source can be a pump or accumulator supplying fluid pressure to an actuator or similar. An electric power source can be an electric motor operated by a storage unit, such as a battery, or a fuel cell. The term &#x201c;power storage&#x201d; denotes a power storing or supplying component used for operating a power source. Non-limiting examples of power storage means are battery packs, electricity generating fuel cells and tanks for various types of fuel.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a first aspect of the invention, the invention relates to an auxiliary hull unit detachably mounted to a transom on a marine vessel, wherein the hull unit is mounted at least partially below the water line of the vessel and arranged to extend rearwards parallel to the rearward extension of vessel hull sections adjacent to the hull unit. The hull unit comprises a rear hydrofoil system for the marine vessel, which hydrofoil system allows foldable hydrofoils to be deployed when it is desired to increase the speed of the marine vessel to enter foiling mode.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A suitable hydrofoil system to be arranged in a forward portion of the vessel is described in the application PCT/EP2019/072138 which is hereby incorporated by reference. As the invention relates to an auxiliary hull unit comprising a rearward hydrofoil system, forward hydrofoil systems will not be described in further detail in the subsequent text.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The rear hydrofoil system comprises at least one pair of foldable hydrofoils which are pivotable in a lateral direction relative to the longitudinal axis of the auxiliary hull unit, wherein each hydrofoil is controllable by at least one actuator for displacement of the at least one pair of foldable hydrofoils in the lateral direction of the hull unit between a stowed position and a deployed position. Each foldable hydrofoil comprises a first portion comprising a first end which first end is mounted hinged relative to the auxiliary hull unit and on opposite sides thereof. The function of the first portion is the act as a strut or support for a foiling portion that provides a lifting force. Each foldable hydrofoil further comprises a second portion comprising a free second end extending away from the respective first portion towards the opposite side of the hull unit and at an obtuse angle relative to the first portion. The second function of the second portion is to form a foiling portion or wing that creates lift when deployed. The first and second portions are joined at their respective second ends to form a general wing shaped foil. The join between the first and second portions can have a shape that is dependent on the shape of the adjacent hull section of the auxiliary hull unit. Consequently, such a join can be shaped as a distinct sharp line or as a section having a rounded or curved transition. The foldable hydrofoils are preferably at least flush with the auxiliary hull unit in the stowed position, in order to minimize drag and flow resistance when the vessel is travelling at low or planing speeds.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A lower outer surface of each hydrofoil is at least flush with the submerged outer surface of the hull in front of the hydrofoil when the hydrofoil is in the stowed position. In this context, an outer surface of the hydrofoil faces away from the outer surface of the hull. By locating the stowed hydrofoils so that their outer surfaces are flush with or inside the envelope of the outer hull surface immediately behind a step in the hull or the auxiliary hull unit, it is possible to virtually eliminate any drag from the stowed hydrofoils when the vessel is travelling at low or planing speeds. In order to reduce drag as well as air resistance, an outer side surface of each hydrofoil can be located in a recess in the side of the hull located above the water line when the hydrofoil is in the stowed position. The recesses in the opposite sides of the hull can form a continuation of a submerged step in the auxiliary hull unit.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Each hydrofoil comprises a single structural component having a generally angled wing shape. The shape of the hydrofoil conforms to the outer surface of the hull at least below and preferably also above the water line. In this way at least the submerged portion of the hydrofoil conforms with and is located at least flush with the outer surface of an adjacent portion of the hull. This is achieved by giving the outer surface of each hydrofoil the same cross-sectional shape as the outer surface of the hull immediately in front of the respective stowed hydrofoil. In this example, the cross-sections are taken at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the vessel.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The first end of each foldable hydrofoil comprises a hinge having parallel or near parallel pivot axes extending in the longitudinal direction of the marine vessel, in a plan view of the vessel. The hinges allow the hydrofoils to be pivoted away from the hull of the vessel, so that a foiling portion of the second portions can provide a lifting force sufficient to lift the hull clear of the water. Simultaneously, one or more drive units for propelling the vessel are extended downwards to allow the drive units to remain submerged as the hull of the vessel is lifted out of the water by the hydrofoils with increasing speed.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a first example, the auxiliary hull unit can have the first portion of each hydrofoil extending adjacent the hull unit along its entire length when the hydrofoil is in the stowed position. The second portion of each hydrofoil can be arranged to extend into a lateral cavity in the hull unit when the hydrofoil is in the stowed position. In this example, the second portion of each hydrofoil can be arranged to extend inwards and upwards into the lateral cavity in the hull unit when in the stowed position. In addition, the free second end of each second portion can be arranged to extend up to a vertical plane through the longitudinal axis of the hull unit when the hydrofoil is in the stowed position. In this way the hydrofoils can be deployed and retracted simultaneously, as they do not interfere with each other. Hydrofoils according to this example can be suited for smaller and/or relatively light vessels, requiring a correspondingly smaller lifting force to make the hull clear the surface of the water.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to this example, at least the side portions of the auxiliary hull unit can be arranged as an inward step relative to the side portions of the hull of the vessel adjacent the transom. The inward step will extend along the entire length of the auxiliary hull unit. The recessed depth of the step can be at least equal to the thickness of the first portion of the corresponding hydrofoil in its stowed position, whereby drag can be eliminated or at least significantly reduced for the part of the first portion of the hydrofoil that extends below the waterline when the vessel is travelling at low or planing speeds. Alternatively, such an inward step can be provided in the side portions of the auxiliary hull unit itself. The inward step will extend along the remaining rearward length of the auxiliary hull unit. This option can be used when the foldable hydrofoils are located at a position in the hull unit remote from the transom of the vessel.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The lateral cavity can be arranged to extend into the bottom or lower hull portion of the auxiliary hull unit below the waterline. In order to avoid a forward facing, drag inducing surface, the lateral cavity can open up gradually or completely in the rearward direction of the hull unit. The cavity for the second portions of the hydrofoils is always located in the lateral direction of the inwards step in the hull unit.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a second example, the auxiliary hull unit can have the first portion of each hydrofoil extending adjacent the hull unit up to the central longitudinal axis of the hull unit when the hydrofoil is in the stowed position. The second portion of each hydrofoil can be arranged to extend adjacent the hull unit past the central longitudinal axis of the hull unit. The second ends of each pair of hydrofoils can be arranged to extend a predetermined distance past the central longitudinal axis of the auxiliary hull unit. Hydrofoils according to this example are suited for larger and/or relatively heavy vessels, requiring a correspondingly larger lifting force to make the hull clear the surface of the water.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to this example, at least the side portions of the auxiliary hull unit can be arranged as an inward step relative to the side portions of the hull of the vessel adjacent the transom. The inward step will extend along the entire length of the auxiliary hull unit. The recessed depth of the step can be at least equal to the thickness of the first portion of the corresponding hydrofoil in its stowed position, whereby drag can be eliminated or at least significantly reduced for the part of the first portion of the hydrofoil that extends below the waterline when the vessel is travelling at low or planing speeds. Alternatively, such an inward step can be provided in the side portions of the auxiliary hull unit itself. The inward step will extend along the remaining rearward length of the auxiliary hull unit. This option can be used when the foldable hydrofoils are located at a position in the hull unit remote from the transom of the vessel.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a preferred example, each pair of hydrofoils can be arranged to overlap in the lateral direction of the hull unit when the hydrofoils are in the stowed position. In the stowed position, a first hydrofoil will extend adjacent the hull unit along its entire extension while the opposite, second hydrofoil will extend partially adjacent the hull unit and partially adjacent the second portion and a part of the first portion of the first hydrofoil. In this example, the overlapping first and second hydrofoils are arranged to be displaced in a predetermined order. During deployment, the overlapping hydrofoils are arranged to be displaced sequentially when moved towards their operative positions, wherein the outermost hydrofoil is actuated first. During retraction of the hydrofoils towards the stowed position the hydrofoils are actuated in reverse, wherein the innermost hydrofoil is actuated first. In addition, the lower part of the hull unit, where the first and second hydrofoils the hull unit are arranged to overlap on either side of the longitudinal axis of the unit, will require a deeper inward step in order to accommodate the overlapping foil portions. This deeper recessed inward step will extend along the remaining rearward length of the auxiliary hull unit.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a further example, each pair of hydrofoils can be arranged side-by-side in the lateral direction of the hull unit when the hydrofoils are in the stowed position. Hence, a first hydrofoil is positioned in front of a second hydrofoil in the longitudinal direction of the auxiliary hull unit. In this example, the longitudinally offset hydrofoils are arranged to be displaced simultaneously when moved towards the deployed position. Here, at least the side portions of the auxiliary hull unit can be arranged as an inward step relative to the side portions of the hull of the vessel adjacent the transom. The inward step will extend along the entire length of the auxiliary hull unit. The depth of the step can be at least equal to the thickness of the first and second portions of the hydrofoils in their stowed positions, whereby drag can be eliminated or at least significantly reduced for the part of the first portion of the hydrofoil that extends below the waterline when the vessel is travelling at low or planing speeds. Alternatively, such an inward step can be provided in the side portions of the auxiliary hull unit itself. The inward step will extend along the remaining rearward length of the auxiliary hull unit. This option can be used when the foldable hydrofoils are located at a position in the hull unit remote from the transom of the vessel. If desired, the inward step on one side of the auxiliary unit can be offset in the longitudinal direction of the vessel, in order to conform to the corresponding offset of the rear second hydrofoil.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the latter example where the stowed hydrofoils are side-by-side adjacent the hull, the first ends of both foldable hydrofoils can comprise a hinge having a pivot axis extending in the horizontal plane in the longitudinal direction of the marine vessel. When these hydrofoils are deployed, the submerged second ends of each hydrofoil will be offset in the longitudinal direction of the vessel when each hydrofoil reaches its operative position. As the hydrofoils are deployed non-symmetrically, or offset in the lateral direction, a moment is generated about the centre of gravity of the vessel. This moment will require a steering correction in order to maintain the vessel on a straight heading.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In all the above-mentioned examples, the first end of each foldable hydrofoil comprises a hinge having pivot axes extending in parallel with the longitudinal axis of the hull unit. These hinges allow the hydrofoils to be pivoted outwards from their stowed positions into their respective deployed positions.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The auxiliary hull unit only requires a limited number of fixed attachment points. Attachment of the hull unit can be achieved by any suitable heavy-duty fastening means. A non-limiting list of fastening means comprises screw and nut fasteners, keyhole-type fasteners, hook-and-slot type fasteners, interlocking profiles, twist-lock fasteners or any combination of the above fasteners. Fasteners of this type are well known in the field of marine vessels and will not be described in further detail. The number of attachment points is dependent on the size and displacement of the auxiliary hull unit, as well as the power output of the one or more propulsion units.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The auxiliary hull unit described above is provided with at least one actuator for controlling displacement of the hydrofoils. Each hydrofoil can be connected to at least one actuator arranged within the auxiliary hull unit and arranged to displace the hydrofoils between their stowed and deployed positions. The at least one actuator is preferably, but not necessarily, arranged below the water line within the auxiliary hull unit. The size and number of actuators is dependent on the force required to deploy and maintain the hydrofoils in their operative positions. For relatively small vessels it can be sufficient to provide a single actuator for displacing the hydrofoils on both sides of the vessel. Relatively larger vessels can require one or possibly two actuators per hydrofoil.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The at least one actuator is arranged to be operated by a suitable power source within a self-contained auxiliary hull unit. The power source can be an electric motor or an internal combustion engine (ICE). An electric motor can be operated using electric power from a storage battery or a fuel cell, which motor can drive the at least one actuator directly or by driving a pump providing hydraulic or fluid pressure. Alternatively, an ICE using fossil or alternative fuels can be operated to drive a generator to provide electric power, or a pump providing hydraulic or fluid pressure. According to one example, the auxiliary hull unit can be self-contained and be provided with a water tight compartment within the hull unit comprising both a power source, such as an electric motor or an ICE, and an energy storage, such as a battery of a fuel tank, as well as a suitable electric or hydraulic means for driving the at least one actuator.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to an alternative example, the auxiliary hull unit is partially self-contained and comprises a power source and/or a power storage as described above for driving the at least one actuator. In this case, an energy storage, such as a battery of a fuel tank, can be provided on-board the marine vessel.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">An electronic control unit for the actuators controlling the hydrofoils can be provided in the auxiliary hull unit or on-board the vessel. Operation of the actuators is controlled by an operator via a suitable control panel or a graphical user interface on-board the vessel.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For the purpose of propulsion, a marine vessel suitable for hydrofoil operation requires at least one propulsion unit that can be displaced between a first position for low speed or planing operation, and a second position for operation at foiling speeds. The at least one propulsion unit can be located within the auxiliary hull unit or within the hull of the marine vessel.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to one example, the auxiliary hull unit can comprise a pod propulsion unit arranged to be vertically displaceable between a stowed position and a deployed position. The auxiliary hull unit can comprise an internal power storage connected to the pod propulsion unit or a power storage located on-board the marine vessel to which the hull unit is mounted.

The invention also solves the problem of increased drag experienced by fixed hydrofoil vessels when travelling at speeds where the hull is in contact with the water. The solution according to the invention provides a compact arrangement that does not create undesired drag or require excessive space for the stowed hydrofoils, while also providing a lifting force sufficient for lifting the vessel out of the water when fully deployed.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A further advantage is related to the problem that foil systems are fragile and likely to break on impacting submerged or floating objects, e.g. a log in the water. Even in case of a complete breakdown failure caused by hitting a hard object, the floating capability of the vessel is not endangered as the impact forces are absorbed by the auxiliary hull unit. Further, the auxiliary hull unit can be assembled after the vessel has been built or can be retrofitted to an existing vessel to convert it to a foiling vessel. The auxiliary hull unit only requires a number of fixed attachment points and a small hole in the hull of the vessel for a control cable.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">If required, a conduit for fuel or a cable for electric power can be provided when the auxiliary hull unit comprises a propulsion unit.

One or more battery packs or fuel tanks for alternative fuels can be distributed within the auxiliary hull unit to achieve an optimal weight distribution. When battery packs with a limited range are provided for driving the at least one propulsion unit, it can be an option to provide a small combustion engine or generator to be used as a hybrid range extender.

However, the auxiliary hull unit can also be connected to a power storage located on-board the marine vessel to which the hull unit is mounted. The internal power storage can be a rechargeable battery pack for relatively short distance travel, or fuel cells using alternative fuels for travelling longer distances.

Internal component parts are located in a sealed, watertight compartment where they can be protected from the corrosive marine environment. A preferred embodiment involves a self-contained auxiliary hull unit, which comprises at least one power storage unit, an electronic control unit (ECU) for the electrical components, an optional hydraulics unit and a control unit for such a hydraulics unit. The use of multiple battery packs facilitates packing of the batteries in the auxiliary hull unit and provides redundancy in case of a failure of one battery pack. The electric propulsion units are controlled by the ECU, which comprises power electronics and electrical circuits for monitoring and controlling the battery packs. The ECU is also controlled by an operator via suitable wiring from the auxiliary hull unit to an operator position on-board the marine vessel onto which the hull unit is attached. The optional hydraulics unit can comprise a pump, a hydraulic circuit, an optional accumulator and controllable valves, all connected to hydraulic actuators used for driving any auxiliary hydraulic units when provided. The components in the hydraulics unit are controlled by the hydraulics control unit, which are in turn controlled by an operator via suitable wiring from the auxiliary hull unit to an operator position on-board the marine vessel. Hydraulic actuator can, for instance, replace electrical actuators for controlling the lifting or steering of the propulsion units. Hence, when an auxiliary hull unit is attached to a vessel by suitable fastening means, the only additional connection to the vessel comprises electrical connectors and the electrical wiring for controlling the propulsion unit and an optional hydraulics unit.
