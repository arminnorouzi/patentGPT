The first MOSFET M<sub>i1 </sub>and the second MOSFET M<sub>i2 </sub>in the middle are used as switching tubes; and the radio-frequency data b<sub>i </sub>and <o ostyle="single">b<sub>i</sub></o> are connected to the gates of the two MOSFETs respectively, so as to control the bias current of the fifth MOSFET M<sub>i0 </sub>in this unit to flow to the positive output V<sub>OP </sub>or the negative output V<sub>ON </sub>of the differential power amplifier.

The induced voltage current generated at a secondary side of the transformer drives the antenna to emit radio-frequency signals represented by b<sub>n&#x2212;1 </sub>. . . b<sub>0</sub>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Since the frequency of the radio-frequency data b<sub>i </sub>and <o ostyle="single">b<sub>i</sub></o> is the radio-frequency local oscillator clock frequency and is relatively high (for example, the frequency for a UWB application may be up to 9.48 GHz), thereby limiting the size of the capacitive load that can be driven by the radio-frequency input data. In this embodiment, the first MOSFET M<sub>i1 </sub>and the second MOSFET M<sub>i2 </sub>are implemented by thin-oxide low-voltage transistors. The low-voltage MOSFET uses a minimum channel length in this process, and meanwhile a channel width for realizing a certain driving capability is correspondingly reduced, thereby effectively reducing the dimension of the MOSFET and the magnitude of the parasitic capacitance. Therefore, the low-voltage transistors may be used to reduce the capacitive load driven by the radio-frequency data b<sub>i </sub>and <o ostyle="single">b<sub>i</sub></o>. Specifically, the minimum dimension that can be used by the low-voltage MOSFET is related to a process. For example, a minimum channel length of a 40 nm process is about 40 nm, and a minimum channel length of a 22 nm process is about 25 nm. The channel length and the area of the MOSFET are reduced, and the corresponding parasitic capacitance is correspondingly reduced. For another example, in the 22 nm process, a minimum channel length of a 0.8V low-voltage transistor is about 25 nm, a minimum channel length of a 3.3V medium-voltage transistor is 550 nm, and the area and the parasitic capacitance are increased by more than dozens of times.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A voltage amplitude of an output signal of the power amplifier determines the output power. The application of high output power requires that the power voltage V<sub>CC </sub>of the primary side of the transformer may exceed a withstand voltage of the low-voltage transistor. Therefore, in this embodiment, thick-oxide 3.3V medium-voltage transistors are used as the third MOSFET M<sub>i3 </sub>and the fourth MOSFET M<sub>i4 </sub>to isolate a lower-layer low-voltage transistor from an upper-layer transformer. The thick-oxide 3.3V medium-voltage transistor limits a voltage between a source and a drain of the lower-layer low-voltage transistor not to exceed its withstand voltage value, thereby protecting the working safety of the lower-layer low-voltage transistor.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this embodiment, the thin-oxide low-voltage transistors are used as the first MOSFET and the second MOSFET M<sub>i2</sub>, and the thick-oxide medium-voltage transistors are used as the third MOSFET M<sub>i3 </sub>and the fourth MOSFET M<sub>i4</sub>, wherein the voltage ranges of the low-voltage transistor and the medium-voltage transistor vary according to different processes. Those skilled in the art can understand that the low-voltage transistor is a commonly used core device (a device used inside a chip), and the medium-voltage transistor is a commonly used I/O device (a device used when the chip interacts with an external interface). For example, in the commonly used tsmc (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) 40 nm process, MOSFETs of 0.9V, 3.3V and 5V are used, that is, typical voltage values of the MOSFETs in operation are 0.9V, 3.3V, 5V, respectively. In general cases, the MOSFET of 0.9V is referred to as a low-voltage transistor, and the MOSFET of 3.3V is referred to as a medium-voltage transistor. Silica between a gate and a channel of the MOSFET of 0.9V is relatively thin, and silica between a gate and a channel of the MOSFET of 3.3V is relatively thick, which are distinguished as the thin-oxide low-voltage transistor and the thick-oxide medium-voltage transistor. The specific thickness depends on process parameters.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a circuit structure of a current-mode differential digital power amplifier according to another embodiment of the present application is shown.

The current flowing through this amplifier unit is controlled by the gate voltage V<sub>B </sub>of the third MOSFET M<sub>i3 </sub>and the fourth MOSFET M<sub>i4 </sub>to directly adjust the bias current through the gate voltage V<sub>B</sub>, and the output power of the digital radio-frequency transmitter can be changed by adjusting the magnitude of the gate voltage V<sub>B</sub>. That is, the digital power amplifier in this embodiment does not include the current mirror, and one terminal of each of the sources and the drains of the first MOSFET M<sub>i1 </sub>and the second MOSFET M<sub>i2 </sub>is grounded directly. On this basis, in some other embodiments, the gate voltage V<sub>B </sub>may also be connected to a certain fixed power voltage, and a branch bias current is generated by an on-resistance of the MOSFET connected to each branch. The magnitude of the branch bias current can be changed by adjusting the power voltage V<sub>CC </sub>of the transformer, thereby controlling the output power of the transmitter.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In this embodiment of the present application, the digital radio-frequency transmitter integrates the digital-to-analog converter and the power amplifier into a digital power amplifier, thereby simplifying the structure of the radio-frequency transmitter. The low-pass filter may be implemented in a digital domain by a digital filtering algorithm. The digital baseband input data of the radio-frequency transmitter may be digitally filtered data, which can save the cost of an analog filter. The radio-frequency mixing circuit may also implemented digitally, and the transmission baseband digital input data and the radio-frequency clock are mixed through a digital logic gate. The digital logic gate can effectively prevent clock leakage to the power amplifier output.
