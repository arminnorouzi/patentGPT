In response to this trend, various display apparatuses are being developed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Specific examples of these display apparatus include a liquid crystal display apparatus (LCD), an organic light-emitting display apparatus (OLED), and a quantum dot display apparatus.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, there are known deficiencies and limitations with such display apparatus. For example, while it may generally be desirable to increase the viewable area of a screen of such types of display apparatus, increasing the viewable area reduces the bezel area around the screen for connections between various components of the display apparatus and may result in weaker connections that are more prone to failure. These problems are particularly pronounced for more recently developed foldable and bendable displays. In addition, certain aspects of known display apparatus are assembled manually, which increases the likelihood of errors in assembly as the size of the working space or bezel area on the apparatus decreases to increase the viewable area of the screen.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A display apparatus of the present disclosure may be a display apparatus with thinness, light weight, low power consumption, and excellent performance.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an embodiment, a self light-emitting display apparatus, such as an organic light-emitting display apparatus, is considered a competitive application because the organic light-emitting display apparatus does not require a separate light source and implements a compact apparatus and achieves clear color display. The organic light-emitting display apparatus has a self light-emitting element in each pixel, meaning that there is no separate light source. The light-emitting element has two electrodes facing each other and a light-emitting layer which is disposed between the two electrodes so as to emit light when transported electrons and holes are recombined with each other therein. An organic light-emitting element is a self light-emitting element using a thin light-emitting layer between electrodes, and has an advantage that it can be implemented thinly. Further, the organic light-emitting display apparatus does not require a separate light source apparatus and thus is flexible, bendable, or foldable so as to be implemented as a foldable display apparatus which may be designed in various forms.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Recently, users have preferred a bezel-less or bezel-free design in which a display area is full when the user views a screen. The inventors have realized that an edge area of the display area includes connections to couple or mount a display panel or a display apparatus to a module. For example, a decoration plate and a rear cover may be fixed, via a screw or a tape, to a side surface of a cover glass or the display panel in the edge area. The edge area may be a bezel in a front view of the display apparatus. A size of the bezel for the fixing the display panel may increase to allow room for such connections. In order to achieve the user's preferred bezel-less or bezel-free design, the inventors note that a space of a connection point between the display panel or the display apparatus and the module may be reduced or minimized. Specifically, the inventors propose that in order to minimize the bezel area, a structure of a core plate supporting a back surface of the display panel and a structure of a rear cover that is disposed on a back surface of the core plate so as to cover the back surface of the display apparatus may be different from each other such that the space at the connection point between the display apparatus and the module may be reduced or minimized.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, the inventors also note that efficient large production may be reduced if there is use of the screw or the tape in a process of coupling the core plate and the rear cover to the display panel. The coupling process using the screw or the tape may be performed manually by an operator, and defects may occur due to error of the manual work. A scheme for omitting or minimizing the manual work may therefore be considered desirable and advantageous over known display apparatus.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A scheme for securing robustness of the coupling while an operator easily couples the core plate and the rear cover to the display panel and a structure in which the core plate and the rear cover are detachable therefrom for repairing a problem after the coupling may also be considered desirable and advantageous relative to known display apparatus.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">When using the bezel-less or bezel-free design, the user may have greater immersion in the screen, and aesthetics of the display apparatus may be improved.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The concepts of the present disclosure are intended to overcome the above disadvantages of known display apparatus. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, a bezel size of a display apparatus is reduced so that the user may have greater immersion in the screen.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In more detail, a core plate supports a back surface of the display panel or allows the display panel to be bent in a desired shape, and at the same time, couples the display apparatus to a module. A rear cover covers a rear surface of the core plate and plays a role in constituting an appearance of the rear surface of the display apparatus. In this regard, the concepts of the present disclosure improve workability by improving the coupling between the core plate and the rear cover.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A scheme that improves the workability of the operator and at the same time secures the robustness of the coupling in the coupling of the core plate and the rear cover is also contemplated herein. When the coupling is weak though the workability is improved, quality problems may occur. For example, a display apparatus attached to a vehicle may be exposed to extreme cold or extreme hot outdoor temperatures. The coupling between the core plate and the rear cover and the display panel may become loose or otherwise fail due to periodic or irregular vibrations that occur during vehicle driving. Thus, the concepts of the present disclosure achieve a robust coupling between the core plate and the rear cover.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, a design of the core plate and the rear cover is provided in order to stably implement the bezel-less or bezel-free structure of the display apparatus.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, a display apparatus includes: a display panel; a decoration film and a cover glass disposed on a front surface of the display panel; a core plate supporting a rear surface of the display panel and attached to the rear surface thereof; and a rear cover coupled to a rear surface of the core plate; wherein the core plate has a protruding portion protruding toward the cover glass, wherein the rear cover has a coupling portion coupled to the protruding portion so as to covers at least a portion of the protruding portion, wherein resin is applied to at least a portion of the coupling portion and the rear cover is adhered to the decoration film or the cover glass via the resin.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, a display apparatus includes: a display panel including a flexible substrate; a decoration film and a cover glass disposed on a front surface of the display panel; a core plate supporting a rear surface of the display panel and attached to the rear surface thereof; and a rear cover coupled to a rear surface of the core plate; wherein the core plate has an edge area divided into a first area, a second area and a third area, wherein the core plate has a protruding portion protruding toward the cover glass, wherein the protruding portion is disposed in the edge area, wherein resin is applied to at least a portion of the protruding portion and the rear cover is adhered to the decoration film or the cover glass via the resin.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a display apparatus having a bezel-free or bezel-less form may be provided via a coupling structure of the display panel and the core plate and the rear cover constituting the display apparatus. Changing the coupling structure between the core plate and the rear cover may allow a side space of the display panel to be minimized and thus the bezel area may be narrowed while allowing for a strong and reliable coupling between various aspects of the display apparatus to improve performance and reliability.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Therefore, the user of the display apparatus may aesthetically view the light-emitting screen occupying a substantial area of the front surface of the display apparatus. A compact display apparatus may be realized due to the narrow bezel. This may be more advantageous for an interior design of the vehicle, among other applications.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The display apparatus according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may be simplified by changing the coupling structure of the display panel, the core plate, and the rear cover. This means that work of an assembly worker is simplified, and the productivity improvement effect may be expected due to the simplification of the process. For example, in a conventional work scheme, the structures such as the core plate, the rear cover, and the decoration plate are coupled to each other using side screws or tapes. According to the present disclosure, improving the coupling structure may allow the core plate and the rear cover to be coupled to each other without separate fastening devices.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Benefits of the concepts of the present disclosure are not limited to the above-mentioned benefits. Other benefits and advantages of the present disclosure that are not mentioned may be understood based on following descriptions, and may be more clearly understood based on embodiments of the present disclosure. Further, it will be easily understood that the benefits and advantages of the present disclosure may be realized using the concepts of the disclosure and combinations thereof.

The encapsulation layer <b>140</b> prevents the penetration of oxygen and moisture from the outside into the light-emitting material and the electrode material in order to prevent oxidation of the light-emitting material and the electrode material. When the light-emitting element <b>119</b> is exposed to the moisture or oxygen, pixel shrinkage phenomenon in which the light-emitting area is reduced may appear, or dark spots may occur in the light-emitting area. The encapsulation layer <b>140</b> may have a structure in which first and second inorganic layers <b>142</b> and <b>146</b> made of glass, metal, aluminum oxide (AlO<sub>x</sub>) or silicon (Si)-based material, and an organic layer <b>144</b> that improves the planarization performance and relieves the stress between the layers due to the bending of the display panel <b>100</b> may be alternately stacked. A component of the organic layer <b>144</b> may include an organic insulating material such as acrylic resin, epoxy resin, polyimide, polyethylene, or silicon oxycarbon (SiOC). The first and second inorganic layers <b>142</b> and <b>146</b> serve to block the penetration of moisture or oxygen, and the organic layer <b>144</b> serves to planarize the surface of the first inorganic layer <b>142</b>. When the encapsulation layer <b>140</b> is formed as a multi-layered thin-film layer, a passage along which moisture or oxygen travels becomes longer and more complicated than that in a case when the encapsulation layer <b>140</b> is formed as a single layer, thereby making it difficult for the moisture/oxygen to invade into the light-emitting element.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">A protective layer may be further formed between the light-emitting element <b>119</b> and the encapsulation layer <b>140</b> to protect the encapsulation layer <b>140</b> such that a side surface of the encapsulation layer <b>140</b> is not peeled off or the uniformity thereof is not affected during the manufacturing process of the encapsulation layer <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a polarizing layer <b>154</b> may be disposed on the encapsulation layer <b>140</b>.

Each of the first touch electrode <b>155</b><i>a </i>and the second touch electrode <b>155</b><i>c </i>may be disposed on a touch insulating layer <b>155</b><i>b </i>and may be patterned in a polygonal or circular shape such that the patterns are spaced apart from each other.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">A cover member <b>180</b> may be disposed on the touch sensor layer <b>155</b>.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the core plate <b>200</b> may be manufactured in the same shape as that of the display panel <b>100</b>. Thus, the core plate <b>200</b> may sufficiently reinforce and support the back surface of the display panel <b>100</b>. For this purpose, the core plate <b>200</b> may be made of a metal-based material that has greater rigidity than that of the display panel <b>100</b>. For example, the core plate <b>200</b> may be manufactured through a die casting process using magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), etc., having relatively good workability. However, the material of the core plate <b>200</b> is not limited thereto. Another reason why the core plate <b>200</b> is made of the metal-based material is that the metal may dissipate heat that may be generated from the display panel <b>100</b> well. In other words, the core plate <b>200</b> may have dual functionality as a support for the display panel <b>100</b> while also acting as a heat sink for dissipating heat generated by operation of the display panel <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">More specifically, a polyimide-based polymer or plastic used as the material of the substrate for the display panel <b>100</b> may have poor thermal conductivity, and thus may not emit the heat from a driver of the display panel <b>100</b>. This may adversely affect the light-emitting element <b>119</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Therefore, when the core plate <b>200</b> made of a metal material with excellent thermal conductivity is disposed on the back surface of the display panel <b>100</b>, the heat from the display panel <b>100</b> may be dissipated by the core plate <b>200</b> to improve reliability and performance of the display panel <b>100</b>. The die casting process is one of the precision casting methods to obtain a cast of the same shape as a shape of a mold by injecting molten metal into the mold which is made of rigid material and has been precisely shaped so as to match a target shape. A part produced by the die casting process has an accurate dimension and thus hardly needs a finishing work, and further has excellent mechanical properties and is subjected to mass production. For this reason, the die casting process may be mainly used for the production of precise parts such as vehicle parts, electric parts, and optical parts. Other formation techniques and processes for the core plate <b>200</b> are also contemplated herein. In addition, other heat dissipation techniques, such as separate heat sinks and heat dissipation plates are contemplated herein instead of, or addition to the, core plate <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the rear cover <b>300</b> may be disposed to cover at least a portion of a rear surface of the core plate <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>.

For example, an upper portion of the rear cover <b>300</b> has the same outline as that of the display panel <b>100</b> or the core plate <b>200</b>, while a lower portion of the rear cover <b>300</b> may be an empty space because the connectors for coupling the core plate <b>200</b> to the vehicle or set are disposed in an area of the core plate corresponding to the empty space of the rear cover. As a result, the rear cover <b>300</b> may be disposed on a portion of the core plate <b>200</b> that does not include connectors and other like structures for coupling the core plate <b>200</b> to the vehicle or other support. The rear cover <b>300</b> may be made of thermoplastic plastic. For example, the rear cover <b>300</b> may be made of polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polycarbonate, or ABS (Acrylonitrile, Butadiene, and Styrene) and may be manufactured using a plastic injection molding. In embodiments where the rear cover <b>300</b> is ABS (acrylonitrile, butadiene, and styrene), styrene may be the primary raw material among the three materials.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The injection molding is a representative processing method for molding the thermoplastic resin, and has the advantage of being able to mold small to large sized products and of achieving mass-production via repeated injections. However, other processing methods and techniques are also contemplated herein.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the display apparatus <b>10</b>.

In more detail, the display panel <b>100</b> has a front surface <b>100</b>A and a rear surface <b>100</b>B opposite to the front surface <b>100</b>A, the core plate <b>200</b> has a front surface <b>200</b>A and a rear surface <b>200</b>B opposite to the front surface <b>200</b>A, and the rear cover <b>300</b> has a front surface <b>300</b>A and a rear surface <b>300</b>B opposite to the front surface <b>300</b>A. The front surface <b>200</b>A of the core plate <b>200</b> is disposed on, and covers, the rear surface <b>100</b>B of the display panel <b>100</b>. The front surface <b>300</b>A of the rear cover <b>300</b> is disposed on, and covers at least an upper portion of the rear surface <b>200</b>B of the core plate <b>200</b>. Resin <b>400</b> (which may also be referred to herein as a resin strip <b>400</b> or a resin layer <b>400</b>) is applied between the display panel <b>100</b> and the core plate <b>200</b> so that the display panel <b>100</b> is attached to a top surface <b>200</b>C of the core plate <b>200</b> via the resin <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the display apparatus <b>10</b> along line II-II&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the display panel <b>100</b> may include a substrate <b>11</b> on which a light-emitting element is disposed, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a cover glass <b>12</b>, a decoration film <b>14</b>, and an adhesive layer <b>13</b>. In some embodiments, the decoration film <b>14</b> may be attached in a form of a film or may be printed in a form of ink. The display panel <b>100</b> may be attached to an inner flat portion <b>204</b> of the core plate <b>200</b> via the adhesive layer <b>13</b> disposed on the back surface <b>100</b>B of the display panel <b>100</b>. The core plate <b>200</b> includes a protruding portion <b>203</b> protruding toward the cover glass <b>12</b>. The protruding portion <b>203</b> is a projection or ridge extending away from the inner flat portion <b>204</b> of the core plate <b>200</b> toward the cover glass <b>12</b> that may be positioned at an outer peripheral edge of the core plate <b>200</b>. The protruding portion <b>203</b> of the core plate <b>200</b> enables a connection between the core plate <b>200</b>, the rear cover <b>300</b>, and the cover glass <b>12</b> of the display panel <b>100</b>. In particular, the cover glass <b>12</b> may be spaced from the inner flat portion <b>204</b> of the core plate <b>200</b> by an amount corresponding to a thickness of the display panel <b>100</b>. The protruding portion <b>203</b> occupies this space to enable a reliable and strong connection between the core plate <b>200</b> and the cover glass <b>12</b>, while also accommodating a connection with the rear cover <b>300</b>, as described further below.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The rear cover <b>300</b> may have a coupling portion <b>303</b> coupled to the protruding portion <b>203</b> so as to cover the protruding portion <b>203</b>. In particular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the coupling portion <b>303</b> may have an inverted U-shape that interfaces with, and substantially surrounds the protruding portion <b>203</b> of the core plate <b>200</b>. Thus, the coupling portion <b>303</b> defines a channel that receives the protruding portion <b>203</b> of the core plate <b>200</b>. The resin <b>400</b> may be applied to one surface, such as an outer surface, of the coupling portion <b>303</b> of the rear cover <b>300</b> coupled to the protruding portion <b>203</b> of the core plate <b>200</b> such that the rear cover <b>300</b> may be adhered to the cover glass <b>12</b> to which the decoration film <b>14</b> has been attached via the resin <b>400</b>. As a result, the display panel <b>100</b> is coupled to the inner flat portion <b>204</b> by the adhesive <b>13</b>, and the cover glass <b>12</b> is coupled to the protruding portion <b>203</b> and the rear cover <b>300</b> by the resin <b>400</b> at a location that is spaced from the interface between the display panel <b>100</b> and the adhesive <b>13</b>. Due to this structure, a separate fixing screw or tape may be omitted in coupling the display panel <b>100</b>, the core plate <b>200</b>, and the rear cover <b>300</b> together, and thus, an edge area may be minimized. Minimizing the edge area enables a design that may minimize the bezel area of the display apparatus <b>10</b>. When this embodiment is applied, the bezel area may be reduced by an amount of about <b>12</b> mm, compared to the case where the screws or tapes are applied. Specifically, a space utilized for coupling with a screw may be about <b>17</b> mm, while in the structure of this embodiment, a space utilized for coupling may be about <b>5</b> mm to <b>5</b>.<b>5</b> mm based on omission of the screw. The resin <b>400</b> may be applied into the space utilized for the coupling as reduced by applying the present embodiment, such that cover glass <b>12</b> may be attached to the rear cover <b>300</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the rear cover <b>300</b> may be manufactured in a shape such that a bottom portion <b>305</b> of the rear cover <b>300</b> is spaced from the bottom or rear face <b>200</b>B of the core plate <b>200</b> to enable the core plate <b>200</b> to be smoothly fitted into the rear cover <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a detailed perspective view showing the protruding portion <b>203</b> of the core plate <b>200</b> and the rear cover <b>300</b> coupled to each other via the resin <b>400</b>, with the resin <b>400</b> disposed therebetween.

In particular, protrusions <b>210</b> and grooves <b>220</b> may be formed in a top surface <b>205</b> of the protruding portion <b>203</b> of the core plate <b>200</b>. The protrusions <b>210</b> and the grooves <b>220</b> in the top surface <b>205</b> of the protruding portion <b>203</b> assist with coupling the core plate <b>200</b> to the rear cover <b>300</b>, as described below. The protrusions <b>210</b> are arranged to be spaced apart from each other by a certain spacing corresponding to the grooves <b>220</b>, while the grooves <b>220</b> are arranged to be spaced apart from each other by a certain spacing corresponding to the protrusions <b>210</b>. That is, the protrusions <b>210</b> and the grooves <b>220</b> are arranged alternately with each other. In an embodiment, the protrusions <b>210</b> and grooves <b>220</b> are formed across an entirety of the top surface <b>205</b>, or may be formed on selected portions of the top surface <b>205</b>. Further, each protrusion <b>210</b> and groove <b>220</b> may have the same size and shape across the top surface <b>205</b>, or may have different sizes and shapes.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, coupling portions <b>310</b> and openings <b>320</b> may be formed in an edge area <b>305</b> of the rear cover <b>300</b> so as to correspond to the grooves <b>220</b> and the protrusions <b>210</b> of the core plate <b>200</b>, respectively. For example, each protrusion <b>210</b> of the core plate <b>200</b> is inserted into each opening <b>320</b> of the rear cover <b>300</b>, while each coupling portion <b>310</b> of the rear cover <b>300</b> is inserted into each groove <b>220</b> of the core plate <b>200</b>. The coupling portions <b>310</b> and the openings <b>320</b> are arranged alternately with each other. Thus, the core plate <b>200</b> and the rear cover <b>300</b> may be coupled to each other without a separate fastener such as a screw or a tape via the protrusions <b>210</b> and grooves <b>220</b> of the core plate <b>200</b> and the corresponding coupling portions <b>310</b> and openings <b>320</b> in the rear cover <b>300</b>, such as by a friction fit, a force fit, or with assistance of the resin <b>400</b>.

The protruding portion <b>203</b> may disposed only around a top outer peripheral edge of the core plate <b>200</b> and not disposed in the inner flat portion <b>204</b> of the core plate <b>200</b> which receives the display apparatus and couples the display apparatus to the vehicle or the module. The protruding portion <b>203</b> may be largely divided into the three areas, based on an inflection point. For example, the protruding portion <b>203</b> may be divided into the first area as a top or central area that is generally straight, the second area as a left area, and the third area as a right area in the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The boundaries of the areas may correspond to inflection points in the curvature of the rounded corners of the outer peripheral edge of the core plate <b>200</b>. For example, the first area terminates on a right side of the core plate <b>200</b> at an inflection point of the curved upper right edge of the core plate <b>200</b>, and the third area begins at the inflection point and continues to the end of the edge at the bottom of the core plate <b>200</b> in the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The same applies to the interface between the first area and the second area on the left side of the core plate <b>200</b>. The density of the protrusions <b>210</b> and the grooves <b>220</b> in the first area may be higher than that of the protrusions <b>210</b> and the grooves <b>220</b> in each of the second area and the third area.
