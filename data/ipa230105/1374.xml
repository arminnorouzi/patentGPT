Thus, for example, various embodiments may be carried out in a manner that achieves or optimizes one advantage or group of advantages as taught herein without necessarily achieving other aspects or advantages as may also be taught or suggested herein.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Certain exemplary embodiments will now be described to provide an overall understanding of the principles of the structure, function, manufacture, and use of the devices and methods disclosed herein. One or more examples of these embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Those skilled in the art will understand that the devices and methods specifically described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings are non-limiting exemplary embodiments and that the scope of the present invention is defined solely by the claims. The features illustrated or described in connection with one exemplary embodiment may be combined with the features of other embodiments. Such modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Disclosed herein are embodiments of methods, devices, and assemblies for forming materials from feedstocks using microwave plasma processing. Each different feedstock has its own critical, specialized, and unique requirements for microwave plasma processing to achieve desired material characteristics, such as spheroidization, morphology, aspect ratio, particle size distribution (PSD), chemistry, density, diameter, sphericity, oxygenation, hardness, and ductility, among others. As disclosed herein, processing in a microwave plasma torch can include feeding the feedstock into a microwave plasma torch, a plasma plume of the microwave plasma torch, and/or an exhaust of the microwave plasma torch. The feed location may vary depending on the desired material, as the feed location may affect the residence time and heat exposure of the feedstock, altering the material characteristics.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Some embodiments herein are directed to extending a microwave plasma within a microwave plasma torch. In some embodiments, extending the microwave plasma may comprise obtaining a plasma of sufficient length to process feedstocks to produce materials with desired material characteristics. Some embodiments herein are directed to tuning or altering, either automatically or manually, the length of a microwave plasma in order to obtain desired processing characteristics, including temperature profile and material residence time within a microwave plasma apparatus. In some embodiments, a microwave plasma apparatus according to the embodiments herein may comprise an extension tube that extends downward into a reaction chamber of the microwave plasma apparatus, the extension tube confining and directing the microwave plasma to extend its length. In some embodiments, the extension tube may concentrate the energy and power provided by a microwave power source, in order to form a longer microwave plasma within the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a conventional microwave plasma apparatus, a plasma may be formed by superheating and ionizing a plasma gas, and then directed downward into a reaction chamber, in which a feedstock material is provided to the plasma and processed into a material. The length of a plasma, plasma plume, or plasma exhaust in a conventional microwave plasma apparatus may be limited. For example, as the plasma extends downward in a reaction chamber away from the microwave power source, the plasma is cooled by surrounding gases, such that free electrons in the plasma recombine with the plasma gas atoms, causing the plasma to end. Furthermore, as the plasma extends further from the power source, insufficient energy is provided to the plasma gas, again causing the plasma to recombine into gas. Additionally, because the superheated plasma is less dense than the surrounding gases, the plasma naturally rises above the surrounding gases, which limits the length of plasma within the apparatus. Furthermore, in a conventional apparatus, the generated plasma may have length and shape that is extremely dynamic, as plasma does not generally maintain a fixed shape or volume.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">To counteract these limitations in plasma length and stability, the methods and apparatuses described herein may utilize an extension tube, which extends downward from a core plasma tube into the reaction chamber. In some embodiments, the extension tube may concentrate energy from the microwave power source into a smaller volume, extending and directing the plasma at a greater length than would be possible using a conventional microwave plasma apparatus. In some embodiments, a length of a plasma may be tuned or altered by configuring one or more of the following parameters: power, plasma gas flow, type of gas, extension tube material, level of insulation of the reactor chamber or the extension tube, level of coating of extension tube, and geometry of the extension tube (e.g., tapered/stepped).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The process parameters can be optimized to obtain desired material characteristics. For each unique feedstock and desired material characteristics, process parameters can be optimized for a particular outcome. U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2018/0297122, U.S. Pat. No. 8,748,785 B<b>2</b>, and 9,932,673 B2 disclose certain processing techniques that can be used in the disclosed process, specifically for microwave plasma processing. Accordingly, U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2018/0297122, U.S. Pat. No. 8,748,785 B2, and 9,932,673 B2 are incorporated by reference in its entirety and the techniques describes should be considered to be applicable to the processes described herein.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The introduction of an extension tube into a microwave plasma apparatus may present additional processing challenges. For example, when the feedstock is heated by the plasma within the extension tube, the feedstock may adhere to the surfaces of the core tube (i.e., torch liner) or extension tube due to the proximity of the surfaces relative to the reactor chamber walls. This issue is particularly relevant for powder feedstock, which may stick to or coat the walls of the core tube or extension tube, which may undesirably affect the processing conditions and quality of the desired material. When the coating becomes too substantial in the core tube, the microwave energy is shielded from entering the plasma hot zone and plasma coupling is reduced. At times, the plasma may even extinguish and become unstable. Decrease of plasma intensity can result in a reduction in quality of a resulting material. In some embodiments, to prevent the feedstock from adhering to surfaces of the extension tube (or reaction chamber), a non-stick coating may be provided on those surfaces.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Furthermore, in some embodiments, an agitator, vibrator, or other device may be provided to prevent sticking and/or to remove feedstock particles from surfaces of the extension tube. In some embodiments, providing an extension tube with a specific shape may facilitate prevention of material accumulation on one or more surfaces of the microwave plasma torch. For example, a conical extension tube may prevent buildup on surfaces of the extension tube.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Another complication of providing an extension tube within the reaction chamber of the microwave plasma apparatus is that the extension tube may undesirably impact the circulation of gas within the microwave plasma apparatus. In particular, the extension tube may cause changes in system gas dynamics such that chamber gas is ingested into the plasma discharge area thereby reducing the processing power of the flame. This rising may undesirably quench the plasma being formed above. In some embodiments, in order to maintain proper gas circulation within the reaction chamber and prevent quenching of the plasma, the extension tube may be shaped, sized, and orientated such that the gas does not extinguish the plasma. For example, in some embodiments, the extension tube may be formed in the shape of a cone, or stepped, tapered, or otherwise shaped to allow proper gas circulation.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, an extension tube as described herein may extend downward into the reaction chamber of a microwave plasma apparatus.

In some embodiments, a feedstock can be introduced, via one or more feedstock inlets <b>102</b>, into a microwave plasma <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, an entrainment gas flow and/or a sheath flow may be injected into the microwave plasma torch <b>100</b> to create flow conditions within the plasma torch prior to ignition of the plasma <b>104</b> via microwave radiation source <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, the entrainment flow and sheath flow are both axis-symmetric and laminar, while in other embodiments the gas flows are swirling. In some embodiments, the feedstock may be introduced into the microwave plasma torch <b>100</b>, where the feedstock may be entrained by a gas flow that directs the materials toward the plasma <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As discussed above, the gas flows can comprise a noble gas column of the periodic table, such as helium, neon, argon, etc. Although the gases described above may be used, it is to be understood that a variety of gases can be used depending on the desired material and processing conditions. In some embodiments, within the microwave plasma <b>104</b>, the feedstock may undergo a physical and/or chemical transformation. Inlets <b>102</b> can be used to introduce process gases to entrain and accelerate the feedstock towards plasma <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, a second gas flow can be created to provide sheathing for the inside wall of a core gas tube <b>108</b> and a reaction chamber <b>110</b> to protect those structures from melting due to heat radiation from plasma <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Various parameters of the microwave plasma <b>104</b> may be adjusted manually or automatically in order to achieve a desired material. These parameters may include, for example, power, plasma gas flow rates, type of plasma gas, presence of an extension tube, extension tube material, level of insulation of the reactor chamber or the extension tube, level of coating of the extension tube, geometry of the extension tube (e.g. tapered/stepped), feed material size, feed material insertion rate, feed material inlet location, feed material inlet orientation, number of feed material inlets, plasma temperature, residence time and cooling rates. The resulting material may exit the plasma into a sealed chamber <b>112</b> where the material is quenched then collected.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the feedstock is injected after the microwave plasma torch applicator for processing in the &#x201c;plume&#x201d; or &#x201c;exhaust&#x201d; of the microwave plasma torch. Thus, the plasma of the microwave plasma torch is engaged at the exit end of the plasma torch core tube <b>108</b>, or further downstream. In some embodiments, adjustable downstream feeding allows engaging the feedstock with the plasma plume downstream at a temperature suitable for optimal melting of feedstock through precise targeting of temperature level and residence time. Adjusting the inlet location and plasma characteristics may allow for further customization of material characteristics. Furthermore, in some embodiments, by adjusting power, gas flow rates, pressure, and equipment configuration (e.g., introducing an extension tube), the length of the plasma plume may be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, feeding configurations may include one or more individual feeding nozzles surrounding the plasma plume. The feedstock may enter the plasma from any direction and can be fed in 360&#xb0; around the plasma depending on the placement and orientation of the inlets <b>102</b>. Furthermore, the feedstock may enter the plasma at a specific position along the length of the plasma <b>104</b> by adjusting placement of the inlets <b>102</b>, where a specific temperature has been measured and a residence time estimated for providing the desirable characteristics of the resulting material.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the angle of the inlets <b>102</b> relative to the plasma <b>104</b> may be adjusted, such that the feedstock can be injected at any angle relative to the plasma <b>104</b>. For example, the inlets <b>102</b> may be adjusted, such that the feedstock may be injected into the plasma at an angle of about 0 degrees, about 5 degrees, about 10 degrees, about 15 degrees, about 20 degrees, about 25 degrees, about 30 degrees, about 35 degrees, about 40 degrees, about 45 degrees, about 50 degrees, about 55 degrees, about 60 degrees, about 65 degrees, about 70 degrees, about 75 degrees, about 80 degrees, about 85 degrees, or about 90 degrees relative to the direction of the plasma <b>104</b>, or between any of the aforementioned values.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, implementation of the downstream injection method may use a downstream swirl or quenching. A downstream swirl refers to an additional swirl component that can be introduced downstream from the plasma torch to keep the powder from the walls of the core tube <b>108</b>, the reactor chamber <b>110</b>, and/or an extension tube <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the length of a reaction chamber <b>110</b> of a microwave plasma apparatus may be about 1 foot, about 2 feet, about 3 feet, about 4 feet, about 5 feet, about 6 feet, about 7 feet, about 8 feet, about 9 feet, about 10 feet, about 11 feet, about 12 feet, about 13 feet, about 14 feet, about 15 feet, about 16 feet, about 17 feet, about 18 feet, about 19 feet, about 20 feet, about 21 feet, about 22 feet, about 23 feet, about 24 feet, about 25 feet, about 26 feet, about 27 feet, about 28 feet, about 29 feet, or about 30 feet, or any value between the aforementioned values.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the length of the plasma <b>104</b>, which may be extended by adjusting various processing conditions and equipment configurations, may be about 1 foot, about 2 feet, about 3 feet, about 4 feet, about 5 feet, about 6 feet, about 7 feet, about 8 feet, about 9 feet, about 10 feet, about 11 feet, about 12 feet, about 13 feet, about 14 feet, about 15 feet, about 16 feet, about 17 feet, about 18 feet, about 19 feet, about 20 feet, about 21 feet, about 22 feet, about 23 feet, about 24 feet, about 25 feet, about 26 feet, about 27 feet, about 28 feet, about 29 feet, or about 30 feet, or any value between the aforementioned values.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Microwave Plasma Processing</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a microwave plasma process, the feedstock may be entrained in an inert and/or reducing gas environment and injected into the microwave plasma, the microwave plasma plume, or the microwave plasma exhaust. Upon injection into a hot plasma (or plasma plume or exhaust), the feedstock may undergo a physical and/or chemical transformation (e.g., spheroidization). After processing, the resulting material may be released into a chamber filled with an inert gas and directed into hermetically sealed drums where is it stored. This process can be carried out at atmospheric pressure, in a partial vacuum, or at a slightly higher pressure than atmospheric pressure.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In alternative embodiments, the process can be carried out in a low, medium, or high vacuum environment. The process can run in batches or continuously, with the drums being replaced as they fill up with processed material. By controlling the process parameters, such as cooling gas flow rate, residence time, plasma conditions, cooling gas composition, various material characteristics can be controlled.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Residence time of the particles within a hot zone of the plasma can also be adjusted to provide control over the resulting material characteristics. That is, the length of time the particles are exposed to the plasma determines the extent of melting of the feedstock particles (i.e., surface of the particle melted as compared to the inner most portion or core of the particle). Residence time can be adjusted by adjusting such operating variables of particle injection rate and flow rate (and conditions, such as laminar flow or turbulent flow) within the hot zone. Equipment changes can also be used to adjust residence time. For example, residence time can be adjusted by changing the cross-sectional area of the plasma, by, for example, extending the plasma.
