which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or the alike parts. The described embodiments are some but not all of the embodiments of the present disclosure. Based on the disclosed embodiments, persons of ordinary skill in the art may derive other embodiments consistent with the present disclosure, all of which are within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Similar reference numbers and letters represent similar terms in the following Figures, such that once an item is defined in one Figure, it does not need to be further discussed in subsequent Figures.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Based on the current pixel arrangement structure in the display panel, the display panel has problems such as poor text display effect, hidden lighting of a sub-pixel, and jaggedness when displaying an oblique line, etc.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a pixel arrangement structure in a display panel. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, based on an arrangement of first sub-pixels <b>1</b>, second sub-pixels <b>2</b> and third sub-pixels <b>3</b>, when displaying an oblique line, a problem of jaggedness inevitably occurs, which leads to the problem of poor text display effect. The first sub-pixel <b>1</b> is a red sub-pixel, the second sub-pixel <b>2</b> is a green sub-pixel, and the third sub-pixel <b>3</b> is a blue sub-pixel.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, adjacent sub-pixels are arranged in the form of edge-to-edge, which leads to a substantially large facing area between the adjacent sub-pixels. To achieve a high pixels per inch (PPI) display panel, the distance between several adjacent sub-pixels is substantially small. Because the turn-on threshold voltage of each sub-pixel is different, when the display panel performs display, current flows laterally along a common layer between adjacent pixels, and a problem of hidden lighting of the sub-pixel will occur.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, a turn-on threshold voltage of the blue sub-pixel is greater than a turn-on threshold voltage of the red sub-pixel, when displaying a blue picture, the red sub-pixel tends to be lighted stealthy.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The present disclosure provides a display panel. In the disclosed display panel, a new type of pixel arrangement structure may be provided, which may greatly reduce or even solve the existing technical problems, thereby greatly improving the display effect of the display panel.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a display panel consistent with disclosed embodiments of the present disclosure.
