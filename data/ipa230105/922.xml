In addition, the present disclosure relates to induced dopaminergic neuronal progenitors prepared through the method and uses thereof.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Parkinson's disease (PD) occurs due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons (DNs) in substania nigra pars compacta (SNpc), and it leads to a gradual deterioration of motor activity. Currently, the main process of treatment for PD patients is alleviation of the symptoms using drugs that increase dopamine concentration and electrical devices that directly stimulate neurons in the deep brain. Although this approach is effective in alleviating the motor symptoms of PD, it has a limitation in that the worsening of PD cannot be stopped.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, as a novel PD treatment method, a cell replacement therapy was reported in which human fetal midbrain is used for transplantation of dopamine-secreting cells. In particular, this therapy improved motor symptoms even with discontinuation of drug administration in some patients, while not worsening non-motor symptoms for more than 18 years. In addition, in postmortem tissue analysis of transplant recipients, donor-derived DNs were shown to maintain a wide innervation in the striatum for up to 24 years after transplantation. These results demonstrated that long-term survival of donor-derived functional DNs in the brains of transplant recipients was associated with positive outcomes of PD treatment.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in a double-blind study performed in patients with severe symptomatic PD, temporary and mild clinical effects were merely observed. It was confirmed that the number of viable cells was small after termination of the administration of an immunosuppressant, which was due to the immune rejection of the transplanted tissue and is expected to be the main cause of failure of the clinical trial. Furthermore, graft-induced dyskinesia occurred in some recipients, and their brains included serotonin neurons in the graft. It also had ethical issues relating to the use of fetal tissues and technical issues of a limited amount of cells. Therefore, in order to improve the effectiveness of PD cell therapy regimen, a new method for obtaining homogeneous and low immunogenic DNs is needed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Reprogramming technology is a technology that can convert the cell fate of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Human iPSCs (hiPSCs) are a suitable source of cells for autologous cell therapy considering their ability to differentiate into all cell types and their unlimited self-renewal properties.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In pre-clinical experiments using pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic neuron precursors (PSC-DPs) for the treatment of PD, the grafts showed good viability and effectively functioned as dopamine-secreting cells in rodent and non-human primate PD models. Despite such apparent efficacy, there is a possibility that undifferentiated PSCs may remain in differentiated cells, and due to the potential for tumorigenicity, there still remains the safety issue regarding PSC-derived dopaminergic neurons (PSC-DNs) in clinical use. In addition, it was reported that DPs differentiated from PSCs have limited proliferation ability and gradually disappear into DNs during repetitive subcultures. Therefore, for successful PD treatment, new cells that can proliferate more safely and stably are required.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Meanwhile, the direct reprogramming technology is another method for converting a cell fate, and may be performed by target cell specificity and/or ectopic expression of pluripotent factors. Interestingly, it was reported that direct reprogramming with at least one pluripotent factor can produce proliferable stem/progenitor cells. Importantly, it is becoming clear that cells reprogrammed by the pluripotent cell-specific factor-mediated direct reprogramming (PDR) method do not form tumors. In addition, human induced neural stem cells (hiNSCs) have the advantages that enable stable proliferation ability, long-term storage without changes in proliferation and differentiation during frozen storage, and ease of the differentiation process. Therefore, it is expected that PDR can overcome the limited proliferation and stability problems of PSC-DPs.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Previously, the present inventors had successfully produced mouse-induced dopaminergic neuronal precursors (miDPs) by a PDR method (Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2015-0015294). Thus, the present inventors performed experiments whether human adult cells are directly reprogrammed into human iDPs (hiDPs) by the introduction of pluripotent factors followed by activation of midbrain-specific signaling.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a method for preparing an induced dopaminergic neuron precursor, which enables successive subcultures from adult cells through direct reprogramming, has an excellent ability to be differentiated into dopaminergic neurons, and does not have the risk of tumorigenicity in vivo.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the present disclosure is to provide induced dopaminergic neuronal progenitors prepared from the method described above.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Still another object of the present disclosure is to provide induced dopaminergic neuronal progenitors distinguishable from the pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic neuronal progenitors.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Still another object of the present disclosure is to provide a pharmaceutical composition for preventing or treating Parkinson's disease.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Still another object of the present disclosure is to provide a method for preventing or treating Parkinson's disease.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Still another object of the present disclosure is to provide a use of the induced dopaminergic neuronal progenitors.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Still another object of the present disclosure is to provide a method for screening agents for preventing or treating Parkinson's disease.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Still another object of the present disclosure is to provide a mixture or medium composition for preparing induced dopaminergic neuronal progenitors.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Still another object of the present disclosure is to provide a method for preparing dopaminergic neurons.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">To achieve the above objects, the present disclosure provides a method for preparing induced dopaminergic neuronal progenitors (iDPs), which comprises a) introducing one or more genes selected from the group consisting of OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC into adult cells; b) culturing the cells in a medium containing EGF and FGF2; and c) culturing the cells in a medium containing FGF8, SHH, a Wnt signaling agonist, and a TGF-&#x3b2; inhibitor.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present disclosure also provides dopaminergic neuronal progenitors prepared by the method described above.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present disclosure also provides induced dopaminergic neuronal progenitors, in which (i) one or more genes selected from the group consisting of CORIN, FOXA2, and LMX1A exhibit reduced expression compared to dopaminergic neuronal progenitors derived from pluripotent stem cells; (ii) one or more genes selected from the group consisting of EN1, PAX2, PAX5, PAX8, and SPRY1 exhibit increased expression compared to dopaminergic neuronal progenitors derived from pluripotent stem cells; or (iii) the reduced expression of (i) and the increased expression of (ii) are exhibited.

That is, the expression refers to factors that function to maintain or acquire a cell's self-renewal ability or pluripotency. In particular, these factors may play a role in reprogramming cells, which have already undergone differentiation, into totipotent or pluripotent cells.

Bypassing Pluripotent Step During Process of Reprogramming hiDPs</heading><p id="p-0342" num="0335">Since reprogramming of hiDPs depends on ectopic expression of OSKM, which is a pluripotent inducer, there is a possibility that the hiDPs obtained through Example 1 were produced through a differentiation process after transient pluripotency acquisition.
