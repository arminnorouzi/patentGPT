Voltage regulators may be classified as linear regulators or switching regulators. While linear regulators tend to be relatively compact, many applications may benefit from the increased efficiency of a switching regulator. A linear regulator may be implemented by a low-dropout (LDO) regulator, for example. A switching regulator may be implemented, for example, by a switched-mode power supply (SMPS), such as a buck converter, a boost converter, a buck-boost converter, or a charge pump.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, a buck converter is a type of SMPS that may include: (1) a high-side switch coupled between a relatively higher voltage rail and a switching node, (2) a low-side switch coupled between the switching node and a relatively lower voltage rail, (3) and an inductor coupled between the switching node and a load. The high-side and low-side switches are typically implemented with transistors, although the low-side switch may alternatively be implemented with a diode.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Power management integrated circuits (power management ICs or PMICs) are used for managing the power requirement of a host system and may include and/or control one or more voltage regulators (e.g., buck converters and/or LDOs). A PMIC may be used in battery-operated devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, wearables, etc., to control the flow and direction of electrical power in the devices. The PMIC may perform a variety of functions for the device such as DC-to-DC conversion (e.g., using a voltage regulator as described above), battery charging, power-source selection, voltage scaling, power sequencing, etc.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The systems, methods, and devices of the disclosure each have several aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes.

Under light load conditions, certain three-level buck converters may operate with a discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) and a pulse-skipping mode. When the input voltage (VIN) is close to twice the desired output voltage (VOUT), however, the inductor current (IL) is limited and cannot go higher, even with longer on-time. For example, if VIN=7.5 V and the desired VOUT is 3.3 V, then the switching node VSW will be switching between 0 and 3.75 V (=VIN/2). Since VOUT is close to VIN/2, when the converter is turned on for about 400 ns, the build-up inductor current may be quite small (e.g., only a peak current of 383 mA). The normal three-level buck converter mode may not be able to achieve high power efficiency (e.g., at least 90%) with light loads because the converter cannot build up high inductor energy with one-time switching. Therefore, the three-level buck converter may operate with a higher switching frequency, which may lead to more switching loss and lower power efficiency.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a graph <b>400</b> of example power efficiency for a three-level buck converter (operating as such) for various load conditions. In the graph <b>400</b>, VIN is 7.6 V, VOUT is 3.3 V, and the curve represents the relationship between the load current (I<sub>out</sub>) and power efficiency. For small values of load current (e.g., 0.3 A), the efficiency drops from 80% down to 20%.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Certain aspects of the present disclosure operate a three-level buck converter circuit in a two-level buck converter mode during light load conditions, thereby providing a three-level buck converter circuit capable of operating in either a three-level or a two-level buck converter mode. With this configurable three-level buck converter circuit, when a light load entering condition is detected, the two-level buck converter mode may be enabled. When a light load exiting condition is detected, the three-level buck converter mode may be activated, in which the converter circuit operates as a normal three-level buck converter (e.g., with the four phases described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a first phase of the two-level buck converter mode, the three-level buck converter is in powering mode, and the switching node VSW is pulled up to the power supply rail voltage (e.g., to the input voltage of the input node VIN). To achieve this, transistors Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) are concurrently turned on (e.g., the switches are closed), and transistors Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>4</b> are concurrently turned off (e.g., the switches are opened). In a second phase of the two-level buck converter mode, the three-level buck converter is in freewheeling mode, and the switching node VSW is pulled down to the reference potential (e.g., to electrical ground at 0 V). In this case, transistors Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>4</b> are concurrently turned on, and transistors Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are concurrently turned off. Thus, the three-level buck converter behaves as a two-level buck converter when the two-level buck converter mode is enabled.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Operating the three-level buck converter in the two-level buck converter mode for light load conditions may significantly increase power efficiency. Based on the example presented above where VIN=7.5 V and the desired VOUT=3.3 V, the switching node VSW will switch from 0 V to 7.5 V with the two-level buck converter mode (as compared to 0 V to 3.75 V with the three-level buck converter mode). Thus, when the converter is turned on for one 400 ns period, the inductor current may build up to 4 A, which is more than ten times the current transferred using the three-level buck converter mode with this example (and also corresponds to about one hundred times more energy transferred to the output).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an example timing diagram <b>500</b> of a three-level buck converter circuit transitioning between three-level and two-level buck converter modes, in accordance with certain aspects of the present disclosure. Initially, the three-level buck converter circuit may be operating in the three-level buck converter mode, as shown. During certain modes, a current-sensing circuit may be sensing the load current (I<sub>out</sub>) and providing an indication of the sensed load current to the control logic (e.g., control logic <b>220</b> or <b>301</b>).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some scenarios, the load current may decrease and fall below a light load entering threshold (e.g., 300 mA) at time to. When I<sub>out </sub>is determined to be lower than the light load entering threshold by the control logic, the power supply circuit may enter the two-level buck converter mode (as indicated by a signal labeled &#x201c;2lvl_mode&#x201d; transitioning from logic low to logic high at time t<b>0</b>). Upon entering the two-level buck converter mode, the control logic may control the gate drivers <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> to drive the transistors Q<b>1</b>-Q<b>4</b> in the two-level buck converter mode, such that the inductor current (IL) has a greater peak current, as described above and shown by the inductor current signal in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The control logic may effectively control the transistors Q<b>1</b>-Q<b>4</b> to operate in the two-level buck converter mode with constant on-time (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) or with constant peak current.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Shortly after entering the two-level buck converter mode at time t<b>0</b>, the pulse-skipping mode signal (labeled &#x201c;skip&#x201d;) may be asserted (e.g., transitioning from logic high to logic low) to enter the pulse-skipping mode. While operating in the two-level buck converter mode, the output voltage (of the output node VOUT) may be sensed, and if the output voltage falls below a certain level, the skip signal may be deasserted (e.g., transitioning from logic low to logic high) to have the converter circuit enter the first phase and ramp up the inductor current (IL). The converter circuit may enter the second phase of the two-level buck converter mode according to the constant on-time or constant peak current operation and allow the inductor current to ramp down. The control logic may assert the skip signal to bring the inductor current to zero. The inductor current may be more frequently fired as the load current increases, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The control logic may cause the three-level buck converter to exit the two-level buck converter mode (and return to the three-level buck converter mode) when the light load condition is no longer present. To increase the stability of the control loop for the control logic, it may be desirable to introduce hysteresis into the circuit by making the light load exiting threshold greater than the light load entering threshold. For certain aspects, the control logic may monitor the load current (I<sub>out</sub>) directly and exit the two-level buck converter mode when the load current is greater than a certain current threshold. For other aspects, however, the current-sensing circuit may be sleeping during the off-period of the pulse-skipping mode (e.g., when the skip signal is deasserted). During these periods, the current-sensing circuit may not be available to monitor the load current (I<sub>out</sub>) and determine that the load current is sufficiently high to exit the two-level buck converter mode. Therefore, for certain aspects, the output voltage from the error amplifier <b>312</b> at the COMP node may be used to indirectly monitor the load current in the two-level buck converter mode. In such cases, when the load current is higher than the two-level buck converter mode's maximum current capability, the output voltage (VOUT) may start to droop at time t<b>1</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, and after some delay due to the integrator topology, the output voltage of the error amplifier <b>312</b> at the COMP node increases. When this output voltage at the COMP node is greater than a threshold voltage (e.g., 0.35 V, which may be higher than a pulse-skipping mode threshold), the control logic exits the two-level buck converter mode (e.g., the 2lvl_mode signal is deasserted) and enters the three-level buck converter mode at time t<b>2</b>. For a constant on-time operation in the two-level buck converter mode, the maximum current capability for the two level-buck converter mode may be based on VIN, VOUT, the inductance of inductive element L<b>1</b>, and the on-time interval (Ton). With these exiting strategies, the light load exiting threshold may be a current threshold or a voltage threshold.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a graph <b>420</b> of example power efficiency for a three-level buck converter, illustrating the hysteresis of the transitions between three-level and two-level buck converter modes, in accordance with certain aspects of the present disclosure. In the graph <b>400</b>, VIN is 7.6 V, and VOUT is 3.3 V, the same as for the graph <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. Starting from the far right in the graph <b>420</b> where the three-level buck converter is operating in a three-level buck converter mode with high efficiency and high load current, the efficiency of the converter decreases as the load current drops (e.g., from about 93% to about 87%). When the load current falls below the light load entering threshold (here, 300 mA), the converter transitions to operating in the two-level buck converter mode, and the efficiency increases (e.g., to 94%). If the load current continues to decrease, the efficiency remains high (e.g., above 90%) when operating in the two-level buck converter mode, even down to load currents as low as 10 mA or so. As the load current increases, the three-level buck converter remains in the two-level buck converter mode (e.g., even above the light load entering threshold of 300 mA) until a certain light load exiting threshold is surpassed. At this point, the converter may return to operating in the three-level buck converter mode.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Therefore, by using the three-level buck converter in a two-level converter mode during light load conditions, power efficiency may be significantly increased.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example Cfly Balancing for Two-Level Buck Converter Mode</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0055">For certain aspects, the three-level buck converter may include a voltage control circuit <b>600</b> for controlling the voltage V<sub>cfly </sub>across the flying capacitor Cfly during operation of the buck converter (e.g., control the voltage V<sub>cfly </sub>to a defined voltage of Vin/2 (half the input voltage)), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>.
