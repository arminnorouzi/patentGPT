Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of medical devices, and specifically to catheters for performing various diagnostic and therapeutic medical procedures where the depth of an ablation needs to be controlled. More specifically, the present invention relates to ablation catheters for treating cardiac arrhythmias by ablating near pulmonary venous tissue. Other exemplary uses for the present ablation catheters include the treatment of hypertension and ablation of renal tissue.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An ablation catheter according to the present invention includes an ablation head/spring assembly connected to the distal end of the main catheter body. A proximally-facing mirror having varied light reflectivity across its surface is supported at the proximal end of the ablation head. A system of optical fibers extending to a distal end of the main catheter body is spaced proximally from the mirror. When light from the optical fibers shines on the mirror, its varied light reflectivity is used to indicate to the surgeon the amount of force that the ablation head is exerting on the myocardial tissue during the ablation procedure. Optionally, the varied light reflectivity of the mirror is used to indicate the exact orientation of the catheter body and its ablation head inside the vasculature.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The human heart routinely experiences electrical impulses traversing its many surfaces and ventricles, including the left atrium. Just prior to each heart contraction, the heart depolarizes and repolarizes as electrical currents spread across the heart and throughout the body. In healthy hearts, the surfaces and ventricles of the heart experience an orderly progression of depolarization waves. In unhealthy hearts, such as those experiencing atrial arrhythmia, including for example, ectopic atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter, the progression of the depolarization wave becomes chaotic. Arrhythmias may persist because of scar tissue or other obstacles to rapid and uniform depolarization. These obstacles may cause depolarization waves to electrically circulate through some parts of the heart more than once. Atrial arrhythmia can create a variety of dangerous conditions, including irregular heart rates, loss of synchronous atrioventricular contractions, and blood flow stasis. These conditions are associated with a variety of ailments, including death.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Catheters are used in a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic medical procedures to diagnose and correct conditions such as atrial arrhythmia, including for example, ectopic atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter. Typically, in such a procedure, a catheter carrying one or more electrodes is moved through a patient's vasculature to the heart under fluoroscopy-guided observation. The electrodes may be used for mapping, ablation, diagnosis, or other treatments.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When an ablation therapy is desired to alleviate symptoms including atrial arrhythmia, the ablation catheter imparts ablative energy to cardiac tissue to create a lesion in the cardiac tissue. The lesioned tissue is less capable of conducting electrical signals, thereby disrupting undesirable electrical pathways and limiting or preventing stray electrical signals that can lead to arrhythmias. The ablation catheter may utilize ablative energy including, for example, radio-frequency (RF), cryoablation, laser, chemical, and high-intensity focused ultrasound.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Ablation therapies are often delivered by making many individual ablations in a controlled fashion to form a lesion line. To improve conformity of the individual ablations along the lesion line, it is desirable to precisely control the orientation of the catheter and its ablation head when the individual ablations are conducted, the contact force between the ablation head and the targeted tissue, and the ablation period. Thus, ablation therapies require accurate positioning of the ablation catheter as well as precise pressure exertion for optimal ablative-energy transfer into the targeted myocardial tissue. Inaccurate positioning of the ablation head in the myocardia may result in suboptimum ablation or inadvertent ablation of healthy tissue. Excess force between the ablation head and the targeted myocardial tissue may result in excessive ablation, which may permanently damage cardiac muscle and surrounding nerves. On the other hand, when the contact force between the ablation head and the targeted myocardial tissue is below a target force, the efficacy of the ablation therapy may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, for a successful outcome, it is not enough to precisely control the applied force of the ablation head against myocardial tissue under conventional fluoroscopy-guided locational observation. Instead, it is important to precisely control both the force exerted by the ablation head against myocardial tissue and the orientation of the ablation catheter in the myocardium. Both are required.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, there is a need for an improved ablation catheter that is suitable for performing various diagnostic and therapeutic medical procedures to diagnose and correct conditions, such as atrial arrhythmia, where both the orientation of the catheter in the vasculature and the force exerted by the ablation head against myocardial tissue are precisely controlled. The present ablation catheter provides these advantages.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">To overcome the shortcomings of conventional methods for tracking the path of an ablation catheter through the vasculature to the target myocardial tissue, an ablation catheter according to the present invention has a spring assembly connected between the distal end of a main catheter body and an ablation head. At least three optical fibers are supported by the catheter body. At least three mirrors, each of whose light reflectivity varies across its surface, is supported by the ablation head. The mirrors face proximally but are spaced distally from the distal face of a corresponding one of the optical fibers.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In use, each of the at least three optical fibers is optically connected to a light source and a light power detector. Light of a defined power emitted by the light source into each optical fiber shines on the corresponding mirror and a percentage of the defined light power (a reflected light percentage) is reflected toward the optical fiber. Then, a percentage of the reflected light percentage is captured by and travels down each optical fiber to a dedicated light power detector connected to a controller.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In other words, a percentage of the light power emitted by the light source into each optical fiber is reflected by the corresponding mirror toward the distal face of the optical fiber. Then, a lesser percentage of the reflected light percentage is captured by (a captured light percentage) and travels back down the optical fiber to the light power detector. The detector is configured to determine the intensity or power in the reflected and captured light with respect to the defined power of the light emitted by the light source into the optical fiber. The reflected and captured light received by the light power detector has a somewhat lesser power than the originally emitted light. The controller is programmed to determine the difference between the power of the originally emitted light and that of the reflected and captured light received by the detector and to convert that difference into a force imparted to the ablation head in the vasculature.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, in a neutral orientation without any axial or lateral forces imparted to the ablation head, the ablation head is aligned along the longitudinal axis of the catheter body with each of the mirrors spaced a first distance from the distal face of the at least three optical fibers. Then, with only an axial force but no lateral force imparted to the ablation head, the ablation head is still axially aligned with the main catheter body, but now the mirrors are at a second, lesser distance from the distal face of each of the at least three optical fibers. Since the mirrors are closer to the distal faces of the optical fibers, the diminution in power of the reflected and captured light that travels back down each of the optical fibers to the dedicated light power detector is less than with the mirror at the first, greater distance from the optical fibers. In other words, the power of the reflected and captured light is greater with the mirrors at a closer distance to the distal face of each of the at least three optical fibers. The controller connected to the light power detectors is programmed to convert the difference in reflected and captured light power with the mirrors spaced at the first and second distances from the distal faces of the at least three optical fibers into a magnitude of the axial force imparted to the ablation head.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, according to the present invention, the mirrors are provided with a patterned reflectance that varies along a radius from a central area of reflectance. The patterned reflectance of the mirrors means that the position of the ablation head in an x, y, z coordinate system can be performed with precise accuracy. The patterned reflectance of the mirrors comprises a central area of reflectance having a first light reflectance R<sub>1 </sub>and at least one annular ring of reflectance having a second light reflectance R<sub>2</sub>. Reflectance R<sub>1 </sub>is different than reflectance R<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the case without any axial or lateral force imparted to the ablation head, first percentages of the defined light power from each of the mirror reflectances R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>are reflected toward the distal face of the corresponding optical fiber. Then, second, lesser percentages of the first percentages are captured by and travel down the optical fiber to the light power detector connected to the controller. The first percentages are less than the defined light power that was initially emitted into the optical fiber by the light source and the second percentages are less than the first percentages.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the situation with only an axial force imparted to the ablation head, the ablation head is still axially aligned with the main catheter body, but the mirrors are spaced a second distance from the distal face of each of the at least three optical fibers. The second distance is less than the first distance. In this orientation, axial force dependent reflected and captured percentages of the defined light power from the mirror reflectances R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>are received by the controller via each of the optical fibers. The controller then calculates the magnitude of the axial force imparted to the ablation head by comparing reflected and captured percentages of light power from the mirror reflectances R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>without any axial force to that of the reflected and captured percentages of the defined light power from the mirror reflectances R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>under the imparted axial force to determine the distance the ablation head has moved along a longitudinal axis, and hence the magnitude of the axial force imparted to the ablation head.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The magnitude of the axial force is based on Hooke's law, which states that the force (F) needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance (x) scales linearly with respect to that distance. That is, F<sub>s</sub>=kx, where k is a constant factor characteristic of the spring (i.e., its stiffness), and x is small compared to the total possible deformation of the spring.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Continuing, in the situation where both axial and lateral forces are imparted to the ablation head, the ablation head deflects out of both axial and lateral alignment with respect to the main catheter body and the distal faces of each of the optical fibers. Each mirror is now spaced a third distance from the distal face of each of the at least three optical fibers, the third distance being different than the first and second distances. In comparison to the reflected and captured percentages of the defined light power from the mirror reflectances R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>without any axial force or with only an axial force, axial and lateral force induced reflected and captured percentages of the defined light power from the mirror reflectances R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>reflect toward the distal face of each of the optical fibers with a different percentage of the reflected light power captured by and traveling along each of the optical fibers to the corresponding light power detector. The controller calculates the magnitude and vector of the axial and lateral forces imparted to the ablation head from the reflected and captured percentages of the defined light power from the reflectances R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>of each of the at least three mirrors in comparison to those percentages without any axial force or with only an axial force imparted to the ablation head. It is that each of the at least three mirrors have at least the two mirror reflectances R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>that enables the controller to determine the magnitude of the axial and lateral forces imparted to the ablation head of the catheter. The axial and lateral force vectors are related to the precise pressure being exerted by the ablation head against the targeted myocardial tissue and, in turn, the ablative-energy being transferred into the myocardial tissue.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition to determining the amount of force that the ablation head is exerting against body tissue, for example, myocardial tissue, the controller is programmed to use the axial and lateral forces imparted to the ablation head to determine an exact orientational value in an x, y, z coordinate system of the ablation head out of axial alignment with the main catheter body. The controller is programmed to present the orientational and force data in real-time on a visual display.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">If desired, each of the at least three mirrors have a patterned reflectance comprising the central area of reflectance having the first light reflectance R<sub>1 </sub>and at least a first, second, and third annular rings of reflectance having respective second, third and fourth light reflectances R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>4 </sub>at progressively greater first, second and third radial distances from the central area of reflectance; the mirror reflectances R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>4 </sub>are different from each other.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a further embodiment of an ablation catheter according to the present invention, the patterned reflectances comprising the central area of reflectance R<sub>1 </sub>and the second, third and fourth reflectances R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>4 </sub>of the respective first, second and third annular rings of reflectance are each divided into quadrants of reflectances; the quadrants of reflectances of each of the mirror reflectances R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>4 </sub>are different from each other.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Moreover, in another embodiment of an ablation catheter according to the present invention, the patterned reflectance comprising the central area of reflectance R<sub>1 </sub>and the second, third and fourth reflectances R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>4 </sub>of the respective first, second and third annular rings of reflectance are each divided into fractional segments of reflectances; the fractional segments of reflectances of each of the mirror reflectances R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>4 </sub>are different from each other.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">If desired, the controller also uses the force data at the ablation head to generate an input signal to an electromechanical vibrator integrated into the catheter's handle so that the surgeon receives force feedback at the hand. This increased feedback to the surgeon helps reduce the risk of damaging vasculature tissue, speeds up medical procedures and reduces contrast fluid and x-ray use. Also, the force data correlates with the contact force between the ablation head and the targeted tissue. Ablation therapies require accurate positioning of the ablation catheter as well as precise pressure exertion for optimal ablative-energy transfer into the targeted myocardial tissue. Excess force between the ablation head and the targeted myocardial tissue may result in excessive ablation, which may permanently damage cardiac muscle and surrounding nerves. Conversely, when the contact force between the ablation head and the myocardial tissue is below a target force, the efficacy of the ablation therapy may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further embodiments of an ablation catheter according to the present invention include push-pull wires extending from the handle connected to a proximal end of the catheter to the ablation head. Manipulation of actuators in the handle move the push-pull wires to selectively deflect the ablation head. As previously discussed, in addition to being programmed to determine the amount of force that the ablation head is exerting against myocardial tissue, the controller is programmed to use the reflected and captured light power percentages of the defined light power from the at least two reflectances R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>of each of the at least three mirrors in comparison to those percentages without any axial force or with only an axial force imparted to the ablation head to determine an exact orientational value of the ablation head out of axial alignment with the catheter sidewall. In this embodiment, the orientation of the ablation head caused by manipulation of the push-pull wires is first ascertained and then when the ablation head is pressed against myocardial tissue, any added change in the reflected and captured light power percentages of the defined light power from the at least two reflectances R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>of each of the at least three mirrors in comparison to those percentages without any axial force or with only an axial force imparted to the ablation head is used to calculate the additional force vector resulting from contact with myocardial tissue.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">These and other aspects of the present invention will become increasingly more apparent to those skilled in the art by reference to the following detailed description and to the appended drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view of an exemplary ablation catheter system <b>10</b> comprising an ablation catheter <b>12</b> having at least three mirrors corresponding to respective optical fibers extending to a handle <b>20</b> connected to an optical connector <b>56</b> and an external optical cable <b>58</b> supporting external optical fibers <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> optically connected to respective light sources <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> and light power detectors <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> and <b>84</b>, all connected to a controller having a visual display <b>88</b> according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of an ablation catheter <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a slotted spring <b>30</b>A that is useful with the ablation catheter <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a plan view of the reflective surface <b>90</b> of the catheter mirrors <b>50</b>A, <b>50</b>B and <b>50</b>C patterned so that light reflectance varies along a radius radiating outwardly from a central area of light reflectivity <b>92</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a schematic view of the ablation catheter <b>12</b> having the mirrors <b>50</b>A, <b>50</b>B and <b>50</b>C shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> spaced about the circumference of a proximally-extending annular inner sleeve <b>24</b>D of the ablation head <b>24</b> of the catheter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a plan view of the reflective surface <b>90</b> of the catheter mirrors <b>50</b>A&#x2032;, <b>50</b>B&#x2032;

The catheter body <b>18</b> is formed of a polymeric material, such as of PEBAX, encasing a tubular wire braided as a mesh. A liner of a second polymeric material, for example PTFE, resides inside the PEBAX tube. The PTFE liner provides the main delivery lumen <b>26</b> with sufficient lubricity so that medical instruments, devices, and the like, slide through the lumen with a minimal amount of force.

However, this drawing shows that the shining light areas <b>120</b>A and <b>122</b>A have shifted on the reflective surfaces <b>90</b> of the mirrors <b>50</b>A and <b>50</b>B. The light beam <b>120</b> from the optical fiber <b>14</b> now shins on a portion of the central area of light reflectivity <b>92</b> and portions of both the first and second rings of light reflectivity <b>94</b> and <b>96</b>. Simultaneously, the light beam <b>122</b> from optical fiber <b>16</b> shins on a greater portion of the central area of light reflectivity <b>92</b> and greater portions of the first and second rings of light reflectivities <b>94</b> and <b>96</b>. That is because the axial and lateral forces <b>188</b>A and <b>118</b>B have caused the ablation head <b>24</b> to move laterally toward optical fiber <b>14</b> but further away from optical fiber <b>16</b>. The closer the distance from an optical fiber to the reflective surface of a mirror, the tighter or more confined the shinning light in on the surface of that mirror. Conversely, the further the distance from an optical fiber to the surface of a mirror, the broader or less confined the shinning light is on the reflective surface of the mirror. The light shinning from the third internal optical fiber that is not shown in the drawings is at a different distance from its mirror <b>50</b>C, which results in a different pattern of light reflectivity from that mirror <b>50</b>C back to the controller.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Thus, any change in the percentage of light captured by the three internal optical fibers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and the third optical fiber (not shown) following reflection from the reflective surfaces <b>90</b> of the respective mirrors <b>50</b>A, <b>50</b>B and <b>50</b>C back to the distal faces <b>14</b>A, <b>16</b>A of the optical fibers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and the third optical fiber (not shown) with respect to the percentages of light captured with the catheter <b>12</b> in the first state without an axial force being applied to the ablation head <b>24</b> or with respect to the reflected percentages of light captured with the catheter <b>12</b> in the second state with only an axial force but no lateral force being imparted to the ablation head <b>24</b> is indicative of forces of different axial and lateral magnitudes being applied to the ablation head. Then, relative change of the percentages of light captured by each of the internal optical fibers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and the third optical fiber (not shown) is converted by the controller <b>86</b> into a value related to the force that the ablation head <b>24</b> is exerting against body tissue. The controller <b>86</b> is also programmed to calculate a spatial orientation in an x, y, z coordinate system of the ablation head <b>24</b> in the vasculature from the relative change of the percentage of light captured by each of the internal optical fibers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and the third optical fiber (not shown).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Moreover, change in the percentage of light captured by the three internal optical fibers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and the third optical fiber (not shown) following reflection from the reflective surfaces <b>90</b> of their respective mirrors <b>50</b>A, <b>50</b>B and <b>50</b>C back to the distal faces <b>14</b>A, <b>16</b>A of the optical fibers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> is with respect to the reflective surfaces shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>3</b>A, <b>4</b> and <b>4</b>A</figref> as described above for the state with no axial force imparted to the ablation head <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and with respect to the state with only an axial force but no lateral force imparted to the ablation head shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Further, the present invention can be practiced with an ablation catheter having a plurality of optical fibers, for example, more than three optical fibers. Moreover, the three or more optical fibers need not be evenly spaced about the circumference of the annular inner sleeve <b>24</b>D extending proximally from the cylindrically-shaped proximal head portion <b>24</b>A of the ablation head <b>24</b>. So long as the controller <b>86</b> is programmed with information related to the relative positions of the plurality of optical fibers and their corresponding mirror, the optical principals described above apply.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In various embodiments of the present ablation catheter <b>12</b>, the optical fibers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are a step index optical fiber, a graded index optical fiber or a photonic crystal optical fiber. In other embodiments of the ablation catheter <b>12</b>, the optical fibers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are a single-mode optical fiber, a multi-mode optical fiber, or a dual clad optical fiber. Still, in other embodiments of the ablation catheter <b>12</b>, a lens is placed between the distal face <b>14</b>A, <b>16</b>A of the optical fiber <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and the mirrors <b>50</b>A, <b>50</b>B to focus the light beam on the reflective surface <b>90</b> of the mirror.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In one embodiment of the present ablation catheter <b>12</b>, the proximal end of the optical fibers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and the third internal optical fiber (not shown) are uniformly illuminated by the light sources <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> to equally excite all bound modes so that the near-field pattern of the emerging light at the distal face <b>14</b>A, <b>16</b>A of each of the optical fibers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> approximates the refractive index profile of the optical fiber. In another embodiment, the light shining from each of the optical fibers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and the third internal optical fiber (not shown) passes through a mode scrambler to achieve a uniformly distributed light beam.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, this drawing illustrates that there is a visual display <b>88</b> connected to the controller <b>86</b>. As described above, the controller <b>86</b> is programmed to calculate the spatial orientation of the ablation head <b>24</b> in the vasculature and the force that the ablation head is exerting against body tissue, for example, against myocardial tissue. Among other useful information, the display <b>88</b> presents this orientation and force information in real-time in any one of a variety of formats that are useful to the surgeon.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">As previously described, during movement of the ablation catheter <b>12</b> through the vasculature (both forward and rearward movement), frictional feedback from the surface of the shaft of the catheter dominates the tactile feel in the surgeon's hand while tactile perception of the force acting at the ablation head <b>24</b> is minimal. Therefore, there is a risk of vessel injury including perforation due to the force of the catheter <b>12</b> including its ablation head <b>24</b> against vasculature tissue.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">To overcome this, axial and lateral forces applied to the ablation head <b>24</b> are not only fed back to the controller <b>86</b> for presentation by the display <b>88</b> as described above, but the controller also sends a haptic or tactile feedback signal to an electromechanical actuator (not shown) integrated into the handle <b>20</b>. Haptic or tactile feedback is the use of vibration patterns to convey information to a user or operator. Haptic feedback uses the controller <b>86</b> to send haptic feedback signals to the electromechanical actuator, which can be felt by the surgeon holding the handle <b>20</b>. Exemplary electromechanical actuators include a vibration motor, an eccentric rotating mass (ERM) actuator driven by an electronic circuit, a linear resonant actuator, and a piezoelectric actuator.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the ablation catheter system <b>10</b> of the present invention, an exemplary embodiment has the vibration increase in frequency or amplitude depending on the calculated force of the ablation head <b>24</b> against vasculature tissue. Further, the vibrational frequency can be varied to indicate the direction of the force while the amplitude of the vibration can be varied to indicate the magnitude of the axial and lateral force vectors. That way, the surgeon feels the magnitude and direction of the axial and lateral force vectors in his hand as the ablation head <b>24</b> of the catheter <b>12</b> is moved through the vasculature during a medical procedure.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">This haptic or tactile feedback to the surgeon helps reduce the risk of damaging tissue, speeds up the medical procedure and reduces contrast and x-ray use. Also, the haptic or tactile feedback correlates with the contact force of the ablation head against myocardial tissue as ablative energy is imparted to cardiac tissue to create a lesion in the cardiac tissue. The force data at the individual ablations also conveys information on the degree to which the cardiac tissue has been ablated. As discussed above, inaccurate positioning of the ablation head in the myocardia may result in suboptimum ablation or inadvertent ablation of healthy tissue. Excess force between the ablation catheter head and the targeted myocardial tissue may result in excessive ablation, which may permanently damage cardiac muscle and surrounding nerves. Conversely, when the contact force between the ablation head and the targeted myocardial tissue is below a target force, the efficacy of the ablation therapy may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">It is appreciated that various modifications to the inventive concepts described herein may be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
