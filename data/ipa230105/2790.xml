In them, an electrolytic gas reaction occurs under controlled conditions in which pure water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is formed from H<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>2 </sub>and energy is released which can be harnessed, for example by being converted into electric current.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The production of H<sub>2 </sub>is problematic. It is currently based on the combustion of fossil fuels and is therefore not CO<sub>2</sub>-neutral. However, it is known that during photosynthesis, photoautotrophic organisms can form hydrogen. Therefore, experiments have already been carried out on the use of photoautotrophic organisms for solar energy-powered hydrogen production. No CO<sub>2 </sub>is formed in this process.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cyanobacteria and green algae, for example, use solar energy and produce hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) by means of photosynthesis and an enzyme called hydrogenase. This formation of hydrogen, what is known as photobiological hydrogen formation (photo-H<sub>2 </sub>formation), is sustained for only a few seconds to minutes and the cells then re-consume the photo-H<sub>2 </sub>that is produced. It is assumed that the free-moving hydrogenase interacts with the photosystem I (PSI), accepts electrons from photosynthesis from there and uses it for photo-H<sub>2 </sub>formation. However, the bidirectionally-operating hydrogenase subsequently takes up the photo-H<sub>2 </sub>again and recycles the electrons elsewhere in the photosynthetic electron transport chain.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In-vitro systems for photo-H<sub>2 </sub>formation by means of hydrogenase and photosystem I have already been successfully tested. Ihara et al. (2006) describe an in-vitro system, in which a membrane-bound NiFe hydrogenase from <i>Ralstonia eutropha </i>fuses to the C-terminus of the PsaE component of PSI from the cyanobacterium <i>Thermosynechococcus elongatus </i>and the fusion product associated with PsaE-deficient PSI (Ihara, M., Nishihara, H., Yoon, K.-S., Lenz, O., Friedrich, B., Nakamoto, H., Kojima, K., Honma, D., Kamachi, T., Okura, I. (2006), Light-driven Hydrogen Production by a Hybrid Complex of a [NiFe] Hydrogenase and the Cyanobacterial Photosystem I. Photochemistry and Photobiology 82:676-682). Krassen et al. (2009) describe a similar system for coupling photosynthesis and hydrogen formation, wherein a PSI from <i>Synechosystis </i>sp. without a PsaE component was assembled with a fusion protein produced from PsaE component and a subunit of an oxygen-tolerant membrane-bound hydrogenase (MBH) from <i>Ralstonia eutropha </i>on a gold substrate (Krassen, H., Schwarze, A., Friedrich, B., Ataka, K., Lenz, O., Heberle, J. (2009), Photosynthetic Hydrogen Production by a Hybrid Complex of photosystem I and [NiFe]hydrogenase, ACS Nano 3:4055-4061). Lubneret al. (2011, 2010a, 2010b) describe a nanoconstruct in which the [4Fe-4S] cluster F<sub>B </sub>in PsaC of the PSI from <i>Synechococcus </i>sp. is bonded to a [4Fe-4S] cluster of a hydrogenase from <i>Clostridium acetobutylicum </i>via a covalently bonded &#x201c;molecular wire&#x201d; from an organic compound which may contain 3-10 methylene groups or one or two phenyl groups (Lubner, C.

No. 6,410,258 B1 describes a method for the production of molecular hydrogen by means of biological components, in which a hydrogenasc and a photosystem I complex are used, and in which the use of an exogenous electron donor can be dispensed with. Fusion constructs are not described therein.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The objective of the present invention is to enable the long-lasting and sustainable production of hydrogen on the basis of a biological system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a first aspect, the invention achieves the objective by providing a phototrophic cell, which in the wild type has a native photosystem I, PSI, with PSI components and a native hydrogenase, wherein the phototrophic cell has been genetically modified to the extent that</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">a) at least one of the native photosystem I components has been deleted,</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">b) the native hydrogenase has been deleted, and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">c) at least one fusion protein is expressed which comprises i. a hydrogenase or hydrogenase component and ii. at least one PSI component, with the proviso that the PSI is complemented by expression of the at least one fusion protein and the hydrogenase component exhibits hydrogenase activity alone or together with at least one further hydrogenase component which has been expressibly introduced into the cell.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">With the present invention, with the aid of a biological system which can function over the long term, it is possible to produce molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) with light as the energy source. The genetically modified phototrophic cell in accordance with the invention uses energized electrons for the production of hydrogen in photosynthesis, wherein the cells have been genetically modified in a manner such that electrons from the photosynthesis are preferably not completely withdrawn for the production of hydrogen, but continue to serve for the provision of reduction equivalents for maintaining normal cellular metabolism and preferably also CO<sub>2 </sub>fixation. Thus, the invention provides the possibility for light-driven hydrogen production by means of a phototrophic cell which is still viable and preferably also capable of division.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The term &#x201c;phototrophic cell&#x201d; should be understood to mean a cell that can use electromagnetic radiation (light) as an energy source and convert this energy into biochemically bound energy, i.e. energy-rich chemical compounds (for example adenosine triphosphate, ATP). A phototrophic cell may be autotrophic or heterotrophic with respect to the source of carbon, i.e. use CO<sub>2 </sub>or organic carbon compounds as the source of C. This includes that the phototrophic cell may also be mixotrophic, i.e. both fixes CO<sub>2 </sub>by photosynthesis and also uses organic compounds as the source of C. With respect to the hydrogen or electron donor, the phototrophic cell may be lithotrophic or organotrophic, i.e. use water or organic carbon compounds.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Unless clearly indicated otherwise by the context, the term &#x201c;photoautotrophic cell&#x201d; should be understood to mean a cell which is capable of using CO<sub>2 </sub>as the single C-source for the organic carbon compounds required by it, light by means of photosynthesis as the energy source and water as the electron donor. In this regard, the terms &#x201c;photoautotrophic&#x201d; and &#x201c;photolithoautrotrophic&#x201d; are used synonymously here. This does not exclude that the cell could also use organic compounds as the source of C or electron donor.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The term &#x201c;heterotrophic&#x201d; may be used here is a shorthand way of referring to organisms, for example bacteria, which use organic compounds as the source of C, the energy source and as the electron donor. In this regard, the term is used synonymously with the term &#x201c;chemoorganoheterotrophic.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The term &#x201c;photosystem I&#x201d;, also abbreviated to &#x201c;PSI&#x201d;, designates a protein complex of membrane proteins, which catalyses the oxidation of plastocyanin and the reduction of ferredoxin by means of the absorption of photons. The photosystem I comprises a heterodimer produced from the subunits PsaA and PsaB as well as further subunits. The heterodimer of PsaA and PsaB binds the 4Fe4S cluster F<sub>X</sub>. The other 4Fe4Ss clusters F<sub>A</sub>, F<sub>B </sub>are bounded by the subunit PsaC, wherein F<sub>A </sub>is located in the interior of the PsaC subunit, while F<sub>B </sub>lies on the periphery and transfers electrons to ferredoxin.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The term &#x201c;PSI component&#x201d; as used here refers to a subunit of the photosystem I or a functional portion of a PSI subunit. In this context, &#x201c;functional&#x201d; means that the portion of the PSI subunit together with the remaining PSI components forms a photosystem I which is capable of functioning in-vivo, i.e. within the photosystem I it can essentially carry out the function of a complete PSI subunit. In this regard, occasionally the formulation that the PSI component is a &#x201c;functional part as a component of the PSI&#x201d; may be used. The functional portion of a PSI subunit may, for example, be a N-terminally or C-terminally truncated PSI subunit, i.e. a PSI subunit which has been C-terminally and/or N-terminally truncated by one or more amino acids with respect to the wild type. Examples of PSI components are the subunits PsaB, PsaC, PsaD and PsaE, or N-terminally or C-terminally truncated variants thereof.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The term &#x201c;hydrogenase&#x201d; refers to an oxidoreductase which catalyses the reversible transfer of electrons between H<sub>2 </sub>and H<sup>+</sup> and therefore can form or activate molecular hydrogen. The synonymous term &#x201c;H<sub>2</sub>ase&#x201d; is also occasionally used herein. In particular, the term refers to an oxidoreductase with NAD(H), NADP(H) or ferredoxin<sub>ox(red) </sub>as the electron acceptor/donor (EC 1.12.1). An example in this regard is a bidirectional NiFe hydrogenase (EC 1.12.1.2). A bidirectional NiFe hydrogenase encoded by the Hox operon (HoxEFUYH) will occasionally be referred to here by the synonym &#x201c;Hox hydrogenase&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The term &#x201c;hydrogenase component&#x201d; refers to a subunit of a hydrogenase which either has its own hydrogenase activity or has hydrogen activity together with one or more other hydrogenase components. The term also encompasses a portion of a hydrogenase subunit which either has its own hydrogenase activity or has hydrogenase activity together with at least one other component. An example of a hydrogenase component which has no hydrogenase activity of its own, but which does have hydrogenase activity together with other hydrogenase components is a subunit of the diaphorase portion of a Hox hydrogenase, for example HoxU. The wording whereby a hydrogenase component &#x201c;has hydrogenase activity together with at least one other hydrogenase component expressibly introduced into the cell&#x201d; means that, under conditions which occur naturally in the cell, the hydrogenase component exhibits hydrogenase activity with the at least one other hydrogenase component which has been introduced into the cell in a manner such that it is expressed, spontaneously combine into a protein complex which exhibits hydrogenase activity.

Occasionally, the term &#x201c;homologous&#x201d; will be used as a synonym for &#x201c;native&#x201d; and the term &#x201c;heterologous&#x201d; will be used here as a synonym for &#x201c;foreign&#x201d; or &#x201c;originating from a foreign organism&#x201d;.

In particular, the term comprises the biosynthesis of proteins with the aid of the genetic information, occasionally including preceding processes such as transcription, i.e. the formation of mRNA on the basis of a DNA template. The expression wherein a protein, for example a fusion protein or a hydrogenase, is &#x201c;expressed&#x201d; means that the fusion protein is formed in the cell by means of the cell mechanisms which serve for the formation of proteins on the basis of a nucleic acid which codes for it, for example in that a nucleic acid which codes for the fusion protein is translated in the cell with the formation of the fusion protein. &#x201c;Expressibly introduced&#x201d; as used in this context having regard to a protein means that a nucleic acid which codes for the protein is introduced or has been introduced into the cell.

As an example, a photosystem I in which the subunit PsaC has been removed (deleted), is &#x201c;complemented&#x201d; by adding a fusion protein which comprises the PsaC or a functional portion thereof. In this regard, the previously removed native component is then reintroduced into the system in an identical or modified but functional form, for example in the form of a fusion protein with an additional hydrogenase domain, whereupon the system has been complemented. The expression &#x201c;the PSI is complemented by expression of the at least one fusion protein&#x201d; therefore means that with the formation of the at least one fusion protein the photosystem I is supplemented by that component or a functional portion thereof which had previously been deleted. If PsaC had been deleted, the PSI is complemented if a fusion protein is expressed which comprises the PsaC or a functional portion of PsaC which can substantially take over the function of the native PsaC within the PSI. If PsaC and PsaD have been deleted, the PSI is complemented if, for example, a common fusion protein is expressed which comprises both PsaC as well as PsaD or a functional portion thereof or, for example, two individual fusion proteins are expressed, one of which comprises a PsaC and the other PsaD or a functional portion thereof.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The term &#x201c;deleted&#x201d; means that an encoding sequence, for example a gene which codes for a protein, has been completely deleted or deactivated, so that the corresponding gene product is essentially not formed or is not formed in a functional form.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The term &#x201c;biofilm&#x201d; describes a living community of microorganisms, for example bacteria, in a film-like common matrix produced from polymeric extracellular material, for example exopolysaccharides and/or proteins.

A nucleotide is a compound formed by a sugar residue, a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic organic base (nucleotide or nucleobase) and a phosphate group. The sugar residue is usually a pentose; in the case of DNA it is deoxyribose, and in the case of RNA it is ribose. The nucleotides are bonded together via the phosphate group by means of a phosphodiester bridge, usually between the 3&#x2032; C-atom of the sugar component of a nucleoside (compound of nucleobase and sugar) and the 5&#x2032; C-atom of the sugar component of the adjacent nucleoside. The term &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; encompasses, for example, DNA, RNA and mixed DNA/RNA sequences.

As an example, the process is used in the case of polyploid prokaryotic organisms, for example <i>Synechocystis </i>sp., the genome of which is present in more than just one copy in the cell. In the production of mutants of such cells, a genetically modification is usually not necessarily present in all genome copies, so that cells result which, in addition to one or more genetically modified genome copies, also contain one or more genome copies of the (unmodified) wild type. In order to obtain cells where all of the genome copies in the cell are present in the appropriate genetically modified form, these are selected, for example by means of a suitable marker, for example antibiotic resistance. As an example, &#x201c;segregation&#x201d; in the case of <i>Synechocystis </i>can be carried out by multiple inoculation of the cells onto antibiotic-containing agar plates, wherein in the ideal case, all of the wild type gene copies are lost and are then segregated if all of the genome copies contain the mutated gene.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The invention provides a living genetically modified phototrophic cell, for example cyanobacterial cell, which is capable of forming photo-H<sub>2 </sub>efficiently and for as long as possible. This is made possible by means of fusion constructs produced from at least one PSI component and a hydrogenase or hydrogenase component, whereupon as efficient as possible and preferential transfer of electrons from the photosynthesis to cellular hydrogenase occurs and not, for example, to ferredoxin. The phototrophic cell in accordance with the invention in this regard, compared to a genetically modified cell which is not in accordance with the invention or compared to a wild type cell, preferably has higher photobiological hydrogen formation. Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) can advantageously function as an electron donor in this regard. However, organic compounds may also be used as electron donors.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The genetically modified phototrophic cell expresses a fusion protein from a photosystem-I component, for example PsaB, PsaC, PsaD or PsaE, or from a functional portion of PsaB, PsaC, PsaD or PsaE within a PSI, and of a hydrogenase or hydrogenase component. The hydrogenase itself has hydrogenase activity. In the case of a hydrogenase component, this may either itself have hydrogenase activity or combine with at least one further hydrogenase component in the cell together with which it exhibits the hydrogenase component activity. The further hydrogenase component is preferably introduced into the cell together with the fusion protein, advantageously with the aid of the same nucleic acid construct, so that the hydrogenase component fused to the PSI component in the cell forms a protein complex which has hydrogenase activity in the cell together with the at least one further hydrogenase component. In the cell in accordance with the invention, a native hydrogenase which is present in the wild type, which can use electrons from the PSI in order to form hydrogen, has preferably been deleted. In a native hydrogenase which is composed of several hydrogenase components, e.g. a Hox hydrogenase, preferably, the genes for all of the components have been deleted. The PSI component which is expressed as a component of the fusion protein in the cell, has previously been deleted in its native form so that the respective PSI component in the cell in accordance with the invention is essentially no longer expressed without the hydrogenase or hydrogenase component fused with it. Thus, a cell in accordance with the invention is genetically modified in a manner such that a PSI component which has previously been deleted is expressed as part of the fusion protein in the cell, so that the expression of the fusion protein leads to complementation of the photosystem I. This results in a functional photosystem I in the cell in accordance with the invention, wherein, however, a hydrogenase or hydrogenase component is fused with a PSI component. The wording according to which &#x201c;a photosystem I component which has previously been deleted is expressed as part of the fusion protein&#x201d; encompasses the case in which not the complete PSI subunit but only a functional portion of the PSI subunit, for example a C-terminally or N-terminally truncated PSI subunit, has been introduced into the cell with the fusion protein which had previously been deleted in its native form. A functional portion of the (deleted) PSI subunit is therefore capable of at least substantially taking over the function of the deleted native PSI subunit within the PSI.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The phototrophic cell in accordance with the invention produces photo-H<sub>2 </sub>via the fusion construct, but is still viable and preferably also capable of division. Preferably, the phototrophic cell is capable of growing autotrophically or even also heterotrophically or mixotrophically. Particularly preferably, the phototrophic cell in accordance with the invention is capable of growing photolithoautotrophically. In order to maintain the viability, the invention employs a fusion construct in which a hydrogenase or hydrogenase component is fused with a component of the photosystem I in a manner such that not all of the electrons from the photosynthesis are dissipated for photo-H<sub>2 </sub>formation, but a portion thereof can be used further by the cell for maintaining cellular metabolism and maintaining or building cell substance. Although the growth of the genetically modified cell in accordance with the invention is regularly reduced compared with the wild type, it is nevertheless present. Because the cells synthesize the fusion construct themselves, it is also not necessary to carry out extensive synthesis of them. Moreover, the in-vivo system in accordance with the invention of a hydrogenase or hydrogenase component fused with the PSI is more long-lived than in-vitro systems because of cell repair and regeneration processes.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The hydrogenase or hydrogenase component or the PSI component, for example PsaC, PsaB, PsaD or PsaE, or a functional portion thereof, in the fusion protein may be homologous with or heterologous to the respective components of the phototrophic cell. Preferably, however, homologous components are used. In the case in which the phototrophic cell is a <i>Synechocystis </i>cell, for example, the components contained in the fusion protein are preferably also from <i>Synechocystis </i>sp., or at least from a cyanobacterial cell. However, it is also possible to use suitable heterologous components or both homologous as well as heterologous components.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the fusion protein, the hydrogenase or hydrogenase component and the PSI component may be linked directly together or linked via a peptide linker, wherein the peptide linker merely acts as a spacer and does not have any enzyme transport or electron transport function.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the phototrophic cell in accordance with the invention, the hydrogenase or hydrogenase component in the fusion protein is preferably inserted into a PSI component or disposed behind or in front of the PSI component in the N-C direction. Both in case of an insertion and in the case of N-terminal or C-terminal fusion of the hydrogenase or hydrogenase component, a peptide linker may be provided as a spacer between PSI component and hydrogenase or hydrogenase component. The hydrogenase or hydrogenase component may therefore follow the PSI component in the case of C-terminal disposition of the hydrogenase or hydrogenase component behind the PSI component in the N-C direction immediately C-terminally or separated via a peptide linker. In the case of an N-terminal disposition of the hydrogenase or hydrogenase component, the hydrogenase or hydrogenase component may be in front of the PSI component immediately N-terminally or separated via a peptide linker.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The sequence of PSI component and hydrogenase or hydrogenase component within the fusion protein can therefore be N-terminus-PSI component-(linker)-hydrogenase/hydrogenase component-C-terminus or N-terminus-hydrogenase/hydrogenase component-(linker)-PSI component-C-terminus. PSI component and hydrogenase/hydrogenase component may immediately follow one another, so that the N-terminus of the hydrogenase/hydrogenase component immediately follows the C-terminus of the PSI component or the N-terminus of the PSI component immediately follows the C-terminus of the hydrogenase/hydrogenase component. However, PSI component and hydrogenase/hydrogenase component may also follow each other separated via a peptide linker, i.e. a section of one or more successive amino acids. In this regard, the linker acts only as a spacer and has no enzymatic or electron transport function. However, it is also possible to insert the hydrogenase or hydrogenase component into a PSI component, for example into a loop of a PSI component which in-vivo preferably lies on the side facing the stroma. The hydrogenase/hydrogenase component can therefore be introduced into a region within the PSI component in a manner such that the PSI component is still able to carry out its function within the photosystem I, but also has an introduced hydrogenase component which preferably is accessible on its surface, so that here, electrons can be transported out of the PSI. As an example, a hydrogenase or hydrogenase component may be fused into a loop of PsaB. The fusion protein may therefore also have the structure N-terminus-PSI component-x1-hydrogenase/hydrogenase component-PSI component-x2-C-terminus, wherein x1 and x2 represent both portions of the PSI component, x1 representing the N-terminal end, x2 representing the C-terminal end. The PSI component may be a C-terminal and/or N-terminally truncated PSI subunit. As an example, the PSI subunit may be truncated within an in-vivo stromal side loop, i.e. up to an amino acid within the loop, and the hydrogenase/hydrogenase component may be fused C-terminally or N-terminally to the truncated PSI subunit, i.e. to the remaining N-terminal or C-terminal portion of the PSI subunit. Here again, in each case there is the possibility that the hydrogenase/hydrogenase component is fused with the PSI component via a linker (or in fact two linkers in the case of insertion within a PSI component).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The fusion protein preferably consists of only PSI component and hydrogenase/hydrogenase component, which may optionally be linked together via a linker.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the phototrophic cell in accordance with the invention, preferably, at least one of the native PSI components (subunits) PsaB, PsaC, PsaD or PsaE, preferably one of the PSI components PsaB, PsaC or PsaD, has been deleted, and the fusion protein comprises this at least one PSI component, i.e. the complete PSI subunit or a functional portion thereof, for example a C-terminal or N-terminally truncated PSI subunit. As already described above, the PSI component covalently bonded with a hydrogenase or hydrogenase component contained in the fusion protein complements the native photosystem I, i.e. supplements the native photosystem I by the PSI component which has been deleted from the genetically modified phototrophic cell of the invention and which is therefore missing. If, for example, the PsaD PSI component has been deleted from the cell, the fusion protein comprises PsaD as the PSI component, or a functional portion thereof, and a hydrogenase or hydrogenase component fused with it. This is also the case with other PSI components.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the phototrophic cell in accordance with the invention, the PSI-H<sub>2</sub>ase fusion protein is preferably constructed in a manner such that in-vivo in the PSI, there is as small a separation as possible between a metal cluster, for example a NiFe cluster or 4Fe-4S cluster, of the hydrogenase and a FeS cluster of the PSI. The FeS cluster of the PSI may be F<sub>X</sub>, F<sub>A </sub>or F<sub>B </sub>wherein, depending on the fusion construct, one of the FeS clusters may be preferred, for example F<sub>B </sub>of PsaC. In the case of a bidirectional Hox hydrogenase with a NiFe cluster in HoxH and a 4Fe4S cluster in HoxY, it is advantageous, for example, for the separation between the NiFe cluster in HoxH or the 4Fe4S cluster in HoxY and F<sub>A </sub>or F<sub>B</sub>, preferably F<sub>B</sub>, of PsaC, to be at most 14 &#x212b;, preferably less. A suitable fusion protein was constructed for this purpose.

The phototrophic cell in accordance with the invention is furthermore genetically modified in a manner such that in the case in which HoxY is fused with the PSI component, HoxH is also expressed, or in the case in which HoxH is fused with the PSI component, HoxY is also expressed. HoxH and HoxY are those components of a Hox hydrogenase which provide the hydrogenase activity. By means of additional expression of the Hox component which is respectively not fused with the PSI component in addition to the Hox component fused with the PSI component, a highly functional hydrogenase within the cell in accordance with the invention is formed which is composed of HoxH and HoxY, wherein one of the Hox components is fused with the PSI component.

Preferably, the fusion protein is produced from PSI component and HoxY (or HoxH) as well as HoxH (or HoxY, if HoxH is part of the fusion protein) under the control of the same promoter, for example the promoter for the respective PSI component.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the context of the invention, the hydrogenase component which is fused with the PSI component, when this is a Hox hydrogenase, may also be a component of the diaphorase portion of the Hox hydrogenase, i.e. HoxE, HoxF or HoxU, preferably HoxU, or a functional portion thereof. The term &#x201c;functional&#x201d; as used here means that the portion together with other Hox components forms a functional hydrogenase in-vivo or under physiological conditions in-vitro. In this case, the hydrogenase portion of Hox hydrogenase (HoxYH) is also expressed, preferably under the control of the promoter which controls the fusion protein produced from PSI component and HoxU. HoxYH then binds in-vivo to the fusion protein produced from PSI component and HoxU. Again with an embodiment of this type, the Hox operon is initially completely deleted, and one or more nucleic acids coding for the Hox components are then re-introduced into the cell. In all variants, it is also possible not only to reintroduce one diaphorase component of the Hox hydrogenase into the cell, but to introduce two or all diaphorase components. This is also the case for the embodiment in which the fusion protein comprises one of the components HoxH or HoxY. Thus, for example, the invention encompasses the fact that HoxEFUYH has been deleted, and HoxYH then (with HoxY or HoxH, preferably HoxY, as part of the fusion proteins) is reintroduced into the cell together with HoxUFE, HoxFE, HoxUE, HoxUF, HoxE, HoxU or HoxF, preferably under the common control of a promoter, for example the promoter for the PSI component of the fusion protein.

By fusing the hydrogenase to the C-terminus of PsaD or a variant which has been suitably C-terminally truncated, binding of Ferredoxin can be blocked or at least made more difficult, so that electrons are preferably transferred from F<sub>B </sub>to the hydrogenase.

In order to circumvent the aforementioned restrictions and to maximize the photo-H<sub>2 </sub>production in-vivo, the bidirectional NiFe-H<sub>2</sub>ase (Hox hydrogenase) from <i>Synechocystis </i>was fused in-vivo with the endogenous PSI in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis </i>sp PCC 6803 (hereinafter <i>Synechocystis</i>). In this example, HoxYH was fused with the PSI component PsaD.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">It was previously shown that the turnover frequency (TOF) of this hydrogenase in-vivo is large enough to maintain the supply of electrons at the PSI step (25). Bidirectional NiFe hydrogenase (Hox hydrogenase) consists of a diaphorase portion (HoxEFU) and a hydrogenase portion (HoxYH). The diaphorase contains several 2Fe2S and 4Fe4S clusters, which mediate electron transfer from soluble electron donors such as ferredoxin, flavodoxin, NADPH and NADH to the 4Fe4S cluster of HoxY, which then reduces the active centre of NiFe into HoxH for the production of H<sub>2 </sub>(5, 7, 26-28). It has already been reported that the hydrogenase unit alone forms a hydrogenase (HoxYH) which, in the presence of the synthetic electron donor methylviologen (MV) can develop H<sub>2 </sub>in-vitro (28, 29). The deletion of diaphorase subunits in-vivo leads, however, to a reduced hydrogen production, which is probably caused by a reduced electron transfer to the active centre as well as unstable hydrogenase complexes (26, 30). Thus, in a preliminary experiment, a test was carried out as to whether the hydrogenase (HoxYH) alone could be expressed in a stable and active manner in-vivo, with the aim of then fusing only HoxYH to PSI.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Materials and Methods</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Construction of Plasmids</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">All of the primers used are listed in Table 1 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). PCR products of the upstream and downstream regions of the Hox operon and psaD were produced together with those of kanamycin and gentamycin-resistance cassettes (&#x201c;Km cassette&#x201d;, &#x201c;Gm cassette&#x201d;). The three products were then linked by means of a &#x201c;Gibson assembly&#x201d; (52) with pUC19 to form pDHOX and pDPSAD. In order to produce an expression construct for hoxYH PCR products from upstream and downstream regions of the Hox operon, the trc promoter (trp-lac promoter) and hoxYH with a 5&#x2032;-extension, which coded for the Strep-Tag, were amplified and composed into a Gibson Assembly with pBluescript SK-, which had been cut with KpnI and SacI, into a plasmid. In the case of the construct for the fusion of hoxY an psaD, four PCR products were produced: psaD up to the desired fusion site, the hydrogenase gene (hoxY, ORF6, ORF7 and hoxH) from the second codon of hoxY, the erythromycin-resistance cassette (&#x201c;Em cassette&#x201d;) and a downstream region of psaD (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). These four fragments were assembled in a single step by TAR cloning (53) in pMQ80 (54), which had been cut by EcoRI and NaeI. In contrast to the original protocol, the fragments only had 40 bp overlaps. For the cloning process itself, the protocol of (55) was employed. In brief, a single colony of the yeast strain BJ5464 was cultured overnight at 30&#xb0; C. on a rotary shaker with 200 UpM in 50 mL of YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose). The next day, the culture medium was diluted to a density of OD<sub>600</sub>=0.5. The cells had grown to a density of OD<sub>600</sub>=2 in approximately 4 h and were harvested at 3000&#xd7;g for 5 min. The cells were washed twice in 25 mL of sterile water and once in 1 mL of sterile water and then pelletized for 30 seconds at 13000&#xd7;g in a 1.5 mL beaker. Finally, the pellet was re-suspended in 1 mL of sterile water and 100 &#x3bc;L of cells were divided per transformation into separate beakers. A mixture of 240 &#x3bc;L 50% (wt./vol.) PEG 3350, 36 &#x3bc;L 1 M lithium acetate, 50 &#x3bc;l 2 mg/mL denatured salmon sperm DNA and 34 &#x3bc;L DNA was added to the cells, and the mixture was vigorously stirred. 2 &#x3bc;g of plasmid was used and the various fragments were added to the plasmid in a molar ratio of 1:1. After incubating for 40 minutes at 42&#xb0; C., the cells were pelletized for 30 seconds at 13000&#xd7;g, re-suspended in 500 &#x3bc;L of sterile water and plated out onto yeast drop out medium without uracil. All of the colonies which had grown after 3 to 4 days incubation at 30&#xb0; C. on a single plate were washed from the plate with sterile water. The cells were pelletized and the DNA was isolated using standard protocols. With this DNA, chemically competent <i>Escherichia coli </i>DH5a was transformed and selected on the respective antibiotic. Plasmids were purified out of the resulting colonies.

The mixture was swirled 4 times for 1 min at 4&#xb0; C., cooling in between for 1 min on ice. A fresh 150 &#x3bc;L of extraction buffer was added and the mixture was centrifuged at 3500 g, &#x2212;9&#xb0; C.

For the other, 30 &#x3bc;L of NADH extraction buffer (BioVision, California, USA) was placed on ice. Two 25 &#x3bc;L heated and two 25 &#x3bc;L unheated samples were placed in four wells of a 96-well mictotitre plate. For the concentration control, 2.5 &#x3bc;L of all of these samples was placed in wells with 22.5 &#x3bc;L of NADH extraction buffer. 50 &#x3bc;L NAD &#x201c;Cycling Mix&#x201d; (BioVision, California, USA) was mixed well and pipetted into each well and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. Next, 10 &#x3bc;L of NADH developer (BioVision, California, USA) was added to each well and incubated for 1 to 4 hours before the absorption was measured at 450 nm using a TECAN-GENios instrument (TECAN Group Ltd., Austria). The reactions were stopped after adding 5 &#x3bc;L of stop solution (BioVision, California, USA) to each well. The colour should have been made stable for 48 h with the stop solution and was sealed with film at 4&#xb0; C. The plates were then read at OD 450 nm.

The latter enzyme was therefore seen to be less attractive for biotechnological applications because with reduced ferredoxin compared with NAD(P)H, much higher H<sub>2 </sub>concentrations could be produced.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Based on experimental data and theoretical assumptions, it is now maintained that the bidirectional cyanobacterial NiFe hydrogenase also produces hydrogen, to the detriment of the reduced ferredoxin (5). However, these statements were then called into question because of contradicting data which claimed that NAD(P)H (albeit employed in non-physiologically high concentrations) rather than reduced ferredoxin was confirmed as the electron donor for the cyanobacterial enzyme (6). Thus, fresh investigations to find the electron donor for bidirectional NiFe-H<sub>2</sub>ase were undertaken, this time in an in-vivo approach.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Cells were cultured on either nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>) or alternatively on arginine as the source of nitrogen. Nitrate is reduced by ferredoxin in cyanobacteria (31). Thus, it can be assumed that the ferredoxin pool in cells which are cultured with arginine is reduced more strongly. Correspondingly, fermentative H<sub>2 </sub>production under these conditions was raised seven-fold (3.2 &#x3bc;M H<sub>2 </sub>(NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>); 21.2 &#x3bc;M H<sub>2 </sub>(Arg)) (see Table 2), which indirectly again indicates that reduced ferredoxin is the electron donor (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Until now, however, there have not been any methods to hand with which the Fdx<sub>ox</sub>/Fdx<sub>red </sub>ratio could be determined in-vivo.

It may therefore be that NAD(P)H is responsible for the production of small quantities of H<sub>2</sub>, exerts an activating action on hydrogenase and takes part in a bifurcation reaction together with ferredoxin (5, 7, 37). The above results clearly show, however, that reduced ferredoxin must be responsible for the production of large quantities of H<sub>2 </sub>and that the bidirectional cyanobacterium NiFe hydrogenase is therefore a biotechnologically attractive enzyme.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105">Expression of Hydrogenase (HoxYH) Unit In-Vivo</p><p id="p-0109" num="0106">In order to test whether hydrogenase (HoxYH) can be expressed in-vivo in a stable and active manner, HoxYH was overexpressed under the control of a trc promoter in a &#x394;hox deletion strain of <i>Synechocystis</i>.

Because HoxYH could be expressed actively and in a stable manner in-vivo, however, an approach was developed whereby only these subunits were fused with PSI.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0108">Construction of a PSI-H<sub>2</sub>Ase Fusion Product</p><p id="p-0112" num="0109">The efficiency of the electron transfer between Fe&#x2014;S clusters depends primarily on the distance between the redox centres, which should ideally be less than 14 &#x212b; (38). The vicinity of redox centres is more decisive than its mean potential (39). Shortening the distances from the 14 &#x212b; limit enables increasingly endergonic electron transfer steps (38). In contrast to in-vitro tests, the hydrogenase at the PSI in-vivo has to compete successfully with ferredoxin for electrons. The PSI is composed of several subunits, of which PsaA and PsaB are the two largest, which form a heterodimeric reaction centre with the chlorophyll pair P700 and the electron transfer components chlorophyll A<sub>0</sub>, phylloquinone A<sub>1 </sub>and the 4Fe-4S cluster F<sub>X </sub>(40). Three smaller soluble subunits PsaC, PsaD and PsaE are bonded to the reaction centre on the cytoplasm side. PsaC contains two 4Fe-4S clusters F<sub>A </sub>and F<sub>B</sub>. In the photosynthetic electron transport chain, plastocyanin releases electrons directly to the reaction centre and P700. The electrons are transferred from P700 via A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>X</sub>, F<sub>A </sub>and F<sub>B </sub>to the soluble electron carrier ferredoxin (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> as well). The binding site of ferredoxin is in a pouch formed by PsaE, PsaC and PsaD (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) (40-42). In their in-vitro assay, Ihara et al. (2006) bound the NiFe hydrogenase of <i>Ralstonia </i>to the C-terminus of PsaE which is remote from the ferredoxin binding site. This may be a reason for the preferred electron transfer onto ferredoxin instead of the hydrogenase in this fusion construct (20). In order to place the 4Fe-4S cluster of HoxY in the immediate vicinity of the 4Fe-4S cluster F<sub>B </sub>of PsaC, HoxY was fused with the C-terminus of the PsaD shortened by 35 amino acids up to glutamate 103, which is orientated in the F<sub>B </sub>direction, in which it surrounds PsaC in the manner of a clamp (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) (43, 44).</p><p id="p-0113" num="0110">The N-terminus of HoxY was fused directly to the glutamate 103 of PsaD without a linker. In order to coarsely estimate the distance between the 4Fe-4S cluster F<sub>B </sub>in PsaC and the 4Fe-4S cluster of HoxY in the fusion construct, the distances of the 4Fe-4S clusters to the amino acids on the surface of the respective proteins was determined and added. The largest separation within HoxY was approximately 33 &#x212b; to its N-terminus and the shortest separation was 13 &#x212b; to Tyr155 (45). Within PsaC, the largest separation was 12.2 &#x212b; to Pro29 and the shortest separation was 10.7 &#x212b; to Val28 or 10.3 &#x212b; to Glu26 (44). As a function of the in-vivo orientation of HoxY with respect to PsaC, it can be estimated that the 4Fe-4S cluster has a distance of approximately 23.3 &#x212b; (13+10.3) to 45.2 &#x212b; (33+12.2), which is well over the desired limit of 14 &#x212b; (38).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0111">In-Vivo Assembly of PsaD-HoxYH onto PSI</p><p id="p-0115" num="0112">In order to obtain a <i>Synechocystis </i>mutant into which the psaD-hoxYH fusion could finally be introduced, both the complete Hox gene cluster (hoxEFUYH) as well as the PSI subunit psaD were deleted, which produced a &#x394;hox&#x394;psaD mutant (hereinafter: &#x394;hox&#x394;psaD). The respective mutant was segregated in low lighting conditions (5 &#x3bc;E&#xb7;m2&#xb7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) in the presence of 10 mM glucose. Next, a fusion construct (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>) produced from psaDhoxYH in &#x394;hox&#x394;psaD was introduced in order to complement PsaD and to obtain the mutant &#x394;hox&#x394;psaD/psaD-hoxYH. The mutant &#x394;hox&#x394;psaD/psaD-hoxYH will be abbreviated here to psaD-hoxYH. The aim was to develop a mutant which preferentially transferred electrons from the photosynthesis electron transport chain to the hydrogenase (HoxYH) without completely blocking the PSI for other electron acceptors which are responsible for fixing CO<sub>2 </sub>and for photoautotrophic growth. In earlier studies, it was shown that the deletion or modification of the PSI subunit PsaD results in mutants with reduced PSI stability, reduced ferredoxin affinity and NADP* photoreduction. However, these mutants could still grow under photoautotrophic conditions, albeit in some cases at extremely low rates (46, 47).</p><p id="p-0116" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is diagrammatic and shown as an example of the structure of the plasmid for introducing a fusion of hoxYH onto PsaD.

The shortened sequence of psaD borders directly onto hoxY, followed by two open reading frames (ORF6, ORF7), which are located in the operon of the Hox gene (hoxEFUYH) and the function of which is unclear. The hoxH is adjacent, followed by a resistance cassette against the antibiotic erythromycin (EM cassette), which is used in order to build up selection pressure.

In contrast to the wild type, with psaD-hoxYH under dark anaerobic conditions, as expected, no fermentative H<sub>2 </sub>production was observed, because in psaD-hoxYH, diaphorase (HoxEFU), which is responsible for the electron transfer from the in-vivo electron donor to the active centre of the hydrogenase, is missing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) (26). Because of binding to the PSI, it can also be considered that the 4Fe-4S cluster of HoxY is difficult for electrons other than those from PSI to access.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0123">Under illumination, photo-H<sub>2 </sub>was produced both in the wild type (1.8 &#x3bc;M H<sub>2</sub>&#xb1;0.7; n=17) as well as in psaD-HoxYH (1.1 &#x3bc;M H<sub>2</sub>&#xb1;0.5; n=22) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A-C</figref>). The mutants had a much slower photo-H<sub>2 </sub>production rate (11.5 &#x3bc;M H<sub>2</sub>/h&#xb1;4.9) compared to the wild type (260 &#x3bc;M H<sub>2</sub>/h&#xb1;143), which indicates that the transfer of electrons between PSI and HoxYH in the case of psaD-hoxYH is less effective than in the wild type and could be optimized further (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>). The poorer electron transfer could be due to the estimated distance of 23 &#x212b; to 45 &#x212b; between the 4Fe4S clusters of HoxY and F<sub>B</sub>, which is over the target limiting value of 14 &#x212b; (38). However, while the wild type consumed the photo-H<sub>2 </sub>within a few minutes, the psaD-hoxYH culture maintained a high photo-H<sub>2 </sub>level for several hours (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A-B</figref>). This is in agreement with the concept that the hydrogenase in the WT takes up electrons for the photo-H<sub>2 </sub>production, then catalyses the reverse reaction and possibly feeds electrons back via the diaphorase and the photosynthesis complex 1 (NDH-1) into the photosynthetic electron chain (6, 7, 48). The immobility of HoxYH in psaD-HoxYH together with the lack of diaphorase is therefore highly probably responsible for the lack of photo-H<sub>2 </sub>pickup. The oxygen contents in the cultures were kept low by adding glucose and glucose oxidase and catalase to consume the oxygen, in order to prevent inactivation of the hydrogenase. Electrons dissipated from the glucose oxidation can enter the photosynthetic inter-system chain (for example via the photosynthetic complex I, NDH1) and finally reach the PSI for photo-H<sub>2 </sub>production (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). This process contains exclusively PSI without the formation of oxygen and therefore enables photo-H<sub>2 </sub>production on the basis of an anoxygenic photosynthesis. In order to test whether the observed photo-H<sub>2 </sub>is based on either oxygenic or anoxygenic photosynthesis or on both, DCMU was added, which specifically inhibits electron transfer from photosystem II (PSII) into the plastoquinone pool (PQ) (7). The addition of DCMU reduced the photo-H<sub>2 </sub>production both in the wild type and also in psaD-hoxYH, but did not cancel this completely, which confirms that PSII probably delivers electrons from the H<sub>2</sub>O oxidation for photo-H<sub>2 </sub>production in addition to another source.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0124">Long-Term Photo-H<sub>2 </sub>Production Under Anaerobic Conditions with Constant Lighting</p><p id="p-0128" num="0125">When WT and psaD-hoxYH cultures were left for several days under anaerobic conditions in constant lighting, a second photo-H<sub>2 </sub>production phase was observed in which both in WT (average of 15 &#x3bc;M H<sub>2</sub>&#xb1;8.3; n=8) and also, most impressively, in psaD-hoxYH (average 139 &#x3bc;M H<sub>2</sub>&#xb1;146; n=16), much higher quantities of photo-H<sub>2 </sub>were formed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).

The comparison of the maximum H<sub>2 </sub>concentrations which were obtained from the WT (23 &#x3bc;M H<sub>2</sub>) and psaD-hoxYH (500 &#x3bc;M H<sub>2</sub>) exhibited a 22-fold rise in the level of H<sub>2 </sub>in the mutant (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>). Interestingly, in contrast to the situation with short-term photo-H<sub>2 </sub>production, the mutants exhibited significantly higher rates of H<sub>2 </sub>production (12.5 &#x3bc;M H<sub>2</sub>/h&#xb1;5.8; n=16) compared with WT (2.1 &#x3bc;M H<sub>2</sub>/h&#xb1;1.8; n=6) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>). Typically, photo-H<sub>2 </sub>production in the mutant began sooner than compared with WT (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). To the knowledge of the inventors, the highest in-vivo concentration measured for <i>Synechocystis </i>cultures until now was approximately 50 &#x3bc;M H<sub>2 </sub>(11). By far the best cyanobacterial H<sub>2 </sub>producer identified up to now is the filamentary cyanobacterium <i>Lyngbya aestuarii</i>, which under fermentative conditions in-vivo, in the absence of externally added reducing agents, reached concentrations of 160 &#x3bc;M H<sub>2 </sub>(49).</p><p id="p-0129" num="0126">In order to test whether the observed H<sub>2 </sub>production was genuinely light-dependent, WT and psaD-hoxYH were initially left under anaerobic conditions with constant lighting until H<sub>2 </sub>production began. The light was switched off as soon as the H<sub>2 </sub>production reached high rates. The oxygen concentration dropped immediately because of the interrupted H<sub>2</sub>O splitting at PSII in darkness (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0127">The wild type still produced H<sub>2 </sub>in darkness (even at higher rates), probably by switching to fermentative H<sub>2 </sub>production.

Both cultures recommenced H<sub>2 </sub>production at the earlier rates as soon as the light was switched on again (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). The long-term photo-H<sub>2 </sub>production is thus clearly light-dependent, at least with psaD-HoxYH.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0128">Next, the possible dependency of the observed long-term photo-H<sub>2 </sub>production on the oxygenic photosynthesis with a contribution from PSII was investigated. To this end, DCMU was added to the cultures; this specifically inhibits electron transfer from PSII to plastoquinone and therefore ends H<sub>2</sub>O splitting at PSII (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). The observed results were not always consistent, because in some cases, DCMU reduced the quantity of photo-H<sub>2 </sub>produced (for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>), whereas in most cases the photo-H<sub>2 </sub>level rose even in the presence of DCMU (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>). Because DCMU did not clearly inhibit the long-term photo-H<sub>2 </sub>production, however, this process is clearly not primarily dependent on H<sub>2</sub>O oxidation at PSII.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0129">Because glucose, glucose oxidase and catalase were present in the measured cultures, in order to keep the oxygen content low, we tested the influence of glucose on the observed H<sub>2 </sub>production further. Unfortunately, in this case there were only two possibilities for keeping cultures anaerobic for several days in constant lighting: (1) Adding DCMU in order to block O<sub>2 </sub>development at PSII, or alternatively (2) adding glucose, glucose oxidase and catalase. Flushing cultures with N<sub>2 </sub>or argon in order to obtain anaerobic conditions would also have driven H<sub>2 </sub>out of the cultures and therefore rendered H<sub>2 </sub>measurements impossible. Thus, DCMU was added to the cultures in order to inhibit O<sub>2 </sub>production at PSII and to observe the influence of external glucose on the H<sub>2 </sub>production. In order to induce anaerobic conditions in the absence of glucose, prior to beginning the O<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2 </sub>measurements, all of the cultures were flushed with argon for 10 min.
