The power switch is typically controlled by operation of a feedback comparator and an on-time circuit, which cause the power switch to be turned on and off. The on-time for the power switch is generally held constant by the on-time circuit, during which time an output inductor and output capacitor are charged up by the input voltage to provide power to a load, and the output voltage increases. At the end of the on-time, the power switch is turned off, and the output voltage decreases. The off-time for the power switch may vary, depending on how quickly a feedback voltage (based on the decreasing output voltage) drops below a reference voltage, as determined by the feedback comparator. When the feedback comparator determines that the feedback voltage has fallen below the reference voltage, the power switch is turned back on for the duration of the on-time, and this on-off cycle repeats.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The on-off cycle results in the output voltage having a frequency component. During steady state operation, i.e., when the load does not vary significantly, the on-off cycle exhibits a relatively steady switching frequency. The switching frequency of the output voltage can cause undesirable harmonics in other components of an overall electronic circuitry due to electromagnetic interference. For some types of electronic circuitry, therefore, it is desirable to ensure that the switching frequency of the output voltage is maintained at a known desired value that will not unduly affect the other components in the overall circuitry.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The switching frequency is dependent on several factors, including the duration of the on-time. It is, thus, possible to ensure a certain frequency during steady state operation by adjusting the on-time. Some other factors that can affect the frequency are caused by various component parameters that result in propagation delays, deadtimes, and losses within some of the components of the power converter. Some of these factors are not very significant when the on-time is relatively long, in which case, a common relationship between the frequency and the on-time provides for a general design formula for determining the appropriate component values for the power converter circuitry. However, when the on-time is relatively short, e.g., approaching 100 ns or less, the general design formula does not apply, due to a greater relative effect of the various propagation delays, deadtimes, and losses within some of the components. In other words, at a relatively short on-time (i.e., a low duty cycle with a relatively high switching frequency), the typical circuit design can result in a switching frequency that is substantially different from the desired value, such that there is a higher risk that it can unduly affect the other components in the overall circuitry.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additionally, when a transient occurs (e.g., a sudden and significant change in either the load or the input voltage), the switching frequency can undergo substantial instability, or fluctuations, before settling back into steady state operation. Although this instability is temporary, it is desirable for the switching frequency to settle into steady state operation relatively quickly.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with some embodiments, an improved power converter includes an output, a power switch, a constant on-time feedback loop, a frequency error detector, a filter, a counter, and a pulse generator. An output voltage is produced at the output. Power is produced through the power switch for the output voltage in response to an activation signal that has an on-time and a switching frequency. The constant on-time feedback loop receives a feedback signal from the output and generates an on-time signal in response to the feedback signal. The on-time signal has a constant on-time and controls the on-time of the activation signal. The frequency error detector produces an error signal indicating that the switching frequency is not equal to a reference frequency. The filter is configured to produce a step up signal and a step down signal based on the error signal. The counter produces a count signal and is configured to increase the count signal in response to the step up signal and to decrease the count signal in response to the step down signal. The pulse generator produces an on-time pulse having a duration that is related to a value of the count signal. The pulse generator provides the on-time pulse to the constant on-time feedback loop to control the constant on-time of the on-time signal and to maintain the switching frequency at about the reference frequency.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with some embodiments, an improved method involves generating an output voltage by a power switch of a power converter in response to an activation signal that has an on-time and a switching frequency; providing a feedback signal based on the output voltage; generating an on-time signal based on the feedback signal, the on-time signal having a constant on-time; controlling, based on the on-time signal, the on-time of the activation signal; producing an error signal indicative of whether the switching frequency is lower than or greater than a reference frequency; producing a step up signal and a step down signal based on the error signal; producing a count signal by increasing the count signal in response to the step up signal and decreasing the count signal in response to the step down signal; producing an on-time pulse having a duration that is related to a value of the count signal; and controlling, based on the on-time pulse, the constant on-time of the on-time signal, the controlling of the constant on-time resulting in maintaining the switching frequency at about the reference frequency.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the step up signal is based on an overlap of the error signal and a switching signal having a frequency based on the switching frequency; and the step down signal is based on an overlap of the error signal and a reference signal having a frequency based on the reference frequency. In some embodiments, a low-error signal is produced when the error signal and the switching signal overlap, the low-error signal indicating that the switching frequency is lower than the reference frequency; the step up signal is based on the low-error signal; a high-error signal is produced when the error signal and the reference signal overlap, the high-error signal indicating that the switching frequency is higher than the reference frequency; and the step down signal is based on the high-error signal. In some embodiments, the step up signal is produced after N pulses of the low-error signal; and the step down signal is produced after N pulses of the high-error signal. In some embodiments, the N pulses of the low-error signal are consecutive; and the N pulses of the high-error signal are consecutive. In some embodiments, a counting of the N consecutive pulses of the low-error signal is reset when any pulse of the low-error signal is immediately followed by a pulse of the high-error signal; and a counting of the N consecutive pulses of the high-error signal is reset when any pulse of the high-error signal is immediately followed by a pulse of the low-error signal. In some embodiments, all or a portion of the error signal is blanked; the step up signal and the step down signal are produced when only the portion of the error signal is blanked; and the step up signal and the step down signal are not produced when the error signal is all blanked. In some embodiments, the error signal is produced only once every four cycles of the switching signal or the reference signal; a first edge of the reference signal is synchronized with a corresponding first edge of the switching signal immediately prior to a cycle in which the error signal is produced; and the error signal is produced at a time period between a second edge of the reference signal and a corresponding second edge of the switching signal.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a simplified schematic diagram of a power converter, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a simplified schematic diagram of a portion of a frequency control loop for use in the power converter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> are idealized timing diagrams for portions of the frequency control loop, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a simplified schematic diagram of a reference clock circuit for use in the power converter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>10</b></figref> are additional idealized timing diagrams for portions of the frequency control loop, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a simplified representation of a digital Ton pulse generator for use in the power converter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a simplified schematic diagram of a logic core for generating a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal for use in the power converter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a simplified idealized timing diagram of a PWM signal for use in the power converter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is an idealized voltage or frequency vs time diagram illustrating operation of the frequency control loop, in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>-<b>19</b></figref> are simulated voltage and frequency vs time diagrams illustrating operation of the frequency control loop, in accordance with some embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An improved constant on-time (COT) power converter <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> for providing electrical power (i.e., with an output voltage Vout and output current lout) to a load <b>101</b> from a supply voltage (e.g., an input voltage Vin), in accordance with some embodiments. The power converter <b>100</b> generally includes a constant on-time feedback loop and a frequency control loop (frequency locked loop, FLL) that provide for control of the switching frequency of the output voltage Vout, so that the switching frequency returns to (i.e., at or near) a predetermined frequency relatively quickly upon reaching steady state conditions after a transient occurs, e.g., when the load <b>101</b> or the input voltage Vin undergoes a sudden significant change. Additionally, the power converter <b>100</b> includes improved features that enable greater stability in, or faster settling by, the switching frequency, such that large fluctuations in the switching frequency are minimized in amplitude, severity and/or duration as the switching frequency returns to the predetermined frequency. In this manner, undesirable harmonics due to electromagnetic interference in the power converter <b>100</b> or in other components of an overall electronic circuitry (e.g., within the load <b>101</b> or other circuitry within which the power converter <b>100</b> is included) are mitigated, minimized or eliminated.

The voltage at the phase node <b>113</b> (highly variable between the input voltage Vin and ground) is smoothed out by the output inductor <b>104</b> and the output capacitor <b>105</b> to produce the output current Tout at the output voltage Vout with relatively small ripple (increase and decrease) for application to the load <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In general, the constant on-time controller <b>108</b> generates the high side gate signal at <b>111</b> to turn on the high side power switch <b>102</b> and turns off the low side gate signal at <b>112</b> to turn off the low side power switch <b>103</b>, so that the output voltage Vout will increase, for the duration of a constant on-time of a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal. Additionally, when the on-time of the PWM signal expires, the constant on-time controller <b>108</b> turns off the high side gate signal at <b>111</b> to turn off the high side power switch <b>102</b> and generates the low side gate signal at <b>112</b> to turn on the low side power switch <b>103</b>, so that the output voltage Vout will decrease, for the duration of an adjustable off-time of the PWM signal. As the output voltage Vout increases and decreases, the feedback voltage Vfb also increases and decreases accordingly. When the feedback voltage Vfb decreases below the reference voltage Vref, the constant on-time controller <b>108</b> adjusts the off-time to be shorter, so that it turns on the high side gate signal at <b>111</b> sooner, or more often, thereby bringing up the output voltage Vout. On the other hand, when the feedback voltage Vfb increases above the reference voltage Vref, the constant on-time controller <b>108</b> adjusts the off-time to be longer, so that it turns on the high side gate signal at <b>111</b> later, or less often, thereby bringing down the output voltage Vout. In this manner, the output voltage Vout is held relatively constant (i.e., with relatively small ripple), the output current Tout is held relatively constant during steady state conditions, and the output current Tout also increases and decreases in accordance with transient changes in the load <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the constant on-time controller <b>108</b> generally includes a comparator <b>114</b>, a logic core <b>115</b>, and a driver block <b>116</b> connected as shown.

An output <b>117</b> of the comparator <b>114</b> is a raw voltage feedback loop pulse width modulation (PWM) signal (PWM-Comp signal) based on the relative voltage levels of the feedback voltage Vfb and the reference voltage Vref. Thus, when the feedback voltage Vfb is greater than the reference voltage Vref, the PWM-Comp signal at <b>117</b> is a first logic level, e.g., logic high. When the feedback voltage Vfb is less than the reference voltage Vref, the PWM-Comp signal at <b>117</b> is a second logic level, e.g., logic low.

The logic core <b>115</b> operates such that a duration of the on-time (i.e., the duty cycle) of the PWM-signal <b>119</b> is based on or set by the duration of the on-time pulse Ton.

The reference clock signal may be at any desired frequency, e.g., 600 KHz, 800 KHz, 1 MHz, 2 MHz, etc. (as set, for example, by a trim bit or external resistor configuration), at which the output voltage Vout is expected to oscillate for the desired performance of the power converter <b>100</b> and the least electromagnetic interference. In some embodiments, the frequency of the reference clock signal may be based on or related to the desired frequency, instead of being at the actual desired frequency. For example, the reference clock signal may be divided down to a lower frequency for use with the frequency error detector <b>121</b>. In some embodiments, the reference clock <b>120</b> receives a control signal indicating the desired frequency at which to produce the reference clock signal. In some embodiments, however, the source of the reference clock signal is external to the power converter <b>100</b>, in which case the illustrated reference clock <b>120</b> represents this external source. An example embodiment of the reference clock <b>120</b> and its operation are described in more detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the frequency error detector <b>121</b> receives the reference clock signal from the reference clock <b>120</b> and the switching signal <b>110</b> from an appropriate location or node in the power converter <b>100</b> and generates or produces an error signal based thereon. Four alternatives are shown in dashed lines for providing the switching signal <b>110</b>, since the voltage at each of these nodes would generally oscillate at about the same frequency as that of the output voltage Vout, but only one of these connections would be implemented. Alternative sources for the switching signal <b>110</b> include the phase node <b>113</b>, the PWM-signal <b>119</b>, the high side gate signal at <b>111</b>, or the low side gate signal at <b>112</b>. Since the voltage oscillation at the phase node <b>113</b> directly drives the output voltage Vout, the phase node voltage would most closely match the timing of the oscillations of the output voltage Vout. The error signal produced by the frequency error detector <b>121</b> generally indicates that the switching frequency of the switching signal <b>110</b> (and thus of the output voltage Vout) is not equal to the frequency of the reference clock signal (i.e., a reference frequency), i.e., that the switching frequency is either too high or too low compared to the reference frequency. The error signal may be produced directly from the switching signal <b>110</b> and the reference clock signal or from signals that are based on or related to the switching signal <b>110</b> and the reference clock signal (i.e., signals having frequencies that are based on or related to the switching frequency of the switching signal <b>110</b> and the reference frequency of the reference clock signal). For example, in some embodiments, the error signal may be produced from signals having frequencies that are divided down from those of the switching signal <b>110</b> and the reference clock signal. Additionally, in some embodiments, the frequency error detector <b>121</b> produces the error signal only once in a predetermined number (e.g., 2, 3 or 4) of cycles of the switching signal or the reference clock signal, as described below. The frequency error detector <b>121</b> provides the error signal to the frequency error filter <b>122</b>. An example embodiment of the frequency error detector <b>121</b> and its operation are described in more detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b> and <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The frequency error filter <b>122</b> generally receives the error signal along with the switching signal <b>110</b> and the reference clock signal (or along with the signals that are based on or related to the switching signal <b>110</b> and the reference clock signal) and produces a &#x201c;step up&#x201d; signal and a &#x201c;step down&#x201d; signal based thereon, as described below. Additionally, only one of these &#x201c;step&#x201d; signals is produced at any given time, and sometimes neither is produced. The step up signal generally indicates that the switching frequency of the switching signal <b>110</b> is too low compared to the reference frequency of the reference clock signal, so the frequency needs to be increased or stepped up; and the step down signal generally indicates that the switching frequency is too high compared to the reference frequency, so the frequency needs to be decreased or stepped down. Production of neither of the step signals generally indicates that the switching frequency is the same as or is relatively close to (i.e., within an acceptable range or tolerance) the reference frequency. The frequency error filter <b>122</b> provides the step up and step down signals to the up/down counter <b>123</b>. The step up and step down signals are used to adjust the on-time pulse Ton to reduce the frequency error until the switching frequency is locked to the reference frequency. The FLL of the frequency controller <b>109</b>, thus, causes the switching frequency to track the reference frequency during steady state operation.

The up/down counter <b>123</b> is configured to increase a value of the count signal in response to the step up signal and to decrease the value of the count signal in response to the step down signal. The up/down counter <b>123</b> provides the count signal to the pulse generator <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The pulse generator <b>124</b> produces or generates the on-time pulse Ton, as described below. A duration of the on-time pulse Ton is generally related to or directly proportional to the value of the count signal. Thus, the pulse generator <b>124</b> generally increases (&#x201c;up&#x201d;) the on-time pulse Ton when the count signal increases and decreases (&#x201c;down&#x201d;) the on-time pulse Ton when the count signal decreases. The pulse generator <b>124</b> provides the on-time pulse Ton to the logic core <b>115</b> of the constant on-time controller <b>108</b> (i.e., the frequency control loop provides the on-time pulse Ton to the constant on-time feedback loop) to control or modify the constant on-time of the PWM-signal <b>119</b> and to maintain the switching frequency of the switching signal <b>110</b> (and thus of the output voltage Vout) at about the reference frequency. Therefore, the on-time pulse Ton is based on the count signal, which is based on the step up and step down signals, which are based on the error signal, the switching signal <b>110</b> and the reference clock signal (or the signals that are based on or related to the switching signal <b>110</b> and the reference clock signal). In this manner, whereas the constant on-time controller <b>108</b> drives the power switches <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> with a constant on-time for the high side power switch <b>102</b>, the frequency controller <b>109</b> causes the constant on-time controller <b>108</b> to set or modify this on-time to a duration or value that indirectly results in maintaining the switching frequency at about the reference frequency.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A conventional technique to set the constant on-time of the PWM-signal that drives power switches in a power converter is generally based on or proportional to a ratio of the output voltage Vout to the input voltage Vin (i.e., a quotient of the output voltage Vout divided by the input voltage Vin). A conventional design formula using this relationship then provides for determining appropriate component values (e.g., for components of a constant on-time feedback loop) for the power converter circuitry, which results in a switching frequency of the output voltage Vout relatively close to a desired switching frequency. However, when the on-time is relatively short (e.g., at or near 100 ns or less) or the switching frequency is relatively high (e.g., 600 KHz-2 MHz or higher), the typical circuit design resulting from the conventional design formula can result in a switching frequency that is substantially different from the desired switching frequency. This difference is generally due to the greater relative effect of the various propagation delays, deadtimes, and losses within some of the components (e.g., the comparator <b>114</b>, the logic core <b>115</b>, and the driver block <b>116</b>) of the power converter when operating at the shorter on-time or higher frequency. Nevertheless, in some embodiments, the output voltage Vout and the input voltage Vin (and their general relationship to the on-time) can be used for a coarse setting of the on-time pulse Ton, thereby resulting in a coarse, or first order, setting of the switching frequency. The coarse setting can be done whenever the reference clock signal is changed, or upon power-on or reset of the power converter <b>100</b> (or the overall electronic circuitry), or when a significant transient occurs in the input voltage Vin, the output voltage Vout or the load <b>101</b>. In some embodiments, the coarse setting is done by the sigma delta ADC <b>125</b> and the look up table <b>126</b>. The coarse setting is then followed by a fine, or second order, tuning of the on-time pulse Ton (and, thus, of the switching frequency) by the FLL operation of the components <b>121</b>-<b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The sigma delta ADC <b>125</b> generally receives the output voltage Vout and the input voltage Vin (or other voltage signals directly related thereto or based thereon). Based on these inputs, the sigma delta ADC <b>125</b> either generates a digital output that is indicative of or based on the output voltage Vout and the input voltage Vin (i.e., Vout and Vin values) or the ratio of the output voltage Vout to the input voltage Vin (i.e., a Vout/Vin value), or generates a stream of pulses representative of the Vout and Vin values or the Vout/Vin value. The sigma delta ADC <b>125</b> provides the digital output to the look up table <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The look up table <b>126</b> receives the digital output of the sigma delta ADC <b>125</b> and an indication of the selected or desired switching frequency (e.g., as set by the reference clock <b>120</b>) and generates an initial Ton width output. If the digital output of the sigma delta ADC <b>125</b> is the Vout and Vin values, then the look up table <b>126</b> includes a variety of combinations of different values or ranges for the Vout and Vin values cross referenced with initial Ton width values. If the digital output of the sigma delta ADC <b>125</b> is the Vout/Vin value, then the look up table <b>126</b> includes several different values or ranges for the Vout/Vin value cross referenced with the initial Ton width values. Given the digital output of the sigma delta ADC <b>125</b>, therefore, the look up table <b>126</b> produces a corresponding initial Ton width value as the initial Ton width output. The look up table <b>126</b> provides the initial Ton width output to the up/down counter <b>123</b> or the pulse generator <b>124</b>. The on-time pulse Ton is thus made adaptive by the Vout and Vin values, since the sigma delta ADC <b>125</b> enables adjustment of the on-time pulse Ton by the pulse generator <b>124</b> relatively quickly after supply and/or load transients.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, therefore, the up/down counter <b>123</b> receives the initial Ton width output in addition to the step up and step down signals. Whenever, the initial Ton width value changes, the up/down counter <b>123</b> resets the count signal to a value based on the initial Ton width value. When the reset count signal propagates through to the pulse generator <b>124</b>, the resulting on-time pulse Ton represents the coarse setting of the on-time pulse Ton. In other embodiments, the pulse generator <b>124</b> sets the width of the on-time pulse Ton accordingly when the initial Ton width value changes, so this setting represents the coarse setting of the on-time pulse Ton. After this resetting of the count signal or the on-time pulse Ton, the up/down counter <b>123</b> proceeds to adjust the count signal as described herein in accordance with the step up and step down signals. These adjustments represent the fine tuning of the on-time pulse Ton (and, thus, of the switching frequency) by the operation of the components <b>121</b>-<b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The operation of the sigma delta ADC <b>125</b> and the look up table <b>126</b> is generally faster than that of the components <b>121</b>-<b>124</b>, so that the coarse setting enables the frequency controller <b>109</b> to relatively rapidly cause the switching frequency to be set near to the desired reference frequency. Consequently, the subsequent adjustments by the components <b>121</b>-<b>124</b> do not have to make large changes to the on-time pulse Ton, which would otherwise likely cause unpredictable large swings or rings in the switching frequency that would take longer to settle to the desired reference frequency. The coarse setting, therefore, reduces the number of steps required and time to perform the subsequent fine tuning and adds to or assists with the overall stability or settling of the operations of the constant on-time controller <b>108</b> and the frequency controller <b>109</b> for managing the switching frequency, which results in a relatively good transient response.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows additional details of the frequency error detector <b>121</b> and the frequency error filter <b>122</b>, in accordance with some embodiments.

The switch and reference signals are provided to the D flip flops <b>201</b> and <b>202</b>, respectively, to divide both signals by two (&#x201c;Div/2&#x201d;) to generate half-frequency signals (&#x201c;switch half&#x201d; and &#x201c;reference half&#x201d; signals), so that a full period of the signals can be compared.

The error signal, thus, overlaps with only one of the switch half and reference half signals. The frequency error detector <b>121</b> provides the error signal to the frequency error filter <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the signal blanking block <b>204</b> receives the error signal and blanks all or a portion thereof, thereby outputting no error pulse or a reduced-duration error pulse as a blanked error signal. Alternatively, the signal blanking block <b>204</b> detects the duration of an on-time of the error signal, outputs the error signal as the blanked error signal only when the pulse of the error signal has a duration longer than a minimum pulse width and does not output any blanked error signal (i.e., blanks all of the error signal) when the pulse of the error signal has a duration shorter than a minimum pulse width. In this manner, error signals that have a pulse width of a relatively short duration are eliminated and not allowed to affect the subsequent components to contribute to the adjustment of the frequency of the switching signal <b>110</b>. Additionally, by eliminating short duration pulses from the error signal, the signal blanking block <b>204</b> provides a hysteresis with respect to adjustments to the switching frequency of the switching signal <b>110</b>, whereby unnecessary adjustments to the switching frequency are prevented from occurring when the switching frequency is close enough to (i.e., within an acceptable range or tolerance of) the desired reference frequency. The operation of the signal blanking block <b>204</b>, therefore, adds to or assists with the stability or settling of the switching signal <b>110</b>. Like the error signal, the blanked error signal overlaps with only one of the switch half and reference half signals. The signal blanking block <b>204</b> provides the blanked error signal to the AND gates <b>205</b> and <b>206</b>. For embodiments in which the blanked error signal is a reduced-duration error pulse, if the duration of the blanked error signal is too short for the AND gates <b>205</b> and <b>206</b> to respond, then the total blanking period is, in effect, longer.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The low AND gate <b>205</b> receives the blanked error signal (when it has been produced) and the switch half signal; and the high AND gate <b>206</b> receives the blanked error signal (when it has been produced) and the reference half signal. When the blanked error signal overlaps with the switch half signal, the low and gate <b>205</b> generates a low-error signal; and when the blanked error signal overlaps with the reference half signal, the high and gate <b>206</b> generates a high-error signal. Since the blanked error signal overlaps with only one of the switch half and reference half signals, either the low-error signal or the high-error signal, but not both, will be produced at any given time. Additionally, when the signal blanking block <b>204</b> blanks all of the error signal, there is no blanked error signal, so neither of the low-error signal and the high-error signal is produced in this situation. The low-error signal indicates that the period of the switching signal (or of the switch half signal) is too long (i.e., longer than the period of the reference signal or of the reference half signal) and the frequency of the switching signal is too low (i.e., lower than the frequency of the reference signal); and the high-error signal indicates that the period of the switching signal (or of the switch half signal) is too short (i.e., shorter than the period of the reference signal or of the reference half signal) and the frequency of the switching signal is too high (i.e., higher than the frequency of the reference signal). The low AND gate <b>205</b> provides the low-error signal to the low error pulse counter <b>207</b>; and the high AND gate <b>206</b> provides the high-error signal to the high error pulse counter <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The low error pulse counter <b>207</b> receives the low-error signal (when it has been produced) and generates or produces the step up signal after counting a series of N pulses of the low-error signal. The low error pulse counter <b>207</b>, therefore, generally includes a series of N D flip flops <b>211</b> connected as shown, i.e., with the low-error signal provided to the clock input of the first D flip flop <b>211</b>, the negative output (Qn) of each D flip flop <b>211</b> connected back to the D input thereof, the positive output (Q) connected to the clock input of the next D flip flop <b>211</b>, and the positive output (Q) of the last D flip flop <b>211</b> providing the step up signal. The last of the D flip flops <b>211</b>, thus, outputs the step up signal after the Nth pulse of the low-error signal causes the first pulse in the series to propagate thereto. The function of the low error pulse counter <b>207</b>, thus, represents a delay in the producing of the step up signal. Additionally, the high error pulse counter <b>208</b> receives the high-error signal (when it has been produced) and generates or produces the step down signal after counting a series of N pulses of the high-error signal. The high error pulse counter <b>208</b>, therefore, generally includes a series of N D flip flops <b>212</b> connected as shown, i.e., with the high-error signal provided to the clock input of the first D flip flop <b>212</b>, the negative output (Qn) of each D flip flop <b>212</b> connected back to the D input thereof, the positive output (Q) connected to the clock input of the next D flip flop <b>212</b>, and the positive output (Q) of the last D flip flop <b>212</b> providing the step down signal. The last of the D flip flops <b>212</b>, thus, outputs the step down signal after the Nth pulse of the high-error signal causes the first pulse in the series to propagate thereto.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some situations, it is not desirable to change the switching frequency of the switching signal <b>110</b> while the switching frequency is still rapidly swinging below and above the reference frequency immediately after a transient condition has occurred, because changing the switching frequency under this condition could exacerbate the swinging or fluctuations of the switching frequency. It would then potentially take longer for the constant on-time controller <b>108</b> and the frequency controller <b>109</b> to bring the switching frequency into steady state operation. Therefore, by producing the step up signal or the step down signal only after a count of N pulses of the low-error signal or the high-error signal, respectively, the frequency error filter <b>122</b> ensures that the switching frequency of the switch signal <b>110</b> has remained steadily too low or too high, respectively, relative to the reference frequency for a sufficiently long amount of time. Due to this count, therefore, it is relatively certain that the switching frequency is not rapidly swinging below and above the reference frequency, as would occur immediately after a transient condition has occurred. The operation of the low and high error pulse counters <b>207</b> and <b>208</b>, thus, adds to or assists with the stability or settling of the switching signal <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The value of N, and thus the number of the D flip flops <b>211</b> and <b>212</b>, may depend on the anticipated post-transient settling time for the switching frequency in a particular design, as well as on the length of the period of the switching frequency. Additionally, the number of the count N may depend on the system bandwidth, which is a function of several parameters. The higher the count, the lower the equivalent cutoff frequency of the frequency error filter <b>122</b>. Acceptable values for N have been determined to be 16 and 32; however, any appropriate integer value between 8 and 64 may be used and may even be higher or lower in some designs. Additionally, since the period of a lower frequency is longer than the period of a higher frequency, a count number (N) for the lower frequency takes a longer time than does the same count number for the higher frequency. However, the anticipated settling time for the switching signal <b>110</b> may not have this proportional relationship to the count number, so it may be appropriate to provide one series of the D flip flops <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> for a given design, but take the step up and step down signals from different flip flops within each series depending on the anticipated settling time for each desired reference frequency. For example, for a first reference frequency, the step up and step down signals may be taken from the Nth (or last) flip flop in the series; whereas, for a second, third or fourth reference frequency, the step up and step down signals may be taken from the Mth, Pth or Qth (i.e., any appropriate intermediate) flip flop in the series, depending on the anticipated settling time for each frequency. In this manner, the count for each frequency may take the same or a different predetermined amount of time as that for the other frequencies. Furthermore, although the number of flip flops <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> (and, thus, the count number) is shown as being the same for both error pulse counters <b>207</b> and <b>208</b>, it is understood that there could be one number of the flip flops <b>211</b> and a second (different) number of the flip flops <b>212</b>, since the anticipated settling time may be different depending on whether the switching frequency is being stepped up or stepped down.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Additionally, in some situations, the error signal (or the blanked error signal) may include pulses indicating that the switching frequency is too high followed by pulses indicating that the switching frequency is too low (or neither if there are cycles in which the error signal or blanked error signal is not produced) or vice versa. In this situation, if the error signals were nevertheless allowed to propagate through the AND gates <b>205</b> and <b>206</b> and the flip flops <b>211</b> and <b>212</b>, then it would be possible to produce both the step up signal and the step down signal within just one (or a few) cycles of each other. In this case, the switching frequency would potentially be increased followed relatively quickly by a decrease (or vice versa). Such a situation would potentially add to instability, rather than assist with stability, of the switching signal <b>110</b>. The low and high consecutive count check blocks <b>209</b> and <b>210</b> ensure that this situation does not occur.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The low consecutive count check block <b>209</b> produces a low error reset signal whenever the low-error signal is not followed immediately by another low-error signal, i.e., consecutive low-error signals do not occur. In this situation, the low-error signal is followed by a high-error signal or neither a high-error signal nor a low-error signal. The low error reset signal is provided to reset (R) inputs of the D flip flops <b>211</b> of the low error pulse counter <b>207</b>. Thus, whenever consecutive low-error signals do not occur, the low error reset signal is produced and causes the D flip flops <b>211</b> to reset, thereby resetting the low error pulse counter <b>207</b> to zero. (A counting of the N consecutive pulses of the low-error signal is reset when any pulse of the low-error signal is immediately followed by a pulse of the high-error signal.) In this manner, the cooperative operation of the low consecutive count check block <b>209</b> with the low error pulse counter <b>207</b> ensures that the low error pulse counter <b>207</b> generates or produces the step up signal only after counting a series of N consecutive pulses of the low-error signal.

A whole single period of each of the switch signal <b>301</b>/<b>401</b> and the reference signal <b>302</b>/<b>402</b> is, thus, represented by a single on-time pulse of the switch half signal <b>303</b>/<b>403</b> and the reference half signal <b>304</b>/<b>404</b>, respectively. (In some embodiments, it is not necessary to generate the reference signal <b>302</b>/<b>402</b>. Instead, it is possible to simply generate the reference half signal <b>304</b>/<b>404</b>, in some embodiments.)</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the period of the switch signal <b>301</b> is longer than the period of the reference signal <b>302</b> (i.e., the frequency of the switch signal <b>301</b> is lower than the frequency of the reference signal <b>302</b>), so the on-time pulse of the switch half signal <b>303</b> is longer than the on-time pulse of the reference half signal <b>304</b>.

In this manner, the duration for the pulses <b>305</b> and <b>405</b> of the error signal between points <b>306</b>/<b>406</b> and <b>307</b>/<b>407</b> properly represents the error between the periods of the switch signal <b>301</b>/<b>401</b> and the reference signal <b>302</b>/<b>402</b>. On the other hand, the rising edges of the second or subsequent pulses of each of the switch half signal <b>303</b>/<b>403</b> and the reference half signal <b>304</b>/<b>404</b> are not shown as being synchronized. The frequency controller <b>109</b>, therefore, includes circuitry for ensuring that pulses of the error signal are not generated within subsequent intervals during which the switch half signal <b>303</b>/<b>403</b> and the reference half signal <b>304</b>/<b>404</b> do not both have the same high or low value (e.g., at <b>308</b> between points <b>309</b> and <b>310</b>, at <b>311</b> between points <b>312</b> and <b>313</b>, at <b>408</b> between points <b>409</b> and <b>410</b>, and at <b>411</b> between points <b>412</b> and <b>413</b>) until rising edges of the switch and reference signals <b>301</b>/<b>401</b> and <b>302</b>/<b>402</b> or the switch and reference half signals <b>303</b>/<b>403</b> and <b>304</b>/<b>404</b> can be synchronized again.

Thus, the frequency error filter <b>122</b> is configured to synchronize a first edge of the reference signal with a corresponding first edge of the switching signal immediately prior to a cycle in which the error signal is produced, so that the error signal can be produced at a time period between a second edge of the reference signal and a corresponding second edge of the switching signal.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">An example embodiment for periodically synchronizing rising edges of the switch and reference half signals <b>303</b>/<b>403</b> and <b>304</b>/<b>404</b> is described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>.

Additionally, other components may be included in the reference clock <b>120</b> but are not shown for simplicity.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The current sources <b>501</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>503</b> and <b>504</b> are provided for each of the desired frequencies (e.g., 600 KHz, 800 KHz, 1 MHz, 2 MHz, respectively) for the switching signal <b>110</b> at which the power converter <b>100</b> is able to operate. When one or more of the current sources <b>501</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>503</b> and <b>504</b> is activated and the reset switch <b>505</b> is open (responsive to a reset signal <b>510</b> output low from the reset signal generator <b>509</b>), the capacitor <b>507</b> is charged, such that a charge voltage <b>511</b> on the capacitor <b>507</b> increases generally linearly. When the reset switch <b>505</b> is closed (responsive to the reset signal <b>510</b> output high), the capacitor <b>507</b> is discharged and the voltage thereon decreases to or toward ground. The charge voltage <b>511</b> is provided to a negative input of the comparator <b>508</b>; and a reference voltage VREF is provided to a positive input of the comparator <b>508</b>. The comparator <b>508</b> outputs the reference half signal. Thus, when the charge voltage <b>511</b> is below the reference voltage VREF, the comparator <b>508</b> outputs a high voltage for the on-time pulse for the reference half signal, which is pulled low by the switch <b>506</b> when the reset signal <b>510</b> is output high. When the reset signal <b>510</b> is output low, the reset switch <b>505</b> is opened, so that the charge voltage <b>511</b> rises. Additionally, when the reset signal <b>510</b> is output low, the switch <b>506</b> is opened, so that the output of the comparator <b>508</b> is not pulled low. Thus, at the moment that the switches <b>505</b> and <b>506</b> are opened, the charge voltage <b>511</b> is low (since the capacitor <b>507</b> had previously been discharged through the reset switch <b>505</b>), so the output of the comparator <b>508</b> is high. Since the switch <b>506</b> is no longer pulling the reference half signal low at this time, the reference half signal goes high. When the charge voltage <b>511</b> rises above the reference voltage VREF, the comparator <b>508</b> outputs a low voltage for the off-time for the reference half signal. The rising edge of the reference half signal, thus, generally corresponds with opening the switches <b>505</b> and <b>506</b> and the beginning of the charging of the capacitor <b>507</b>; and the falling edge of the reference half signal generally corresponds with the charge voltage <b>511</b> crossing to above the reference voltage VREF.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Additionally, the reference half signal is fed back to the reset signal generator <b>509</b>. The reset signal generator <b>509</b> receives the reference half signal and the switch signal (or the switch half signal). The reset signal generator <b>509</b> includes logic that causes a falling edge of the reset signal <b>510</b> to be synchronized with the rising edge of a pulse of the switch signal (or the switch half signal). The reset signal generator <b>509</b> further includes logic that causes a rising edge of the reset signal <b>510</b> to be synchronized with a falling edge of the reference half signal. Additionally, after the reference half signal falls and the reset signal <b>510</b> rises, the reset signal generator <b>509</b> further includes logic that prevents the reset signal <b>510</b> from falling again for at least <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> or <b>4</b> pulses of the switch signal (or the switch half signal), so that the next pulse of the switch signal (or the switch half signal) does not interfere with completion of the current pulse of the reference half signal.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> includes idealized timing diagrams for the switch signal (<b>601</b>), the switch half signal (<b>602</b>), the reset signal <b>510</b>, the charge voltage <b>511</b>, a pulse <b>603</b> of the reference half signal, and a pulse <b>604</b> of the error signal. The reset signal <b>510</b> is coordinated or synchronized with the switch signal <b>601</b> and/or with the switch half signal <b>602</b>. This synchronization may be done by basing the reset signal <b>510</b> on, or deriving it directly from, the switch signal <b>601</b> or the switch half signal <b>602</b>. Thus, the rising edge of the reset signal <b>510</b> is synchronized with the rising edge of the switch signal <b>601</b> or the switch half signal <b>602</b>. When the reset signal <b>510</b> turns on (at the rising edge thereof), the capacitor <b>507</b> is discharged, and the charge voltage <b>511</b> falls below the reference voltage VREF, so the comparator <b>508</b> begins to generate the reference half signal, but the switch <b>506</b> pulls the reference half signal low, so the pulse <b>603</b> thereof is not generated yet. (Alternatively, the reset signal <b>510</b> can be inverted and ANDed with the output of the comparator <b>508</b> to produce the pulse <b>603</b> of the reference half signal.) When the reset signal <b>510</b> turns off (at the falling edge thereof), the pulse <b>603</b> of the reference half signal is generated (a rising edge thereof, as explained above), the capacitor <b>507</b> begins to charge, and the charge voltage <b>511</b> rises accordingly. When the charge voltage <b>511</b> rises above the reference voltage VREF, the comparator <b>508</b> ends the pulse <b>603</b> of the reference half signal (falling edge of the pulse), and the reset signal <b>510</b> is caused to go high again (discharging the capacitor <b>507</b> again).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this example, the period of the switch signal <b>601</b> (i.e., a pulse of the switch half signal <b>602</b>) is longer than the pulse <b>603</b> of the reference half signal, so the pulse <b>604</b> of the error signal is generated accordingly. Since it may be unknown how different the switch signal <b>601</b> or the switch half signal <b>602</b> is from the reference half signal, it is desirable to wait 1, 2, 3 or 4 cycles before generating the reset signal <b>510</b> again in order to ensure that the whole pulse <b>603</b> of the reference half signal can occur before the next such pulse.

In this example, the signal blanking block <b>204</b> blanks a portion of the error signal, but the error signal is larger than the blanked portion, so the remaining portion of the blanked error signal <b>703</b>/<b>803</b> fills just a portion of the region between the falling edges of the reference half signal <b>702</b>/<b>802</b> and the switch half signal <b>701</b>/<b>801</b>.

Additionally, in some embodiments, the look up table <b>126</b> generally sets the initial width of the on-time pulse Ton (e.g., either directly via an initial Ton width value <b>1104</b> provided from the look up table <b>126</b> to the pulse generator <b>124</b> or indirectly via the up/down counter <b>123</b>), and the small individual pulse width steps are based on (e.g., may be a predetermined fraction of) the width of the initial on-time pulse Ton.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates an example embodiment for the logic core <b>115</b>; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates the operation thereof. In this embodiment, the logic core <b>115</b> generally includes an S-R latch (flip flop) <b>1301</b>, inverters <b>1302</b> and <b>1303</b>, and an AND gate <b>1305</b> connected as shown. Additionally, other components may be included in the logic core <b>115</b> but are not shown for simplicity.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The falling edge of the PWM-Comp signal and the rising edge of the on-time pulse Ton are synchronized by logic (not shown). The PWM-Comp signal at the comparator output <b>117</b> is inverted by the inverter <b>1302</b>, and the inverted PWM-Comp signal is provided to a set (S) input of the S-R latch <b>1301</b>. Additionally, the on-time pulse Ton is inverted by the inverter <b>1303</b>, and the inverted on-time pulse Ton is provided to a reset (R) input of the S-R latch <b>1301</b>. A raw PWM signal (PWMraw signal) is generated at the positive output (Q) of the S-R latch <b>1301</b> and is provided to an input of the AND gate <b>1305</b>. One or more additional inputs of the AND gate <b>1305</b> receive the control signals <b>118</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) or combinations thereof. Thus, when the control signals <b>118</b> are activated, the AND gate <b>1305</b> generates a rising edge of the PWM-signal <b>119</b> at the falling edge of the PWM-Comp signal at <b>117</b> (PWMComp fall edge or inverted PWMCOMP rise edge), and the AND gate <b>1305</b> generates a falling edge of the PWM-signal <b>119</b> at the falling edge of the on-time pulse Ton (Ton fall edge or inverted Ton rise edge), via the PWMraw signal, as shown by the PWM-signal <b>119</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The on-time of the on-time pulse Ton is thus represented in the pulses of the PWM-signal <b>119</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The various control signals <b>118</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) generally provide for a minimum on time and a minimum off time for the PWM-signal <b>119</b>, an enable control (EN), a test logic control, a ZCD (zero cross detection) control for DCM (DisContinous Mode) operation, a power good (PGOOD) control, undervoltage (UVLO) protection, overvoltage (OTP) protection, and thermal monitoring, among other potential control signals. As long as these control signals are set, the AND gate <b>1305</b> is controlled by the PWMraw signal. Under fault conditions, therefore, the switching signal can be disabled.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows an idealized voltage or frequency vs time diagram <b>1501</b> illustrating a &#x201c;valid&#x201d; error window for the operation of the frequency control loop, in accordance with some embodiments. Following each step in the adjustment of the on-time pulse Ton and the switching frequency, the voltage and/or frequency of the switching signal swings as shown, with negative errors below the midline and positive errors above the midline, and with the errors steadily decreasing until they are within the hysteresis range of the signal blanking block <b>204</b> (indicated by dashed lines <b>1502</b> and <b>1503</b>), at which point errors will not be detected due to the blanking. The blanking by the signal blanking block <b>204</b>, thus, performs a hysteresis to remove small errors, so that the switching frequency will not experience jitter that would otherwise occur due to small noise that could cause the up/down counter <b>123</b> to toggle unnecessarily between adjacent steps. Additionally, the error counts by the low and high error pulse counters <b>207</b> and <b>208</b> generally performs a low pass filtering (LPF) effect. In time domain, therefore, if the duration of an error in the switching frequency does not exceed an error count window, the error will not be detected and the algorithm of the frequency error filter <b>122</b> will not cause the up/down counter <b>123</b> to increment or decrement the count signal. In this example, the negative and positive error is shorter than the valid error window, so no step up or step down counter pulse would be generated. By using the consecutive count of same polarity error described above (dependent on a system loop bandwidth), a very effective digital low pass filter is thus realized by the frequency error filter <b>122</b> with relatively few components. (An analog LPF, by comparison, would require a much larger physical area in an integrated circuit die.) Since the low and high error pulse counters <b>207</b> and <b>208</b> are clocked based on the switching frequency, the equivalent low pass cutoff frequency is relative to the switching frequency, i.e., a lower frequency has a longer period, which results in a higher cutoff frequency, and a higher frequency has a shorter period, which results in a lower cutoff frequency. Thus, the cut off frequency of the frequency error filter <b>122</b> self-tracks with the switching frequency, so it can be used in a design that allows for a variable switching frequency.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows a frequency vs time diagram <b>1601</b> for a switching signal generated by a simulation of an embodiment of the power converter <b>100</b>. After a transient condition, the switching frequency swings until it settles to a steady state. In this example, sufficient settling had occurred by about 40 &#x3bc;s after the transient. Additionally, during this response period, the output voltage Vout and the frequency thereof will oscillate within a decaying envelope and then settle to a steady state value.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows a frequency vs time diagram <b>1701</b> for a switching signal generated by a simulation of another embodiment of the power converter <b>100</b>. In this example, the desired reference frequency was about 2 MHz.

The steps in the switching signal are shown (by arrows) to correspond with the pulses of the step up signal. In this example, the desired reference frequency was about 1 MHz. Sufficient settling of the switching frequency was considered to have occurred after about 1.76 ms (about at point <b>1803</b>, and the step up pulses have stopped) with a resulting switching frequency at about 1.001 MHz.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> shows a frequency vs time diagram for a switching signal (<b>1901</b>) and voltage vs time diagrams for the reference half signal (<b>1902</b>), the switch half signal (<b>1903</b>), the error signal (<b>1904</b>), the low-error signal (<b>1905</b>), the high-error signal (<b>1906</b>), the step up signal (<b>1907</b>), and the step down signal (<b>1908</b>) generated by a simulation of another embodiment of the power converter <b>100</b>. The pulses of the reference half signal <b>1902</b> are shown to correlate with the pulses of the switch half signal <b>1903</b>, because the pulses of the reference half signal have been synchronized therewith. Only one out of every four pulses of the switch half signal and the reference half signal are shown, because the rest have been blanked. The error signal <b>1904</b> is shown correlated with the reference half signal <b>1902</b> and the switch half signal <b>1903</b>. Since the switching frequency was too low (as shown by diagram <b>1901</b>), the pulses for the low-error signal <b>1905</b> are shown to have been generated, and pulses for the high-error signal <b>1906</b> are shown not to have been generated, except for one stray high-error pulse at the beginning. Additionally, the count in this example was 16, so the pulses of the step up signal <b>1907</b> are shown to have been generated after every 16 pulses of the low-error signal <b>1905</b>. The pulses of the step up signal <b>1907</b> are shown to continue until gaps appear in the pulses of the low-error signal <b>1905</b>, after which point no more pulses in the step up signal <b>1907</b> occur, since the low consecutive count check block <b>209</b> started to reset the low error pulse counter <b>207</b> after this point due to the failure to continue to produce consecutive pulses for the low-error signal <b>1905</b>. The step down signal <b>1908</b> is shown to exhibit minor fluctuations in the millivolt range, but these are too small to have had an effect. The steps in the switching signal <b>1901</b>, thus, correspond with the pulses of the step up signal <b>1907</b>. In this example, the desired reference frequency was about 800 KHz.
