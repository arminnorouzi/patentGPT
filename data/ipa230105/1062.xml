For such purposes, blood perfusion systems typically entail the use of one or more pumps in an extracorporeal circuit that is interconnected with the vascular system of a patient. Cardiopulmonary bypass surgery typically requires a perfusion system that provides for the temporary cessation of the heart to create a still operating field by replacing the function of the heart and lungs. Such isolation allows for the surgical correction of vascular stenosis, valvular disorders, and congenital heart defects. In perfusion systems used for cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, an extracorporeal blood circuit is established that includes at least one pump and an oxygenation device to replace the functions of the heart and lungs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">More specifically, in cardiopulmonary bypass procedures oxygen-poor blood, i.e., venous blood, is gravity-drained or vacuum suctioned from a large vein entering the heart or other veins in the body (e.g., femoral) and is transferred through a venous line in the extracorporeal circuit. In some cases, blood is drained inside a reservoir that filters out solid and gaseous emboli, while in other cases such as in mini bypass applications, a relatively small volume venous bubble trap can be used instead of a large volume venous reservoir. The venous blood is pumped to an oxygenator that provides for oxygen transfer to the blood. Oxygen may be introduced into the blood by transfer across a membrane or, less frequently, by bubbling oxygen through the blood. Concurrently, carbon dioxide is removed across the membrane. The oxygenated blood is filtered and then returned through an arterial line to the aorta, femoral, or other artery.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Often, an arterial filter is added to the extracorporeal circuit, after the oxygenator, as a last barrier before the patient, so as to block any solid or gaseous emboli and prevent any such emboli from entering into the aorta of the patient. Recently, arterial filters integrated in the oxygenator have been developed, allowing the reduction of the priming volume of the circuit and decreasing the global haemodilution of the patient. In some cases, excessive haemodilution is one of the major post-operative causes of patient morbidity, and should be avoided.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the disclosure is directed to a filter assembly for use in a blood processing apparatus. The filter assembly includes a filter mesh screen having an average pore size of about 20 microns to about 150 microns and a plurality of hollow gas exchange fibers secured to the filter mesh screen. The filter mesh screen is spirally wound to form a filter assembly that is useable as a gas exchanger. Blood flowing between the plurality of hollow gas exchange fibers is filtered by the filter mesh screen.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the disclosure is directed to a blood processing apparatus that includes an apparatus housing having a blood inlet and a blood outlet, the blood inlet extending into an interior of the apparatus housing. In some embodiments, a heat exchanger is in fluid communication with the blood inlet and is disposed about the blood inlet. A gas exchanger is disposed about the heat exchanger such that an inner surface of the gas exchanger is positioned to receive blood exiting an outer surface of the heat exchanger. In some embodiments, there is no heat exchanger, and the gas exchanger is disposed about the blood inlet. A screen filter is spirally wound through the gas exchanger such that blood passing through the gas exchanger passes through the screen filter and is filtered by the spirally wound screen filter a plurality of times.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">While multiple embodiments are disclosed, still other embodiments of the present disclosure will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, which shows and describes illustrative embodiments of the disclosure.

The intention, however, is not to limit the disclosure to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the disclosure is intended to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The disclosure pertains to a blood processing apparatus that combines, in a single structure, an optional heat exchanger, a gas exchanger or oxygenator and an arterial filter. In some embodiments, the term oxygenator with integrated arterial filter may be used to refer to a structure that combines an optional heat exchanger, a gas exchanger and an arterial filter in a unitary device. In some embodiments, an oxygenator may be used in an extracorporeal blood circuit. An extracorporeal blood circuit, such as may be used in a bypass procedure, may include several different elements such as a heart-lung machine, a blood reservoir, as well as an oxygenator.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, by combining the arterial filter with the oxygenator, the tubing set used to create the extracorporeal blood circuit may be reduced in complexity or number of parts and thus may simplify the extracorporeal blood circuit. In some embodiments, this will reduce the priming volume of the extracorporeal blood circuit. To illustrate, for a particular neonatal-sized oxygenator utilizing a separate arterial filter, the priming volume is about 47 milliliters (ml). A similar neonatal-sized oxygenator made in accordance with the disclosure, with an arterial filter integrated within the oxygenator, has a priming volume of about 35 ml. This represents a substantial reduction in priming volume of about 25 percent.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of a blood processing apparatus or oxygenator <b>10</b>. While the internal components are not visible in this illustration, the oxygenator <b>10</b> may include one or more of a heat exchanger, a gas exchanger and an arterial filter. According to some embodiments, each of the heat exchanger, gas exchanger and arterial filter are integrated into a single structure disposed within a device compartment or housing <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, as will be discussed, the gas exchanger may include an arterial filter that is integrated into the gas exchanger itself.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to various embodiments the heat exchanger (if present), the gas exchanger, and the device housing <b>12</b> may have a cross-section shaped generally as a circle. Each of the heat exchanger, the gas exchanger and the device housing <b>12</b> may have generally the same sectional shape or each may have a different sectional shape.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, a blood inlet <b>16</b> extends into the device housing <b>12</b>. A blood outlet <b>18</b> exits the device housing <b>12</b>. As noted, in some embodiments the oxygenator <b>10</b> includes a gas exchanger and thus may include a gas inlet <b>20</b> and a gas outlet <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, the oxygenator <b>10</b> includes a heat exchanger and thus may include a heating fluid inlet <b>24</b> and a heating fluid outlet <b>26</b>. While not illustrated, in some embodiments it is contemplated that the oxygenator <b>10</b> may include one or more purge ports for eliminating air bubbles entrained within the blood.

Heating and/or cooling fluid may enter through the heating fluid inlet <b>24</b>, pass through the hollow fibers (not illustrated) forming the heat exchanger <b>232</b>, and exit the oxygenator <b>10</b> via the heating fluid outlet <b>26</b>. Blood entering the heat exchanger <b>232</b> flows around and over the aforementioned hollow fibers and exits the heat exchanger <b>232</b>. Blood exiting the heat exchanger <b>232</b> flows into the gas exchanger <b>234</b>. Oxygen enters the oxygenator <b>10</b> via the gas inlet <b>20</b>, flows through hollow fibers (not illustrated in this view) within the gas exchanger <b>234</b>, and exits through the gas outlet <b>22</b>, carrying carbon dioxide and other gases that diffuse through and out of the hollow fibers.

While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the oxygenator <b>10</b> as including the heat exchanger <b>32</b>, it will be appreciated that in some embodiments the heat exchanger <b>32</b> may be excluded. If there is no heat exchanger <b>32</b>, a cylindrical core may be provided in its place to provide a support for the gas exchanger <b>34</b>. In this illustration, other internal components such as the inlets and outlets are not shown, for simplicities sake. In some embodiments, the heat exchanger <b>32</b> includes a number of hollow fibers through which a heating fluid such as water can flow.

The hollow fibers are too small to be represented in the drawing. In some cases, metallic fibers may be used within the heat exchanger <b>32</b>. According to other embodiments, the heat exchanger <b>32</b> includes a metal bellows or other structure comprising a substantial surface area (e.g., fins) for facilitating heat transfer with the blood.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments the gas exchanger <b>34</b> may include a number of hollow fibers through which a gas such as oxygen may flow. The blood may flow around and past the hollow fibers. Due to concentration gradients, oxygen may diffuse through the hollow fibers into the blood while carbon dioxide may diffuse into the hollow fibers and out of the blood. The hollow fibers are too small to be represented in this drawing.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the gas exchanger <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), <b>234</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) and <b>334</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) includes an arterial filter that is integrated into the gas exchanger <b>34</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>334</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of a composite filter screen assembly <b>40</b> that includes a filter screen <b>42</b> and a plurality of hollow fibers <b>44</b>. The schematic illustration is only one of the possibilities for coupling in an assembly a filter mean <b>42</b> with a gas exchange fiber mat. In some embodiments, the filter screen <b>42</b> may extend along an entire longitudinal length of the assembly. In other embodiments, the filter screen <b>42</b> extends longitudinally along only a portion of the longitudinal length of the assembly. In some exemplary embodiments, the screen <b>42</b> extends from about 20 to about 80 percent along the longitudinal length of the assembly.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this illustration, the size of the hollow fibers <b>44</b> is blown up out of scale to better illustrate the hollow fibers <b>44</b>. The filter screen <b>42</b>, in various embodiments, is a polymeric filter screen having an average pore size, defined as the average distance between adjacent elements, that ranges from about 20 microns to about 150 microns. In various embodiments, the average pore size of the filter screen is from about 60 microns to about 125 microns. In some embodiments, the filter screen <b>42</b> can be made from a polypropylene or polyester, although other suitable materials may also be used. In some cases, the filter screen <b>42</b>, the gas exchange hollow fiber <b>44</b> or the whole oxygenator with integrated arterial filter may be coated with a biocompatible material.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The hollow fibers <b>44</b> may be polymeric.

As schematically illustrated, the composite assembly <b>40</b> is sized such that the composite assembly <b>40</b> forms about four complete layers about the oxygenator core <b>52</b>. It will be appreciated that this is for simplifying the image, as in some embodiments, the composite assembly <b>40</b> may be sized to permit about 5 to about 100 complete layers. As blood exits the heat exchanger <b>32</b>, it will be appreciated that as blood moves radially outwardly, the blood will pass through the filter screen <b>42</b> a plurality of times.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">It can be seen that the oxygenator core <b>52</b> defines a volume <b>50</b> that corresponds to the location of the heat exchanger <b>32</b>. The oxygenator core <b>52</b> can be formed of any suitable material, such as any suitable polymeric material, and can have an outer diameter that is in the range of about 10 to about 200 millimeters (mm) and an inner diameter that is in the range of about 5 to about 5-100 mm. In some embodiments, relative dimensions will depend on the patient size and the choice of inner core diameter. While not illustrated in this view, the oxygenator core <b>52</b> may include one or more apertures that permit blood to flow from the heat exchanger <b>32</b> into the gas exchanger <b>34</b>. In some embodiments, the oxygenator core <b>52</b> may be absent, and thus potting may be used to separate water and gas compartments within the device <b>10</b>. As discussed above, in some embodiments there is no heat exchanger, and thus the oxygenator core <b>52</b> would be empty.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> provides a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a blood processing apparatus <b>110</b>. The blood processing apparatus <b>110</b> includes a blood inlet <b>116</b> and a blood outlet <b>118</b>. Blood entering via the blood inlet <b>116</b> passes into a central core <b>150</b>. In some embodiments, the central core <b>150</b> may include a plurality of apertures <b>152</b> that permit the blood to exit the central core <b>150</b> and move in a radially outward direction. The blood passes through the hollow fibers (not labeled) within a heat exchanger <b>132</b>. A shell <b>154</b> surrounds and defines the heat exchanger <b>132</b>. In some embodiments, the shell <b>154</b> includes a plurality of apertures <b>156</b> that permit blood to exit the heat exchanger <b>132</b> and flow through the gas exchanger <b>134</b> in a radially outward direction. In some embodiments, the blood exiting the gas exchanger <b>134</b> collects in an annular collection space <b>160</b> before exiting through the blood outlet <b>118</b>.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLE</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">To illustrate the advantages in priming volume achieved by incorporating the arterial filter within the gas exchanger, consider the following example. A neonatal oxygenator D<b>100</b> available from Sorin combined with a neonatal arterial filter D<b>130</b> available from Sorin has a total priming volume of 47 ml. In comparison, a D<b>100</b> oxygenator modified to include the inventive arterial filter incorporated within the gas exchanger has a total priming volume of <b>35</b> ml. This represents a 25% reduction.
