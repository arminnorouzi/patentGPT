The precursors for Raney metal catalysts are usually alloys/intermetallic phases comprising at least one catalytically active metal and at least one alloy component soluble (leachable) in alkalis. Examples of typical catalytically active metals are Ni, Co, Cu, with additions of Fe, Cr, Pt, Ag, Au, Mo and Pd, examples of typical leachable alloy components are Al, Zn and Si. The production of the Raney metal from the alloys generally takes place through an activation process in which the leachable component is removed through the use of concentrated sodium hydroxide solution.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A key disadvantage of pulverulent Raney metal catalysts is the need to remove them from the reaction medium of the catalysed reaction through costly sedimentation and/or filtration processes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There has accordingly already been a number of attempts to immobilize Raney metal catalysts and to provide them as fixed-bed catalysts.Thus, EP 2 764 916 describes a process for producing shaped catalyst bodies in foam form that are suitable for hydrogenations, in which: a) a shaped metal foam body is provided that comprises at least one first metal selected for example from Ni, Fe, Co, Cu, Cr, Pt, Ag, Au and Pd, b) at least one second leachable component, or component that can be converted into an leachable component by alloying is applied to the surface of the shaped metal foam body, said component being selected for example from Al, Zn and Si, c) an alloy is formed through alloying of the shaped metal foam body obtained in step b) on at least part of the surface and d) the foam-like alloy obtained in step c) undergoes treatment with an agent capable of leaching the leachable components of the alloy.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO 2019057533A1 discloses a similar process for producing foam-like shaped catalyst bodies. Here too, metal powders are applied to monolithic foam-like metal bodies and then thermally treated, with the result that alloys are formed in the region of contact of the foam-like metal bodies and metal powders. Wo2019057533A1 discloses a multitude of metals and metal combinations that may be chosen for the metal body in foam form and the metal powder, and also general details for the performance of the thermal treatment for alloy formation and some specific examples for treatment of aluminum powder on nickel foam.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention relates to processes for producing metal foam bodies, which comprise the providing of a metal foam body, the subsequent applying of aluminum-containing material, and a thermal treatment for alloy formation. The extent of alloy formation depends on the conditions of the thermal treatment: A long thermal treatment at high temperatures leads, for example, to alloy formation in deeper regions of the metal foam, whereas a shorter thermal treatment at lower temperatures leads only to alloy formation in the upper regions of the metal foam, leaving unalloyed regions within the metal foam. Since unalloyed regions remaining within the metal foam have a positive effect on the mechanical stability of the metal foam, there is a need in the prior art processes to make such metal foams available. A temperature regime according to the invention for the thermal treatment enables limiting of alloy formation to the upper layers of the metal foam, such that unalloyed regions remain in central regions of the metal foam. The processes according to the invention also take account of the thickness of the metal foam bodies treated.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="2">The Present Invention</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Processes according to the invention for producing metal foam bodies comprise the following steps:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">providing a metal foam body A made of nickel, cobalt, copper or alloys or combinations thereof, applying an aluminum-containing material MP to metal foam bodies A so as to obtain metal foam bodies AX, treating metal foam bodies AX thermally, with exclusion of oxygen, in order to achieve alloy formation between the metallic components of metal foam body A and the aluminum-containing material MP so as to obtain metal foam body B,<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">wherein the duration H of the thermal treatment (in minutes), depending on the temperature T of the thermal treatment (in &#xb0; C.), is chosen as follows:</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">Hmin &#x3c;H &#x3c;Hmax, with</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">maximum duration H<sub>max</sub>=d1+(a1&#x2212;d1)/(1+(T/c1){circumflex over (&#x2003;)}b 1), and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0012">minimum duration H<sub>min</sub>=d2+(a2&#x2212;d2)/(1+(T/c2){circumflex over (&#x2003;)}b2),</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0013">where</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0014">a1=366.1;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0015">b1=129.0;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0016">c1=650.9;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0017">d1=8.7;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0018">a2=33.5;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0011" num="0019">b2=235.5;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0012" num="0020">c2=665.8;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0013" num="0021">d2=1.8;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0014" num="0022">and wherein the temperature T of the thermal treatment, depending on the thickness D of the metal foam body AX, is chosen as follows:</li>        <li id="ul0002-0015" num="0023">when 0 mm&#x3c;D &#x2264;10 mm, 600&#xb0; C. &#x3c;T&#x2264;680&#xb0; C.,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0016" num="0024">when 10 mm &#x3c;D &#x2264;20 mm, 600&#xb0; C. &#x3c;T&#x2264;675&#xb0; C.,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0017" num="0025">when 20 mm &#x3c;D &#x2264;30 mm, 600&#xb0; C. &#x3c;T&#x2264;665&#xb0; C.,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0018" num="0026">when 30 mm &#x3c;D, 600&#xb0; C. &#x3c;T&#x2264;660&#xb0; C.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0027">Experimental results obtained in association with the present invention show that the choice of conditions for the thermal treatment for alloy formation has a considerable influence on the result. The processes according to the invention allow alloy formation to be limited to the upper layers of the metal foam, so that unalloyed regions remain in central regions of the metal foam. The presence of these unalloyed regions affects properties including the chemical and mechanical stability of the resultant metal foam.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0028">In connection with the present invention, a metal foam body A is understood to mean a metal body in foam form. Metal bodies in foam form are described e.g. in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, section &#x201c;Metallic Foams&#x201d;, published online on 07.15.2012, DOI: 10.1002/14356007.c16_c01.pub2. Suitable metal foams are in principle those having different morphological properties with regard to pore size and shape, layer thickness, area density, geometric surface area, porosity, etc. The metal foam preferably has an apparent density within a range from 100 to 1500 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, more preferably from 200 to 1200 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>and most preferably from 300 to 600 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. The average pore size is preferably from 400 to 3000 &#x3bc;m, more preferably from 400 to 800 &#x3bc;m. Preferred metal foams have a specific BET surface area of 100 to 20 000 m<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>, preferably of 1000 to 6000 m<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>. The porosity is preferably within a range from 0.50 to 0.95.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0029">The apparent density of the metal foam is determined in accordance with ISO 845. The average pore size is determined by the Visiocell&#xae; analysis method from Recticel described in The Guide 2000 of Technical Foams, book 4, section 4, pages 33-41. In particular, the pore size is measured through optical measurement of the pore diameter by overlaying calibrated rings printed on transparent paper on the selected cell. To obtain an average cell diameter, this pore size measurement is performed on at least 100 different cells. The specific BET surface area is measured in accordance with DIN 9277 by gas adsorption on a metal foam sample of not more than 2 g. Porosity is determined by means of the following equation:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>Porosity</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mtext>   </mtext>   <mrow>    <mo>(</mo>    <mi>%</mi>    <mo>)</mo>   </mrow>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mfrac>    <mrow>     <msub>      <mi>V</mi>      <mi>T</mi>     </msub>     <mo>-</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>W</mi>      <mo>&#xb7;</mo>      <mfrac>       <mn>1000</mn>       <mi>&#x3c1;</mi>      </mfrac>     </mrow>    </mrow>    <msub>     <mi>V</mi>     <mi>T</mi>    </msub>   </mfrac>   <mo>&#xb7;</mo>   <mn>100</mn>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0014" num="0030">V<sub>T</sub>=volume of the metal foam sample in mm<sup>3 </sup></p><p id="p-0015" num="0031">W=weight of the metal foam sample in g</p><p id="p-0016" num="0032">&#x3c1;=density of the metal in g/cm<sup>3 </sup>(e.g. 8.9 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>for Ni)</p><p id="p-0017" num="0033">Production can be carried out in a manner known per se. For example, a foam made of an organic polymer may be coated successively or simultaneously with two metal components and then the polymer removed by thermolysis, yielding a metal foam. For coating with at least one first metal or a precursor thereof, the foam made of the organic polymer may be contacted with a solution or suspension containing the first metal. This may be done for example by spraying or dipping. Deposition by means of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is also possible. For example, a polyurethane foam may be coated successively with one or two metals and then the polyurethane foam may be thermolysed. A polymer foam suitable for producing shaped bodies in the form of a foam preferably has a pore size within a range from 100 to 5000 &#x3bc;m, more preferably from 450 to 4000 pm and in particular from 450 to 3000 &#x3bc;m. A suitable polymer foam preferably has a layer thickness from 5 to 60 mm, more preferably from 10 to 30 mm. A suitable polymer foam preferably has a foam density of 300 to 1200 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.

High-purity aluminum is highly flammable and should be handled under an inert gas atmosphere. In addition to metallic aluminum (Al), the material may also contain aluminum AI(III). This AI(III) fraction is typically in the form of oxidic compounds selected from the group of aluminum oxides, hydroxides and/or carbonates. More preferably, the AI(III) fraction is within a range from 0.05% to &#x3c;10% by weight, most preferably within a range from 0.1% to 8% by weight, based on the aluminum-containing material MP. In addition to Al and AI(III), the mixture may also contain organic compounds and/or a further metal or metal oxide or metal carbonate, the further metals preferably being selected from the group of promoter elements such as Ti, Ta, Zr, V, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Rh, Fe, Ru, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Ce and Bi. The organic compounds are preferably selected from the group comprising hydrocarbons, polymers, resins, waxes, amines and alcohols.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0036">The aluminum-containing material MP applied to the metal foam body in step (b) is preferably an aluminum-containing powder. In preferred embodiments, the aluminum-containing powder contains 1% to 5% by weight, preferably 2% to 4% by weight and most preferably approx. 3% by weight, of organic compounds, in particular a wax, and 94.5% to 98.8% by weight, more preferably 95.5% to 97.8% by weight and most preferably 96.5% to 96.8% by weight, of Al. The particles of the aluminum-containing powder preferably have a diameter of not less than 5 pm and not more than 200 &#x3bc;m. Particular preference is given to powders in which 95% of the particles have a diameter of 5 to 75 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0037">The aluminum-containing powder is usually fixed to the surface of the metal foam body by means of an organic binder. In one embodiment, the metal foam body is impregnated with the organic binder before the actual application of the aluminum-containing powder. The impregnation may be effected for example by spray application of the binder, dipping the metal foam body in the binder, or by pumping or drawing the binder through the foam, but is not limited to these options. The binder is usually used in an amount such that the layer thickness on the metal foam body is 10 to 60 &#x3bc;m, preferably 10 to 30 &#x3bc;m. The aluminum-containing powder may then be applied to the metal foam body thus prepared.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0038">Alternatively, the organic binder and the aluminum-containing powder may be applied in a single step. For this purpose, before being applied, the aluminum-containing powder is either itself suspended in a liquid binder or the aluminum-containing powder and the binder are suspended/dissolved in an auxiliary liquid.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0039">The application of the aluminum-containing powder in step (b) of the process according to the invention may be effected in various ways, for example by contacting the metal foam body with the aluminum-containing powder by rolling or dipping, or by applying the aluminum-containing powder by spraying, sprinkling or pouring. For this, the aluminum-containing powder may be in the form of a pure powder or else suspended in the binder and/or an auxiliary liquid. If an auxiliary liquid is used, this is preferably water.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0040">The binder is an organic compound that promotes adhesion of the aluminum-containing powder to the metal body. Preference is given to the binder selected from polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), ethylene glycol, waxes, polyethyleneimine (PEI) and mixtures of said compounds. Particular preference as binder is given to PVP or PEI, for example where M<sub>w</sub>=10 000 to 1 300 000 g/mol, determined by gel-permeation chromatography using a polystyrene standard. Preference is given to using as binder PEI, e.g. where M<sub>w</sub>=500 000 to 1 000 000 g/mol or M<sub>w</sub>=600 000 to 900 000 g/mol. PEI is typically used in aqueous solution, preferably in concentrations of 0.5% to 15% by weight, more preferably 1% to 10% by weight or 2% to 5% by weight and most preferably 2% to 3% by weight, based on the weight of PEI and water. The aluminum-containing powder may be suspended in the binder, optionally dissolved in an auxiliary liquid such as water, e.g. in the aqueous PEI solution, the amount of the aluminum-containing powder in the suspension being preferably 30% to 70% by weight, more preferably 40% to 60% by weight, most preferably 45% to 55% by weight, based on the total weight of the suspension.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0041">Examples of alternative methods of applying the aluminum-containing material MP in step (b) include dipping the metal foam body in a metal melt, sputtering deposition or chemical vapor-phase deposition of the aluminum-containing material MP, and deposition of the aluminum-containing material MP as metal salts with subsequent reduction to the metal. Combinations of all said methods of application are also possible.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0042">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the aluminum-containing material MP is an aluminum-containing powder, and an organic binder is applied to metal foam body A together with, or before, the aluminum-containing powder.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0043">The coated metal foam bodies are soft and can therefore be easily deformed if required. For example, the coated metal foam bodies may be embossed on the surface, for example with a corrugated profile. The embossing can be performed with a standard tool, for example a profiled roller, a stamp or another embossing tool. In addition, the coated metal foam bodies may, optionally after prior embossing, be folded or rolled up. A modified metal foam body may also be obtained by stacking two or more metal foam bodies one on top of another, optionally after prior embossing, where the body may consist solely of coated metal foam bodies or may include an uncoated metal foam body interposed between two coated metal foam bodies. Rolled-up, folded or stacked metal foam bodies are also referred to herein as multilayer and may optionally undergo further shaping by various shaping methods. The shaping, reshaping and/or stacking of the coated metal foam bodies can produce a shaped metal foam body AX having a desired geometry, according to the planned field of use.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0044">In step (c) of the process according to the invention, a thermal treatment is effected in order to achieve the formation of one or more alloys. Experimental results obtained in connection with the present invention show that relatively strict temperature control is necessary in order to restrict alloy formation to the upper regions of the metal foam and to leave unalloyed regions within the metal foam. Moreover, in the selection of the conditions for thermal treatment, it is necessary to take note of the thickness D of the metal foam body AX.

In the case of objects having more complicated geometry, D is ascertained by a rough estimate, assuming an excessively high value D if anything, in the case of doubt, rather than one that is too low. The value D is estimated here as twice the value of the shortest distance from the surface of the point within the body that has the maximum shortest distance from the surface. In each case, in the determination of D, the foam pores and their surfaces should be neglected, meaning that the foam pores should be considered to be filled for this determination. Moreover, recesses in the bodies in question with diameters below 1 cm should not be considered to be surface, but rather likewise to be filled regions.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0064">The thermal treatment comprises the heating, typically in a stepwise manner, of the metal foam body AX and subsequent cooling to room temperature. The thermal treatment takes place under inert gas or under reductive conditions. Reductive conditions are understood to mean the presence of a gas mixture containing hydrogen and at least one gas which is inert under the reaction conditions; a suitable example is a gas mixture containing 50% by volume of N<sub>2 </sub>and 50% by volume of H<sub>2</sub>. The inert gas used is preferably nitrogen. The heating can be accomplished for example in a belt furnace. Suitable heating rates are within a range from 10 to 200 K/min, preferably 20 to 180 K/min. During the thermal treatment, the temperature is typically first increased from room temperature to about 300 to a maximum of 350&#xb0; C. and this temperature is maintained for a period of about 2 to 30 minutes in order to remove moisture and organic constituents from the coating.

Determination of the Position of the Limiting Curves of the Heating Time</p><p id="p-0066" num="0112">On the basis of the abovementioned results, the position of the limiting curves for the heating time that, for a given heating temperature, leads to superficial alloy formation leaving unalloyed regions within the metal foam was ascertained by a sigmoidal model (heating time=d+(a&#x2212;d)/(1+(heating temperature / c){circumflex over (&#x2003;)}b)).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0113">The limiting values used for the position of the upper curve (maximum heating time) were the following values:</p><p id="p-0068" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="98pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="105pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Temp (&#xb0; C.)</entry><entry>&#x2192;</entry><entry>Duration (min)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>680</entry><entry>&#x2192;</entry><entry>10</entry></row><row><entry>675</entry><entry>&#x2192;</entry><entry>12</entry></row><row><entry>665</entry><entry>&#x2192;</entry><entry>30</entry></row><row><entry>660</entry><entry>&#x2192;</entry><entry>60</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0069" num="0114">The limiting values used for the position of the lower curve (minimum heating time) were the following values:</p><p id="p-0070" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="98pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="105pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Temp (&#xb0; C.)</entry><entry>&#x2192;</entry><entry>Duration (min)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="98pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="105pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>680</entry><entry>&#x2192;</entry><entry>2</entry></row><row><entry>675</entry><entry>&#x2192;</entry><entry>3</entry></row><row><entry>665</entry><entry>&#x2192;</entry><entry>20</entry></row><row><entry>660</entry><entry>&#x2192;</entry><entry>30</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0071" num="0115">The following result was found for the position of the limiting curves (reporting of H in minutes and reporting of T in &#xb0; C.):</p><p id="p-0072" num="0116">maximum duration H<sub>max=d</sub>1+(a1&#x2212;d1)/(1+(T/c1){circumflex over (&#x2003;)}b1), with</p><p id="p-0073" num="0117">a1=366.1;</p><p id="p-0074" num="0118">b1=129.0;</p><p id="p-0075" num="0119">c1=650.9;</p><p id="p-0076" num="0120">d1=8.7;</p><p id="p-0077" num="0121">and minimum duration H<sub>min</sub>=d2+(a2&#x2212;d2)/(1+(T/c2){circumflex over (&#x2003;)}b2), with</p><p id="p-0078" num="0122">a2=33.5;</p><p id="p-0079" num="0123">b2=235.5;</p><p id="p-0080" num="0124">c2=665.8;</p><p id="p-0081" num="0125">d2=1.8.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0126">6.
