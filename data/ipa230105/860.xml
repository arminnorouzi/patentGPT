B. et al. (2012) Blood 119(3):651-665; Beutler B. et al. (1985) <i>Science </i>229(4716):869-871). However, a dysregulated signaling of TNF subtypes (particularly TNF-&#x3b1;) is associated with several pathological conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis (Victor F. C. &#x26; Gottlieb A. B. (2002) <i>J. Drugs Dermatol. </i>1(3):264-275), and inflammatory bowel disease (Brynskov J. et al. (2002) Gut. 51(1):37-43). Chronic production of TNF-&#x3b1; is also associated with Alzheimer's disease (Swardfager W. et al. (2010) <i>Biol. Psychiatry </i>68(10):930-941), major depression (Dowlati Y. et al. (2010) <i>Biol. Psychiatry </i>67(5):446-457), and cancer (Locksley R. M. et al. (2001) <i>Cell </i>104(4):487-501). Therefore, considerable efforts have been focused on disrupting the TNF signaling pathway using different types of therapeutic modulators (Monaco C. et al. (2015) <i>Int. Immunol. </i>27(1):55-62).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">TNF-&#x3b1; is initially synthesized as a 26 kDa 233-amino-acid transmembrane (TM) protein that after proteolytic cleavage (by TNF-&#x3b1;-converting enzyme) is released as a 17 kDa 157-amino-acid soluble protein. Soluble TNF-&#x3b1; (sTNF-&#x3b1;) is spontaneously assembled into stable homotrimers, which are biologically active forms of cytokines (Black R. A. et al. (1997) <i>Nature </i>385(6618):729-733). TNF-&#x3b1; is mainly produced by macrophages, T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells, and is recognized by two distinct receptors, TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNFR2, leading to different signaling (Wajant H. et al. (2003) <i>Cell Death Differ. </i>10(1):45-65). Although TNFR1 is ubiquitously expressed by all cell types, the expression of TNFR2 is limited to immune cells. Thus, the binding of TNF-&#x3b1; to each receptor has various functional consequences (Kontermann R. E. et al. (2009) <i>Expert Opin. Drug Discov. </i>4(3):279-292). The downstream signaling pathway of TNFR1 typically activates transcription factors such as nuclear factor &#x3ba;-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#x3ba;B) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (Ting A. T. &#x26; Bertrand M. J. M. (2016) <i>Trends Immunol. </i>37(8):535-545). Activation of NF-&#x3ba;B and MAPKs plays an important role in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and immunoregulators, which exhibit strong inflammatory responses that often results in the apoptosis or necrosis of most cell types (Annibaldi A. &#x26; Meier P. (2018) <i>Trends Mol. Med. </i>24(1):49-65).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It has been suggested that dysregulation of TNF production is associated with chronic arthritis in a mouse model and that the application of TNF inhibitors is effective against the disease (Keffer J. et al. (1991) <i>EMBO J. </i>10(13):4025-4031). This observation had aroused great interest among anti-TNF manufacturers, leading to the first successful clinical trials for chronic inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (Elliott M. J. et al. (1993) <i>Arthritis Rheum. </i>36(12):1681-1690), Crohn's disease, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, spondyloarthritis, and Behcet's disease (Sfikakis P. P. (2010) <i>Curr. Dir. Autoimmun. </i>11:180-210). Currently approved drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases are synthetic monoclonal antibodies such as infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, and golimumab, or receptor fusion proteins such as etanercept, and all of these drugs bind to sTNF-&#x3b1; to thus prevent its association with TNFR1 or TNFR2 (Lis K. et al. (2014) <i>Arch. Med. Sci. </i>10(6):1175-1185). Although clinically successful, these biologics are expensive, not available for oral administration, and sometimes undermine the host immunity to latent or recurring infections (Wendling D. et al. (2017) <i>Expert Opin. Drug Saf. </i>16(1):1-3). Therefore, small-molecule-based therapy is perceived as a potential alternative to TNF-&#x3b1; inhibition using biologics (Richmond V. et al. (2015) <i>Curr. Med. Chem. </i>22(25):2920-2942). SPD304, which is the first antagonist of TNF-&#x3b1;, was developed through structure-based drug design (He M. M. et al. (2005) <i>Science </i>310(5750):1022-1025). Subsequent studies revealed the structure of TNF-&#x3b1; bound to multiple copies of ligand JNJ525, indicating possible aggregation-mediated TNF inhibition (Blevitt J. M. et al. (2017) <i>J. Med. Chem. </i>60(8):3511-3517). A recent study proposed small molecules that directly bind to TNF-&#x3b1; with IC<sub>50 </sub>in the range of 1-50 &#x3bc;M and block TNFR1- or TNFR2-mediated downstream signaling pathways (Chen C. S. et al. (2010) <i>Bioorg. Med. Chem. </i>18 (2):597-604). Compounds resembling natural products, which regulate TNF-&#x3b1;-mediated cellular effects, have also been found in both in vitro and in vivo studies (Hu Z. et al. (2012) <i>Biochem. Pharmacol. </i>84(11):1482-1491). Despite preclinical advances in anti-TNF biology, the low potency and high toxicity of these chemicals have limited testing in clinical trials lately.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, the present inventors have made great efforts to develop small-molecule TNF-&#x3b1; inhibitors, identified a series of novel small-molecule TNF-&#x3b1; inhibitors designated as TNF inhibitory molecules (TIM) through a combined structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening approach, and ascertained that through in vitro bioassay, the lead material TIM1 significantly inhibits TNF-&#x3b1;-mediated secretion of cytokines, does not show cytotoxicity up to 200 &#x3bc;M, and attenuates TNF-&#x3b1;-induced cell death in both mouse and human cell types. Moreover, it has been confirmed that TIM1 is capable of stably occupying the central hydrophobic cavity in a TNF-&#x3b1; homodimer through cross-linking experiments, Western blotting, and computational modeling, and also that it is possible to prevent binding of the third monomer, which is necessary for the formation of a functional homotrimer. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that among the derivatives of TIM1, TIM1c exhibits oral bioactivity in a mouse model of collagen-induced polyarthritis and suppresses arthritis symptoms to a level resembling healthy mice. Consequently, it has been confirmed that the TIM series is capable of playing a role as a potent lead compound for the development of small-molecule compound therapeutic agents that alleviate TNF-mediated autoimmune diseases and/or inflammatory diseases, thus culminating in the present invention.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The information described in the Background Art is only for improving understanding of the background of the present invention, and it is not to be construed as including information forming the related art, which is already known to those of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention belongs.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a small-molecule compound having effects of inhibiting TNF-&#x3b1;-mediated cytokine secretion and attenuating TNF-&#x3b1;-induced cell death, and a composition for inhibiting TNF-&#x3b1;

In general, the nomenclature used herein is well known in the art and is typical.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;) is induced by the TNF receptor 1-mediated death signaling pathway, and strongly induces necrosis, which is a form of cell death. Compounds that directly inhibit TNF-&#x3b1; have long been considered as alternative therapies to biological products, such as antibodies, which are currently approved for the treatment of systemic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and Crohn's disease. Due to the severity of diseases associated with the dysregulated TNF-&#x3b1;-TNFR1 signaling axis, there is increasing need to develop potent molecules capable of preventing TNF-&#x3b1;-mediated inflammatory and necrotic pathways (Li P., Zheng Y. &#x26; Chen X. (2017) <i>Front Pharmacol. </i>8:460).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">The X-ray crystallographic structure of TNF-&#x3b1; complexed with the TNF-&#x3b1; inhibitor SPD304 makes it possible to screen many multiconformational libraries using the principle of computational drug discovery. The present inventors have identified a novel lead compound, TIM1, which is not toxic to cells and inhibits TNF-&#x3b1;-induced toxicity in both human and mouse cell lines. Through comparison with the known inhibitor SPD304, it has been confirmed that TIM1 had relatively low toxicity for TNF-&#x3b1; signaling and had significant inhibitory activity. In addition, the compound TIM1c was demonstrated to be the most active TNF inhibitor among all TIM1 derivatives, exhibited oral bioavailability in a CIA mouse model, and suppressed various arthritis symptoms in mice.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">The inhibitor, defined as TNF inhibitory molecule 1 (TIM1), had an IC<sub>50 </sub>(half-maximal inhibitory concentration) of 26.2 &#x3bc;M (in a human cell line) and 24.9 &#x3bc;M (in a mouse cell line), exhibited negligible cytotoxicity compared to the known inhibitor SPD304, and showed an excellent attenuation effect in TNF-&#x3b1;-induced cell death. In addition, the compound exhibited inhibitory effects by blocking, in L929 cells, NF-&#x3ba;B (nuclear factor &#x3ba;-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells), MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases), and caspase 3- and 8-dependent proapoptotic pathways. The IC<sub>50 </sub>values of TIM1 for secretion of TNF-&#x3b1;-mediated interleukin 6 and interleukin 8 in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) were calculated to be 6.3 &#x3bc;M and 16.71 &#x3bc;M, respectively. In the present invention, it was demonstrated that the compound inactivates the function of TNF-&#x3b1; by disrupting the homotrimerization assembly and prevents binding to the TNF receptor. One of the TIM1 derivatives, TIM1c, showed the most potent in vitro activity and oral bioavailability in a mouse model of collagen-induced polyarthritis, and this compound inhibited paw swelling, weight loss, and the number of squeaks, and decreased all arthritis indexes in mice. Therefore, TIM series compounds are capable of acting as potent lead materials in the development of alternatives to anti-TNF biological products.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">The computational modeling suggests that TIM1/TIM1c has good shape complementarity to the central hydrophobic cavity of the TNF-&#x3b1; dimer, having a thiazole ring stacked between the Y119 residues of both monomers. It has been revealed that Y119 is essential for coordinating monomer assembly and receiving inhibitors in the binding cavity of TNF-&#x3b1; (He M. M. et al. (2005) <i>Science </i>310(5750):1022-1025). Most TNF-&#x3b1;-TIM1 or TNF-&#x3b1;-TIM1c complexes are stabilized through intermolecular hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic contact without salt bridges. Since the ligand-binding cavity on the TNF-&#x3b1; dimer has a predominantly flat surface due to an aromatic ring structure such as tyrosine, the ligand must be hydrophobic and large enough to occupy the cavity in an expanded form (Jin L., Wang W. &#x26; Fang G. (2014) <i>Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. </i>54:435-456). Chemical cross-linking and Western blotting analysis clearly showed that TIM1 is a specific and potent disruptor of TNF-&#x3b1; homotrimerization. Based on these results, proposed are two possible scenarios for the mechanism of action of TIM1 or potent derivatives thereof (e.g. TIM1c). First, the ligand promotes the formation of a stable homodimer by mimicking the third monomer during assembly. Second, the ligand binds to the homodimer only after the third monomer spontaneously dissociates and prevents subsequent reassembly of the functional trimer. A third mechanism of action may be as follows: the ligand interacts with the preformed homotrimer to displace one of the monomers from the trimeric assembly. Since the ligand-binding moiety of the TNF-&#x3b1; monomer is buried at the protein-protein interface, the inhibitor has to overcome a significant energy barrier in order to dissociate the preformed trimer (Arkin M. R., Tang Y. &#x26; Wells J. A. (2014) <i>Chem. Biol. </i>21(9):1102-1114).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">For a few known TNF-&#x3b1; inhibitors, the definite mechanism of their inhibitory action has been determined. Ligands are capable of blocking the cellular effect of TNF-&#x3b1;, for example, (i) by interacting with the receptor-binding surface of TNF-&#x3b1; (Ma L. et al. (2014) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>289(18):12457-12466), (ii) by interacting with the TNF-binding surface of the receptor (Chen S. et al. (2017) <i>J. Chem. Inf. Model </i>57(5):1101-1111), (iii) by disrupting the trimerization interface of TNF-&#x3b1; (Chan D. S. et al. (2010) <i>Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. </i>49(16):2860-2864), or (iv) by blocking TNF-&#x3b1;-converting enzymes or other downstream signaling molecules (Esposito E. &#x26; Cuzzocrea S. (2009) <i>Curr. Med. Chem. </i>16(24):3152-3167). Although all of these approaches have been relatively effective at downregulating TNF-mediated signaling pathways, extracellular inactivation of TNF-&#x3b1; due to disruption of the protein-protein interface is regarded as the most innovative and effective method for alleviating a chronic systemic inflammatory status. This approach is similar to approaches using antibodies or receptor fusion proteins that irreversibly bind to TNF-&#x3b1; and neutralize interactions with the receptor with maximal specificity.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">The present inventors evaluated the two TNF inhibitors, SPD304 and C87, as positive controls, and simultaneously confirmed and compared the inhibitory activity of TIM1 in a cell viability assay. Unlike SPD304, C87 has been reported to inhibit TNF-&#x3b1; signaling by an unknown mechanism that does not involve disruption of the homotrimerization interface (Ma L. et al. (2014) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>289(18):12457-12466). Therefore, C87 was excluded from further activity comparison with TIM1 because these two have different mechanisms of action. TIM1 had high efficacy in inhibiting TNF-&#x3b1;-induced cytokine secretion and death of inflammatory cells, and did not exhibit cytotoxicity even at high concentrations (up to 100 &#x3bc;M). The toxicity of a given ligand is usually due to intrinsic chemical scaffolds that may interfere with various host pathways after metabolic degradation (Stepan A. F. et al. (2011) <i>Chem. Res. Toxicol. </i>24(9):1345-1410). A similarity search in chemical database (e.g. PubChem) confirmed that TIM1/TIM1c did not contain any fragments previously known to interact with essential host molecules, indicating good absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) characteristics. In this regard, SPD304 was observed to have an inconsistent effect on cytokine secretion at different concentrations. For example, inhibition of cytokine secretion was weak at 10 &#x3bc;M but stronger at 1 &#x3bc;M, while significant cytotoxic effects were exhibited at concentrations of 10, 50 or 100 &#x3bc;M. This inconsistent activity of SPD304 may be due to certain chemical properties that may interfere with important physiological processes in cells. The 3-alkylindole moiety of the ligand is metabolized by cytochrome P450 to thus generate reactive electrophilic iminium ions that are able to react with major intracellular proteins and DNA (Sun H. &#x26; Yost G. S. (2008) <i>Chem. Res. Toxicol. </i>21(2):374-385). Moreover, C87 showed mild toxicity to HDFs. In contrast, TIM1 did not show any signs of cytotoxicity at the concentrations tested. At low concentrations (i.e. &#x2dc;1 &#x3bc;M), TIM1 is somewhat less effective than SPD304, but the safety profile thereof is vastly superior from a therapeutic standpoint (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">The present inventors have ascertained that TIM1c, one of the TIM1 derivatives, has oral activity and is capable of suppressing systemic inflammation in a CIA mouse model. Currently, only anti-TNF antibodies or decoy receptors are approved for therapeutic administration for the treatment of diseases such as RA, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis (Patra M. C., Shah M. &#x26; Choi S. (2019) <i>Semin. Cancer Biol.</i>). Previously, several peptide/peptidomimetic-based TNF-&#x3b1; inhibitors have been identified through phage display or inferential design approaches (Sun H. &#x26; Yost G. S. (2008) <i>Chem. Res. Toxicol. </i>21(2):374-385; Alizadeh A. A. et al. (2017) <i>Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. </i>96:490-498). Nevertheless, small-molecule products are preferred over peptides or proteins because of the desirable pharmacokinetic endpoints thereof, and provide drugs having improved bioavailability and metabolic stability (Mocsai A., Kovacs L. &#x26; Gergely P. (2014) <i>BMC Med. </i>12:43). A small number of TNF-blocking small molecules have been demonstrated to be effective via oral routes in animals (Cost E. et al. (2015) <i>Ann. Rheum. Dis. </i>74(1):220-226). The efficacy of TIM1c on CIA mice suggests that TIM series compounds may make a useful contribution to existing research on the treatment or prevention of TNF-mediated inflammatory diseases through the use of low-molecular-weight drugs.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">In summary, it is possible to obtain novel small-molecule ligands having the ability to inhibit TNF-&#x3b1; function by interfering with homotrimerization assembly through the virtual screening workflow according to the present invention. Compared to existing TNF inhibitors, TIM series compounds having oral efficacy in mice and a low toxicity profile may be developed and characterized in the future as valuable anti-inflammatory lead molecules.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention is directed to a compound represented by Chemical Formula 1 below or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="36.32mm" wi="69.85mm" file="US20230000861A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0052" num="0049">In Chemical Formula 1,</p><p id="p-0053" num="0050">R<sub>1 </sub>to R<sub>3 </sub>are each independently a hydrogen atom, straight or branched alkyl, amino, alkylamino, arylamino, hydroxy, halogen, nitrile group, nitro group, cycloalkyl, haloalkyl, allyl, alkoxy, alkylcarbonyl, cycloalkylcarbonyl, arylcarbonyl, alkylarylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, cycloalkoxy, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, heteroaryl, heterocycloalkyl, aryloxy, alkoxyheteroaryl, heteroaryloxyalkyl, alkylheteroaryl, alkylaryl, arylalkyl, alkylheteroaryl, alkylester, alkylamide, or acryl,</p><p id="p-0054" num="0051">in which the alkyl, alkylamino, or alkoxy is C<sub>1-30</sub>, the cycloalkyl is C<sub>3-30</sub>, the allyl is C<sub>2-30</sub>, the aryl is C<sub>6-30</sub>, and the heteroaryl and heterocycloalkyl contain a heteroatom selected from among oxygen (O), sulfur (S), and nitrogen (N).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0052">In the present invention, the alkyl, alkylamino or alkoxy is preferably C<sub>1-20</sub>, more preferably C<sub>1-12</sub>, and most preferably C<sub>1-6</sub>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">As used herein, the term &#x201c;C<sub>1-30 </sub>alkyl&#x201d; refers to a monovalent linear or branched saturated hydrocarbon moiety having 1 to 30 carbon atoms and consisting only of carbon and hydrogen atoms.

The treatment groups were orally fed 2 or 20 mg/kg of TIM1c every 2 days from day 15 to day 60 after the first immunization.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 1-4: Behavioral Assessment of Arthritis Symptoms</heading><p id="p-0117" num="0106">In order to evaluate the progression of arthritis in CIA mice, four parameters (body weight, paw volume increase, squeaking score, and arthritis score) were measured after the first immunization with collagen and complete Freund's adjuvant. The body weights of the mice were measured using a digital balance (Mettler-Toledo Inc., Columbus, Ohio, USA). In order to assess nociception and hyperalgesia, ankle pain was evaluated on a scale measuring squeaking. Squeaking included any vocalization evoked by ankle flexion and extension. The flexion and extension procedures were repeated 10 times every 5 seconds, and the mouse was rated 0 (no vocalization) or 1 (vocalization) for each hindlimb thereof. The total number of vocalizations detected by the observer was counted as the number of squeaks. Paw swelling was measured by volume displacement of an electrolyte solution using a water-displacement plethysmometer (Ugo-Basil Biological Research Apparatus Co., Comerio-Varese, Italy), as previously described (Bang J. S. et al. (2009) <i>Arthritis Res. Ther. </i>11(2):R49). The hindlimbs were immersed to the line of the hairy skin, and the volumes thereof were read on a digital display. The increase in paw volume was represented compared to day 0, which was defined as zero. The arthritis index was assessed by grading the apparent arthritis severity in all joints of each limb using a per-limb 4-point scale; a maximum score of 16 for each mouse, 0=neither erythema nor swelling of any joint in one limb, 1=erythema or swelling of at least one joint per limb, 2=erythema or swelling of fewer than 3 joints per limb, 3=erythema or swelling of all joints in one limb, 4=ankylosis and deformity of all joints in one limb.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 1-5: Cell Viability Assay</heading><p id="p-0118" num="0107">In order to measure cell viability, a colorimetric 1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazan (MTT) assay (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was performed.

Chemical structures were prepared using the sdwash tool of Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software (2013.08; Chemical Computing Group ULC, 1010 Sherbooke St. West, Suite #910, Montreal, QC, Canada, H3A 2R7, 2017). The ligand structures were cleaned up by removing disconnected salt atoms and inorganic metal ions as well as ligands having reactive groups. For ligands having broken fragments, only the largest fragments were kept. Explicit hydrogen atoms were added, and the protonation state was adjusted by protonating the strong base and deprotonating the strong acid. A maximum of 10 tautomeric states were listed for each ligand, and intramolecular bonds were scaled to the appropriate length. The resulting structures were subjected to energy minimization using the MMFF94x force field until a root mean square gradient of 0.1 was reached. Partial charges were calculated on the ligand atoms before energy minimization with the MMFF94x force field.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">Example 1-11: Calculation of Molecular-Fingerprint-Based Ligand Similarity</heading><p id="p-0126" num="0114">In order to emphasize molecular properties, molecular fingerprints were calculated for each ligand in a database according to a bit-packed MACCS Structural Keys (FP:BIT_MACCS) scheme. In order to identify ligands that are at least 60-80% similar to those selected from among the known set of TNF-&#x3b1; inhibitors reported in the literature, an in-house support vector language (SVL) script was applied. The search was performed using a Tanimoto similarity metric called the Tanimoto coefficient, which measures the similarity between two fingerprints through the expression #AB/(#A+#B&#x2212;#AB). Here, A and B are two fingerprints, and #represents the number of features.

Docking was performed with the triangle-matcher placement method and the London dG scoring function, maintaining a maximum of 30 docked poses for each ligand. The top-scoring poses for each ligand were applied to another round of docking run with MMFF94x force field refinement and Affinity dG scoring function to thus maintain 30 docked conformations of each ligand.

Energy minimization and MD simulation were performed using the gromos96-54a6 force field in GROMACS 5.1.5 software (Abraham M. J. et al. (2015) <i>SoftwareX </i>1-2:19-25). Protein-ligand complexes were embedded in cubic boxes with a distance of 20 &#x212b; between the surface thereof and the box boundary. A simple point-charge (SPC216) water molecule and an appropriate amount of counterion were added to the simulation box to neutralize the total charge of the simulation system. Energy minimization was performed through the steepest-descent algorithm until a maximum force of 1000 kJmol<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>nm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>was reached. The temperature of the simulation system was equilibrated according to the V-rescale scheme, which is a modified version of the Berendsen temperature-coupling scheme. Pressure equilibration was achieved using the Parinello-Rahman algorithm at 1 bar. During the temperature and pressure equilibration process, the backbone heavy atom of the protein was harmonically suppressed for 100 ps. The production run was performed for 100 ns with no positional restrictions on the backbone atoms. Period-boundary conditions were applied to the simulation system, and all bonds including hydrogen atoms were limited using a linear constraint solver algorithm.

M. et al. (2017) <i>J. Med. Chem. </i>60(8):3511-3517) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>). Then, a set of 15,668 ligands was subjected to structure-based virtual screening in the central hydrophobic cavity of the TNF-&#x3b1; homodimer. The docked ligand poses were graded using the MMFF94x force-field-based binding free energy (GBVI/WSA dG) score. In silico toxicity assay was performed on the 100 top-scoring ligands using online and offline computational tools, including removal of pan-assay interference (PAINS) compounds. The top 10 ligands without any toxic fragments in chemical structures were obtained for in vitro confirmation of bioactivity thereof.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0132">The 10 chemicals thus obtained were initially tested for toxicity to human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) at concentrations of 1-50 &#x3bc;M. After 24 hours of compound treatment, cell viability was monitored through a colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Among the molecules tested, TIM1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>) showed no cytotoxicity up to a concentration of 50 &#x3bc;M, whereas the other compounds showed mild toxicity to cells. It is noteworthy that the known TNF-&#x3b1; inhibitors SPD304 and C87, serving as positive controls, showed cytotoxicity in this experiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). TIM1 showed no lethality in HDF or murine fibrosarcoma cell line L929 up to 200 &#x3bc;M (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>). Based on the observed cytotoxicity of the compounds, TIM1 was selected for further experimentation to test the inhibitory effect of TNF-&#x3b1;-mediated cytokine secretion. HDFs were cultured with pre-cultured mixtures of recombinant human TNF-&#x3b1; (rhTNF-&#x3b1;) with TIM1 or SPD304, and for evaluation of cytokine secretion profiles through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the culture supernatant was collected after 24 hours. Thereby, it was confirmed that TIM1 inhibited TNF-&#x3b1;-mediated secretion of human interleukin 8 (hIL-8; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) and human interleukin 6 (hIL-6; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC<sub>5</sub>O values of TIM1 for the secretion of hIL-8 and IL-6 were calculated to be 16.71 and 6.3 &#x3bc;M, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>). Although the known anti-TNF ligand SPD304 completely inhibited the secretion of hIL-8 or hIL-6 at 50 &#x3bc;M, this significant inhibition was due to severe cytotoxicity at high concentrations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>F</figref>). At lower concentrations (i.e. 10 &#x3bc;M), SPD304 was found to increase the secretion of cytokines. This is deemed to be due to the physiological stress that the cells experienced before ligand-induced necrosis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) (Grootjans S. et al. (2017) <i>Cell Death Differ. </i>24(7):1184-1195).</p><heading id="h-0029" level="1">Example 3: Confirmation of Effect of TIM1 on Preventing TNF-&#x3b1;-Induced Death in Human and Mouse Cells</heading><p id="p-0149" num="0133">TNF-&#x3b1; is a potent inducer of the death of inflammatory cells via activation of the TNFR1-associated death signaling pathway (Elinav E. et al. (2013) <i>Nat. Rev. Cancer </i>13(11):759-771). In order to evaluate the effect of TIM1 on preventing TNF-&#x3b1;-mediated apoptosis, different concentrations of TIM1 or SPD304 (pre-cultured with rhTNF-&#x3b1;) were applied to actinomycin D (act-D)-sensitized HDFs. Significant attenuation of TNF-&#x3b1;-induced apoptosis was observed upon TIM1 treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>), and the IC<sub>50 </sub>value was 26.2 HM (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>). On the other hand, similar effects were not exerted by the known anti-TNF compound SPD304 at concentrations higher than 1 &#x3bc;M. Next, in order to test whether TIM1 is able to reproduce the protective effect thereof in mouse cells, a pre-cultured mixture of TIM1 or SPD304 and recombinant mouse TNF-&#x3b1; (rmTNF-&#x3b1;) was applied to an act-D-sensitized L929 cell line. As expected, TIM1 inhibited the rmTNF-&#x3b1;-mediated proapoptotic pathway in L929 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref>), with an IC<sub>50 </sub>value of 24.9 &#x3bc;M (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref>). In contrast, SPD304 did not reduce the death of these cells at concentrations other than 1 &#x3bc;M (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0030" level="1">Example 4: Confirmation of Effect of TIM1 on Inhibiting TNF-&#x3b1;-Dependent Signaling Pathway</heading><p id="p-0150" num="0134">Activation of TNFR1 by TNF-&#x3b1; triggers several distinct signaling pathways, including the NF-&#x3ba;B, MAPK, and caspase pathways (Brenner D., Blaser H. &#x26; Mak T. W. (2015) <i>Nat. Rev. Immunol. </i>15(6): 362-374). The present inventors first evaluated the effect of TIM1 on phosphorylation of the p65 subunit, which is an essential indicator of NF-&#x3ba;B activation, in L929 cells through Western blotting (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, TNF-&#x3b1;-mediated phosphorylation of the p65 subunit was attenuated by TIM1 compared to untreated cells, in which the amount of phosphorylated p65 increased over time. Next, phosphorylation of MAPKs such as p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK also appeared to be inhibited through treatment with TIM1. Moreover, TIM1 inhibited the activation of the caspase signaling pathway, a hallmark of programmed/inflammatory cell death (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). Specifically, TIM1 blocked the formation of cleaved active caspases 3 and 8 induced by TNF-&#x3b1; stimulation.</p><heading id="h-0031" level="1">Example 5: Confirmation of Effect of TIM1 on Preventing TNF-&#x3b1; Homotrimerization Assembly</heading><p id="p-0151" num="0135">After confirming the effect of TIM1 on inhibiting the TNF-&#x3b1; signaling pathway, the mechanism of action thereof was verified through cross-linked protein interaction analysis followed by Western blotting analysis. It is known that TNF-&#x3b1; is a stable homotrimer in a solution and is biologically active, and also that ligands interfering with trimeric assembly inactivate cytokine functions (Melagraki G. et al. (2017) <i>PLoS Comput. Biol. </i>13(4):e1005372). Since the initial screening of ligands was performed in consideration of the small-molecule binding site of the TNF-&#x3b1; conformation, it was expected that TIM1 should block TNF-&#x3b1; activity by inhibiting the formation of a functional trimer. To this end, rhTNF-&#x3b1; was pre-cultured with TIM1 or SPD304, chemically cross-linked, and then analyzed through Western blotting. As expected, TIM1 inhibited the formation of functional homotrimers in both rhTNF-&#x3b1; and rmTNF-&#x3b1; in a concentration-dependent manner (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>). This indicates that TIM1 binds very specifically to the central hydrophobic cavity of the preformed TNF-&#x3b1; homodimer, thus preventing spatial binding of the third monomer under physiological conditions.</p><heading id="h-0032" level="1">Example 6: Confirmation of Improved Bioactivity of TIM1 Derivatives on TNF-&#x3b1; Signaling</heading><p id="p-0152" num="0136">In order to improve the TNF-inhibitory activity of TIM1, further experiments were performed using a subset of commercially available (80% similar) derivatives, and the activity thereof was compared to TIM1 or SPD304. HDFs were cultured with pre-cultured mixtures of rhTNF-&#x3b1; with TIM1, TIM1-derivatives, or SPD304, and the culture supernatants were assessed for secretion levels of hIL-8 through ELISA. Among the molecules tested, TIM1c, TIM1d, TIM1-7, TIM1-10, TIM1-11, and TIM1-14 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) showed negligible cytotoxicity and exhibited concentration-dependent inhibition of TNF-induced hIL-8 greater than that of TIM1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>). In particular, TIM1c maximally inhibited TNF-induced hIL-8 compared to the others, and was considered the most potent derivative. It should be noted herein that SPD304 completely inhibits cytokine production at 50 &#x3bc;M, but exhibits strong cytotoxicity at concentrations exceeding 1 &#x3bc;M, making the observed cytokine inhibition insignificant.</p><heading id="h-0033" level="1">Example 7: Confirmation of Oral Bioavailability of TIM1c and Suppressed Arthritis Symptoms in Mice</heading><p id="p-0153" num="0137">Due to strong TNF-&#x3b1; signaling inhibition of TIM1c in vitro, the present inventors predicted that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) symptoms could be ameliorated in animals. In a mouse model of collagen-induced polyarthritis (CIA), the efficacy of TIM1c was analyzed by feeding the animals with 2 or 20 mg/kg of the compound every 2 days (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) and evaluating arthritis symptoms. Dose-dependent amelioration was exhibited in RA of the group treated through oral administration of TIM1c when compared to CIA mice, as confirmed by weight gain (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>), paw volume decrease (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>), and number of squeaks per day (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>). Consequently, the arthritis index (clinical score) of the treatment group was significantly decreased compared to the case of CIA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E</figref>). At the start of drug treatment (day 15), the knees, ankles and paws were swollen, so the development of RA was evident in all forelimbs and hindlimbs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>F</figref>). At a low dose of 2 mg/kg/2 days, TIM1c was able to slightly ameliorate disease severity. However, at a dose of 20 mg/kg/2 days, the induction of RA was significantly decreased to such an extent that the limbs of the animals were almost identical to those of the normal group. This suggests that oral administration of TIM1c exhibits an anti-inflammatory efficacy and effect in animals.</p><heading id="h-0034" level="1">Example 8: TIM1 and TIM1c Stably Occupying TNF-&#x3b1; Homodimer Through Non-Polar Interaction</heading><p id="p-0154" num="0138">The present inventors performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of TNF-&#x3b1;-SPD304, TNF-&#x3b1;-TIM1, and TNF-&#x3b1;-TIM1c complexes for 100 ns in order to compare ligand-binding patterns under dynamic conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). The initial lead material TIM1 was bound to the TNF-&#x3b1; dimer in a more expanded form than SPD304 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>), and the thiazole ring was packed for Y119/Y119* represents chain B) and a carboxamide-linked pyrrole group that interacts mainly with Q61 and Y151 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>). The phthalazine group was stabilized through hydrophobic contact with Y151 and H15 as well as partial n-stacking interactions with Y59. The ethynylphenyl group interacted with V123, L57 and I155, and also interacted with Y151*, Y59* and I155*. With the exception of the electrostatic interaction alone between the amide-nitrogen of TIM1 and the hydroxyl group of the Y151 side chain, TIM1 did not form any salt bridge or hydrogen bond with TNF-&#x3b1;. The electronegative atom of SPD304 (e.g. 3-trifluoromethyl moiety) interacted with the core and was exposed toward the oxygen solvent of the ligand.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0139">Also, TIM1c was bound to the TNF homodimer fully in an unfolding direction but partially in a planar direction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>). In TIM1c, the ethynylphenyl group is substituted with a propylamino group, which is extended toward the hydrophobic pocket formed by A96*, P117*, I118* and L120*. Unlike TIM1, the thiazole ring and carboxamide-linked pyrrole group of TIM1c were packed only for Y119/Y119*, which showed a distinct orientation compared to the other two complexes. The phthalazine group was stabilized through hydrophobic contact with Y59*, L57*, L115* and H15, as well as partial &#x3c0;-stacking interactions with Y119 and Y59.
