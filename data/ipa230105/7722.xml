In the RRC inactive state, a non-access stratum (NAS) layer is still in a connected state, and behavior of an RRC layer is similar to behavior of an RRC idle state. When a terminal needs to enter an RRC connected state, the terminal does not need to re-perform an RRC connection establishment process, but directly sends an RRC connection resumption request to a network. In other words, in 5G, there are three RRC states: an RRC connected state, an RRC inactive state, and an RRC idle state.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When user equipment (UE) is in the RRC connected state, the network sends, to the UE, an RRC connection release message used to indicate the UE to enter the RRC idle state. After receiving the RRC release message, the UE switches to the RRC idle state. If the UE needs to subsequently initiate a service, the UE may send an RRC connection establishment message, to re-establish an RRC link and enter the RRC connected state. When the UE is in the RRC connected state, the network may alternatively configure the UE to enter the RRC inactive state. If the UE needs to subsequently initiate a service, the UE may send an RRC connection resumption message, to quickly resume an RRC connection and enter the RRC connected state. If an exception occurs when the UE switches from the RRC inactive state to the RRC connected state, the UE enters the RRC idle state. Alternatively, when the UE is in the RRC inactive state, the UE may directly enter the RRC idle state by using an RRC inactive state release message. When the UE is in the RRC inactive state or the RRC idle state, energy consumption of the UE can be reduced. However, the UE in the RRC inactive state can more quickly switch back to the RRC connected state than the UE in the RRC idle state.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a conventional protocol, a procedure in which the network configures the UE in the RRC connected state to enter the RRC inactive state is as follows: A network device determines, based on load of the UE and detection on service transmission that is performed by the UE for a period of time, whether to configure the UE to enter the RRC inactive state. If the network device determines to configure the UE to enter the RRC inactive state, the network device configures, by using an RRC release message, the UE to enter the RRC inactive state.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a conventional manner of configuring the UE to enter the RRC inactive state, power consumption of the UE and network resource consumption cannot be reduced to a maximized extent.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Example embodiments of this application provide a method and an apparatus for switching an RRC state, to effectively reduce power consumption of a terminal-side communications apparatus and reduce network resource consumption.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect, a method for switching an RRC state is provided, and the method for switching an RRC state includes: sending, by a communications apparatus, indication information to a network device, where the indication information is used to indicate that the communications apparatus requests to enter an RRC inactive state; after completing a registration process of an RRC connected state, receiving, by the communications apparatus, an RRC connection release message that is sent by the network device based on the indication information, where the RRC connection release message is used to indicate the communications apparatus to enter the RRC inactive state; and entering, by the communications apparatus, the RRC inactive state from the RRC connected state based on the RRC connection release message.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The communications apparatus is a terminal-side communications apparatus.

A communications apparatus sends indication information to the network device, where the indication information is used to indicate that the communications apparatus requests to enter an RRC inactive state.

In this way, flexibility of the terminal device in switching from the RRC connected state to the RRC inactive state can be improved. Therefore, in this embodiment of this application, the terminal device is allowed to trigger to enter the RRC inactive state, and compared with the prior art, energy consumption of the terminal device can be further reduced, and network resource consumption can also be further reduced.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Specifically, in S<b>220</b>, after receiving the indication information sent by the terminal device, the network device determines, by parsing the indication information, that the terminal device needs to enter the RRC inactive state; and sends the RRC connection release message to the terminal device after the terminal device completes the registration process of the RRC connected state.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Optionally, in some embodiments, S<b>210</b> further includes: after completing the registration process of the RRC connected state, sending, by the terminal device, the indication information to the network device.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Specifically, in S<b>210</b>, after completing the registration process of the RRC connected state, the terminal device detects that there is no data to be sent currently, and sends the indication information to the network device.

The RRC air interface message carries the indication information used to indicate that the terminal device requests to enter the RRC inactive state.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In still another example, if the terminal device in the RRC connected state predicts that the terminal device does not need to send data in a future period of time after completing current service data transmission, the terminal device sends an RRC air interface message to the network device. The RRC air interface message is used to indicate that the terminal device requests to enter the RRC inactive state after completing the current service data transmission.
