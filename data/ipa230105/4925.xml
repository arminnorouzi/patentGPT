The transfer robot is widely introduced in such facilities as warehouses, factories, and ports.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In response to diversification of customer needs in recent years, warehouses handling many types of products each in a small lot, such as warehouses for mail-order businesses, are increasing in number. Products to be managed require, by nature, time and personnel cost to search for and load. For that reason, demands for automation of logistics work inside a facility are greater in warehouses for mail-order businesses than in warehouses handling one type of product in a large quantity.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, there has been known a system using a transfer robot which conveys a rack for housing products to raise efficiency of warehouse management. The transfer robot conveys the rack inside a warehouse following an instruction of the system which performs overall warehouse management.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A technology as described in JP 2000-351422 A has been known as a technology for determining placement of products inside a warehouse. In JP 2000-351422 A, there is included description &#x201c;in a commercial product placement planning support system for determining locations at which a plurality of commercial products are to be stored out of a plurality of predetermined storage areas, information about degrees of relevance determined for the commercial products based on simultaneity of work to be performed after the commercial products are stored is obtained, and locations at which the commercial products are to be stored are determined in accordance with the degrees of relevance out of the plurality of storage areas, based on the obtained information about the degrees of relevance of the commercial products.&#x201d;</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A premise of the technology as described in JP 2000-351422 A is that a worker travels to a storage area and performs work there. In systems of recent years, on the other hand, a transfer robot moves a rack for housing products to a picking station, and a worker performs picking work at the picking station. Accordingly, in order to raise efficiency of the picking work, determination of an appropriate picking station to perform picking work at is also required. Only a limited amount of rise in the efficiency of the picking work is consequently expected from the technology as described in JP 2000-351422 A alone.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This invention provides a system and a method which determine product storage locations and picking station allocation that accomplish a raised efficiency of picking work.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A representative example of the present invention disclosed in this specification is as follows: a management system for managing entering and dispatching of products to be managed in a warehouse. The warehouse includes a plurality of racks each of which stores the products, at least one transfer robot configured to convey a rack, and a plurality of picking stations at which workers perform picking work on the rack conveyed by the at least one transfer robot. The management system comprises: a product group generation module configured to generate, based on relevance among the products in the picking work, a plurality of product groups each including a plurality of products; an allocated-rack determination module configured to determine, for each one of the plurality of product groups, allocation of at least one of the plurality of racks in which the plurality of products belonging to the one of the plurality of product groups are to be stored; an allocated-picking station determination module configured to determine, for each one of the plurality of product groups, allocation of at least one of the plurality of picking stations to be used for the picking work of the plurality of products belonging to the one of the plurality of product groups; and a transfer robot controller configured to control the at least one transfer robot so that the at least one transfer robot conveys the at least one of the plurality of racks allocated to the one of the plurality of product groups to the at least one of the plurality of picking stations allocated to the one of the plurality of product groups. The allocated-picking station determination module is configured to: select a target product group out of the plurality of product groups; and determine one of the plurality of picking stations that is at a shortest distance from the at least one of the plurality of racks that is allocated to the target product group, as the at least one of the plurality of picking stations that is to be allocated to the target product group.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to this invention, the product storage locations and picking station allocation that accomplish a raised efficiency of picking work can be determined. Other problems, configurations, and effects than those described above will become apparent in the descriptions of embodiments below.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention can be appreciated by the description which follows in conjunction with the following figures, wherein:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram for illustrating an example of a configuration of a warehouse management system of a first embodiment of this invention;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view for illustrating an example of a warehouse in the first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a plan view for illustrating an example of the warehouse in the first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a table for showing an example of data structure of allocation information in the first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow chart for illustrating an example of processing executed by a control system in the first embodiment in order to determine allocated racks and allocated picking stations;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flow chart for illustrating an example of processing executed by the control system in the first embodiment in order to generate work data; and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flow chart for illustrating an example of processing executed by the control system in a second embodiment in order to change allocation of the picking stations.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Now, a description is given of an embodiment of this invention referring to the drawings.
