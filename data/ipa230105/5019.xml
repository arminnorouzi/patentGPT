Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention generally relates to position monitoring networks and, more particularly, to a system and method for location-targeting the delivery of media from a mobile platform.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Humans spend more and more time in their automobiles driving to work and to other lifestyle activities, as well as travel. In the United States, the average American spends approximately 10 minutes per day in an automobile. Approximately 90% of Americans own cars and over 75% drive to work every day. A record 107 million Americans have automobile debt and make monthly payments. The outdoor advertising industry aimed at targeting these drivers is estimated at $8 billion each year.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There exist many systems that attempt to take advantage of human user mobility to implement advertising and media distribution. US 2013/0304565, entitled &#x201c;System and Method for Advertising on Mobile Platforms&#x201d;, and US 2016/0267539, entitled &#x201c;Individual and Fleet-Based Vehicle-Based Wireless Marketing Device&#x201d; disclose such systems. U.S. Pat. No. 8,010,134, entitled &#x201c;Architecture for Mobile Advertising with Location&#x201d;, discloses a system that uploads particular media content to a mobile device based upon the mobile device location. U.S. Pat. No. 7,463,898, entitled &#x201c;System and Method for the Distribution of Advertising and Associated Coupons via Mobile Media Platforms&#x201d;, describes a similar concept. U.S. Pat. No. 8,712,630, entitled &#x201c;Mobile Advertising and Compensation-Verification System&#x201d; describes a system where a display with an embedded power source and Global Position System (GPS) receiver is adhesively attached to a vehicle. The owner of the vehicle is rewarded for the number of miles the vehicle is driven. The installation of the display is verified by recording a cell phone picture. The system includes a GPS device with a transmitter, shown communicating with a GPS satellite, that allegedly prevents tampering or removal of the display after its installation. However, as is well known in the art, GPS satellites only transmit data to users&#x2014;they do not receive or otherwise uplinked data from users. Similarly, although an EEPROM device is described for storing location information and distance data, no means is presented for downloading this data to the central entity computerized database that is tasked with distributing rewards.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would be advantageous if the time and location of a portable media presentation could be tracked and recorded.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It would be advantageous if the media presentation could be selectively enabled.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would be advantageous if the above-mentioned media presentation could be accurately and continuously verified. It would be advantageous if the system included a targeting mechanism to suggest that the media be presented in desired target locations.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It would also be advantageous if the enablement of media presentation of the location of the media presentation could be verified remotely, without requiring the employment of a human.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A system and method are disclosed herein that encompass remotely deployable and activated automated signage. In one aspect, the signage is a vehicle cover that displays advertising and is integrated, for example, with a mobile phone software application to provide a means of directing the signage to prime locations. Alternatively, the vehicle driver may manually deploy the vehicle cover and the device functions in the same manner. In one aspect, the mobile sign advertising system is enabled as a vehicle roof mounted all-weather device that upon remote instruction from an vehicle operator deploys and retracts a cover made of cloth or other pliable material over and across a vehicle, either manually or using an electric motor (battery, vehicle sourced, or solar powered). Thus, the system creates a mobile advertising platform that seeks to expand and capture market share within the outdoor advertising market segment by directing the selective deployment of media to preferred target locations, as well as (optionally) providing the automobile protection from the elements.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The cover may display an advertising message, coupon, or logo. The vehicle cover may be deployed automatically or manually by the vehicle operator by removing the cover from the housing. The roof mounted device may contain side panels displaying logos that may remain in place on the exterior of the vehicle roof during transport and may be affixed to the exterior of the vehicle roof by magnets or suction cups or pads, or the roof mounted device may be removed and stored in the vehicle following retraction of the cover by the internal motor or manually by the vehicle operator. The roof mounted device may also contain a halo of LED lights located under a fin that directs emitting light downward onto the cover to illuminate the cover during darkness or low light periods. The LED lights may be powered by a battery contained in the device housing or an electrical system connected to the vehicle's power source. Once in a stationary position, a receiver located in the roof mounted device can be activated remotely by an electrical signaling device (such as Bluetooth, cellular, or WiFi) to deploy and retract the cover through a proprietary software application on the operator's mobile phone. Alternatively, the system and communications are initiated by deploying the cover. The mobile phone software application may transmit the following information to the owner of the proprietary software: (i) a unique identifier for the device in use (for example, radio-frequency identification) and the operator of the vehicle assigned or in possession of the device, (ii) the time, date, duration and location (using mobile-satellite triangulation systems or radio-frequency identification systems) that the device or the person manually deployed or retracted the presentation media, and (iii) a photographic image of the vehicle with the cover deployed. The proprietary software may utilize graphic information system (GIS) mapping technology to compensate the operator of the vehicle for parking the vehicle in specified locations as identified in the mobile phone software application.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, a method is provided for monitoring the provision of media distributed by a mobile platform. The method provides a mobile platform with an attached media projection subsystem, and an identifier (e.g., serial number) associated with the media projection subsystem or the mobile platform. Examples of a mobile platform include a self-powered vehicle, a towed trailer or sign, a shopping cart, a drone, or even a backpack. The media projection subsystem is selectively enabled, and may be a car cover, retractable screen, or a broadcasted sound to name a few examples. In one aspect of the method, media uploads are received from a server and projected by the media projection subsystem.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The method determines the geographic location of the mobile platform, and verifies the identifier and the enablement of the media projection system. Verification information, including the mobile platform (or media projection subsystem) location, identifier, and enablement of the media projection subsystem, is communicated to a server and stored in a non-transitory memory.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Typically, the identifier is associated with an entity such as a person, business, or corporation. Then, a targeting application, stored in the server memory, enables a sequence of processor executable instructions for directing the entity to a target location in cooperation with analyzing the verification information. For example, the target location may be selected from a plurality of value weighted target locations. More explicitly, the target location may be weighted in response to geographic location factors such as proximate vehicular traffic, line of sight, proximate pedestrian traffic, proximity to cultural events, proximity to cultural facilities, and combinations thereof. Otherwise, the target location may be weighted in response to factors such as the type of media being projected, the time of day, the day of the week, the date, the length of time the media is being projected, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one aspect, the identifier and media projection subsystem include short-range wireless devices transmitting, respectively, an identification code and an enablement signal. A personal communications device, enabled for example as a smartphone, includes a wireless device to receive the identification code and enablement signal, and a global positioning system (GPS) receiver for determining the mobile platform location. A verifier software application, stored in a non-transitory memory, is enabled as a sequence of processor executable instructions for verifying the identification code and the enablement of the media projection subsystem, and providing verification information. The verifier may be embedded with the personal communications device or the server. Alternatively, a GPS receiver, the identifier, and a communication subsystem are embedded with the media projection subsystem.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another aspect, the identifier is an identification code physically marking the media projection subsystem. Then, a personal communications device with a camera photographs the identification code and the deployment of the media projection subsystem. The step of verifying the identifier and the enablement of the media projection system includes recognizing the photographs of the identification code and media projection subsystem deployment, respectively, as the identifier and the enablement of the media projection subsystem.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect, the method provides a camera embedded with media projection subsystem, and images recorded by the camera are communicated to the server for storage in memory. The value of the target location provided to the entity may then be modified based upon the information provided in the images. Alternatively, the camera images may be used to verify the enablement of the media projection subsystem. Additional details of the above-described method, a mobile media distribution system, a system for monitoring the occupation of a geographic location by a mobile platform, and a system for monitoring the provision of media distributed by a mobile platform are provided below.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> are schematic block diagrams of a mobile media distribution system.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> are schematic block diagrams depicting the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> as a stand-alone mobile media distribution system.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A through <b>3</b>C</figref> are a schematic block diagrams depicting the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> partially enabled with a personal communications device.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram depicting the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> partially enabled using photographic images.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a plan view of an exemplary target location weighting map.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A through <b>6</b>C</figref> are perspective views depicting the media projection subsystem associated with an exemplary vehicle mobile platform.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram depicting a system for monitoring the occupation of a geographic location by a mobile platform.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram depicting a system for monitoring the provision of media distributed by a mobile platform.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method for monitoring the provision of media distributed by a mobile platform.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> are schematic block diagrams of a mobile media distribution system. The system <b>100</b> comprises a selectively enabled media projection subsystem <b>102</b> having an interface <b>104</b> to project media and an interface on line <b>106</b> to supply an enablement signal in response to the media projection subsystem being enabled.

Examples of memories include, without limitation, Random Access Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory (ROM), flash memory, or any other suitable memory device. Although not required, in certain embodiments, the systems described herein may include both a volatile memory unit and a non-volatile storage device. The memory may be implemented as shared memory and/or distributed memory in a network device.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one aspect, the identifier <b>108</b> is associated with a first entity. The first entity may be referred to as a legal entity in some aspects, examples of which include a human being, a business, or a corporation. A targeting software application <b>126</b> is stored in a non-transitory memory <b>128</b> of the server <b>124</b>, enabling a sequence of processor executable instructions for directing or suggesting to the first entity (or media projection subsystem) a target location in cooperation with analyzing the verification information. In one aspect, the target location is predetermined. As such, portions of the system described herein that are enabled with software applications may be understood to be a type of computer system. As is well known in the art, a processor is used to implement the steps in a software application. The memory of the computer system typically includes some type of operating system (OS). To reduce the clutter in the drawings, and since the interaction with an OS, processor, and software application is so well understood, processors and OS software are not shown in this figure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> depicts the interaction between components of the targeting application <b>126</b> and the verifier <b>116</b>. In one aspect, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the targeting application <b>126</b> and verifier <b>116</b> may be collocated in the same memory, or be combined as a single unified application. Otherwise, the various components depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> may be non-centrally distributed. In one aspect, the targeting application may optionally determine a reward for the first entity, as shown in phantom, in response to the media projection subsystem occupying the target location. The most obvious type of reward is money. However, the first entity may alternatively be rewarded with bitcoin, cryptocurrency, coupons, or services. In one aspect, the target location is selected from a plurality of weighted (in value of importance) target locations, in response to the specific geographic location of where the media projection subsystem is located. For example, the target location may be weighted in response to geographic location factors such as proximate vehicular traffic, line of sight from a particular vantage point, proximate pedestrian traffic, proximity to cultural events, proximity to cultural facilities, and combinations thereof. A cultural event is generally understood to be an activity involving human beings. Likewise, a cultural facility is a facility used by human beings, such as a museum, office building, or grocery store parking lot. As a more explicit example, a target location may have a first value if the media projection subsystem <b>102</b> is enabled within X feet of a particular location, and second value, greater than the first value, if the media projection subsystem is enabled within X/2 feet of the same location. Other factors reflected in the weighting of the target locations may include the type of media being projected, the time of day, the day of the week, the date, the length of time the media is being projected, and combinations thereof. There may be locations, such as parks, hospitals, or freeways where signage or parking is legally restricted, and in one aspect these locations are given a target value of zero. In one aspect, the system may even prevent the enablement of the media projection subsystem in legally restricted areas. The system <b>100</b> described herein is not limited to any particular factors weighting a target location. The system is interactive in the sense that the first entity may select a deployment location after determining the value of a location. In this sense, the targeting application does not so much direct the media presentation subsystem to a particular predetermined location, as suggest multiple possible locations.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another aspect shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the system <b>100</b> further comprises an optional camera <b>130</b>, shown in phantom, embedded with the media projection subsystem <b>102</b>, and having an output on line <b>132</b> to supply images of the geographic location proximate to the media projection subsystem. The communications subsystem <b>120</b> receives the images from the camera and transmits them to the server. The camera images of the environment surrounding the media projection subsystem <b>102</b> may be stored as data <b>132</b> in memory for analysis. In one aspect, the camera images may be analyzed using an artificial intelligence (AI) application, in conjunction with stored map images, the combination of which operates as the location device <b>112</b>. In this way, the system may &#x201c;learn&#x201d; to deployment media in the optimum locations.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The camera images may also be used to modify the value of the target location. For example, the recorded traffic in a location may be greater than anticipated, and the target value adjusted accordingly. That is, images recording higher pedestrian or vehicular traffic may have greater value. The data may be used to help determine the efficacy of the media or location. In one alternative aspect shown in phantom, the data recorded by the camera may be imprinted with the identifier <b>108</b>, stored in a local memory <b>134</b> of the media projection subsystem, and subsequently downloaded through the communications subsystem <b>120</b> or through a memory peripheral, such as a thumb drive, which can be accessed by a third party, server provider, or first entity. Alternatively or in addition, the camera images my act to verify that the media projection subsystem <b>102</b> has been enabled. In one aspect, simply recording a change in images, and thus proximate traffic, can be used as a means for proving media projection subsystem enablement.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one aspect, the communications subsystem <b>120</b> receives media uploads from the server <b>124</b> on line <b>122</b>, and the communications subsystem provides the media uploads to the media projection subsystem <b>102</b> on line <b>136</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> are schematic block diagrams depicting the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> as a stand-alone mobile media distribution system. A non-transitory memory <b>200</b> is embedded with the media projection subsystem <b>102</b>. Likewise, the identifier <b>108</b>, communications subsystem <b>120</b>, and GPS receiver <b>112</b> are embedded with the media projection subsystem <b>102</b>. As shown, the verifier <b>116</b> is software application enabled as a sequence of processor executable instructions, and stored in the memory <b>200</b>, for processing the verification information. Alternatively, as shown in phantom, the verifier <b>116</b> may be embedded in the server memory <b>128</b>. Although not explicitly depicted, communications between the media projection subsystem and the server may be relayed through the use personal communication devices or WiFi access points. In this example, the identifier <b>108</b> is a code loaded into memory <b>200</b>, but alternatively it can be a mechanical device, such as a DIP switch often associated with garage door openers. The media projection subsystem enablement signal on line <b>106</b> may be triggered, for example, by the deployment of a screen displaying a media message. In one aspect, the media projection subsystem can be remotely enabled, using signals relayed by a personal communications device or embedded communications subsystem, from the server or from an entity (user) at a different location. For example, the media projection subsystem may be remotely enabled to project only in the daylight hours, and then remotely disabled at night.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another aspect, a GPS antenna <b>212</b> (shown in phantom) may be embedded in the media projection mechanism, for example, if the mechanism is a screen or cover. Since location data is only collected when the screen is deployed, the collection of location data simultaneously proves the enablement of the media projection subsystem <b>102</b>. Otherwise, a switch may be thrown that powers the GPS receiver when the media projection mechanism is deployed. Again, since location data is only collected when the media projection mechanism is deployed, the collection of location data simultaneously acts as proof of enablement. As yet another alternative, a powered GPS is shielded (e.g., by a metal cover) until the media projection mechanism is activated.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The verifier application <b>116</b> is enabled with the aid of processor <b>202</b> and OS <b>204</b>. Also note that interfaces <b>106</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>114</b>, and <b>118</b> may share the same bus line. Likewise, server <b>124</b> includes OS <b>206</b> and processor <b>208</b>, with transceiver <b>210</b>. For ease of understanding the above-described functions have been described as individual components. However, it should be understood that in practice, multiple functions may be performed in a single device or subsystem.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> depicts more of a peer-to-peer type system where the targeting application <b>126</b> is embedded in the memory of the media projection subsystem memory <b>200</b>. In this case, the targeting application <b>126</b> may use the communications subsystem <b>120</b> to communicate with at least one server in the distributed network of servers <b>124</b>-<b>0</b> through <b>124</b>-<i>n</i>. In one aspect, the distributed network of servers may be other media projections systems. As another alternative, each server in the distributed network may include targeting and verifier applications, and data storage block-chain mechanisms. If the system is enabled to reward users (entities) based upon time, location, and duration of media deployment, the rewards may also be managed using a block-chain mechanism.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A through <b>3</b>C</figref> are a schematic block diagrams depicting the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> partially enabled with a personal communications device.

The personal communications device may be capable of cellular, WiFi, and Bluetooth communications. In addition, the personal communications device may be a customized smartphone or proprietary device capable of nanoscale, near-field communication (NFC), body (BAN), personal (PAN), near-me (NAN), or wireless local area network (WLAN) to name a few examples. In additional, the personal communications device may also be capable of hardline (e.g., Ethernet) communications, and capable of downloading memory-stored information into peripheral memory devices.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this aspect, the identifier <b>108</b> includes a short-range wireless device <b>300</b>, embedded with the media projection subsystem <b>102</b>, transmitting the identification code.

In one aspect not shown, the identifier and media projection subsystem may use the same transmitter. Further, the short-range wireless device(s) may be transceivers if the system employs a handshaking mechanism. The communications subsystem is a personal communications device <b>304</b> that includes a wireless device <b>306</b> to receive the identification code and enablement signal, the GPS receiver <b>112</b>, an OS <b>310</b>, and processor <b>312</b>.

In some aspects, the personal communications device wireless unit <b>306</b> is also only capable of short range communications, to further ensure accurate GPS location measurement. Although the communications <b>122</b> to the server <b>124</b> are depicted as wireless, they may alternatively be enabled with hardline protocols or by downloading personal communications device memory on a peripheral memory card.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> depicts some overall media performance algorithm components. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> depicts some aspects of an exemplary media projection mobile application.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram depicting the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> partially enabled using photographic images.

Again, the communications subsystem is a personal communications device <b>304</b>. The personal communication device <b>304</b> comprises a camera <b>400</b> to photograph the identification code and the deployment of the media projection subsystem. The GPS receiver <b>122</b> may be embedded with the personal communications device, as shown. Alternatively but not shown, the GPS receiver may be embedded with the media projection subsystem, and communicate GPS location data to the personal communications device via a wireless link. The verifier <b>116</b> is shown embedded in the personal communications device memory <b>308</b>, but alternatively as shown in phantom, it may be embedded in the memory of the server. Wherever the verifier <b>116</b> is embedded, it recognizes the photographs of the identification code and media projection subsystem deployment, respectively, as the identification code and enablement signal. As another alternative, an AI mapping analysis application may determine location from the photographs.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a plan view of an exemplary target location weighting map.

Regions <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> may be suburban areas, with the values associated with Region <b>3</b> being higher because of a greater population density. Region <b>5</b> may be rural and have the smallest value. In one aspect, the target location weighting map is stored and maintained in the server. Components of the media projection system (e.g., a verifier application stored in a personal communications device) may access, and perhaps upload, the target location weighting map so as to determine the optimum position for locating the system. Alternatively, a separate but associated mobile map application may be used.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A through <b>6</b>C</figref> are perspective views depicting the media projection subsystem associated with an exemplary vehicle mobile platform.

The identifier, GPS receiver, and verifier are not explicitly depicted. These components may be internal to the chassis housing the media projection subsystem <b>102</b>. As described above, a GPS receiver and verifier may be embedded in other parts of the system. The media projection subsystem <b>102</b> is mounted to a roof rack <b>600</b>. In this example, the media projection subsystem <b>102</b> may use a screen <b>602</b> to project image data. As shown, the screen <b>602</b> may be retractable. The screen <b>602</b> may be printed with a fixed advertising message, warning, or alert. Alternatively, the screen may be fixed or stationary. In one aspect, not shown, the media projection subsystem <b>102</b> further comprises a light projecting device for illuminating the screen with the media image, or for simply illuminating a fixed printed message at night. In another aspect, the screen includes a field of light emitting diodes (LEDs) or liquid crystal display (LCD) for projecting (i.e., creating) a visual image. In general, any type of imaging system, such as a conventional projector, may be used to create or transfer an illuminated message onto a screen or cover. As noted above, in one aspect the light projection system is capable of receiving updated media from the server, or capable of projecting different types of media packages stored in memory. In one aspect, the media presented may include a quick response (QR) code, matrix barcode, or watermark that can be downloaded by a viewer, and used as a coupon in a subsequent purchase, as a metric of efficacy of the media presentation. Optionally, in combination with or as an alternative to the projection of image media, the system may include a speaker <b>604</b> to broadcast an audible sound as the media.

The device housing may be painted various colors. The leading edge portion of the device housing that faces the front of the automobile can be aerodynamic to reduce wind drag and noise. Located at or near the bottom of the device housing are openings that allow the fabric car cover to be deployed and retracted. The device housing may be an automated roof mounted case. Alternatively, the top portion of the device may be removed manually by the vehicle driver and deployed. As an alternative to the rack, the housing may be attached by vibration resistant bolts, suction cups, screws, clips, or magnetic devices that attach to the roof of the vehicle and that are capable of keeping the device affixed to the roof during transit or inclement weather. The perimeter of the device housing may include a row of continuous or intermittent LED lights directly under a small rib or fin of the housing that directs the emanating LED light in a downward fashion over and across the fabric cover to illuminate it during periods of darkness or low light. On the vertical portions of the device housing facing the sides, and/or front and rear of the automobile, are panels that can be painted or impregnated with logos or lettering.

In this aspect, the media presentation is more likely to be a fixed stationary message or picture. If operated in cooperation with a personal communications device as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the car cover need not include a power source, as the personal communications device can photograph an identifier printed on the cover while simultaneously verifying that the cover is deployed (as shown). Alternatively, enablement of the system can be measured with an embedded camera or photodetector, with the use of short-range transmitters as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, or with the use of communications subsystem.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The enablement of the media projection subsystem using a screen can be measured in a number of different ways.

In the case of a more active presentation system, the enablement of an LED field or light projection unit can act as proof of enablement.

Other weighting factors may include the time of day, the day of the week, the date, the length of time the media is being projected, and combinations thereof. This system may be useful, as described above, for ensuring that certain areas are blocked and subsequently made available for cultural events and priority vehicle parking. As another example, the system may be used to determine that a rental car or scooter has been returned to a proper specified location. Although the target locations and weights may be predetermined, in some aspects the weighting for non-predetermined areas may be calculated concurrently with the deployment of the media projection subsystem.

For example, an advertising client may contract with a system provider stipulating a target market and deployment hours/rate. The system provider determines geo-fenced locations that meet or exceed the advertiser's target market based on location, demographics, traffic, population density, and other variables. In one variation, system enablers (e.g., entities or drivers) use a mobile application in conjunction with the media projection subsystem that is deployed in geo-fenced region for a period of time. Platform deployment time, location, quality code, and user information are recorded by the server. A system provider algorithm determines platform performance based on length of deployment, contracted rate, parking cost reimbursement, and location quality code.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As noted above, in one aspect a personal communications device mobile application communicates with the media projection system using a near-field, low power (e.g., Bluetooth) protocol. This mobile application may require user authentication and handshaking with media projection system as a means of identification and verification. The mobile application may provide the user with geo-fenced target deployment assignments, user account info, module status, and module controls. Driver deployment is logged when the driver pairs and connects the application with the media projection subsystem, and in one aspect, the driver deploys the media advertisement by pulling down a vinyl roller. Location and deployment time metrics are recorded using mobile GPS/cell-tower telemetric capabilities and time features. The user data and metrics may be transmitted using cellular wireless electronic communication to the server.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As at least partially seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>, the media projection system may include a roof mounted rack, battery compartment, pulldown vinyl advertisement, microcontrollers, and microchip wireless antenna. The projection system is mounted to a vehicle and the driver may then be directed to preferred deployment locations using the mobile map application. That is, a mobile map application may display geo-fenced locations corresponding to areas where the driver is eligible to make money by deploying advertising media. The driver syncs their mobile device application to the media projection system to control and confirm the device location, deployment, and length of deployment.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The systems described above support a targeted mobile sign system, where the mobile sign is selectively deployed. As explained above, the sign may be a car cover with an advertising logo or message. In cooperation with the deployment of the sign, an organization or user associated with the sign is directed to preferred locations. For example, the deployment of the sign along a busy urban thoroughfare is likely to have a greater value than deployment on a suburban side-street. Other factors that may be used to calculate target value may include the time of day and the length of deployment. Thus, some key features to the system are determining that the sign has actually been deployed, and once deployed, the location of the sign. In some aspects, the sign is a type of visual display, but other aspects may include just an auditory presentation, a combination visual and auditory presentation, or a presentation that is able to interact with a proximate viewer.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In one aspect, the sign communicates a deployment message and supporting systems receive the deployment message and determine the deployment location. This information can be relayed in real-time to a server entity. Alternatively, the information can stored in memory of the supporting system and transferred to the server at periodic intervals or upon the attainment of predetermined metrics such as the number of deployments. In this aspect, the sign can be enabled with a relatively simple transmitting device or memory.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The supporting system may be a smartphone with a proprietary application for interrogating or receiving interrogations from the sign. For example, the system may assume that smartphone is both enabled with a GPS application, and in the same approximate location as the deployed sign, if the sign uses a short range communication system such as Bluetooth, NFC, or WiFi. Likewise, the supporting system may be a local or mobile WiFi hotspot, in which case the deployment signal is relayed to the server, and it may be possible for the server to determine the location of the WiFi hotspot, for example, by communicating with devices adjacent to the hotspot that are enabled with GPS receivers.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In another aspect, the sign includes mechanisms for determining both deployment and location. As above, this information can be communicated to a supporting system in real-time using a wireless communications system. Again this information can be communicated to a smartphone with a proprietary application via Bluetooth, WiFi, or even cellular communications. Alternatively, the communications can be related via a WiFi hotspot, or sent more directly to the server via cellular communications. Alternatively, the deployment and location information can be stored and transferred occasionally or periodically using a wireless communications system, using a hard-wired link, or memory peripheral. In one aspect, the media projection subsystem can be equipped with inertial measurement unit (IMU), such as an accelerometer or gyroscope, to detect changes in location.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method for monitoring the provision of media distributed by a mobile platform. Although the method is depicted as a sequence of numbered steps for clarity, the numbering does not necessarily dictate the order of the steps. It should be understood that some of these steps may be skipped, performed in parallel, or performed without the requirement of maintaining a strict order of sequence. The method steps are supported by the above system descriptions and, generally, the method follows the numeric order of the depicted steps. The method starts at Step <b>900</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Step <b>902</b> provides a mobile platform with an attached media projection subsystem, and an identifier associated the media projection subsystem. Exemplary media projection subsystem may comprise a car cover, fixed screen, or retractable screen for displaying a media image. The media projection subsystem may also employ a light projection device, a field of LEDs, and an audio speaker. Step <b>904</b> selectively enables the media projection subsystem. Step <b>906</b> determines the geographic location of the mobile platform. Step <b>908</b> verifies the identifier and the enablement of the media projection system. Step <b>910</b> communicates, to a server, verification information including the mobile platform location, identifier, and enablement of the media projection subsystem. As noted above, there is no necessity that these steps be performed in the particular order listed above. In Step <b>912</b> the server accepts the verification information, and in Step <b>914</b> the server stores the verification information in a non-transitory memory.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one aspect, the identifier of Step <b>902</b> is associated with a first entity, and Step <b>916</b> directs or suggests a target location to the first entity in cooperation with analyzing the verification information using a targeting software application, stored in the server memory, and enabled as a sequence of processor executable instructions. A target location weight may be responsive to the type of geographic location occupied by the mobile platform. Some geographic location factors are proximate vehicular traffic, line of sight, proximate pedestrian traffic, proximity to cultural events, proximity to cultural facilities, and combinations thereof. A target location weight may also be responsive to factors such as the type of media being projected, the time of day, the day of the week, the date, the length of time the media is being projected, and combinations thereof. As shown with the arrow leading back to Step <b>906</b>, the selection of location may be influenced by the value of the location.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one aspect, Step <b>902</b> provides an identifier comprising a short-range wireless device transmitting an identification code, and with the media projection subsystem comprising a short-range wireless device for transmitting an enablement signal. In addition, Step <b>902</b> may further provide a personal communications device comprising a short-range wireless device to receive the identification code and enablement signal, and a GPS receiver for determining the mobile platform location. Then, verifying the identifier and the enablement of the media projection system in Step <b>908</b> includes using a verifier software application, stored in a non-transitory memory, enabled as a sequence of processor executable instructions for verifying the identification code and the enablement of the media projection subsystem. The verifier software application may be embedded with either the personal communications device or the server.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Alternatively, Step <b>902</b> embeds a GPS receiver, the identifier, and a communication subsystem with the media projection subsystem. In this case, the verifier software application is stored in a non-transitory memory of the media projection subsystem. The verification information communicated in Step <b>910</b> is communicated using the embedded communications subsystem. This method permits constant verification updates if so desired.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In another aspect, Step <b>902</b> provides the identifier as an identification code physically marking the media projection subsystem, and also provides a personal communications device including a camera to photograph the identification code and the deployment of the media projection subsystem. Then, verifying the identifier and the enablement of the media projection system in Step <b>908</b> includes recognizing the photographs of the identification code and media projection subsystem deployment, respectively, as the identifier and the enablement of the media projection subsystem.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one aspect, Step <b>903</b><i>a </i>receives media uploads from the server, and enabling the media projection subsystem in Step <b>904</b> includes the media projection subsystem projecting the media uploads. Optionally, Step <b>903</b><i>b </i>uplinks a target location weighting map, which may influence the deployment location of Step <b>904</b>. In another aspect, Step <b>902</b> provides a camera embedded with the media projection subsystem, and Step <b>918</b> communicates images recorded by the camera to the server for storage in memory. In another variation, the camera may be used in verifying system enablement in Step <b>908</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">System and methods have been provided for monitoring the deployment of media and the occupation of geographic locations. Examples of particular message structures, schematic block linkages, and hardware units have been presented to illustrate the invention. However, the invention is not limited to merely these examples. Other variations and embodiments of the invention will occur to those skilled in the art.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>We claim:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
