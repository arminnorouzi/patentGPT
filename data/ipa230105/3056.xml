<b>10</b> of a vehicle and a striker <b>40</b> is mounted on the vehicle body <b>30</b> so as to be lockable to the latch <b>20</b> for operation of opening and closing the door of the vehicle, and a compressible weather strip <b>50</b> is mounted in the region of the surface of the vehicle body <b>30</b> that faces the inner edge of the door <b>10</b> for water and air sealing of the door <b>10</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The weather strip <b>50</b> serves to perform a waterproofing function in the case of rain and to block wind noise generated due to the pressure difference between indoor air and outdoor air during driving.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> are vertical cross-sectional views illustrating a latch and a striker among the components of a conventional door-opening-and-closing device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, the latch <b>20</b> includes a claw <b>21</b> having an engaging groove <b>22</b>, into which the striker <b>40</b> is removably fitted, and a pawl <b>24</b> configured to hold the claw <b>21</b> at a position for locking of the striker <b>40</b> or to release the held state of the claw <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The claw <b>21</b> is provided at the entry of the engaging groove <b>22</b> thereof with an engaging end <b>23</b> projecting therefrom, and the pawl <b>24</b> is provided with an engaging step <b>25</b>, which is engaged with the engaging end <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, the rotating shaft <b>26</b> of the claw <b>21</b> is provided with a first return spring <b>27</b> configured to apply elastic restoring force to the claw <b>21</b> to rotate the claw <b>21</b> in the direction in which the locked state of the striker <b>40</b> is released, and the rotating shaft <b>28</b> of the pawl <b>24</b> is provided with a second return spring <b>29</b>, configured to apply elastic restoring force to the pawl <b>24</b> in the direction in which the claw <b>21</b> is locked to the striker <b>40</b> (the engaging end <b>23</b> is engaged with the engaging step <b>25</b>).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, in the locked state of the door, the striker <b>40</b> mounted on the vehicle body <b>30</b> is fitted into the engaging groove <b>22</b> in the claw <b>21</b>, among the components of the latch <b>20</b>, so as to be locked thereto, and is maintained in the locked state. Furthermore, the engaging end <b>23</b> of the claw <b>21</b> is engaged with the engaging step <b>25</b> of the pawl <b>24</b> such that the claw <b>21</b> is positioned so as to lock the striker <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">At this point, the weather strip <b>50</b> is maintained in the compressed state by the closing pressure of the door <b>10</b>, and applies repulsive force for pushing the door <b>10</b> in the opening direction (see the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Meanwhile, when a user operates a door lever <b>12</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) mounted on the outer surface of the door <b>10</b> in the opening direction, the pawl <b>24</b> among the components of the latch <b>20</b>, which is actuated in conjunction with the door lever <b>12</b>, is rotated in a clockwise direction (in which the locked state of the claw <b>21</b> is released). Accordingly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the engaging end <b>23</b> of the claw <b>21</b> is released from the engagement with the engaging step <b>25</b> of the pawl <b>24</b>, and the claw <b>21</b> is rotated by the elastic restoring force of the first return spring <b>27</b> in the direction in which the locked state of the striker <b>40</b> is released (in the clockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), whereby the engaging groove <b>22</b> in the claw <b>21</b> is rotated so as to allow the striker <b>40</b> to escape therefrom.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">When the claw <b>21</b> is rotated to a position such that the striker <b>40</b> can escape therefrom, the door <b>10</b> is first momentarily opened to a predetermined angle by the repulsive force of the weather strip <b>50</b> acting on the door <b>10</b> to push the door <b>10</b>. Subsequently, when a user pulls the door <b>10</b> to the outside, the door <b>10</b> is further opened to an angle desired by a user.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, the conventional door-opening-and-closing device has the following problems when an operation for opening a door is performed.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Because an actuation in which the pawl <b>24</b> is rotated in a counterclockwise direction (in which the claw <b>21</b> is released from the engaged state) and the engaging end <b>23</b> of the claw <b>21</b> is thus disengaged from the engaging step <b>25</b> of the pawl <b>24</b>, an actuation in which the claw <b>21</b> is rotated in a direction by the elastic restoring force of the first return spring <b>27</b> such that the striker <b>40</b> is released from the locked state, and an actuation in which the striker <b>40</b> escapes from the engaging groove <b>22</b> in the claw <b>21</b> while the door <b>10</b> is momentarily pushed outwards by the repulsive force of the weather strip <b>50</b>, thereby allowing the door <b>10</b> to be opened to a predetermined angle, are successively performed in a very short time, there is a problem in which a sound caused by momentary rotational actuation of the pawl <b>24</b> and the claw <b>21</b>, a contact sound generated when the striker <b>40</b> instantaneously escapes from the engaging groove <b>22</b> in the claw <b>21</b>, and the like are amplified through the internal space in the door panel and are transmitted to a user's ear as noise.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In other words, when the door <b>10</b> is momentarily pushed in the opening direction by the repulsive force of the weather strip <b>50</b> and the striker <b>40</b> escapes from the engaging groove <b>22</b> in the claw <b>21</b>, thereby allowing the door <b>10</b> to be opened to a determined angle, the door <b>10</b> is not in the state of being in close contact with the weather strip <b>50</b> (i.e., the state of preventing vibration is released). At this point, because the internal space in a door panel constituting the door <b>10</b> serves to amplify a vibrational sound and an operational sound caused by rotation of the pawl <b>24</b> and the claw <b>21</b> and a contact sound generated when the striker <b>40</b> escapes from the claw <b>21</b>, there is a problem in which the sounds are transmitted to a user's ear as noise.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The above information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the invention and therefore it may contain information that does not form the prior art that is already known to a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present disclosure relates to a vehicular door-opening-and-closing device.

Consequently, it is possible to prevent vibration and an operational sound, which are generated when the pawl and the claw are rotated, from being amplified through the internal space in the door, and it is thus possible to greatly reduce the amount of noise that is generated when the door is opened.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Second, even though the repulsive force of the weather strip is applied to the door when the operation of the pawl and the claw of the latch for opening the door is performed, the striker is continuously positioned in the engaging groove in the claw by virtue of the magnetic force of the magnet. Consequently, it is possible to prevent a phenomenon which would otherwise occur, in which a contact sound is generated when the door is pushed in the opening direction by the repulsive force of the weather strip and the striker momentarily escapes from the engaging groove in the claw of the latch, and it is thus possible to further reduce the amount of noise that is generated when the door is opened.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Third, even though the repulsive force of the weather strip is applied to the door after the operation of the pawl and the claw of the latch is performed for opening of the door, the striker is continuously positioned in the engaging groove in the claw by virtue of the magnetic force of the magnet. Thereafter, when a user pulls the door lever in the opening direction using force exceeding the magnetic force of the magnet, the striker easily escapes from the engaging groove in the claw, thereby allowing the door to be easily opened.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Fourth, when the claw of the latch is locked to the striker to close the door, the claw is attracted to the striker by the magnetic force of the magnet, thereby reducing resistance to closing of the door and thus improving the closing performance of the door.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The invention has been described in detail with reference to preferred embodiments thereof.
