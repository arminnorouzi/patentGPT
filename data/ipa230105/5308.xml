Such a cable is typically wrapped around a part of the bicycle as well as a part of the separate structure. Loops on ends of the cable were then secured to one another with the lock. More recently, bicycle locking options have expanded into new technologies such as those that allow for keyless operation, as examples, biometric locks and &#x201c;smart locks&#x201d; (which as used herein refers to locks that are configured to wirelessly communicate and be operated by a remote device such as a smart phone). However, despite an increase in locking options, bicycle theft continues to be an ongoing concern. For example, some estimates indicate that a bicycle is stolen in the United States every ten seconds.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Bicycle sharing programs are a type of transportation service in which bicycles are provided for shared use on a short-term basis. Many bicycle sharing programs allow riders to borrow a bicycle from a lockable bicycle rack (commonly referred to as a &#x201c;dock&#x201d;) to be returned to the same or another dock at a later time. Alternatively, some bicycle sharing programs utilize self-locking bicycles and do not require docks. Modern bicycle sharing programs may include computerized activation and payment, either at the dock or via a system integrated into the bicycle. Due to their convenience and relatively low cost to riders, bicycle sharing programs have seen significant worldwide growth in recent years. For example, it is estimated that bicycle sharing ridership in the United States has grown 25% every year since 2010.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While bicycle sharing programs are rapidly innovating, there are still several drawbacks. For example, dock-based programs include a limited number of docks and therefore require riders to go to specific locations to obtain and return bicycles. This may be inconvenient for the rider and may require the program staff to redistribute bicycles between the docks to maintain a widespread inventory. Dockless programs may require the riders to return the bicycles to certain designated locations, in which case such programs suffer from similar shortcomings as the dock-based programs. Alternatively, certain dockless programs allow the riders to leave the bicycles in any location or within a relatively broad geographic boundary. Such programs have received criticism from communities due to riders leaving the bicycles in locations that are on private property, block pedestrian or vehicle traffic, and/or are considered to negatively affect community aesthetics. In addition, current bicycle sharing programs often require significant initial investment (e.g., docks, specialized bicycles, proprietary computer software, etc.) which may act as a barrier to entry into the market and may limit the growth and success of the programs.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the above, it can be appreciated that there are certain problems, shortcomings or disadvantages associated with the prior art, and that it would be desirable if systems and methods were available for securing and/or sharing bicycles that were capable of at least partly overcoming or avoiding these problems, shortcomings or disadvantages.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides locking devices, systems, and methods for securing personal property to separate structures, as a nonlimiting example, securing personal transportation equipment including bicycles to bicycle racks, and in certain embodiments allow for remote sharing of the transportation equipment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one nonlimiting aspect of the invention, a locking device is provided that is responsive to a remote device. The locking device includes a lock body, a cable within the lock body and having a first end accessible from an exterior of the lock body, a spool configured to extend and retract the cable out of and into the lock body, a lock pin disposed at the first end of the cable, a cable lock incorporated into the lock body and configured to releasably secure the lock pin to the lock body, and an electronic communication and control unit incorporated into the lock body and configured to communicate with a remote device. The electronic communication and control unit controls the cable lock to secure and release the lock pin relative to the lock body to allow the remote device to wirelessly unlock the first end of the cable from the lock body.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another nonlimiting aspect of the invention, the cable lock includes a pin capture hole in the lock body and configured to receive the lock pin, a pin capture member within the lock body that shifts between a capture position that prevents the locking pin from being retracted from the pin capture hole and a release position that allows the locking pin to be retracted from the pin capture hole, a lock member that shifts between a locked position that maintains the pin capture member in the capture position and an unlocked position that allows the pin capture member to shift to the release position, and a drive mechanism configured to shift the lock member between the locked position and the unlocked position. The drive mechanism includes an electric motor and a gear assembly operatively coupling the electric motor to the locking member, and the electronic communication and control unit controls the electric motor in response to commands received from the remote device to selectively shift the lock member between the locked position and the unlocked position.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to yet another nonlimiting aspect of the invention, the locking device may be part of a system that includes the remote device and a software application configured to operate on the remote device, communicate with the communication and control unit of the locking device, and provide the commands to selectively shift the lock member between the locked position and the unlocked position.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to still another nonlimiting aspect of the invention, a method of locking a bicycle is provided that includes securing a lock body of a locking device on a part of the bicycle, pulling on a first end of a cable accessible from an exterior of the lock body in a direction away from the lock body to uncoil a portion of the cable from a spool within the lock body and extend the portion of the cable from the lock body, and locking the bicycle to a separate structure by wrapping the cable around the separate structure and locking a locking pin on the first end of the cable to the lock body. Locking the locking pin includes capturing the locking pin in a pin capture hole in the lock body with a pin capture member shifted into a capture position, and shifting a lock member in the lock body with a motorized drive mechanism to a locked position that maintains the pin capture member in the capture position. The method also includes wirelessly unlocking the locking pin to unlock the bicycle from the separate structure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Technical aspects of a locking device comprising elements as described above include its ability to securely lock personal property, including but not limited to personal transportation equipment such as bicycles, to separate structures including but not limited to bicycle racks. An optional feature of the locking device is the ability to facilitate sharing of a bicycle within a community. For this purpose, the communication and control unit incorporated into the lock body can be used to remotely unlock the bicycle from a separate structure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Other aspects and advantages of this invention will be appreciated from the following detailed description.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings

The cable <b>22</b> can be extended from the lock body <b>12</b> by unwinding it from the spool <b>24</b>, and can be retracted into the lock body <b>12</b> by rewinding the cable <b>22</b> onto the spool <b>24</b>. A spring <b>116</b>, such as a constant force spring, is coupled to the cable <b>22</b> to urge the cable <b>22</b> to rewind onto the spool <b>24</b> and thereby retract the cable <b>22</b> into the lock body <b>12</b>. Pulling on the first end <b>48</b> of the cable <b>22</b> unspools the cable <b>22</b> from the spool <b>24</b> to cause the cable <b>22</b> to be drawn from the lock body <b>12</b> against the biasing effect of the spring <b>116</b>, and releasing the cable <b>22</b> allows the cable <b>22</b> to retract into the lock body <b>12</b> and onto the spool <b>24</b> under the biasing effect of the spring <b>116</b>. The cable <b>22</b> may be a steel cable and may be covered with a sheath, such as a polymer sheath, or other coating, such as a vinyl plastic coating.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">A cable lock <b>118</b> is disposed on another area of the lock body <b>12</b> and configured to releasably secure the lock pin <b>114</b> to the lock body <b>12</b>. The cable lock <b>118</b> includes a pin capture hole <b>120</b>, represented as being disposed in the case portion <b>18</b>, that extends into the interior of the lock body <b>12</b>. The pin capture hole <b>120</b> is sized and configured to receive the distal end of the lock pin <b>114</b>. A pin latch is disposed inside the lock body <b>12</b> adjacent the pin capture hole <b>120</b> to capture the lock pin <b>114</b>. The pin latch includes a slide latch <b>124</b> that slides back and forth between a capture position and a release position. A spring <b>126</b> urges the slide latch <b>124</b> toward the capture position. The slide latch <b>124</b> includes a first aperture <b>128</b> that receives the tapered nose of the lock pin <b>114</b>. In the capture position, the first aperture <b>128</b> is slightly offset from the pin capture hole <b>120</b>. Inserting the nose of the lock pin <b>114</b> through the pin capture hole <b>120</b> and into the first aperture <b>128</b> pushes the slide latch <b>124</b> laterally against the spring <b>126</b> into the release position until the retention groove of the lock pin <b>114</b> is aligned with the slide latch <b>124</b>, at which point the spring <b>126</b> urges the slide latch <b>124</b> back into the retention groove and to the capture position. The retention groove also has a slanted distal wall so that pulling the lock pin <b>114</b> back out of the pin capture hole <b>120</b> will also cause the slanted distal wall to push the slide latch <b>124</b> laterally to the release position, thereby allowing the lock pin <b>114</b> to be released from the cable lock <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">To lock the lock pin <b>114</b> in the cable lock <b>118</b>, a lock member <b>130</b> in the lock body <b>12</b> can be selectively shifted between a locked position that holds the slide latch <b>124</b> in the capture position and an unlocked position that allows the slide latch <b>124</b> to shift to the release position. The lock member <b>130</b> is in the form of a pin that moves back and forth laterally relative to the movement of the slide latch <b>124</b>. A second aperture <b>132</b> through the slide latch <b>124</b> is axially aligned with the lock member <b>130</b> when the slide latch <b>124</b> is in the capture position. Extending the locking member <b>130</b> through the second aperture <b>132</b> shifts the lock member <b>130</b> to the locked position, which locks the slide latch <b>124</b> in the capture position by preventing it from shifting to the release position. Retracting the locking member <b>130</b> back out of the second aperture <b>132</b> shifts the lock member <b>130</b> to the unlocked position, which thereby allows the slide latch <b>124</b> to shift to the release position.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">A motorized drive mechanism <b>134</b> is configured to shift the lock member <b>130</b> back and forth between the locked position and the unlocked position in response to control commands, as a nonlimiting example, commands received from a remote device <b>58</b> as discussed previously. The drive mechanism <b>134</b> includes an electric motor <b>136</b> operatively coupled with the locking member <b>130</b> by a gear assembly <b>138</b>. The motor <b>136</b> is preferably a reversable (bi-polar) DC motor that can drive in opposite directions depending on the direction of current; however, other types of motors are also possible. The gear assembly <b>138</b> includes a rack gear <b>142</b> coupled to the locking member <b>130</b> and a worm drive, including a worm gear <b>138</b> driven by the motor <b>136</b> and a worm wheel <b>140</b> driven by the worm gear <b>138</b>, that drives the rack gear <b>142</b> axially back and forth. Actuating the electric motor <b>136</b> in one direction drives the rack gear <b>142</b> and the locking member <b>130</b> from the unlocked position to the locked position. Actuating the electric motor <b>136</b> in the opposite direction drives the rack gear <b>142</b> and the locking member <b>130</b> in the opposite direction from the locking position to the unlocking position. Other gear assemblies are also possible, such as a rack and pinion as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, in which the rack gear <b>142</b> is driven by a pinion gear <b>144</b> that is rotated directly by the electric motor <b>136</b>. However, the worm drive is preferred because in some arrangements it prevents the rack gear <b>142</b> and the locking member <b>130</b> from undesirably shifting without positive actuation of the motor <b>136</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">A manual override is provided to allow the locking member <b>130</b> to be manually shifted from the locked position to the unlocked position, for example if the battery <b>148</b> fully discharges while the cable <b>22</b> is locked in the cable lock <b>118</b>. For this feature, the pin of the locking member <b>130</b> is preferably a threaded pin that can advance and retract axially relative to the rack gear <b>142</b> independently when rotated in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. An access port <b>146</b> through the case of the lock body <b>12</b> is axially aligned with the locking member <b>130</b> so that a tool, such as a specialized key or a screwdriver, can be inserted into the lock body <b>12</b> and turn the threaded pin to manually retract the locking member <b>130</b> out of the second aperture <b>132</b> in the slide latch <b>124</b>, thereby unlocking the slide latch <b>124</b>. Once the battery <b>148</b> is suitably recharged to be able to operate the electric motor <b>136</b> again, the threaded pin may be manually advanced back to its operative position to again shift between the locked and unlocked positions. The access port <b>146</b> is preferably plugged to prevent the ingress of dirt and moisture when not in use, such as with a rubber plug that can be removed when the manual override feature must be accessed and replaced when such access is no longer needed.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A proximity switch <b>150</b> is disposed adjacent the second aperture <b>132</b> to sense when the locking member <b>130</b> is in the locked position. The proximity switch <b>150</b> may be any type of proximity sensor capable of detecting when the locking member <b>130</b> is in the locked position and when it not in the locked position. The proximity switch <b>150</b> is operatively coupled with the control and communications unit <b>20</b>. When the proximity switch <b>150</b> senses that the locking member <b>130</b> is in the locked position, the control and communications unit <b>20</b> causes a lock status indicator <b>152</b> on the exterior of the lock body <b>12</b> to indicate that the cable lock <b>118</b> is locked. When the proximity switch <b>150</b> senses that the locking member <b>130</b> is not in the locked position, the control and communications unit <b>20</b> causes a lock status indicator <b>152</b> on the exterior of the lock body <b>12</b> to indicate that the cable lock <b>118</b> is unlocked. The lock status indicator <b>152</b> may be a light that shines red when the cable lock <b>118</b> is locked and shines green when the cable lock <b>118</b> is unlocked. Other types of visual, audible, and/or tactile indicators may be used.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The battery <b>148</b> may be any electrical energy storage device suitable for providing the power needed to drive the motor <b>136</b> and the control and communications unit <b>20</b>, and any other electrical loads present in the locking device <b>110</b>. The battery <b>148</b> may take the form of a single cell or multiple cells formed as a battery pack. In one arrangement, the battery <b>148</b> is a lithium-ion polymer battery, although other types of battery, such as nickel-cadmium, may be used. In this example, the battery <b>148</b> is a rechargeable battery, and a charging interface, such as the USB connection port <b>36</b>, is disposed in the lock body case for receiving a power source jack (not shown) to recharge the battery. A battery charge indicator <b>154</b> may be provided to indicate the status of the charge in the battery <b>148</b>. In one example, the battery charge indicator <b>154</b> is an LED light that illuminates (e.g., red) when the battery <b>148</b> is charging.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The mounting mechanism for securing the locking device <b>110</b> to a bicycle or other personal transportation device includes a flexible strap <b>14</b> generally similar to the strap <b>14</b> described previously in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>14</b></figref>, but with certain modifications. In this arrangement, the strap <b>14</b> has a fixed end <b>156</b> that is attached to the lock body <b>12</b> on one side of the concave channel <b>112</b>, and a free end <b>158</b> that is unattached and free to be moved. The fixed end <b>156</b> may be fixed to the lock body <b>12</b>, for example to the second case portion <b>18</b>, by any suitable mechanism, such as with a screw, bolt, rivet, adhesive, or weld, preferably in such a manner as to prevent the strap <b>14</b> from being inadvertently or intentionally separated from the lock body <b>12</b>. In the nonlimiting example represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> through <b>21</b></figref>, the strap <b>14</b> is secured to the second case portion <b>18</b> with a faster <b>159</b>. The free end <b>158</b> of the strap <b>14</b> can be selectively inserted into and through an entry slot <b>52</b> through the lock body <b>12</b> on the opposite side of the concave channel <b>112</b> from the fixed end <b>156</b>. The strap <b>14</b> includes a plurality of teeth <b>160</b> near the free end <b>158</b> that engage with another locking mechanism <b>162</b> inside the lock body <b>12</b> to allow the free end <b>158</b> to be secured in any one of a plurality of positions through the entry slot <b>52</b>. A loop can be formed by the strap <b>14</b> across the concave channel <b>112</b> by inserting the free end <b>158</b> of the strap <b>14</b> into the entry slot <b>52</b>. The size of the loop be adjusted by sliding the free end <b>158</b> through the entry slot <b>52</b> and the lock body <b>12</b> to any of a plurality of lengths out the opposite end of the entry slot <b>52</b>, and the locking mechanism <b>162</b> engages with the teeth <b>160</b> to secure the strap <b>14</b> in a selected location. In this manner, the strap <b>14</b> can be wrapped around a support structure, such as frame member of a bicycle, and adjusted to securely mount the locking device <b>110</b> to the support structure by pulling the free end <b>158</b> of the strap until the loop tightly clamps the lock body <b>12</b> to the support structure. When the strap <b>14</b> is in a selected position, it can then be locked in that selected position by engaging the locking mechanism <b>162</b> with the teeth <b>160</b> of the strap <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>A, and <b>17</b>B</figref>, the locking mechanism <b>162</b> is a manually-operated keyed lock. The keyed lock in this example is a cam lock that rotates a lock arm <b>164</b> into and/or out of engagement with the teeth <b>160</b> on the strap <b>14</b>. By using a keyed lock, only a person with the appropriate key, such as the owner of the bicycle and the locking device <b>110</b>, can mount and/or dismount the locking device <b>110</b> from the support structure. This enables, for example, the owner of the bicycle to securely mount the locking device <b>110</b> to a bicycle and also allow others to have authorized access to and use of the bicycle through a ride sharing app as described herein that controls unlocking of the motorized locking mechanism for the cable <b>22</b>. However, other types of locking mechanisms could be used.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, with the locking device <b>110</b> suitably mounted to a frame member of a bicycle <b>60</b> as described above, the bicycle <b>60</b> can then be secured to a separate structure, such as a bike rack, by pulling the cable <b>22</b> out of the lock body <b>12</b>, wrapping the cable <b>22</b> around the support structure, inserting the lock pin <b>114</b> into the cable lock <b>118</b> through the pin capture hole <b>120</b>, and locking the cable lock <b>118</b> by causing the motorized drive mechanism <b>134</b> to shift the lock member <b>130</b> into the locked position, thereby preventing the lock pin <b>114</b> from being removed from the pin capture hole <b>120</b>. When it is desired to remove the bicycle <b>60</b> from the bike rack, the motorized drive mechanism <b>134</b> is caused to shift the lock member <b>130</b> into the unlocked position, and the lock pin <b>114</b> can then be pulled out of the pin capture hole <b>120</b> and the cable <b>22</b> allowed to be retracted back into the lock body <b>12</b> and onto the spool <b>24</b> under the biasing effect of the spring <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The communication and control unit <b>20</b> includes electronic circuitry, integrated circuits, wireless data transceivers, and associated hardware configured to selectively implement and control the various functions disclosed herein.

The charging circuit <b>166</b> may be implemented on an integrated circuit. The communication circuit is implemented on a controller <b>168</b> that includes a digital wireless data transceiver. The controller <b>168</b> is operatively coupled to the battery <b>148</b>, to the lock status indicator <b>152</b>, and to a programming header <b>170</b>. The controller <b>168</b> may be, for example, a Bluetooth low-energy module with an integrated microprocessor that is programmable via the programming header <b>170</b>, which removes the need for a host microprocessor or an external antenna design for the wireless radio. Various LEDs may be controlled by the controller <b>168</b> that light up the lock status indicator <b>152</b>, the battery charging indicator <b>154</b>, and a data communication indicator <b>153</b> that indicates when the transceiver is communicating with and/or in range and capable of communicating with a remote device <b>58</b> (as discussed previously). The motor control circuit includes a driver <b>172</b> that is connected to the battery <b>148</b>, to the controller <b>168</b>, and to the motor <b>136</b>. The driver <b>172</b> may be, for example, a dual H-bridge driver integrated circuit with power width modulation input received from the controller <b>168</b> to control the speed and direction of the motor's rotation.
