Unfortunately, the invasive nature of drawing a blood sample from a patient can cause discomfort and may lead to less cooperation from a subject, especially children, and hence render obtaining a physiological sample that may contain a target biomarker difficult.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some recently developed dermal patches allow for the detection target biomarkers, but typically suffer from a number of shortcomings, such as low sensitivity and/or specificity. Some dermal patches allow a user to obtain a physiological sample in order to send the obtained sample to a laboratory for further analysis that may not be able to be performed on the patch itself. Unfortunately, these dermal patches fail to provide a physiological sample preservation fluid within the dermal patch. This failure makes sample storage and preservation impractical thus rendering such at home sample collection solutions unsatisfactory.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Aspects of the present disclosure address the above-referenced problems and/or others.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, a system for collecting a physiological sample is disclosed, which includes an applicator having a needle that is configured to puncture a subject's skin to allow drawing a physiological sample from the subject as well as a first and a second actuating lever, each of which is configured to move form an undeployed position to a deployed position. The system further includes a dermal patch (herein also referred to as a dermal patch cartridge) that is configured for coupling to the applicator. The dermal patch can include a fluid reservoir configured to store a processing fluid and a sample collection chamber that is configured to receive the physiological sample. In some embodiments, the sample collection chamber is further configured to receive the processing fluid. The applicator can be configured to activate the needle so as to puncture the subject's skin to allow drawing the physiological sample when the first actuating lever is moved from its undeployed lever position to its deployed lever position and cause the processing fluid to be released from the fluid reservoir when the second actuating lever is moved from its undeployed position to the deployed position.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the applicator can be removably coupled to the dermal patch. In other embodiments, the applicator and the dermal patch can form a single integral unit.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A system according to the present teachings can be employed to collect (and in some embodiments analyze the collected sample) physiological samples, such as blood and interstitial fluid.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A variety of processing fluids (typically liquids) can be stored on the dermal patch. By way of example, and without limitation, the processing fluid can be an anti-coagulant (e.g., heparin), a protease inhibitor, a preservative, or any other processing fluid suitable for preparing a physiological sample for collection and/or analysis.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, an adhesive layer coupled to the dermal patch can allow attaching the dermal patch to a subject's skin.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the second actuating lever is in a locked state when the first actuating lever is in the undeployed position. For example, a latch can inhibit the movement of the second actuating lever so long as the first actuating lever is in the undeployed position. The actuation of the first actuating lever by moving it from its undeployed position to its deployed position can release the latch to allow actuation of the second actuating lever.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the applicator can further include a vacuum chamber in which a syringe is movably positioned. The syringe can be activated by moving the first actuating lever from its undeployed position to its deployed position so as to create a vacuum in the vacuum chamber. When the applicator is coupled to the dermal patch, the vacuum chamber will be in fluid communication with one or more fluidic channels within the dermal patch such that the creation of the vacuum in the vacuum chamber will result in generating a vacuum in those channels, thereby facilitating collection of the physiological fluid and its transfer, as well as the transfer of the processing fluid, to the sample collection chamber.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a related aspect, a system for analyzing a physiological sample is disclosed, which includes an applicator and a dermal patch, where the dermal patch is configured for attachment to a subject's skin and the applicator is configured for coupling, e.g., removable coupling, to the dermal patch for activating the dermal patch. The applicator can include a needle that is configured to puncture a subject's skin to allow drawing a physiological sample from the subject.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The applicator can further include a first and a second actuating lever, each of which is configured to move from an undeployed position to a deployed position. The dermal patch can include a fluid reservoir that is configured to store a processing fluid, which can be mixed with a drawn physiological sample to generate a processed physiological sample, and a sensor that is configured to detect a target analyte in the processed physiological sample. The applicator is further configured to cause the needle to puncture the subject's skin to allow drawing the physiological sample when the first actuating lever is moved from its undeployed lever position to its deployed lever position and to cause the processing fluid to be released from the fluid reservoir when the second actuating lever is moved from the undeployed position to the deployed position.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The sensor incorporated into the dermal patch can be configured to detect the target analyte when the target analyte is present in the processed physiological sample at a concentration level equal to or greater than a threshold amount.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A variety of processing fluids, such as those discussed herein can be employed. In some embodiments, the processing fluid can include one or more reagents needed for isothermal amplification of a target analyte.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An applicator/dermal patch system according to the present teachings can be employed to detect a variety of analytes in the drawn physiological sample. By way of example, the analyte can be a biomarker. Some examples of biomarkers that can be detected using an applicator/dermal patch system according to the present teaching can include, without limitation, troponin, brain natriuretic peptide (BnP), myelin basic protein (MBP), ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isoenzyme L1 (UCHL-1), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S100-B, Cardiac troponin I protein (cTn1), Cardiac troponin T protein (cTnT), C-reactive protein (CRP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), Myeloperoxidase, Creatine kinase MB, Myoglobin, Hemoglobin, or HbA1C.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In other embodiments, the analyte of interest may be a pathogen, such as a bacterium and/or a virus.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A variety of sensors can be incorporated in various embodiments of a dermal patch according to the present teachings. Some examples of such a sensor can include, without limitation, an immunoassay sensor, an isothermal amplification detection system, a graphene-based sensor, an electrochemical sensor, and chemical sensor.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the second actuating lever can be in a locked state when the first actuating lever is in its undeployed position. By way of example, the applicator can include a latch that is configured to lock the second actuating lever when the first actuating lever is in an undeployed position.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some such embodiments, the actuation of the first actuating lever, e.g., via moving it from its undeployed position to its deployed position, can unlock the second actuating lever, e.g., by releasing the latch, thereby allowing the actuation of the second actuating lever.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the applicator can further include a vacuum chamber in which a syringe is movably position. The syringe can be activated, via the movement of the first actuating lever from its undeployed position that is configured to create a vacuum within the dermal patch when the first actuating lever is moved from the deployed position to the undeployed position, wherein the vacuum draws the physiological sample and the released processing fluid to flow to the well.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Aspects of the present disclosure may take form in various components and arrangements of components, and in various steps and arrangements of steps.

that may be utilized to collect and store a physiological sample (e.g., blood, interstitial fluid, etc.) and/or detect a target analyte in a collected physiological sample.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, a dermal patch system according to the present teachings can include a dermal patch and an applicator that is configured for coupling to the dermal patch. A user can actuate the applicator to cause the activation of the dermal patch so as to collect a physiological sample. The dermal patch may include a processing fluid (e.g., reagent, buffer, anticoagulant, etc.), for persevering the physiological sample and/or preparing the physiological sample for analysis. Providing a system with a dermal patch that includes a processing sample allows for the collection and preservation of a physiological sample within the dermal patch. Such a system may allow a user of the system to collect a physiological sample themselves at home and store the collected sample for further testing.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In other embodiments, a dermal patch of a dermal patch system according to the present teachings may be configured to detect one or more target analytes (e.g., a biomarker) in a physiological sample. As discussed in more detail below, in some such embodiments, the applicator can include one or more needles that can be deployed, when an actuating lever of the applicator is moved from an undeployed position to a deployed position, to puncture the skin so as to allow the collection of a physiological sample into the dermal patch. For example, the collection of the physiological sample can be facilitated using the applicator to create a vacuum in one or more fluidic channels of the dermal patch. In embodiments, subsequent to collection of at least some of the physiological sample into the dermal patch, another actuating lever of the applicator can be actuated to release at least a portion of the processing fluid on-board of the dermal patch such that the release processing fluid can mix with the drawn physiological sample. In some such embodiments, both the physiological sample and the processing fluid can be directed onto a detector incorporated in the dermal patch. By way of example, the processing fluid may be suitable for amplification of a target analyte (e.g., a primer), or otherwise preparing a physiological sample for analysis. Such embodiments of a dermal patch system according to the present teachings can provide ease of use and further allow facile collection and analysis of a physiological sample, among other advantages.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In embodiments, the use of two actuating levers, where one is used to draw a physiological sample, and the other to release a processing fluid (e.g., a buffer) for processing the physiological sample advantageously allows performing the steps of drawing a sample and processing the sample via the processing fluid in a temporal sequence. In other words, initially, a physiological sample, such as a blood sample, can be drawn, via actuation of one of the actuating levers, and transferred to a sample collection chamber (e.g., a well) or a sensor incorporated in the dermal patch. Subsequently, the processing fluid can be transferred to the sample collection chamber or the sensor to mix with the physiological sample. By way of example, in embodiments, a user can visually inspect the sample collection chamber or a chamber in which a sensor (such as a lateral flow sensor) is positioned to ensure that a sufficient amount of the physiological sample has been collected before causing the processing fluid to be released from a reservoir in which the processing fluid is stored, in a manner discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Various terms are used herein in accordance with their ordinary meanings in the art, unless indicated otherwise.

In some embodiments, the serum-separating element is a nitrocellulose strip. The use of such a fibrous element, and in particular a nitrocellulose strip, can allow sufficient fractionation of the blood to enhance significantly the sensitivity/specificity of detection of analytes (e.g., biomarkers) in the separated serum, especially using a graphene-based sensor. In other words, although the use of a nitrocellulose strip in a patch according to some embodiments may not result in fractionation of the whole blood sample with the same degree of separation quality that is achievable via traditional fractionation methods, such as differential centrifugation; nonetheless, the applicant has discovered that the use of such a nitrocellulose strip in embodiments of the dermal patch can significantly enhance the sensitivity/specificity for the detection of a variety of analytes (e.g., biomarkers) using a variety of detectors, such as graphene-based detectors, relative to the use of a whole blood sample for such detection. In some embodiments, wherein the detector <b>1018</b> is a graphene sensor, the nitrocellulose strip may be coupled to the detector <b>1018</b> and the detector <b>1018</b> may detect the target analyte via the nitrocellulose strip.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Furthermore, the serum-separation element may include at least one fibrous membrane configured to capture at least a portion of one or more cellular components of the received blood, thereby separating a serum (or a plasma) component of the blood.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some embodiments, the separated plasma or the serum component can still include some cellular elements. Even without having a level of fractionation that is achieved via traditional methods, such as differential centrifugation, the separated serum component can be utilized to achieve an enhanced detection sensitivity/specificity relative to using whole blood for detecting, and optionally quantifying, a variety of target analytes in a drawn blood sample. Some examples of such target analytes may include, without limitation, a biomarker, such as troponin, brain natriuretic peptide (BnP), or other biomarkers including those disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The separated serum component may include any of a plurality of red blood cells and/or a plurality of white blood cells and/or platelets. However, the concentration of such cellular components in the separated serum component can be less than that in the whole blood by a factor in a range of about 2 to about 1000, though lower concentrations can also be achieved.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In use, the dermal patch cartridge <b>1002</b> can be attached to a subject's skin via the adhesive layer <b>1008</b>.
