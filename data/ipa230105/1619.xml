Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a technique of extruding an optical sheet used in a light guide panel, etc., for example. In the present invention, a light guide panel is formed as a thickness-reduced sheet (referred to also as a thin sheet) for optical use.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, in the technical field of mobile devices such as mobile phones and smartphones, along with the thickness reduction of a device main body, the need for the thickness reduction of a backlight unit arises, accordingly. The backlight unit is composed of a light guide panel, a diffuser, a prism sheet, etc., for example. The light guide panel is formed of transparent resin having a high refractive index. To reduce the thickness of the backlight unit, it is essential to form a thickness-reduced light guide panel, i.e., a thin light guide panel. Therefore, to meet the above-described need, a technique of forming an optical thin sheet using resin has been proposed (for example, see Patent Literature 1).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As the thin sheet forming technique, injection molding and extrusion are assumed. In this case, the extrusion technique has higher productive efficiency than the injection molding. Therefore, the thin resin sheet should preferably be formed by the extrusion technique.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">Patent Literature 1: JP 2014-502568 A</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the conventional extrusion technique, in the case of continuously forming a thin sheet having flat front and back surfaces and having a constant thickness (hereinafter referred to as a standard thickness), for example, a technique of continuously forming a thin sheet by thinly spreading molten resin extruded from an extruder into a sheet shape through a flow channel of a T-die and ejecting the sheet-shaped molten resin from the T-die, and then compressing and solidifying the ejected sheet-shaped molten resin by a pair of rolls has been known. In this technique, the flow channel of the T-die has such a configuration that the flow volume of the molten resin is even in the width direction of the T-die when the molten resin is thinly spread into a sheet shape.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Incidentally, the thin sheet continuous forming technique is not exclusively applied to the case of forming a thin sheet having flat front and back surfaces but is also applied to the case of forming a patterned sheet having a recess/projection pattern. In the patterned sheet, recesses and projections are regularly arranged side by side on one or both of the entire front and back surfaces. In this case, a recess/projection pattern corresponding to the reversed recess/projection pattern of the patterned sheet is formed on the surfaces of the pair of rolls. At this time, sheet-shaped molten resin having an even volume in the width direction is ejected from the T-die, similarly to the case of forming a thin sheet having flat front and back surfaces. When the sheet-shaped molten resin contacts the pair of rolls, molten resin overflowing from the projections of the pattern sneaks into the recesses of the pattern, and the volume of resin is balanced, accordingly. Therefore, the average thickness of the formed patterned sheet is the standard thickness.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, in the case of forming a thin sheet having flat front and back surfaces and having the standard thickness, as a contour of a preset shape, it is impossible to stereoscopically project (thicken) part of the surface of the thin sheet while maintaining the standard thickness, for example.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this case, only a recessed groove pattern corresponding to the reversed projection (stereoscopically-projected part of the surface) of the thin sheet is provided on the surfaces of the pair of roll. In other words, a projection corresponding to a recessed groove is not provided on the surfaces of the pair of rolls. Further, sheet-shaped molten resin having an even volume in the width direction is ejected from the T-die, similarly to the case of forming a thin sheet having flat front and back surfaces.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In that case, when the sheet-shaped molten resin contacts the pair of rolls, the molten resin sneaking effect is not sufficient for the molten resin to sneak into the entire recessed groove of the pattern. That is, the volume of resin necessary for the stereoscopic projection (thickening) cannot be supplied. As a result, for example, when the molten resin is solidified, sinks may be developed, and the thin-sheet having a contour of a preset shape may not be accurately formed.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">An object of the present invention is to propose an optical sheet forming technique of accurately extruding an optical sheet having a contour of a preset shape.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">To achieve this object, the present invention includes an extruding unit, a forming roll unit, and a thick portion forming mechanism. The extruding unit has an ejecting slit configured to eject sheet-shaped molten resin. The ejecting slit has a standard gap portion and an enlarged gap portion. The standard gap portion has a gap of a constant size in a direction crossing an extrusion direction. The enlarged gap portion has a gap larger than the standard gap in a position corresponding to a thick portion. The forming roll unit solidifies and carries the ejected sheet-shaped molten resin in the extrusion direction. The thick portion forming mechanism forms one or a plurality of thick portions which are thicker than the other portion in the sheet-shaped molten resin continuously in the extrusion direction.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the present invention, an optical sheet forming technique of accurately extruding an optical sheet having a contour of a preset shape can be realized.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.

The light guide panel is used as a structure of a backlight unit of a mobile device such as a mobile phone or a smartphone, for example. The light guide panel can be formed of transparent resin having a high reflective index. As the transparent resin, for example, resin such as acrylic resin (PMMA), polycarbonate resin (PC) and cycloolefin resin (COP) can be applied, for example.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a thin light guide panel <b>1</b> for optical use includes a light entering portion <b>2</b> and a surface emitting portion <b>3</b>. The light entering portion <b>2</b> is thicker than the surface emitting portion <b>3</b>. Here, along with the thickness reduction of the backlight unit, the need for the thickness reduction of the surface emitting portion <b>3</b> arises, accordingly. On the other hand, it is technically difficult to reduce the thickness of a light source <b>7</b> (for example, an LED) which will be described later to about the thickness of the surface emitting portion <b>3</b>. Therefore, to take in all the light from the light source <b>7</b>, it is necessary to increase the thickness of the light entering portion <b>2</b> at least to about the thickness of the light source <b>7</b> while reducing the thickness of the surface emitting portion <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">An upper surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the light entering portion <b>2</b> and an upper surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the surface emitting portion <b>3</b> are formed as smooth and flat surfaces. Both of the upper surfaces <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>a </i>are arranged parallel to each other. On the other hand, a lower surface is of the light guide panel <b>1</b> is continuously formed from the light entering portion <b>2</b> to the surface emitting portion <b>3</b>. The lower surface is of the light guide panel <b>1</b> is formed as a smooth and flat surface. The lower surface is of the light guide panel <b>1</b> is opposed parallel to both of the upper surfaces <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the light entering portion <b>2</b>, a smooth and inclined surface <b>4</b> is formed between the upper surfaces <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>a</i>. A boundary portion <b>5</b> between the inclined surface <b>4</b> and the upper surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the light entering portion <b>2</b> is angled. In other words, the boundary portion <b>5</b> between the inclined surface <b>4</b> and the upper surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the light entering portion <b>2</b> is not rounded. In short, the angle suddenly changes in the boundary portion <b>5</b> from the upper surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the light entering portion <b>2</b> toward the inclined surface <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The light guide panel <b>1</b> is integrally formed from the light entering portion <b>2</b> to the surface emitting portion <b>3</b>. The light entering portion <b>2</b> has a light entering surface <b>2</b><i>b</i>. The light entering surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>stretches in a direction orthogonally crossing the above-described upper surfaces <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>a</i>. The light entering surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>has a rectangular shape, for example. The light entering surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>faces straight from the light entering portion <b>2</b> toward the surface emitting portion <b>3</b>. A light diffusing component <b>6</b> such as a diffuser or a prism sheet is mounted on the upper surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the surface emitting portion <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Here, the light guide panel <b>1</b> equipped with the light diffusing component <b>6</b> is installed in the mobile device. The light source <b>7</b> (for example, an LED) is arranged to be opposed to the light entering surface <b>2</b><i>b</i>. In this way, the backlight unit is formed in the mobile device. In this structure, the light emitted from the light source <b>7</b> is guided from the light entering surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>to the light entering portion <b>2</b>. All the light guided to the light entering portion <b>2</b> is guided along the inclined surface <b>4</b> and transmitted to the surface emitting portion <b>3</b>. The light transmitted to the surface emitting portion <b>3</b> is planarly diffused by the light diffusing component <b>6</b>. As a result, planar and even light can be generated from the surface emitting portion <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, an optical sheet forming device <b>8</b> is composed of an extruding unit <b>9</b>, a forming roll unit <b>10</b> and a thick portion forming mechanism <b>11</b>. The extruding unit <b>9</b> is configured to eject sheet-shaped molten resin <b>12</b><i>m</i>. The forming roll unit <b>10</b> is configured to make the ejected sheet-shaped molten resin <b>12</b><i>m </i>go through a state where only the surface is solidified (for example, in the case of amorphous resin, the temperature is adjusted to a temperature lower than the glass transition temperature) and then extrude it as an entirely-flexible solid-state optical sheet <b>12</b><i>p </i>in an arrow <b>13</b> direction. The thick portion forming mechanism <b>11</b> is configured to form one or a plurality of thick portions <b>14</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>) which are thicker than the other portion in the molten resin <b>12</b><i>m </i>and <b>12</b><i>s </i>continuously in the extrusion direction <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Here, the extrusion direction <b>13</b> represents a direction along a series of extrusion passages continuing from the extruding unit <b>9</b> to the forming roll unit <b>10</b>, for example. The series of extrusion passages represents a series of process paths where the molten resin <b>12</b><i>m </i>ejected in the gravity (vertical) direction from the extruding unit <b>9</b> is sent forth through the forming roll unit <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, the optical sheet <b>12</b><i>p </i>is thin and excellent in flexibility and can be formed into a roll.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">&#x201c;Forming roll unit <b>10</b>&#x201d; The forming roll unit <b>10</b> includes a main roll <b>15</b>, a pushing roll <b>16</b>, and a feed roll <b>17</b>. These three rolls <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> are formed as rolls configured to adjust temperatures thereof, respectively. The three rolls <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> are maintained at preset constant temperatures, respectively. The preset temperatures represent such temperatures that will not melt but can solidify the molten resin <b>12</b><i>m </i>and <b>12</b><i>s </i>while maintaining the flexibility of the molten resin <b>12</b><i>m </i>and <b>12</b><i>s</i>. For example, in the case of polycarbonate resin (PC), the temperatures are set to a temperature of about 140&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The main roll <b>15</b> has a cylindrical transfer surface <b>15</b><i>s</i>. The transfer surface <b>15</b><i>s </i>is mirror-finished. The transfer surface <b>15</b><i>s </i>is configured to guide the sheet-shaped molten resin <b>12</b><i>m </i>ejected from an ejecting slit <b>18</b> which will be described later in the extrusion direction <b>13</b>. The pushing roll <b>16</b> has a cylindrical transfer surface <b>16</b><i>s</i>. The transfer surface <b>16</b><i>s </i>is mirror-finished. The transfer surface <b>16</b><i>s </i>is configured to push the molten resin <b>12</b><i>m </i>onto the transfer surface <b>15</b><i>s </i>of the main roll <b>15</b>. The feed roll <b>17</b> has a cylindrical feed surface <b>17</b><i>s</i>. The feed surface <b>17</b><i>s </i>is not necessarily mirror-finished. The feed surface <b>17</b><i>s </i>is configured to feed the optical sheet <b>12</b><i>p </i>in the extrusion direction <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The three rolls <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> are configured to rotate about single rotation axes <b>15</b><i>r</i>, <b>16</b><i>r </i>and <b>17</b><i>r</i>, respectively. The three rotation axes <b>15</b><i>r</i>, <b>16</b><i>r </i>and <b>17</b><i>r </i>are arranged parallel to each other in the horizontal direction. In other words, the three rotation axes <b>15</b><i>r</i>, <b>16</b><i>r </i>and <b>17</b><i>r </i>are arranged in a direction (horizontal direction) crossing (orthogonally crossing) the gravity (vertical) direction. The rotation direction of the main roll <b>15</b> is opposite to the rotation direction of the other two rolls <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this structure, the sheet-shaped molten resin <b>12</b><i>m </i>ejected from the extruding unit <b>9</b> in the gravity (vertical) direction passes (a contact point) between the main roll <b>15</b> and the pushing roll <b>16</b>. The molten resin <b>12</b><i>m </i>having passed the contact point changes to the molten resin <b>12</b><i>s </i>where only the surface is solidified while the molten resin <b>12</b><i>m </i>is extruded along the transfer surface <b>15</b><i>s </i>of the main roll <b>15</b>. Having passed (the contact point) between the main roll <b>15</b> and the feed roll <b>17</b>, the molten resin <b>12</b><i>s </i>changes to the entirely-flexible solid-state optical sheet <b>12</b><i>p</i>. In this way, the optical sheet <b>12</b><i>p </i>is extruded in the arrow <b>13</b> direction. At this time, the thickness is set in the optical sheet <b>12</b><i>p </i>as a half-finished product which eventually serves as the thin light guide panel <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As one example of the best mode, the drawing shows a mode where the three rolls <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> are laterally arranged in the horizontal direction.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Alternatively, as a relatively preferable mode, for example, the main roll <b>15</b> may be centered and the side rolls (the pushing roll <b>16</b> and the reel roll <b>17</b>) may be obliquely arranged. However, a mode where the three rolls <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> are vertically arranged in the gravity (vertical) direction is not considered as the best mode.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the vertical arrangement mode, resin is ejected from the extruding unit <b>9</b> to (the contact point) between the main roll <b>15</b> and the pushing roll <b>16</b>. At this time, before reaching (the contact point) between the main roll <b>15</b> and the pushing roll <b>16</b>, the ejected resin is pulled down and hung down by the action of gravity. Therefore, the resin contacts the lower roll (for example, the pushing roll <b>16</b>) first and begins to solidify at a relatively early stage. As a result, the transfer (forming) accuracy (between the main roll <b>15</b> and the pushing roll <b>16</b> may not be maintained constant.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">&#x201c;Thick portion forming mechanism <b>11</b>&#x201d; The thick portion forming mechanism <b>11</b> can be provided in one or both of the main roll <b>15</b> and the pushing roll <b>16</b>. In this case, the thick portion forming mechanism <b>11</b> should preferably be provided in the mall roll <b>15</b>. Therefore, the drawing shows the thick portion forming mechanism <b>11</b> provided in the main mall <b>15</b> as one example. The thick portion forming mechanism <b>11</b> includes a circular thick portion forming groove <b>19</b> in the circumferential direction of the main roll <b>15</b>.

The thick portion forming groove <b>19</b> is applied to the case of locally forming a thick portion (thick portion <b>14</b><i>b </i>which will be described later) in the above-described half-finished product having a constant thickness (standard thickness). In other words, the thick portion forming groove <b>19</b> is provided in a position corresponding to an enlarged gap portion <b>30</b> (recessed portion <b>31</b>) which will be described later (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). The thick portion forming groove <b>19</b> and the enlarged gap portion <b>30</b> (recessed portion <b>31</b>) are arranged parallel to each other and are opposed to each other in the extrusion direction <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this structure, in the case of simultaneously forming two half-finished products (thin light guide panels <b>1</b>), for example, one thick portion forming groove <b>19</b> (thick portion forming mechanism <b>11</b>) may be provided at the width-directional center of the main roll <b>15</b>. Further, in accordance with the thick portion forming groove <b>19</b>, one enlarged gap portion <b>30</b> (recessed portion <b>31</b>) may be provided at the width-directional center of the slit <b>18</b> which will be described later. On the other hand, in the case of forming one half-finished product (thin light guide panel <b>1</b>), for example, one thick portion forming groove <b>19</b> (thick portion forming mechanism <b>11</b>) may be provided on one width-directional side of the main roll <b>15</b>.

In this way, only the heat generating portion <b>35</b><i>a </i>can be accurately and easily positioned with respect to the heating target (for example, the width region of the enlarged gap portion <b>30</b> (recessed portion <b>31</b>)).</p><p id="p-0111" num="0099">The position adjusting mechanism is configured to adjust the position of the heat generator <b>33</b> such that the heat generator <b>33</b> is opposed to the enlarged gap portion <b>30</b> (recessed portion <b>31</b>). The position adjusting mechanism includes the through hole <b>36</b> and a movement mechanism. The through hole <b>36</b> penetrates through the T-die <b>21</b> (for example, the first lip <b>26</b><i>a</i>). The through hole <b>36</b> extends in the width direction of the slit <b>18</b>. The heat generator <b>33</b> can be inserted into the through hole <b>36</b>. Further, the movement mechanism is configured to move the heat generator <b>33</b> along the through hole <b>36</b>. In the drawing, an operation bar <b>37</b> extending on both sides of the heat generator <b>33</b> is applied as one example of the movement mechanism. One end of the operation bar <b>37</b> is connected to the heat insulating portion <b>35</b><i>b</i>.

When the heat generator <b>33</b> (more specifically, the heat generating portion <b>35</b><i>a</i>) is opposed to the enlarged gap portion <b>30</b> (recessed portion <b>31</b>), the operation of the operation bar <b>37</b> is stopped. At this time, the heat generator <b>33</b> (heat generating portion <b>35</b><i>a</i>) is positioned oppositely to the enlarged gap portion <b>30</b> (recessed portion <b>31</b>). In this way, the heat generator <b>33</b> (heat generating portion <b>35</b><i>a</i>) can be fixed in a state of being adjusted to the position of the first lip <b>26</b><i>a</i>. In this state, only the heat generating portion <b>35</b><i>a </i>of the heat generator <b>33</b> contacts the first lip <b>26</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0113" num="0101">&#x201c;Arrangement of Lip Adjusting Bolts <b>28</b>&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0114" num="0102">In the above-described lip gap adjusting mechanism <b>27</b>, the lip adjusting bolts <b>28</b> are arranged at regular intervals.

In the molten resin <b>12</b><i>m </i>ejected from the slit <b>18</b>, the thickness of the position corresponding to the enlarged gap portion <b>30</b> is greater than the thickness of the other portion. Further, as the molten resin <b>12</b><i>m </i>passes through the thick portion forming mechanism <b>19</b>, the contour of the shape of the thick portion <b>14</b><i>b </i>of the half-finished product (the light entering portion <b>2</b> of the light guide panel <b>1</b>) is accurately formed.

In short, the angle can be suddenly changed from the upper surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the light entering portion <b>2</b> toward the inclined surface <b>4</b> in the boundary portion <b>5</b>. In this way, all the light guided into the light entering portion <b>2</b> can be transmitted to the surface emitting portion <b>3</b> along the inclined surface <b>4</b>.
