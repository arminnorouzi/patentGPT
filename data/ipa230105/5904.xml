Although some 3D NAND devices use device stacking (e.g., monolithic 3D integration), application to random logic designs is harder because random logic circuits typically lack the repeating patterns associated with memory chips and should accommodate many different standard cells for specialized functions. Additionally, production-ready design tools for logic fabrication in 3D are lacking.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, 3D monolithic integration processing involves performance-reducing compromises. Vertical fabrication for high performance transistors replaces the current manufacturing paradigm with a scheme that uses difficult line-of-sight doping and etch processes for forming source/drain regions and contacts. Also, to accommodate wiring, at least 3-4 levels of logic are fabricated to achieve desired scaling, presenting economic headwinds.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another path to 3D processes is a complimentary field effect transistor (CFET) scheme that involves stacking p-channel FET (PFET) wires on n-channel FET (NFET) wires (or vice versa). CFETs provide a node of logic scaling for certain regular memory structures. Random logic circuits would gain less scaling to accommodate wiring for different standard cells. Even with a performance and scaling benefit for CFETs relative to horizontal nanowire FETs, CFETs provide only a node of scaling while making the devices more difficult to scale.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">CFETs use a relaxed contacted poly pitch (CPP), which may increase transistor delay. While a relaxed CPP allows future CPP scaling, contacts to potentially two gates and four contacts should be accommodated, creating a lower limit to the volume scalability of gates and sources/drains. Thus, a minimum CPP for CFET may be larger than for a single N/P-FET. Stacking CFETs with wiring between layers introduces new challenges with a harder-to-scale stacked device. Alternatively, transistors can be scaled to a limit and then stacked. A horizontal nanowire PFET stacked over a horizontal nanowire NFET, both at the limit of scaling, has a smaller area than a CFET at the current scaling limit. Thus, areal density from stacking can be higher than with CFET, and the vertical direction is available area for scaling, so doubling the number of layers one time is not a costly detriment when numerous layers are used. Due to complex manufacturing for fabricating CFET devices, increased device critical dimensions (CDs) are expected, which may offset the one-time areal scaling benefit to adopting CFETs.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An alternative to building vertical transistors is to stack logic transistors in layers with wiring between the layers. Stacking may include building a layer as a wafer of chips, placing a single-crystalline silicon (Si) wafer on top of the pre-built logic, and building a second layer over the first layer, lithographically aligned with the first layer. While providing lithographic alignment, this process repeatedly subjects bottom layers to the full thermal budget of upper layers, which may compromise performance of the bottom layers. Fabricating upper layers using a lower thermal budget compromises performance of devices in the upper layers.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Alternatively, logic cores could be built as chiplets, with the logic fabricated in a high temperature device flow, stacked into a logic multi-chip IC with technology adapted from system on a chip (SOC) and system in package (SiP) fabrication. A single logic core that is a composite of vertically-stacked chiplets may be formed. A chiplet may refer to a complete subsystem intellectual property (IP) core, a reusable unit of logic, on a single die or part of single die. The chiplets may be fabricated using a planar logic process flow as a single die (or part of a single die) on a wafer, which is cut into individual chiplets prior to stacking. Stacking chiplets may reduce the number of metal layers to those used for core interconnect, and the global interconnect may be implemented similarly to fan-out packaging on a separate substrate.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Chiplet-stacking avoids compromising logic device performance with a non-ideal manufacturing process and is a direct extension of current device manufacturing and scaling paradigms. With chiplet-stacking, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices can continue to scale in planar areal fabrication. Devices may be migrated to horizontal nano-sheet and eventually nano-wire configurations to continue the current scaling path. Chiplet-stacking may provide a relatively low cost alternative for improving performance by lowering interconnect line lengths overall, and can decrease system volume and energy use.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Chiplet-stacking, though, presents difficulties, including heat dissipation and aligning and bonding of chiplets. Fabrication process variability from chiplet to chiplet presents alignment challenges, which may limit the number and density of interconnections. Scaling benefits may be achieved using micro-through-silicon via (TSV) processes for inter-chiplet stacking, and improved alignment technologies may further improve scaling. As alignment approaches the level of scaled feature sizes, however, process variability between chiplets of a stacked multi-chip device may be a limiting factor. Another challenge with chiplet stacking is chiplet bonding. For device integrity and reliability, maintaining a low thermal budget is desirable, but low temperature (e.g., &#x3c;400&#xb0; C.) bonding processes are immature. A chiplet-stacking approach might use only a few metal layers for interconnects, and a refractory metal interconnect (e.g., with ruthenium) that can withstand higher temperatures than conventional copper barrier/seed technology might be used.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Certain embodiments of this disclosure provide techniques to create vertically-stacked multi-chip devices with minimal alignment errors from layer to layer using a 2D projection process that can be adapted into design algorithms. With certain embodiments, chiplets for a stacked multi-chip device are fabricated as a single die or part of a single die within a logic process flow.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example semiconductor wafer wo that includes multiple chiplets <b>102</b> formed on a substrate <b>104</b>, according to certain embodiments. Semiconductor wafer wo may include any suitable number of chiplets <b>102</b>.

In certain embodiments, each chiplet <b>102</b> is a self-contained unit designed to perform particular functions in a larger multi-chip device.

For example, substrate <b>104</b> may be a bulk silicon wafer platform suitable for high performance logic fabrication. With wafer thinning from the back side, a bulk substrate can be used. Silicon on insulator (SOI) and fully depleted SOI (FDSOI) substrates may be used to fabricate chiplets <b>102</b> due to the buried oxide layers already present in those substrates. In addition, for monolithic 3D logic (M3DL) technology operating at scale, heat dissipation techniques may counteract self-heating. Engineered SOI and FDSOI wafers with built-in heat spreading layers may facilitate device cooling in a 3D structure. Heat conducting insulators such as diamond or hexagonal boron nitride may be used as such heat spreading layers under device layers. In this example, a stacked IC with back-to-back bonding produces logic devices sandwiched around heat spreading layers, providing a suitable structure for counteracting self-heating of the devices. Other embodiments can be fabricated using non-silicon elements or silicon alloys as the active layer for the devices. For example, germanium (Ge), silicon Ge (SiGe), III-V or other active channel layers may be accommodated given appropriate substrates.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Chiplets <b>102</b> are designed and formed according to techniques described herein.

Although designs for vertical stacks of two, three, and four chiplets <b>102</b> have been illustrated and described, the mirroring approach described herein may be extended for vertical stacks of more than four aligned chiplets <b>102</b>. Certain embodiments allow 3D logic circuitry to be formed in a high temperature process flow, including interconnect, which can be used to design and manufacture random logic cores for microprocessor and SOC applications. Embodiments allow random logic to be fabricated in a near ideal process flow that is attainable with current tool sets with minimal new technology development. Memory structures (e.g., SRAM, Ferroelectric FETs, Resistive RAM, etc.) can be incorporated within the chiplet design. Certain embodiments provide volumetric, rather than simply areal scaling of logic devices. Embodiments can be implemented with any suitable devices, including FinFET devices and/or with nano-wire/nano-sheet devices. Additionally, because logic-based chiplets use fewer interconnects, certain embodiments provide economic and performance benefits relative to a traditional logic framework with large numbers interconnect layers for accommodating global interconnect. Because global system interconnects can be built separately from the logic cores, the global system interconnect thermal budget and fabrication can be separated from the logic fabrication, providing additional performance benefits and cost savings.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Although examples for designing and forming two-, three-, and four-layer vertical stacks have been described, it should be understood that the techniques for designing and forming multi-chip ICs can be extended to vertical stacks that include any suitable number of chiplets <b>102</b> arranged in any suitable number of layers.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Furthermore, this disclosure contemplates each chiplet <b>102</b> being formed as a single die on semiconductor wafer <b>100</b>.
