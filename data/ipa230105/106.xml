relates to a foodstuff and particularly, although not exclusively, relates to a foodstuff which is meat-like and/or may be used as a meat substitute. The invention also extends to a method of making the foodstuff and a foodstuff made in the process. Preferred embodiments include use of a filamentous fungus.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is known, for example from WO 00/15045 (DSM), WO96/21362 (Zeneca) and WO95/23843 (Zeneca) to use edible filamentous fungi as meat-substitutes, for example in the preparation of burgers and sausages. In such uses, filaments of the fungi are bound together, for example with egg albumin, and are texturised so that the product resembles muscle fibres and therefore has a meat-like appearance and texture. Meat substitutes of the type described have been widely commercially available for many years under the trade mark QUORN.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some circumstances, it is desirable to reduce or even eliminate the amount of egg albumin used with edible fungus in the manufacture of meat-substitutes for example on cost grounds or to produce a product suitable for vegans. It may similarly be desirable to reduce the levels of other binding agents or rheology improving agents used. GB2516491A describes edible formulations which may include reduced levels of egg albumin. To achieve a reduction, the edible formulation incorporates divalent or trivalent cations for example calcium ions. However, it is difficult to eliminate use of egg albumin completely and produce a product suitable for vegans or other individuals for whom egg-based products are unacceptable.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another binder which may be used with filamentous fungus is agar as described in GB2551738.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Whilst there are available a wide range of foodstuffs based on filamentous fungus, for example sold under the brand name QUORN&#x2122;, it is an ongoing challenge to produce foodstuffs and processed foods which closely mimic meat and/or include components which closely mimic meat, in terms of physical and/or textural properties such as hardness, resilience, cohesiveness, springiness and chewiness.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a general point, filamentous fungus, for example, which consist essentially of <i>Fusarium </i>species, especially of <i>Fusarium venenatum </i>A3/5 (formerly classified as <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>) (IMI 145425; ATCC PTA-2684 deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va.) have a cell wall comprising chitin, amongst other materials, which can make it difficult to process the fungus and/or combine it with other ingredients to achieve suitable rheological properties and/or a meat-like appearance and texture. Thus, it can be challenging to produce foodstuffs or components for foodstuffs which very closely mimic meaty textures using such filamentous fungus.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to address the above described problems.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to address the problem of producing foodstuffs which closely mimic meat in terms of physical and/or textural properties such as hardness, resilience, cohesiveness, springiness and/or chewiness.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an object of the present invention to produce foodstuffs which have improved hardness and/or chewiness/fibrosity compared to prior filamentous fungus-based foodstuffs</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of making a foodstuff, the method comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0011">(i) selecting a mass comprising an edible filamentous fungus;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0012">(ii) selecting an ingredient (A);</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0013">(iii) processing said mass and ingredient (A) in an extruder to produce an extruded foodstuff.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0014">Said extruder is preferably an extruder cooker.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0015">Said mass preferably comprises particles of said filamentous fungus (herein also referred to as &#x201c;fungal particles&#x201d;).
