apparatus, and a reception method, and more particularly, to a transmission apparatus, a transmission method, a reception apparatus, and a reception method that handle a tactile presentation signal together with an audio signal.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In a multichannel audio application such as 5.1 channel and 7.1 channel, a name is assigned and used to identify each channel usage. Examples include a right channel, a left channel, a center channel, and a low frequency effect (LFE) channel, and the like. These are expected to be delivered to a loudspeaker disposed at the position indicated by the name and reproduced as a sound.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, multimedia applications have been proposed, and among them, there are tactile presentation applications and the like used in synchronization with conventional audio videos. For example, Patent Document 1 describes a technology for transmitting a tactile vibration signal (tactile signal) and vibrating a vibration unit on the reception side on the basis of the tactile vibration signal.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0004">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2018-060313</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The most widespread multichannel audio transmission system is 5.1 channel (six channels in total). In the method of transmitting a stereo audio signal and a tactile presentation signal in an empty channel using this multichannel audio transmission system, tactile presentation is merely performed at four positions, and sufficient tactile production is impossible.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the present technology is to enable tactile presentation at more positions than the number of channels of a tactile presentation signal that can be transmitted.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solutions to Problems</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A concept of the present technology is a transmission apparatus including:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">a transmission signal generation unit that generates a transmission signal including audio signals of a predetermined number of channels and tactile presentation signals of a predetermined number of channels and to which metadata designating a tactile presentation position targeted by each of the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined number of channels is added; and</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">a transmission unit that transmits the transmission signal to a reception side via a predetermined transmission path.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the present technology, the transmission signal is generated by the transmission signal generation unit. The transmission signal includes the audio signals of the predetermined number of channels and the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined number of channels, and the metadata designating the tactile presentation position targeted by each of the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined number of channels is added to the transmission signal. For example, the metadata may designate zero, one, or a plurality of tactile presentation positions as the tactile presentation position targeted by each of the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined number of channels.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The transmission unit transmits the transmission signal to the reception side via the predetermined transmission path. For example, the predetermined transmission path may be a coaxial cable, an optical cable, an Ethernet (IEC 61883-6) cable, an HDMI cable, an MHL cable, or a display port cable.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, the transmission signal may be a transmission signal for each block including a plurality of frames, the transmission unit may sequentially transmit the transmission signal for each block to the reception side via the predetermined transmission path, and the transmission signal generation unit may add metadata using a predetermined bit region of a channel status configured for each block. In this case, for example, the plurality of frames may include repetition of a multichannel group including a predetermined number of frames, and the transmission unit may arrange and transmit the audio signals of the predetermined number of channels and the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined number of channels in a time-division manner for each multichannel group on a channel-by-channel basis in all or some of the predetermined number of frames.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As described above, in the present technology, the metadata designating the tactile presentation position targeted by each of the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined number of channels is added to the transmission signal including the audio signals of the predetermined number of channels and the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined number of channels, and the transmission signal is transmitted. Therefore, on the reception side, the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined number of channels can be output as the tactile presentation signals of the target tactile presentation positions on the basis of the metadata, and the tactile presentation can be performed at more positions than the number of channels of the tactile presentation signals that can be transmitted.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Note that, in the present technology, for example, the transmission signal generation unit may dynamically change the metadata to dynamically change the tactile presentation position targeted by each of the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined number of channels. Therefore, on the reception side, the tactile presentation positions targeted by the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined number of channels can be dynamically changed on the basis of the metadata.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this case, for example, when changing the metadata from a first state to a second state, the transmission signal generation unit may perform fade-out and fade-in processing on the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined number of channels, or may insert a mute signal into the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined number of channels. Therefore, it is possible to alleviate the user's uncomfortable feeling caused by a discontinuous change of the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined number of channels.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, in this case, for example, the transmission signal generation unit may dynamically change the metadata in synchronization with the scene of content related to the audio signal. Therefore, it is possible to effectively drive the tactile presentation position suitable for the scene, and to perform appropriate tactile presentation to the user.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, another concept of the present technology is a reception apparatus including:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">a reception unit that receives, from a transmission side via a predetermined transmission path, a transmission signal including audio signals of a predetermined number of channels and tactile presentation signals of a predetermined number of channels and to which metadata designating a tactile presentation position targeted by each of the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined number of channels is added; and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">a processing unit that extracts and outputs the audio signal of the predetermined channel from the transmission signal, extracts the tactile presentation signal of the predetermined channel from the transmission signal, and outputs each of the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined channels as a tactile presentation signal of a target tactile presentation position on the basis of the metadata.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the present technology, the reception unit receives the transmission signal from the transmission side via the predetermined transmission path. The transmission signal includes the audio signals of the predetermined number of channels and the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined number of channels, and the metadata designating the tactile presentation position targeted by each of the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined number of channels is added to the transmission signal. For example, the predetermined transmission path may be a coaxial cable, an optical cable, an Ethernet (IEC 61883-6) cable, an HDMI cable, an MHL cable, or a display port cable.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, for example, the transmission signal may be a transmission signal for each block including a plurality of frames, the reception unit may sequentially receive the transmission signal for each block from the transmission side via the predetermined transmission path, and the metadata may be added using a predetermined bit region of a channel status configured for each block. In this case, for example, the plurality of frames may include repetition of a multichannel group including a predetermined number of frames, and the audio signals of the predetermined number of channels and the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined number of channels may be arranged in a time-division manner for each multichannel group on a channel-by-channel basis in all or some of the predetermined number of frames.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The audio signal of a predetermined channel is extracted from the transmission signal and output by the processing unit. Furthermore, the processing unit extracts the tactile presentation signal of the predetermined channel from the transmission signal, and each of the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined channels is output as a tactile presentation signal of a target tactile presentation position on the basis of metadata.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As described above, in the present technology, each of the tactile presentation signals of the predetermined channels extracted from the transmission signal is output as the tactile presentation signal of the target tactile presentation position on the basis of the metadata. Therefore, it is possible to perform tactile presentation at more positions than the number of channels of the tactile presentation signal.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0008" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a configuration example of an AV system as an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a tactile presentation position range.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating each tactile presentation position.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a configuration example of portions of a SPDIF reception circuit, an audio DA converter, a selector, and a driver in an audio amplifier.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining a tactile presentation signal sorting function included in the selector.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration example of the selector.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a configuration example in a case where some paths of the SPDIF reception circuit, the selector, and the driver are wireless.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining an example of audio-visual content reproduction.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of tactile presentation positions targeted by tactile presentation signals of four channels in Scenes <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining fade-out and fade-in processing and mute signal insertion processing on tactile presentation signals performed at the time of scene switching.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating another configuration example of portions of a SPDIF reception circuit, an audio DA converter, a selector, and a driver in an audio amplifier.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a configuration example of an HDMI reception unit of a television receiver and an HDMI transmission unit of an audio amplifier.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration example of a high-speed bus interface of a television receiver.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration example of a high-speed bus interface of an audio amplifier.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a frame configuration according to the IEC 60958 standard.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a sub-frame configuration according to the IEC 60958 standard.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a frame configuration of a multichannel transmission format in a case where stereo audio signals of two channels and tactile presentation signals of four channels are simultaneously transmitted.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating a format of a channel status according to the IEC 60958 standard.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining a mapping type that designates a tactile presentation position targeted by tactile presentation signals of four channels indicated by an 8-bit field of &#x201c;Haptic channel mapping type&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining a tactile presentation position targeted by each of tactile presentation signals of four channels predefined for each type.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating a format of a channel status according to the IEC 60958 standard.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining tactile presentation positions indicated by each 8-bit field of &#x201c;Haptic channel <b>0</b> allocation&#x201d;
