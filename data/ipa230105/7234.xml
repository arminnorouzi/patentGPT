Such optical elements can include windows, windshields, filters, lenses, mirrors, light emitters, or light detectors, among numerous other possibilities. As an example, an optical window over a camera can become contaminated by rain, snow, dirt, and biological materials. These contaminants can block, blur, distort, and scatter light that might otherwise be received by the camera. In such scenarios, it can be difficult to disambiguate, based on an image from the camera only, what is debris and what is the scene. This issue is often exacerbated due to optical window surfaces being out-of-focus in camera images. Furthermore, utilizing image processing techniques to disambiguate blurred portions of a camera image from the unblurred portions can be computationally costly and slow.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to an optical contaminant detection system.

Other embodiments can be utilized, and other changes can be made, without departing from the scope of the subject matter presented herein.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Thus, the example embodiments described herein are not meant to be limiting. Aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, separated, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are contemplated herein.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, unless context suggests otherwise, the features illustrated in each of the figures may be used in combination with one another. Thus, the figures should be generally viewed as component aspects of one or more overall embodiments, with the understanding that not all illustrated features are necessary for each embodiment.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">I. Overview</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present disclosure relates to an optical contaminant detection system. The optical contaminant detection system may provide a way to determine whether dust, dirt, water, cracks, etc. are present on an optical element (e.g., an optical window of a camera system). In some embodiments, an array of light sources could emit light that is coupled into the optical window. The light coupled into the optical window can be detected by an array of detectors. If a contaminant material is present on the window it will tend to couple the light out of the optical window, effectively attenuating the detected signal. Over an array of light-emitter/detector pairs, a differential signal could be associated with a contaminant on the optical window. Sunlight and ambient light can be subtracted from the overall detector signals.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The array of light sources could include light-emitting diodes, laser diodes, and/or other types of light-emitter devices that are configured to emit light according to a modulation signal with a frequency between 100 Hz and 100 kHz. In some embodiments, the light sources could be modulated according to a pseudo-random code, such as a maximal length sequence, a Gold code, a Kasami code, or a Barker code. Other modulation sequences are possible and contemplated. In some embodiments, the light sources could be configured to emit infrared light.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In various embodiments, the light sources and detectors could be interleaved (e.g., ABAB, etc.) along two or more edges of a rectangular or square optical element in an N&#xd7;N or M&#xd7;N arrangement.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Additionally or alternatively, the array of light sources and detectors could be optically coupled to the optical element by way of one or more optical couplers. In some examples, the optical couplers could be configured to &#x201c;in-couple&#x201d; light emitted by the light sources into the optical element and &#x201c;out-couple&#x201d; light from the optical element and focus light onto the detector. In some embodiments, an optical coupler could include one or more lensed portions, a reflective surface, and a mounting surface. In some examples, the reflective surface could include a surface that reflects light by way of total internal reflection. In other examples, the reflective surface could include a reflective material (e.g., a metal) that is coated on at least a portion of the optical coupler. The optical coupler could be coupled (e.g., glued or otherwise fastened) to a first surface or second surface of the optical element</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In scenarios where the present optical contaminant detection system is used with a camera, the light-emitter devices could be oriented to emit light along axes that are parallel with an optical axis of the camera. In other embodiments, the light-emitter devices could be oriented to emit light at an inward angle with respect to the optical axis of the camera. In yet another embodiment, the light-emitter devices could be oriented to emit light at an angle substantially perpendicular to the optical axis of the camera (e.g., parallel to a surface of the optical element).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, the optical coupler could be mounted to the optical element by way of an optical adhesive material (e.g., index-matched optical epoxy).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In various examples, the light-emitter devices and detectors could be arranged along a printed circuit board that is disposed about an optical axis of the camera.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some examples, a controller could be configured to cause the light-emitter devices to emit light that is coupled into the optical element by way of the optical couplers. The controller could also be configured to receive a plurality of detected signals from the detector devices. Based on the plurality of detected signals, the controller could be configured to determine that a contaminant (e.g., water, dirt, dust, etc.) is present on a surface of the optical element. Upon determining that a contaminant is present, the controller could send an instruction or a notification to clean the optical element. In some embodiments, in response to determining that a contaminant is present on the optical element, the controller could cause a cleaning device (e.g., water jet, wiper, moveable optical element, etc.) to clean the optical element.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Additionally or alternatively, the plurality of detected signals could provide information about a location of the contaminant on the optical element. The controller could be configured to take various actions (or take no action) based on the location of the contaminant along the optical element. For example, if the contaminant is located at a first location (e.g., lower priority portion of the field of view) of the optical element, the controller could take no action. If the contaminant is located at a second location (e.g., medium priority portion of the field of view) of the optical element, the controller could cause the cleaning system to attempt to clean the contaminant from the optical element. Furthermore, if the contaminant is located at a third location (e.g., high priority portion of the field of view) of the optical element, the controller could be configured to downgrade or disregard information from the camera and, in some embodiments, the controller could utilize other sensors to scan the high priority portion of the field of view.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">II. Example Contaminant Detection Systems</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a contaminant detection system <b>100</b>, according to an example embodiment.

As an example, the infrared light could include light having a wavelength of about 905 nanometers (e.g., between 900 and 910 nanometers). However, other wavelengths of emission light <b>122</b> are possible and contemplated.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some examples, the plurality of light-emitter devices <b>120</b> could be configured to emit emission light <b>122</b> according to a modulation frequency, wherein the modulation frequency is between 100 Hz and 100 kHz. While the light-emitter devices <b>120</b> could be configured to turn &#x201c;on&#x201d; and &#x201c;off&#x201d; according to the modulation frequency, other intensity modulations and/or waveforms (e.g., sawtooth, square wave, stair step, etc.) are possible and contemplated. Furthermore, although such embodiments describe periodic illumination using the light-emitter devices <b>120</b>, it will be understood that aperiodic illumination (e.g., according to a pseudorandom code) could be provided in addition or in the alternative. For example, the light-emitter devices <b>120</b> could be configured to provide emission light <b>122</b> based on determination of a potential, predicted, or likely contaminant <b>12</b> on the optical element <b>10</b> (e.g., during rain/snow conditions).

The optical coupler <b>110</b> could additionally or alternatively include a reflective surface <b>114</b> configured to reflect light. The optical coupler <b>110</b> could also include a coupling surface <b>112</b> configured to be optically coupled to the optical element <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the optical coupler <b>110</b> could be configured to guide light by total internal reflection. As an example, the optical coupler <b>110</b> may be configured to guide at least a portion of the emission light <b>122</b> by total internal reflection. In various embodiments, the optical coupler <b>110</b> could be mounted to the optical element <b>10</b> by way of an optical adhesive material (e.g., index-matched optical epoxy). In some embodiments, the optical element <b>10</b> and the optical coupler(s) <b>110</b> could be formed from a single piece of optical material. For example, the optical element <b>10</b> and the optical coupler(s) <b>110</b> could be incorporated into a single piece of an injection-moldable optical material.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The contaminant detection system <b>100</b> also includes a plurality of detector devices <b>130</b>. The detector devices <b>130</b> could be configured to detect at least a portion of the emission light (e.g., return light <b>124</b>) by way of the optical element <b>10</b> and the optical coupler <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The detector devices <b>130</b> could also be configured to provide detector signals indicative of a presence of a contaminant <b>12</b> on the optical element <b>10</b>. In various embodiments, the contaminant <b>12</b> could include at least one of: liquid water, snow, ice, dirt, dust, or crack or a defect in the optical element.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the contaminant detection system <b>100</b> could also include a controller <b>150</b>. In some embodiments, the controller <b>150</b> could include at least one of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC).
