Depending on the situation, it may be advantageous for the device to be held more tightly to a person's body, such as when completing a high-speed turn on snow skis or when free-falling just before opening a parachute while sky diving. A loose fit may result in failure to complete the turn, or loss of a parachute when the parachute opens and the user experiences a brief period of rapid deceleration. However, a loose fit is often advantageous during long periods of milder activity, such as while riding up a chair lift on the ski slope, or during the airplane ride to altitude before preparing to sky dive.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The optimum tension applied to the attachment interface of the wearable device may be directly related to movement of the wearable device relative to the person wearing it, or relative to the environment around the person wearing it, or relative to some other context such as a vehicle the person is riding in. This relative motion may be desirable in some situations, and less desirable in others depending on the circumstances. In many situations, the optimum tension may change quickly making it impractical for the user to adjust the tension on the wearable device manually. It may also be the case that the activity the user is engaged in requires using both hands for balance, for manipulating an object, or for support such as in the case of a person using crutches.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Disclosed are various examples of an automatic retention apparatus for automatically retaining a first object adjacent to a second object.

Such a communications link may be a wireless communications link implemented using wireless communication module <b>108</b>, or a physical communication link implemented using wires, optical fibers, and the like. For example, wireless communication module <b>108</b> may transmit and receive signals which may then be processed according to the protocols recognized by network interface <b>117</b> in order to implement a communications link.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Retention apparatus <b>100</b> may include a retention member <b>127</b> for retaining objects together. One or more sensors <b>129</b> may be included in or coupled to retention number <b>127</b>. The sensors may be configured to sense any suitable sense parameter such as any combination of speed, angular momentum, velocity, motion, acceleration, air pressure, force, ambient air temperature, and the like. Sensors <b>129</b> may optionally be included in or mounted to retention member <b>127</b>, or included in or mounted to automatic retention apparatus <b>100</b>. Sensor input from sensors on other objects interacting with apparatus <b>100</b> may also be used such as in the case of wireless sensors sending data received as signals <b>140</b> by wireless communication module <b>108</b> from a remote location.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">An actuator <b>130</b> may be included and configured to act on retention number <b>127</b> to increase or decrease tension on the retention member to vary the resulting tension on any or objects to be held in place by a retention member <b>127</b>. A motor <b>132</b> may be included in actuator <b>130</b> and coupled to a rotating member <b>134</b> such as the gear, pulley, and the like. An optional braking mechanism <b>136</b> may be coupled to rotating member <b>134</b> two selectively limit movement of rotating member <b>134</b>, such as, for example reducing or eliminating the possibility of retrograde rotation after rotating member <b>134</b> is no longer being acted on by motor <b>132</b>. In this way, braking mechanism <b>136</b> may be used to maintain tension on retention member <b>127</b> after actuator <b>130</b> has applied tension.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates at <b>200</b> one example of an arrangement of some of the parts of the automatic retention apparatus discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A retention member <b>208</b> is coupled to a first object <b>205</b> and surrounds at least a portion of a second object <b>203</b> such that the retention member is mounted outside the first object <b>205</b>. In this example, retention member <b>208</b> includes multiple portions such as a left portion <b>209</b> and a right portion <b>210</b> which may be mounted to first object <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Aspects of an actuator like actuator <b>130</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The actuator includes a rotating member <b>211</b> rotatable about an axis of rotation <b>220</b>. Rotation about the axis is provided by a motor <b>218</b> coupled to rotating member <b>211</b> by a shaft <b>215</b>. In this example, rotating member <b>211</b> is a worm gear with one or more teeth engaging one or more holes <b>213</b> passing through at least a portion of the retention member <b>208</b>. Rotating member <b>211</b> rotates around and axis of rotation <b>220</b> that is substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>223</b> of retention member <b>208</b>. As illustrated, the rotating member is outside the first object and coupled to retention number <b>208</b> such that when the actuator rotates the rotating member in a first direction, the length of retention member <b>208</b> is increased thus reducing tension on the retention member and consequently reducing the tension of retention member <b>208</b> on second object <b>203</b>. In other words, reducing tension on the retention member reduces the compression force on object <b>203</b> caused by retention member <b>208</b> thus relaxing the compression of object <b>203</b> with respect to object <b>205</b>. When the actuator rotates rotating member <b>211</b> in a second direction opposite the first direction, the length of retention member <b>208</b> is decreased thus increasing tension on the retention member <b>208</b> and increasing tension on second object <b>203</b>. Reducing the length of retention number <b>208</b> thus increases the compression force caused by retention member <b>208</b> on object <b>203</b> thus also pressing object <b>203</b> and <b>205</b> together more tightly. In this way, an actuator with a motor driving a worm gear that engages holes in a retention member is operable to automatically adjust a force applied to a first object to retain it in proper relationship with a second object by adjusting tension on the retention member.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another aspect, a processor such as processor <b>103</b> responsive to input from at least one sensor like sensor <b>129</b> may be configured to control the actuator. A processor may control the actuator instructing it to energize the motor to rotate the rotating member in the first or second direction to adjust the tension on the retention member to automatically retain the first object adjacent to the second object based on input from the sensor. For example, processor <b>103</b> may control the actuator to rotate in the first and second directions with the direction and number of rotations being a function of force applied to the retention member by the second object as measured by sensors <b>129</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In another aspect, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of sensors <b>129</b> positioned to collect data about sense parameters related to the operation of the automatic retention apparatus. For example, a sensor <b>222</b> is mounted to retention member <b>208</b>, and a sensor <b>221</b> is mounted to first object <b>205</b>. Sensor <b>222</b> is configured to generate input for the processor based on tension in the retention member <b>208</b>, and sensor <b>222</b> is configured to generate input for the processor based on movement of the first object <b>205</b>. This allows the processor to determine and control tension in retention member <b>208</b> according to movement of the first object.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another aspect, the processor controls rotation in the first and second directions as a function of force applied to the retention member by the second object. This force may be measured using any of sensors <b>129</b> such as by measuring changes in the tension on retention member <b>208</b> measured by sensor <b>222</b>. For example, if first object <b>205</b> is accelerated in a direction away from retention member <b>208</b>, the tension on retention member <b>208</b> applied by second object <b>203</b> will increase and may be measured as a temporary or prolonged increase in force applied to the retention member by the second object <b>203</b> as measured by sensor <b>222</b>. The apparatus may then respond to the sensor readings by automatically rotating rotatable number <b>211</b> two shorten retention member <b>208</b> the supplying additional force to objects <b>205</b> and <b>203</b> to retain them in place.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Another example of an arrangement of some of the parts of automatic retention apparatus <b>100</b> is shown at <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In this example, motor <b>218</b> rotates a shaft <b>308</b> that rotates around an axis of rotation <b>305</b>. Unlike the example of <b>200</b>, the retention member is arranged along a longitudinal axis <b>223</b> that is substantially perpendicular to the axis of rotation <b>305</b> of the rotating member <b>208</b>. In this example a rotating member <b>303</b> is a gear that rotates with shaft <b>308</b> to engage retention member <b>208</b>. Teeth of gear <b>303</b> engage holes <b>213</b> to cause left portion <b>209</b> to move in the direction of right portion <b>210</b> thus increasing tension in the retention member and applying a corresponding compression force to retain second object <b>203</b> in the proper position with respect to first object <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A braking mechanism <b>311</b> is coupled to the rotating member and configured to hold the rotating member from rotating in either the first or second direction, such as when motor <b>218</b> has stopped rotating shaft <b>308</b>. In another aspect, the processor may be configured to selectively engage and/or disengage braking mechanism <b>311</b> to facilitate changes in the tension of retention member <b>208</b> while maintaining those changes. In another aspect, braking mechanism <b>311</b> may be configured to automatically release when motor <b>218</b> begins to rotate and then automatically activate when stops rotating shaft <b>308</b>. Braking mechanism <b>311</b> may thus reduce or eliminate unwanted forward or reverse rotation that might, for example, cause retention member <b>208</b> to loosen after motor <b>218</b> has stopped rotating. Like the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the processor may accept input from sensors <b>129</b>, such as sensors <b>222</b> and <b>221</b>, to adjust the tension according to forces applied to the retention member <b>208</b>, first object <b>205</b>, and second object <b>203</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates at <b>400</b> aspects of the disclosed automatic retention apparatus adapted for use with a human wearable object such as an article of footwear.

A first automatic retention apparatus <b>407</b> is coupled to the object <b>405</b> with opposing ends of a retention member <b>411</b> mounted adjacent to a sole region <b>413</b> of the article of footwear <b>401</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">An actuator like those discussed above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> may be included in retention apparatus <b>407</b> that includes a gear with multiple teeth, the gear rotatable about an axis of rotation and positioned in the actuator so that at least one of the multiple teeth extends into the one or more holes of the retention member.

An antenna or antenna system designed to transmit radio waves may comprise an arrangement of metallic conductors (elements), electrically connected (often through a transmission line) to a receiver or transmitter. An oscillating current of electrons forced through the antenna by a transmitter can create an oscillating magnetic field around the antenna elements, while the charge of the electrons also creates an oscillating electric field along the elements. These time-varying fields radiate away from the antenna into space as a moving transverse electromagnetic field wave. Conversely, during reception, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of an incoming electromagnetic wave exert force on the electrons in the antenna elements, causing them to move back and forth, creating oscillating currents in the antenna. These currents can then be detected by receivers and processed to retrieve digital or analog signals or data.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Antennas can be designed to transmit and receive radio waves substantially equally in all horizontal directions (omnidirectional antennas), or preferentially in a particular direction (directional or high gain antennas). In the latter case, an antenna may also include additional elements or surfaces which may or may not have any physical electrical connection to the transmitter or receiver. For example, parasitic elements, parabolic reflectors or horns, and other such non-energized elements serve to direct the radio waves into a beam or other desired radiation pattern. Thus antennas may be configured to exhibit increased or decreased directionality or &#x201c;gain&#x201d; by the placement of these various surfaces or elements. High gain antennas can be configured to direct a substantially large portion of the radiated electromagnetic energy in a given direction that may be vertical horizontal or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Antennas may also be configured to radiate electromagnetic energy within a specific range of vertical angles (i.e. &#x201c;takeoff angles) relative to the earth in order to focus electromagnetic energy toward an upper layer of the atmosphere such as the ionosphere. By directing electromagnetic energy toward the upper atmosphere at a specific angle, specific skip distances may be achieved at particular times of day by transmitting electromagnetic energy at particular frequencies.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Other examples of antennas include emitters and sensors that convert electrical energy into pulses of electromagnetic energy in the visible or invisible light portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Examples include light emitting diodes, lasers, and the like that are configured to generate electromagnetic energy at frequencies ranging along the electromagnetic spectrum from far infrared to extreme ultraviolet.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">&#x201c;Article of Footwear&#x201d; generally refers to an object configured to be worn on the foot of a human or an animal. Examples of articles of foot wear include, but are not limited to, shoes, boots, sandals, socks, stockings, leg braces, waders, and wet suits. An example of regions of an article of footwear as referenced herein is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Note that some articles of footwear do not rise high enough along the leg to cover the ankle, and therefore some footwear does not include an ankle region. Some foot wear does not include laces or a tongue, and may not include a heal region that is enclosed.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">&#x201c;Battery&#x201d; generally refers to an electrical energy storage device or storage system including multiple energy storage devices. A battery may include one or more separate electrochemical cells, each converting stored chemical energy into electrical energy by a chemical reaction to generate an electromotive force (or &#x201c;EMF&#x201d; measured in Volts). An individual battery cell may have a positive terminal (cathode) with a higher electrical potential, and a negative terminal (anode) that is at a lower electrical potential than the cathode. Any suitable electrochemical cell may be used that employ any suitable chemical process, including galvanic cells, electrolytic cells, fuel cells, flow cells and voltaic piles. When a battery is connected to an external circuit, electrolytes are able to move as ions within the battery, allowing the chemical reactions to be completed at the separate terminals thus delivering energy to the external circuit.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">A battery may be a &#x201c;primary&#x201d; battery that can produce current immediately upon assembly. Examples of this type include alkaline batteries, nickel oxyhydroxide, lithium-copper, lithium-manganese, lithium-iron, lithium-carbon, lithium-thionyl chloride, mercury oxide, magnesium, zinc-air, zinc-chloride, or zinc-carbon batteries. Such batteries are often referred to as &#x201c;disposable&#x201d; insofar as they are generally not rechargeable and are discarded or recycled after discharge.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">A battery may also be a &#x201c;secondary&#x201d; or &#x201c;rechargeable&#x201d; battery that can produce little or no current until charged. Examples of this type include lead-acid batteries, valve regulated lead-acid batteries, sealed gel-cell batteries, and various &#x201c;dry cell&#x201d; batteries such as nickel-cadmium (NiCd), nickel-zinc (NiZn), nickel metal hydride (NiMH), and lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">&#x201c;Braking mechanism&#x201d; generally refers to a selectively engageable mechanism configured to reduce or halt the movement or rotation of one object with respect to another. In one example, a braking mechanism uses friction between two surfaces selectively pressed together to convert the kinetic energy of the moving or rotating object into heat, though other methods of energy conversion may be employed. Regenerative braking converts much of the energy to electrical energy, which may be stored for later use. Other methods convert kinetic energy into potential energy in such stored forms as pressurized air or pressurized oil. Eddy current brakes use magnetic fields to convert kinetic energy into electric current in the brake disc, fin, or rail, which is converted into heat. Still other braking methods even transform kinetic energy into different forms, for example by transferring the energy to a rotating flywheel.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Another example of a braking mechanism is a ratchet which allows continuous linear or rotary motion in only one direction while preventing motion in the opposite direction. A ratchet may include a series of engagement members such as teeth arranged around a gear or on linear rack. A pivoting, spring-loaded finger called a pawl engages the teeth. The teeth are uniform but asymmetrical, with each tooth having a moderate slope on one edge and a much steeper slope on the other edge. When the teeth are moving in the unrestricted (i.e., forward) direction, the pawl easily slides up and over the gently sloped edges of the teeth, with a biasing element such as a spring forcing it into the depression between the teeth as it passes the tip of each tooth. When the teeth attempt to move in the opposite (backward) direction the pawl catches on the steeply sloped edge of the first tooth it encounters, thereby locking it against the tooth and preventing any further motion in that direction until the pawl is released.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">&#x201c;Cable&#x201d; generally refers to one or more elongate strands of material that has tensile strength but little if any compressive strength. In other words, a cable is a relatively flexible elongate structure of one or more strands that tends to resist being pulled apart or stretched, but is generally unable to resist being compressed together. Examples include wire rope, flexible shafts, Bowden cables, coaxial cable, twisted pair electrical wire, a single strand of wire, as well as non-wire ropes made of natural or synthetic fibers.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">&#x201c;Computer&#x201d; generally refers to any computing device configured to compute a result from any number of input values or variables. A computer may include a processor for performing calculations to process input or output. A computer may include a memory for storing values to be processed by the processor, or for storing the results of previous processing.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">A computer may also be configured to accept input and output from a wide array of input and output devices for receiving or sending values. Such devices include other computers, keyboards, mice, visual displays, printers, industrial equipment, and systems or machinery of all types and sizes. For example, a computer can control a network or network interface to perform various network communications upon request. The network interface may be part of the computer, or characterized as separate and remote from the computer.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">A computer may be a single, physical, computing device such as a desktop computer, a laptop computer, or may be composed of multiple devices of the same type such as a group of servers operating as one device in a networked cluster, or a heterogeneous combination of different computing devices operating as one computer and linked together by a communication network. The communication network connected to the computer may also be connected to a wider network such as the internet. Thus a computer may include one or more physical processors or other computing devices or circuitry, and may also include any suitable type of memory.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A computer may also be a virtual computing platform having an unknown or fluctuating number of physical processors and memories or memory devices. A computer may thus be physically located in one geographical location or physically spread across several widely scattered locations with multiple processors linked together by a communication network to operate as a single computer.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The concept of &#x201c;computer&#x201d; and &#x201c;processor&#x201d; within a computer or computing device also encompasses any such processor or computing device serving to make calculations or comparisons as part of the disclosed system. Processing operations related to threshold comparisons, rules comparisons, calculations, and the like occurring in a computer may occur, for example, on separate servers, the same server with separate processors, or on a virtual computing environment having an unknown number of physical processors as described above.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">A computer may be optionally coupled to one or more visual displays and/or may include an integrated visual display. Likewise, displays may be of the same type, or a heterogeneous combination of different visual devices. A computer may also include one or more operator input devices such as a keyboard, mouse, touch screen, laser or infrared pointing device, or gyroscopic pointing device to name just a few representative examples. Also, besides a display, one or more other output devices may be included such as a printer, plotter, industrial manufacturing machine, 3D printer, and the like. As such, various display, input and output device arrangements are possible.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Multiple computers or computing devices may be configured to communicate with one another or with other devices over wired or wireless communication links to form a network. Network communications may pass through various computers operating as network appliances such as switches, routers, firewalls or other network devices or interfaces before passing over other larger computer networks such as the internet. Communications can also be passed over the network as wireless data transmissions carried over electromagnetic waves through transmission lines or free space. Such communications include using WiFi or other Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) or a cellular transmitter/receiver to transfer data.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">&#x201c;Communication Link&#x201d; generally refers to a connection between two or more communicating entities and may or may not include a communications channel between the communicating entities. The communication between the communicating entities may occur by any suitable means. For example the connection may be implemented as a physical link, an electrical link, an electromagnetic link, a logical link, or any other suitable linkage facilitating communication.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the case of physical link, communicating entities may be physically connected one to another. For example, the physical link directly connected to one entity may be directly connected to another. In the case of an electrical link, the communication link may be composed of one or more electrical conductors electrically connected to the communicating entities to form the communication link. In the case of an electromagnetic link, the communicating entities may be coupled to a communications link by sending or receiving electromagnetic energy at any suitable frequency, thus allowing communications to pass as electromagnetic waves. These electromagnetic waves may or may not pass through a physical medium such as a wire or an optical fiber, or through free space, or any combination thereof. Electromagnetic waves may be passed at any suitable frequency including any frequency in the electromagnetic spectrum.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the case of a logical link, the communication link may be a conceptual linkage between the sender and recipient such as a transmission station and receiving station. Logical link may include any combination of physical, electrical, electromagnetic, or other types of communication links.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">&#x201c;Coupling device&#x201d; generally refers to a device for coupling one object to another. Examples include a belt buckle, a zipper, a latch, a padlock, a trailer hitch, a clothing button, an electrical connector, boot bindings for a snow board or snow ski, and foot straps for a water ski, kite board, surf board, wave board, or sail board, to name a few non-limiting examples.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">&#x201c;Gear&#x201d; generally refers to a machine part having engagement teeth, or cogs, which extend outwardly away from the body of the gear. The teeth are configured to mesh with another part have corresponding similarly spaced teeth or similarly spaced holes that extend at least a portion of the way through the other part. Types of gears include spur, helical, skew, double helical, bevel, spiral bevel, hypoid, crown, worm, non-circular, rack and pinion, epicyclic, sun and planet, harmonic, cage, cycloidal, and magnetic to name a few non-limiting examples.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Worm gears resemble screws and mesh with a worm wheel, which looks similar to a spur gear. Worm-and-gear sets are a simple and compact way to achieve a high torque, low speed gear ratio. A worm gear is a species of helical gear, but its helix angle is usually somewhat large (close to 90 degrees) and its body is usually fairly long in the axial direction. These attributes give it screw like qualities. The distinction between a worm and a helical gear is that at least one tooth persists for a full rotation around the helix. A worm gear may be thought of as having a single tooth in the case where the tooth persists for several turns around the helix. A worm gear may also be thought of as having more than one tooth when viewed perpendicular to the long axis of the gear. The reappearing tooth at intervals along the length of the worm may thus be thought of as multiple teeth.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In a worm-and-gear set, the worm can always drive the gear. However, if the gear attempts to drive the worm, it may or may not succeed. Particularly if the lead angle is small, the gear's teeth may simply lock against the worm's teeth, because the force component circumferential to the worm is not sufficient to overcome friction. In traditional music boxes, however, the gear drives the worm, which has a large helix angle. A worm and gear set may be &#x201c;self-locking&#x201d;, as when it is desired to set the position of a mechanism by turning the worm and then have the mechanism hold that position without allowing retrograde rotation. An example is the machine head found on some types of stringed instruments.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">&#x201c;Hole&#x201d; generally refers to a hollowed out area defined by a solid body or surface. A hole may extend into the solid body or surface without passing through such as in the case of an indention, depression, or pit. A hole may also pass through one side of an object to another side, thus passing completely through the object. The second side may be the same as the first, such as in the case of loop inside a solid body. Holes may have any suitable shape such as a circle, rectangle, oval, square, triangle, and the like.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">&#x201c;Input&#x201d; generally refers to something put in, such as a physical substance put in (e.g. increased input of fuel), power or energy put into a machine or system usually with the intent of sizable recovery in the form of output, a component of production (such as land, labor, or raw materials), signals, data, or information fed into a computer, advice or comment, or a stimulus that acts on and is integrated into a bodily system. In the case of information fed into a computer, the input may be generated by a sensor detecting a sense parameter. In this instances, the time-varying values of the sense parameter are at least part of the input.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">&#x201c;Memory&#x201d; generally refers to any storage system or device configured to retain data or information. Each memory may include one or more types of solid-state electronic memory, magnetic memory, or optical memory, just to name a few.

The network standards may qualify as 1G, 2G, etc. by fulfilling a specification or standards such as the specifications maintained by International Telecommunication Union (ITU). For example, a network may be referred to as a &#x201c;3G network&#x201d; if it meets the criteria in the International Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000) specification regardless of what it may otherwise be referred to. A network may be referred to as a &#x201c;4G network&#x201d; if it meets the requirements of the International Mobile Telecommunications Advanced (IMTAdvanced) specification. Examples of cellular network or other wireless standards include AMPS, GSM, GPRS, UMTS, LTE, LTE Advanced, Mobile WiMAX, and WiMAX-Advanced.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Cellular network standards may use various channel access methods such as FDMA, TDMA, CDMA, or SDMA. Different types of data may be transmitted via different links and standards, or the same types of data may be transmitted via different links and standards.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The geographical scope of the network may vary widely. Examples include a body area network (BAN), a personal area network (PAN), a low power wireless Personal Area Network using IPv6 (6LoWPAN), a local-area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wide area network (WAN), or the Internet.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">A network may have any suitable network topology defining the number and use of the network connections.
