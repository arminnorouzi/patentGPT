level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to electric vehicles and more particularly to updating software of electric vehicles without requiring approval of the vehicle operator.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many vehicles, including vehicles powered by internal combustion engines, electrical power, or a combination of both, include one or more control modules that include electronics and software for controlling a plurality of operational aspects of the vehicle (referred to hereinafter as a &#x201c;system control module&#x201d; or &#x201c;SCM&#x201d;). Occasionally, software and/or data used by the SCM (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;calibration data&#x201d;) is identified as including a bug, an outdated customer requirement, inefficient instructions, outdated look-up data, or other outdated software and/or data that may affect performance of the vehicle. When such outdated calibration data is identified, it is desirable to perform a calibration data update or &#x201c;port over&#x201d; by transferring or downloading updated calibration data from a remote location to the SCM of the vehicle. However, the normal operation of the SCM is interrupted during a calibration data port over, so the timing of such port overs should be carefully managed.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, calibration data port over was only initiated upon receipt by the SCM of an indication that a port over was desired by the vehicle operator, such as a signal provided to the SCM by a physical switch that is manually activated by the operator. In general, the vehicle operator or other customer associated with the vehicle (e.g., the fleet owner, operations director manager, etc.) receives an electronic notification that a calibration update is available and stored, for example, in the cloud. When the operator or customer approves of receiving a calibration update (such as by activating a physical switch), the calibration data port over begins through wireless communications between the cloud and the vehicle SCM wherein data is sent in small packets. For a variety of reasons, however, it is desired to remove the requirement that a port over is initiated by manual input by the vehicle operator/customer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As indicated above, the normal operation of the SCM is interrupted during a port over, while certain functions of the vehicle may still be in operation. Thus, in conventional internal combustion engine powered vehicles, a port over would not occur unless the manual request is provided and the engine speed was zero and the vehicle speed was zero. If these criteria were met, the vehicle was considered not in mission and the port over could occur.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For electric vehicles (e.g., all-electric and hybrid vehicles), the energy storage systems (e.g., batteries) may still be functioning even when the vehicle and engine speeds are zero. In other words, the energy storage systems may be powering accessories such as lights and air conditioning while the vehicle is stationary, and interruption of those functions by a calibration data port over would be undesirable. Thus, there is a need for a calibration data port over system and method that does not require manual initiation and does not interfere with the desired operational state of the vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, the present disclosure provides a system for automatically performing a calibration data port over process for a vehicle, comprising: a system control module mounted to the vehicle and in communication with an information storage device configured to store calibration data; a telematics module mounted to the vehicle and in communication with the system control module; the telematics module being configured to communicate wirelessly with a remote communication device to receive data indicating a current geographic location of the vehicle and with a remote computing system to receive calibration data; and a charging port mounted to the vehicle and configured to connect to a charging station to receive electrical energy during a charging event for charging an energy storage system mounted to the vehicle; wherein the remote computing system is configured to generate and transmit updated calibration data to the telematics module for use in a port over process to replace and/or add to the calibration data stored on the information storage device; and wherein the system control module is configured to receive the updated calibration data from the telematics module and initiate an automatic port over process to replace and/or add to the calibration data stored on the information storage device with the updated calibration data in response to determining (1) that the charging port is connected to the charging station, (2) that the charging event is complete, and (3) that the current geographic location of the vehicle is within a predetermined geo-fence location.

In yet another aspect of this embodiment, the system control module determines that the charging event is complete by monitoring a state-of-charge of the energy storage system. In a variant of this aspect, the system control module determines that the charging event is complete when the state-of-charge of the energy storage system equals or exceeds a predetermined threshold.

TM <b>14</b> is also in communication with SCM <b>12</b> by wired or wireless connection(s) and functions to transmit and receive information between SCM <b>12</b>, remote computing system <b>26</b> and one or more satellites <b>22</b>. In certain embodiments of the present disclosure, TM <b>14</b> and satellites <b>22</b> are part of a global positioning system which permits TM <b>14</b> (or SCM <b>12</b>) to determine the location of vehicle <b>10</b> with a fairly high degree of accuracy, as is well known in the art.

The recharging is accomplished by connecting charging port <b>20</b> to a charging station <b>24</b>. In various applications, charging station <b>24</b> may be located in any of several different locations such as a service station, a parking garage or lot, a commercial vehicle storage location, a truck stop, a personal garage, etc. When charging port <b>20</b> is connected to charging station <b>24</b>, charging station <b>24</b> provides electrical energy (such as from the grid or other central storage or generation source) to charging port <b>20</b>, which is connected to ESS <b>16</b> to charge the storage devices of ESS <b>16</b>. It should be understood that some charging events may be characterized as &#x201c;opportunistic&#x201d; charging events, in that they are short duration charging events such as charging vehicle <b>10</b> for just a few minutes at a service station while the operator uses other services provided by the service station. In these instances, ESS <b>16</b> is not likely to obtain a fully charged status, but a partial charge is nonetheless advantageous. It should be further understood that in many vehicles, ESS <b>16</b> cannot be charged during a calibration data port over, an operation which may take several minutes to perform. Thus, in many instances a calibration data port over is not desirable during an opportunistic charging event because too much of the time available for charging would be used for the port over.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, vehicle <b>10</b>, and in particular TM <b>14</b>, is in communication with remote computing system <b>26</b> via network <b>28</b>.

As indicated above, network <b>28</b> facilitates communications between remote computing system <b>26</b> and TM <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In general, the calibration data port over approach of the present disclosure is to provide a port over only when (1) vehicle <b>10</b> is connected via charging port <b>20</b> to charging station <b>24</b>, (2) the charging event is complete, and (3) the vehicleis in a predetermined location designated as a safe zone for calibration data updating. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the predetermined location designated as a safe zone for calibration data updating is depicted by dashed lines <b>34</b> and is referred to herein as a geo-fence or geo-fence location. In the present approach, an end customer (e.g., the vehicle operator, fleet owner, original equipment manufacturer, transit authority, etc.) may define one or more geo-fences <b>34</b>. In certain applications, geo-fence <b>34</b> may be a parking lot where buses are charged over night or during periods of non-use. In other applications, geo-fence <b>34</b> may be defined as a residential end customer's garage. Any of a variety of different geo-fences <b>34</b> may be defined for various different vehicles <b>10</b>. By only performing a port over when vehicle <b>10</b> is in a geo-fence location, a system and method of the present disclosure avoids performing port overs during opportunistic charging events as described above.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In operation in certain embodiments, when a customer approves a calibration, calibration data is transferred from remote computing system <b>26</b> to TM <b>14</b>. After the entire set of calibration data is transferred to TM <b>14</b>, TM <b>14</b> transfers a plurality of small packets of calibration data to non-volatile memory in SCM <b>12</b>. After the entire set of calibration data is available in the memory of SCM <b>12</b>, a status flag is set to one as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and described below. SCM <b>12</b> then checks the conditions discussed above. Specifically, when charging port <b>20</b> is connected to charging station <b>24</b>, SCM <b>12</b> will receive a signal from a sensor (such as sensor <b>19</b>) or other device indicating that vehicle <b>10</b> is connected for a charging event. That satisfies one of the conditions for an automatic port over. SCM <b>12</b> can monitor the state-of-charge status of ESS <b>16</b> to determine when the charging event is complete or nearly complete. SCM <b>12</b> may monitor the ESS <b>16</b> state-of-charge status by communicating with, for example, battery management system <b>21</b> of ESS <b>16</b>. SCM <b>12</b> can also determine the current location of vehicle <b>10</b> from information provided by TM <b>14</b>. SCM <b>12</b> can compare the current location of vehicle <b>10</b> to any/all geo-fence <b>34</b> locations stored in ISD <b>18</b> as being associated with vehicle <b>10</b>. Alternatively, TM <b>14</b> can store the geo-fence <b>34</b> locations and make the determination of whether vehicle <b>10</b> is in a geo-fence <b>34</b> location based on the current location of vehicle <b>10</b>. In any event, if the vehicle <b>10</b> is located within a geo-fence <b>34</b>, and if vehicle <b>10</b> is connected to charging station <b>24</b> and the charging event is complete or nearly complete, then SCM <b>12</b> conducts the calibration data port over. In this manner, the downloading of calibration data via network <b>28</b> to TM <b>14</b> and the non-volatile memory of SCM <b>12</b> occurs in advance of the port over of the calibration data, which is not performed unless the conditions described above are all satisfied.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a method <b>50</b> of performing a calibration data port over according to the present disclosure is depicted. Initially, at block <b>52</b>, remote computing system <b>26</b> determines that calibration data is available for downloading to vehicle <b>10</b>. As indicated above, remote computing system <b>26</b> may make this determination for any of a variety of reasons when updated data/instructions may be needed for improved performance of vehicle <b>10</b>. When the determination is made that updated calibration data is available, remote computing system <b>26</b> sets a status valid flag to zero at block <b>54</b>. At step <b>56</b>, the customer, such as a vehicle fleet owner, approves the transfer of the calibration data via network <b>28</b> to TM <b>14</b> and the non-volatile memory of SCM <b>12</b>. At block <b>58</b>, remote computing system <b>26</b> downloads the updated calibration data via network <b>28</b> in the manner described herein and SCM <b>12</b> sets the status flag to one at block <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">At this point in the process, the calibration data has been received by SCM <b>12</b> of vehicle <b>10</b> but the port over operation has not been executed wherein the calibration data is moved to ISD <b>18</b>, a process which interrupts the normal operation of SCM <b>12</b>. At block <b>62</b>, SCM <b>12</b> determines whether a vehicle start switch <b>23</b> is in the ON position. If start switch <b>23</b> is ON, indicating that vehicle <b>10</b> is in use or about to be used, then no port over occurs as is indicated by block <b>64</b>. If start switch <b>23</b> is not in the ON position, then SCM <b>12</b> determines at block <b>66</b> whether charging port <b>20</b> is connected to charging station <b>24</b> in the manner described herein. If charging port <b>20</b> is not connected to charging station <b>24</b>, then an automatic port over will not occur but under certain circumstances outside the scope of the present disclosure a manual port over may occur as indicated by block <b>68</b>. If charging port <b>20</b> is connected to charging station <b>24</b>, then one of the conditions for an automatic port over of updated calibration data is satisfied.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Vehicle <b>10</b> may be in the process of receiving a charge from charging station <b>24</b> when the present method reaches block <b>70</b>, but the charging event may not be complete. SCM <b>12</b> remains at block <b>70</b> monitoring the state-of-charge of ESS <b>16</b> until SCM <b>12</b> determines that the charging event is complete or nearly complete. Charging is complete when the state-of-charge (&#x201c;SOC&#x201d;) of ESS <b>16</b> is at 100%. Charging is nearly complete when the SOC of ESS <b>16</b> is at or above a bulk charge threshold which is a calibration parameter that the customer can set. The criteria that sets charging as complete for the purpose of port over is SOC&#x3e;=bulk charge threshold (default value is 100) and charging time is greater than a time threshold (e.g., 30 minutes).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">When the charging event is complete or nearly complete, SCM <b>12</b> determines at block <b>72</b> whether vehicle <b>10</b> is in a predesignated geo-fence <b>34</b> where a port over may be safely performed. As indicated above, SCM <b>12</b> in communication with TM <b>14</b> determines the actual location of vehicle <b>10</b> (e.g., using GPS technology) and compares the actual location to any predetermined geo-fence <b>34</b> locations. If vehicle <b>10</b> is not in a geo-fence <b>34</b>, then the method returns to block <b>62</b> and SCM <b>12</b> determines whether start switch <b>23</b> is in the ON position. If, on the other hand, vehicle <b>10</b> is in a geo-fence <b>34</b>, then SCM <b>12</b> determines at step <b>74</b> whether the status valid flag is set to one, which in this example it is as described with reference to block <b>60</b>. At this point, all conditions for an automatic port over of updated calibration data are met, and SCM <b>12</b> initiates a port over process at block <b>76</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It should be understood that the various conditions for an automatic port over process may be checked in a different order than that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For example, the first condition check may be whether vehicle <b>10</b> is in a geo-fence <b>34</b>, and if not, the remainder of the checks may be skipped. Other alternative sequences may be used within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">While this disclosure has been described as having an exemplary design, the present disclosure may be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure.
