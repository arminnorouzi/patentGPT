No. 17/716,574, filed on Apr. 8, 2022, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/147,681, filed on Feb. 9, 2021.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure of the present patent application relates to liquid ring vacuum pumps, and particularly to a water-conserving, liquid ring vacuum pump system.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Liquid ring vacuum pumps have an impeller with blades attached to a center hub. The blades are located within a cylindrical body and are off-set from the center. The impeller is situated between two end plates, which have inlet and outlet ports. The pump requires a liquid sealant to create a vacuum. Prior to starting, the pump is partially filled with the liquid sealant. The liquid can be water, as in water ring pumps; an oil; or a solvent, depending upon the application. These water ring vacuum pumps are heavily used in the food industry and generally have a standard &#xbe;&#x2033; water hose from a municipal water supply hooked directly to the make-up water port of the pump. In addition to air, the output from the water ring vacuum pumps includes water, heavy contaminants (sediment), and light contaminants (foam). The water is replenished by adding water to a make-up water port on the pump. The water from the pump is commonly discharged onto the ground, or into a drain. Some municipalities require that the water be treated, before releasing it. In one example, a single 20 HP water ring vacuum pump uses 19 to 49 liters per minute, or 1,140 to 2,940 liters per hour. Many plants operate seven days a week and fifty-two weeks a year, so a single 20 HP water ring vacuum pump may use up to 25,683,840 liters of water per year. Multiply this use by the several thousand water ring vacuum pumps in service, and the amount of wasted water is staggering.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, a water conserving, liquid ring vacuum pump system solving the aforementioned problems is desired.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The water-conserving, liquid ring vacuum pump system receives the output from a water ring vacuum pump, removes the air and contaminants from the water to provide clean water, and returns the clean water to the make-up water port on the pump, thereby recirculating and saving most of the water that would normally be discarded. Friction in the pump also heats the water, so the system is designed to cool the water as well.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The system includes a dry compartment and a wet compartment. The dry compartment includes the electrical system components, a cooling air fan, and a cooling air distribution plenum, and houses the liquid ring vacuum pump. The wet compartment includes an open top, a left-side panel, a rear panel, a right-side panel, a front panel, and a bottom wall. Two chamber walls divide the wet compartment into three chambers. A first chamber receives water from a vacuum pump output stream after foam and air have been removed by a diffuser. A first chamber wall separates the upper portion of the first chamber from the second chamber and includes a gap to allow cold water at the lower portion of the first chamber to flow into the lower portion of the second chamber. A second chamber wall separates the lower portion of the second chamber from the lower portion of the third chamber, while allowing water to flow over the second chamber wail from the second chamber into the third chamber. The chambers form a sediment trap, such that sediment remains in the bottom of the first two chambers and cannot enter the third chamber.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The third chamber includes a thermostat extending through the front panel and a cold-water outlet connected to the water make-up port of the liquid ring vacuum pump via a solenoid valve. The thermostat opens when the water in the third chamber exceeds a predetermined limit. The third chamber also includes a float valve that opens when the level of water in the third chamber drops below a predetermined normal water level to supply cool water to the third chamber via a make-up water inlet. A water lower limit float switch opens when the water in the third chamber falls below a lower limit just above the cold-water outlet.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The cooling air system includes air-cooling tubes that extend through the third chamber. The cooling air fan has a central input for receiving cooling air from the air-cooling tubes and a fan shroud surrounding the fan for directing the cooling air to the plenum. The cooling air system further includes air-cooling tubes that extend through the first chamber and the second chamber and receive cooling air from the plenum.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The electrical system of the water-conserving, liquid ring vacuum pump system includes an AC-to-DC converter that produces a positive and a negative DC relay voltage from an AC voltage source, and also includes a first circuit breaker protecting the AC-to-DC converter. A second circuit breaker protects the vacuum pump motor, while a third circuit breaker protects the cooling air fan motor, and a fourth circuit breaker protects the solenoid of the solenoid valve. A main circuit relay connects the AC voltage source to the second, third and fourth circuit breakers. A control relay is controlled by an emergency stop switch, an on/off switch, the water lower limit float switch, and auxiliary contacts on the second, third and fourth circuit breakers. The control relay controls the main circuit relay to shut off power to the pump motor, fan motor, and solenoid should any of the circuit breakers trip, or if the water level drops below the lower limit, or if an operator depresses the emergency stop switch.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other features of the present subject matter will become readily apparent upon further review of the following specification.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an environmental perspective view of a water-conserving vacuum pump system, showing the housing with its front panel, left side and top covers in their closed positions.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> perspective view of the water-conserving vacuum pump system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, showing ts rear panel.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of the water-conserving vacuum pump system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, showing its right side with open right access panel, its open front access panel, and its top covers in their open positions, showing some of the internal components of the system.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of a first and second chamber of a wet compartment of the water-conserving vacuum pump system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, as seen from above.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective top view of a second and third chamber of the wet compartment of the water-serving vacuum pump system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, as seen from above.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view of the water-conserving vacuum pump system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as seen from the right side, with a portion of its outer housing removed to show internal components of the dry compartment of the system.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the wet compartment of the water-conserving vacuum pump system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, showing fluid flow through the wet compartment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic electrical circuit diagram of the water-conserving vacuum pump system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the attached drawings.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The external features of the water-conserving, liquid ring vacuum pump system <b>100</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>.

The third chamber <b>418</b> includes a cold water outlet <b>500</b> that is connected to the water make-up port (not shown) of the liquid ring vacuum pump via a cold water drainpipe <b>600</b>. A solenoid valve <b>602</b> in the cold water drainpipe <b>600</b> includes a solenoid <b>604</b> that is connected to the control circuitry by a solenoid valve wiring harness <b>606</b>. The solenoid valve <b>602</b> closes when power to the system <b>100</b> is turned off, as described further below, to stop water flow to the liquid ring vacuum pump that may damage the liquid ring vacuum pump upon start-up. The bottom wall <b>501</b> includes a drain <b>502</b> in both the third chamber <b>418</b> and the first chamber <b>406</b> (not shown). The drain <b>502</b> in the third chamber <b>418</b> leads to the right-side water drain <b>320</b>, while the drain in the first chamber <b>406</b> leads to the left-side water drain <b>118</b>. A float valve <b>504</b> receives input water (preferably cool water) via the make-up water inlet <b>326</b> through the right-side panel <b>302</b>. A float <b>506</b> is connected to the float valve <b>504</b> by a float shaft <b>508</b>, similar to float valves found in toilet tanks. A float guide bracket <b>510</b> includes a float guide slot <b>512</b> through which the float shaft extends to thereby stabilize the float.

While the auxiliary input is optional, some liquid ring vacuum pumps include a pressure relief port to avoid damage to the pump should the output become blocked. The supply tube <b>620</b> may be connected to the pressure relief port of the liquid ring vacuum pump to conserve any water lost due to an over pressure condition in the pump.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The initial steps to operate the water conserving, liquid ring vacuum pump system <b>100</b> is best described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The system <b>100</b> is designed to be very simple to operate in order to minimize training requirements of operating personnel. After connecting the vacuum port <b>114</b> to vacuum-operated equipment, connecting the power cord <b>138</b> to an appropriate electrical power source, and connecting the make-up water inlet <b>326</b> to a source of cool water, the operator turns the on/off switch <b>139</b> to the on position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Thereafter, operation of the water-conserving, liquid ring vacuum pump system <b>100</b> is automatic, as described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, when the vacuum pump starts operating, its output stream enters the diffuser <b>404</b> via the air/water output pipe <b>402</b>. The output stream from the vacuum pump includes mostly air, together with some water, foam and sediment. The foam F floats on top of the water in the first chamber <b>406</b> and is held in the diffuser <b>404</b> by the sides of a diffuser shroud <b>702</b>. The large volume of air from the vacuum pump blows the foam F off the top of the water and upward through a vertical air/foam extraction tube <b>700</b> that extends through the top of the diffuser shroud <b>702</b>. The air and foam A+F is directed by an air/foam deflector <b>704</b> into a vertical duct <b>708</b> that extends down the left-side panel <b>116</b> and is exhausted near the bottom of the left-side panel <b>116</b>, or may be directed to air filtering or conditioning equipment before the air is released to the atmosphere. While some of the foam F may be blown outside of the air/foam deflector <b>704</b>, it floats on top of the water in the first chamber <b>406</b> and is held in the first chamber <b>406</b> by the first chamber wall <b>324</b>. The water from the diffuser <b>404</b> sinks in the first chamber <b>406</b> and is cooled by the air flowing through the plurality of air-cooling tubes <b>414</b>. A first chamber thermostat <b>706</b> extends through the front panel <b>400</b> and opens when the temperature of the water in the first chamber <b>406</b> is above a preset first chamber temperature limit, similar to thermostats in water-cooled engines. As with the third chamber thermostat <b>514</b>, water from the first chamber thermostat <b>706</b> is directed downward by an elbow for discharge or connection to a drainpipe that leads to a drain in the facility in which the system <b>100</b> is located.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The water exits the first chamber <b>406</b> through the gap <b>410</b> under first chamber wall <b>324</b> and enters the second chamber <b>408</b>. The water then rises in the second chamber <b>408</b> and is cooled by the air flowing through the plurality of air-cooling tubes <b>416</b>. Once the water in the second chamber <b>408</b> rises to the top of the second chamber wall <b>412</b> it enters the third chamber <b>418</b> and mixes with the water already in the third chamber <b>418</b>. The configuration of the first chamber <b>406</b>, the second chamber <b>408</b> and the water flow under the chamber wall <b>324</b> and over the second chamber wall <b>412</b> produces a sediment trap, wherein heavier sediment S collects on the bottom of the first chamber <b>406</b>, and to a more limited extent on the bottom of the second chamber <b>408</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As the water sinks in the third chamber <b>418</b> it is cooled by the air flowing through the plurality of air-cooling tubes <b>526</b> before exiting through the cold-water outlet <b>500</b> to the water make-up port of the liquid ring vacuum pump. As the thermostats <b>514</b>, <b>706</b> drain warm water from their corresponding chamber <b>418</b>, <b>406</b>, respectively, the water level WL in the chambers <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>418</b> drops. As the water level drops below the preset normal water level WL, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the float <b>506</b> also drops, thereby opening the float valve <b>504</b> and allowing cool water to enter the third chamber <b>418</b> via the lake-up water inlet <b>326</b>. The interaction between the float valve <b>504</b> and the thermostats <b>514</b>, <b>706</b> maintains the water exiting through the cold-water outlet <b>500</b> at a cold temperature to protect the vacuum pump from high temperatures.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The electrical system of the water conserving vacuum pump system <b>100</b> is shown in the system wiring diagram <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The system includes a first circuit breaker <b>802</b> that protects an AC-to-DC converter <b>804</b> that produces a DC relay voltage, which may be any suitable DC voltage, for example 24 VDC. The first circuit breaker <b>802</b> is directly connected to a three phase (L1, L2, L3) power source and includes an auxiliary contact <b>828</b> that is wired into the DC circuit. A second circuit breaker <b>806</b> protects the vacuum pump motor <b>314</b> and includes both quick-blow and slow-blow breakers, as well as an auxiliary contact <b>830</b> that is wired into the DC circuit. A soft start for the pump motor <b>314</b> may also be included in the second circuit breaker <b>806</b>. A third circuit breaker <b>810</b> protects the fan motor <b>308</b> and includes both quick-blow and slow-blow breakers, as well as an auxiliary contact <b>832</b> that is wired into the DC circuit. A fourth circuit breaker <b>814</b> protects the solenoid <b>604</b> of the solenoid valve <b>602</b> and includes an auxiliary contact <b>834</b> that is wired into the DC circuit. The second circuit breaker <b>806</b>, the third circuit breaker <b>810</b>, and the fourth circuit breaker <b>814</b> are connected to the three-phase (L1, L2, L3) power source via a main circuit relay <b>818</b> when its relay coil <b>820</b> is energized. The emergency stop switch <b>140</b>, the on/off switch <b>139</b>, the low water float switch <b>826</b>, and the auxiliary contacts <b>828</b>, <b>830</b>, <b>832</b>, <b>834</b> are all wired in series with a control relay coil <b>836</b> between the positive and negative DC voltages. The relay coil <b>820</b> of the main circuit relay <b>818</b> is directly connected to the negative DC voltage and connected to the positive DC voltage through the control relay contact <b>838</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">If none of the circuit breakers <b>802</b>, <b>806</b>, <b>810</b>, <b>814</b> are tripped, then all of their auxiliary contacts <b>828</b>, <b>830</b>, <b>832</b>, <b>834</b> will be closed. If there is an adequate water level in the third chamber <b>418</b>, the low water float switch <b>826</b> will be closed as well. The low water float switch <b>826</b> may be a simple switch, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, such as the float shaft switch <b>522</b>, or may be a relay contact in the lower water limit sensor circuitry <b>608</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. If the emergency stop switch <b>140</b> is also not tripped, then by turning the on/off switch <b>824</b> to the &#x201c;on&#x201d; position, the on/off switch <b>824</b> is closed, completing the circuit to the control relay coil <b>836</b>, thereby energizing the control relay and closing its contact <b>838</b>. When this contact <b>838</b> closes, the relay coil <b>820</b> of the main circuit relay <b>818</b> is energized and its contacts are closed, providing power to the vacuum pump motor <b>314</b>, the fan motor <b>308</b>, and the solenoid <b>604</b> of the solenoid valve <b>602</b>, thereby opening the solenoid valve <b>602</b> and initiating air and water flow through the system <b>100</b>. Should any of the circuit breakers <b>802</b>, <b>806</b>, <b>810</b>, <b>814</b> trip, then the power to the vacuum pump motor <b>314</b>, the fan motor <b>308</b>, and the solenoid <b>604</b> of the solenoid valve <b>602</b> are shut off, thereby protecting all the components in the system <b>100</b>. In addition, should the solenoid valve <b>602</b> remain open after power is removed from its solenoid <b>604</b>, the soft start for the pump motor <b>314</b>, will start the pump motor <b>314</b> slowly to avoid damage to the vanes of the vacuum pump from the water that entered the vacuum pump through the broken solenoid valve while the system is de-energized.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The water-conserving liquid ring vacuum pump system <b>100</b> includes simple setup and operation, as described above. In addition, the system requires very little maintenance, as no filters are employed. Once the system <b>100</b> is turned off, the wet compartment <b>104</b> is easily cleaned by opening the drain <b>118</b> in the bottom wall of the first chamber <b>406</b> to drain the first chamber <b>406</b> and the second chamber <b>408</b>, and opening the drain <b>320</b> in the bottom wall of the third chamber <b>418</b> to drain the third chamber <b>418</b>.

Any water that needs to be made up is supplied by the float valve <b>504</b> when the water level WL in the third chamber <b>418</b> falls below the normal water level. In addition to the ease of keeping the system <b>100</b> clean, the vast majority of external components and the internal components of the wet compartment <b>104</b> can be made of stainless steel that can be sanitized using chemicals and then easily rinsed as described above.
