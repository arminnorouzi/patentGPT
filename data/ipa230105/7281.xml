Higher resolution of a video indicates higher definition of the video and a larger data amount of the video. Because visual effect of a high-resolution video is more vivid than visual effect of a low-resolution video, to ensure optimal user experience, transmission of a high-resolution video in real time is chosen for increasingly more application scenarios such as network live broadcast, online watching of high-definition videos, and high-definition video conferences.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, when transmitting a high-resolution video, most transmission devices usually encode the high-resolution video before transmitting it. However, a manner in which the high-resolution video is transmitted cannot meet a requirement in actual use. Therefore, how to transmit the high-resolution video is an urgent problem to be resolved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of this application provide an image transmission method and apparatus, to transmit a high-resolution video.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of this application provides an image transmission method. The method may be applied to a sender in a transmission system, or may be applied to a chip in the sender. The method in this embodiment of this application is used to resolve a problem that an existing manner of transmitting a high-resolution video causes a large amount of transmitted data of the high-resolution video. Specifically, a first high-resolution image is converted into a first low-resolution image. First resolution of the first high-resolution image is higher than second resolution of the first low-resolution image. The first low-resolution image is encoded to obtain a first bitstream; and a second high-resolution image is obtained. Third resolution of the second high-resolution image is higher than the second resolution, and the second high-resolution image includes high-frequency information of the first high-resolution image and excludes low-frequency information of the first high-resolution image. An image residual between the first high-resolution image and the second high-resolution image is obtained. The image residual is used to reflect the low-frequency information. The image residual is encoded to obtain a second bitstream. The first bitstream and the second bitstream are sent.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It should be understood that the high-frequency information is image detail information and the low-frequency information is image outline information. In the first high-resolution image, the image detail information changes more rapidly than the image outline information.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Optionally, the method may be applied to video transmission, and the first high-resolution image is a frame of image in a video.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the image transmission method provided in this embodiment, the sender may decompose, for transmission, the to-be-transmitted high-resolution image into the low-resolution image and the image residual used to reflect the low-frequency information of the high-resolution image. In this embodiment, a data amount of the image residual used to reflect the low-frequency information of the high-resolution image is far less than a data amount of an image residual used to reflect the low-frequency information and the high-frequency information of the high-resolution image. Therefore, a transmission bit rate required for transmitting the image residual used to reflect the low-frequency information of the high-resolution image in this embodiment is greatly reduced compared with a transmission bit rate required for transmitting the image residual used to reflect the low-frequency information and the high-frequency information of the high-resolution image. In other words, an amount of transmitted data is reduced. In addition, a transmission bit rate required for transmitting the low-resolution image is also far less than a transmission bit rate required for transmitting the high-resolution image. Therefore, in this embodiment, a low transmission bit rate may be used to transmit the high-resolution image between the sender and a receiver. When the method is used to transmit the high-resolution video, the high-resolution video can be transmitted at a low transmission bit rate, transmission bit rates supported by most transmission devices can be met, and an application scenario of transmitting the high-resolution video in real time can be met.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a possible implementation, the obtaining a second high-resolution image may include: decoding the first bitstream to obtain a second low-resolution image; and reconstructing the second high-resolution image by using the second low-resolution image. For example, the second high-resolution image is reconstructed by using the second low-resolution image and a neural network.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a manner in which the second high-resolution image is obtained by using the decoded second low-resolution image, the second high-resolution image obtained by the sender covers encoding and decoding losses of the first low-resolution image in a transmission process. The image residual obtained by the sender based on the second high-resolution image and the first high-resolution image also covers the encoding and decoding losses of the first low-resolution image in the transmission process. In this way, after obtaining the second high-resolution image based on the second low-resolution image, the receiver may eliminate the loss of the first low-resolution image in the transmission process when combining the second high-resolution image and the image residual obtained through decoding. In this case, only a transmission loss of the image residual exists on a transmission path, a loss of a third high-resolution image restored by the receiver is reduced. This improves image quality.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a possible implementation, the first resolution and the third resolution are the same, and the obtaining an image residual between the first high-resolution image and the second high-resolution image may include: subtracting a pixel value of a first pixel in the first high-resolution image from a pixel value of a second pixel in the second high-resolution image corresponding to the first pixel, to obtain a first pixel residual in the image residual. Alternatively, the first resolution is higher than the third resolution, and the obtaining an image residual between the first high-resolution image and the second high-resolution image may include: converting the second high-resolution image into a fourth high-resolution image, where the fourth high-resolution image has the first resolution; and subtracting a pixel value of a first pixel in the first high-resolution image from a pixel value of a third pixel in the fourth high-resolution image corresponding to the first pixel, to obtain a second pixel residual in the image residual. In this manner, the image residual may be obtained in a plurality of manners. This expands an application scenario of the solution.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a possible implementation, the encoding the first low-resolution image may include: encoding the first low-resolution image by using a lossy encoding scheme. In this manner, a transmission bit rate of the first low-resolution image can be reduced, and a transmission bit rate for transmitting the high-resolution image between the sender and the receiver is further reduced.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a possible implementation, the encoding the image residual may include: encoding the image residual by using the lossy encoding scheme.

For example, the first low-resolution image is encoded by using a lossy encoding scheme to obtain a first bitstream. The first bitstream is decoded to obtain a second low-resolution image. A second high-resolution image is reconstructed by using the second low-resolution image. Third resolution of the second high-resolution image is higher than the second resolution. An image residual between the first high-resolution image and the second high-resolution image is obtained. The image residual is encoded to obtain a second bitstream. The first bitstream and the second bitstream are sent.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Optionally, the method may be applied to video transmission, and the first high-resolution image is a frame of image in a video.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the image transmission method provided in this embodiment, in a manner in which the sender obtains the second high-resolution image by using the decoded second low-resolution image, the second high-resolution image obtained by the sender covers encoding and decoding losses of the first low-resolution image in a transmission process.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the transmission system may include a sender and a receiver. The sender is connected to the receiver in a wireless or wired manner. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is merely a schematic diagram.

For ease of description, the sender and the receiver are collectively referred to as transmission devices in the following application document.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The transmission device may be located at a fixed location, or may be mobile. For example, the transmission device may be deployed on land, including indoor or outdoor and handheld or vehicle-mounted devices, may be deployed on a water surface, or may be deployed on an airplane, a balloon, and an artificial satellite in the air.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The transmission device in this embodiment of this application may be a server, a terminal device, or the like.

The terminal device may be a mobile phone, a tablet computer (pad), a computer having a wireless transceiver function, a virtual reality (VR) terminal device, an augmented reality (AR) terminal device, a wireless terminal in industrial control, a wireless terminal in self driving, a wireless terminal in remote medical surgery, a wireless terminal in a smart grid, a wireless terminal in transportation safety, a wireless terminal in a smart city, a wireless terminal in a smart home, or the like.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">An application scenario of the transmission system is not limited in this embodiment of this application. For example, the transmission system may be applied to a video transmission scenario and/or another static image transmission scenario. Although video transmission and video processing are mainly used as an example in the following description, a related technical solution may also be used for transmission and processing of a static image. This is not limited in this embodiment.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">To facilitate understanding of a video transmission procedure of the transmission system, the following first explains and describes some concepts.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">A pixel is a unit in an image. A frame of image includes a plurality of pixels. Each pixel has a specific location and an allocated color value in the image. Locations and color values of all pixels determine how the image is presented. In some embodiments, a pixel may also be referred to as a sample. They are not distinguished in this embodiment of this application.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Data of each pixel (namely, data used to reflect a color value) is related to a format of an image. Currently, common image formats include an RBG format and a YUV format. When the format of the image is the RBG format, each pixel includes data of 3 channels, which are respectively data representing red sensitivity of the image, data representing blue sensitivity of the image, and data representing green sensitivity of the image. When the format of the image is the YUV format, each pixel includes data of 1.5 channels, which are respectively data representing image luminance and data representing image color. It should be understood that a specific format of the image is related to how an image signal processor (ISP) of the sender processes the image. For details, refer to the conventional technology. Details are not described herein.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">A quantity of pixels included in a frame of image is related to resolution of the image. For example, the resolution of the image is 3840&#xd7;2160, and the resolution represents that each row of the image has 3840 pixels horizontally, and each column of the image has 2160 pixels vertically. It should be understood that, when a size of the image is fixed, higher resolution of the image indicates more pixels included in the image, and the image is clearer (or image quality is higher). Correspondingly, the image includes more data.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">A video includes a plurality of consecutive static image frames, and a frame is a frame of image (which may also be referred to as one image). In other words, the video is a continuous image sequence. Therefore, the resolution of the image may also be understood as resolution of the video, and the format of the image may also be understood as a format of the video. In other words, the video includes consecutive static images with same resolution and a same format. Higher resolution of the video indicates higher definition of the video and a larger data amount of the video. For ease of understanding, the following Table 1 provides examples of some common resolution of the video. It should be understood that Table 1 is merely an example, and does not limit the resolution of the video.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Resolution code</entry><entry>Standard</entry><entry>Resolution</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Common video</entry><entry>Standard image format</entry><entry>352 &#xd7; 288</entry></row><row><entry>standard format</entry></row><row><entry>(common intermediate</entry></row><row><entry>format, CIF)</entry></row><row><entry>480p&#x2003;</entry><entry>Digital television system</entry><entry>720 &#xd7; 480</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>standard</entry></row><row><entry>720p&#x2003;</entry><entry>High definition television</entry><entry>1280 &#xd7; 720&#x2002;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>standard</entry></row><row><entry>1080p&#x2003;&#x2002;</entry><entry>High definition television</entry><entry>1920 &#xd7; 1080</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>standard</entry></row><row><entry>2K</entry><entry>Digital cinema system</entry><entry>2048 &#xd7; 1080</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>standard</entry></row><row><entry>4K</entry><entry>Digital cinema system</entry><entry>4096 &#xd7; 2160,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>standard</entry><entry>3840 &#xd7; 2160,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>and 4608 &#xd7; 2592</entry></row><row><entry>8K</entry><entry>Digital cinema system</entry><entry>7680 &#xd7; 4320</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>standard</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">Usually, the high or low value of the resolution of the video is a relative concept. For example, a 2K video is used as an example. Compared with a 1080p video, the 2K video is a high-resolution video. Compared with a 4K video, the 2K video is a low-resolution video. In this embodiment of this application, for ease of description, a video with high resolution and a large data amount is referred to as a high-resolution video such as a 4K video and an 8K video. Therefore, resolution of a high-resolution video involved in subsequent embodiments is higher than resolution of a low-resolution video. For a specific value, refer to the foregoing example, but the specific value is not limited.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of video transmission. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, currently a sender and a receiver usually transmit a high-resolution video in the following manner.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">S<b>201</b>: The sender encodes the to-be-transmitted high-resolution video HR to obtain a bitstream HR_str of the high-resolution video HR. An encoding scheme used by the sender to encode the high-resolution video HR may be a general encoding scheme, for example, an encoding scheme using the H.264 protocol, an encoding scheme using the H.265 protocol, or the like.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">S<b>202</b>: The sender sends the bitstream HR_str to the receiver. Correspondingly, the receiver receives the bitstream HR_str.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">S<b>203</b>: The receiver decodes the bitstream HR_str to obtain a decoded high-resolution video HR_end. In other words, HR_end is a high-resolution video obtained by the receiver. A decoding scheme used when the receiver decodes the bitstream HR_str is related to the encoding scheme used by the sender. For example, the sender uses the encoding scheme of the H.264 protocol, and correspondingly the receiver may use a decoding scheme of the H.264 protocol. The sender uses the encoding scheme of the H.265 protocol, and correspondingly the receiver may use a decoding scheme of the H.265 protocol.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">A transmission bit rate of the video may be shown in the following formula (1):</p><p id="p-0094" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Transmission bit rate=Size of each frame&#xd7;Quantity of frames/Compression ratio&#x2003;&#x2003;(1).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0095" num="0092">The transmission bit rate is a quantity of bits, of the video, transmitted per second, and the transmission bit rate is a bit rate required for sending the video by the sender and a bit rate required for receiving the video by the receiver. A quantity of frames is a quantity of frames, of the video, transmitted per second. The compression ratio is related to the encoding scheme and the resolution of the video. A size of each frame of image may be shown in the following formula (2):</p><p id="p-0096" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Image size=Resolution&#xd7;Quantity of channels&#xd7;Data bit width&#x2003;&#x2003;(2).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0097" num="0093">The quantity of channels may be determined based on a format of the video. For example, if the format of the video is an RBG format, the quantity of channels is 3. If the format of the video is a YUV format, the quantity of channels is 1.5. The data bit width is a quantity of bits occupied by each piece of data of one pixel, and is usually 8 bits.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0094">For example, a 4K video is transmitted in a transmission mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. It is assumed that 30 frames of images in the 4K video may be transmitted per second. Resolution of the 4K video is 3840&#xd7;2160, a format of the 4K video is the YUV format, and each piece of data of one pixel uses an 8-bit width. The sender encodes the 4K video by using the encoding scheme of the H.265 protocol. Usually, a compression ratio of the 4K video encoded by using the encoding scheme of the H.265 protocol can reach 100 times.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0095">In this example, it can be learned from a calculation method of the formula (1) that the following transmission bit rate required for transmitting the 4K video is:</p><p id="p-0100" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(3840&#xd7;2160&#xd7;1.5&#xd7;8)&#xd7;30/100=29859840.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0101" num="0096">To be specific, when the sender sends the 4K video, the transmission bit rate needs to reach 29859840 bits per second (bps), about 28.5 megabits per second (Mbps). Correspondingly, when receiving the 4K video, the receiver also needs to use the transmission bit rate of 28.5 Mbps.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0097">It can be learned from this example that, because a data amount of the high-resolution video is large, a transmission device needs to use a high transmission bit rate (for example, a transmission bit rate greater than 30 Mbps) to transmit the high-resolution video. In other words, an amount of transmitted data is large. However, limited by bandwidth, power consumption, and the like of the transmission device, a transmission bit rate supported by a conventional transmission device ranges from 1 Mbps to 20 Mbps. Consequently, problems such as a long transmission delay, low transmission efficiency, poor image quality, and video freezing that are of a high-resolution video are caused, and an application scenario of transmitting the high-resolution video in real time cannot be met. The application scenario of transmitting the high-resolution video in real time herein may be, for example, network live broadcast, online watching of high-definition videos, and high-definition video conferences.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0098">In addition, when transmitting the high-resolution video in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the transmission device uses a general encoding and decoding protocol. An encoding scheme in the general encoding and decoding protocol is to obtain a high compression ratio by compromising image quality to some extent. Therefore, a loss of the high-resolution video restored by the receiver through decoding is large, degrading user experience of the receiver. Therefore, how to transmit the high-resolution video is an urgent problem to be resolved.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a schematic diagram of frequency domain of an image. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, it is found through image research that a frame of image includes high-frequency information (usually image detail information) and low-frequency information (usually image outline information). After frequency domain conversion is performed on an image, it can be learned that a frequency of the image detail information changes faster, and is higher than a frequency of the image outline information. To be specific, the image detail information changes more rapidly in the image compared with the image outline information. For details, refer to comparison description in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. For details, refer to the following description. In other words, image information with a higher frequency changes faster. Image information with a lower frequency changes slower. A data amount reflecting the image detail information (namely, the high-frequency information) is usually greater than a data amount reflecting the image outline information (namely, the low-frequency information). In some embodiments, the low-frequency information may also be referred to as a low-frequency component, and the high-frequency information may also be referred to as a high-frequency component. It should be noted that a high frequency and a low frequency herein are not fixed frequency bands, but two relative frequencies in a frame of image. In other words, in a frame of image, the higher frequency is referred to as a high frequency, and the lower frequency is referred to as a low frequency. Different images may have different high frequency and low frequency ranges, provided that a frequency of low-frequency information is lower than a frequency of high-frequency information in frequency domain.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0100">In view of this feature, an embodiment of this application provides an image transmission method. A high-resolution image is decomposed, for transmission, into a low-resolution image and an image residual used to reflect low-frequency information of the high-resolution image. Because the low-resolution image and the image residual carry a small amount of data, a transmission bit rate for transmitting a high-definition image can be greatly reduced, that is, an amount of transmitted data is reduced. When the method is used to transmit the high-resolution video, the transmission bit rate of the high-resolution video can also be greatly reduced. This can satisfy an application scenario of transmitting the high-resolution video in real time.

For example, the sender may encode the image residual by using the encoding scheme in the general encoding and decoding protocol, that is, encode the image residual by using the lossy encoding scheme. The sender may also encode the image residual by using an independent encoding scheme, for example, entropy encoding and an autoencoding network. The independent encoding scheme described herein uses a low compression ratio, and a loss of the image quality may be ignored. For example, the compression ratio of the independent encoding scheme may be between 0.5 and 2. In some embodiments, this encoding scheme may also be referred to as lossless encoding. To be specific, the image residual is encoded by using a lossless encoding scheme.

A decoding scheme used by the receiver to decode the first bitstream is related to the encoding scheme used by the sender to encode the first low-resolution image. To be specific, when the sender encodes the first low-resolution image by using an encoding scheme of a specific protocol, the receiver needs to correspondingly decode the first bitstream by using a decoding scheme of the protocol. Details are not described herein again. For example, if the sender encodes the first low-resolution image by using the encoding scheme of the VP8 protocol, correspondingly the receiver may decode the first bitstream by using a decoding scheme of the VP8 protocol. In this case, the second low-resolution image obtained by decoding the first bitstream by the receiver has the second resolution. In other words, the resolution of the second low-resolution image is the same as the resolution of the first low-resolution image.

A manner in which the second high-resolution image is reconstructed by the receiver by using the second low-resolution image is related to a manner in which the second high-resolution image is obtained by the sender. This part of content is described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0124">S<b>409</b>: The receiver decodes the second bitstream to obtain the image residual between the first high-resolution image and the second high-resolution image.

For example, the receiver adds a pixel value of a second pixel in the second high-resolution image to a pixel residual in the image residual corresponding to the second pixel, to obtain a third pixel in the third high-resolution image corresponding to the second pixel. The third high-resolution image may be obtained by combining third pixels. In this case, the third high-resolution image is a high-resolution image obtained by the receiver.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0126">It should be understood that, the foregoing describes, by using an example in which the first resolution of the first high-resolution image is the same as the third resolution of the second high-resolution image, how the sender obtains the image residual and how the receiver obtains the third high-resolution image by using the image residual.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0127">In some embodiments, if the first resolution of the first high-resolution image is different from the third resolution of the second high-resolution image, for example, the first resolution of the first high-resolution image is higher than the third resolution of the second high-resolution image, or the first resolution of the first high-resolution image is lower than the third resolution of the second high-resolution image, the sender may first convert resolution of the two high-resolution images into a same resolution, and then perform subtraction processing.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0128">For example, the sender may first convert the second high-resolution image into a fourth high-resolution image. The fourth high-resolution image has the first resolution. In other words, the resolution of the first high-resolution image is the same as resolution of the fourth high-resolution image. The sender subtracts the pixel value of the first pixel in the first high-resolution image from a pixel value of a third pixel in the fourth high-resolution image corresponding to the first pixel, to obtain a second pixel residual in the image residual.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0129">For another example, the first high-resolution image is converted into a fifth high-resolution image.

The sender subtracts a pixel value of a fourth pixel in the fifth high-resolution image from the pixel value of the second pixel in the second high-resolution image corresponding to the fourth pixel, to obtain a second pixel residual in the image residual. Correspondingly, after obtaining the second high-resolution image by decoding the second bitstream, the receiver first combines the second high-resolution image and the image residual to obtain the fifth high-resolution image. Then, the receiver may perform resolution conversion on the fifth high-resolution image to obtain the third high-resolution image. The sender transmits the first high-resolution image to the receiver.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0130">For example, the receiver may combine the second high-resolution image with the image residual by using the processor <b>31</b> of the receiver to obtain the third high-resolution image. If an image encoding loss is ignored, the third high-resolution image may be the same as the first high-resolution image at the sender. If encoding causes a loss, the third high-resolution image may be different from the first high-resolution image at the sender, and a slight loss occurs. It may be considered that the restored third high-resolution image is approximately the same as the first high-resolution image.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0131">According to the image transmission method provided in this embodiment, the sender may decompose, for transmission, the to-be-transmitted high-resolution image into the low-resolution image and the image residual used to reflect the low-frequency information of the high-resolution image. In this embodiment, a data amount of the image residual used to reflect the low-frequency information of the high-resolution image is far less than a data amount of an image residual used to reflect the low-frequency information and the high-frequency information of the high-resolution image. Therefore, a transmission bit rate required for transmitting the image residual used to reflect the low-frequency information of the high-resolution image in this embodiment is greatly reduced compared with a transmission bit rate required for transmitting the image residual used to reflect the low-frequency information and the high-frequency information of the high-resolution image. In addition, a transmission bit rate required for transmitting the low-resolution image is also far less than a transmission bit rate required for transmitting the high-resolution image. Therefore, in this embodiment, a low transmission bit rate may be used to transmit the high-resolution image between the sender and the receiver. When the method is used to transmit a high-resolution video, the high-resolution video can be transmitted at a low transmission bit rate, transmission bit rates supported by most transmission devices can be met, and an application scenario of transmitting the high-resolution video in real time can be met.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0132">The following describes how the sender obtains the second high-resolution image and how the receiver reconstructs the second high-resolution image by using the second low-resolution image. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of obtaining a second high-resolution image according to an embodiment of this application. The sender in this embodiment reconstructs the second high-resolution image by using the second low-resolution image.

A decoding scheme used by the sender to decode the first bitstream is related to the encoding scheme used by the sender to encode the first low-resolution image. To be specific, when the sender encodes the first low-resolution image by using an encoding scheme of a specific protocol, the first bitstream needs to be correspondingly decoded by using a decoding scheme of the protocol.

Correspondingly, the receiver may reconstruct the second high-resolution image by using the second low-resolution image in a same manner in S<b>408</b>. In a manner in which the second high-resolution image is obtained by using the decoded second low-resolution image, the second high-resolution image obtained by the sender covers encoding and decoding losses of the first low-resolution image in a transmission process. The image residual obtained by the sender based on the second high-resolution image and the first high-resolution image also covers the encoding and decoding losses of the first low-resolution image in the transmission process. In this way, after obtaining the second high-resolution image based on the second low-resolution image, the receiver may eliminate the loss of the first low-resolution image in the transmission process when combining the second high-resolution image and the image residual obtained through decoding. In this case, only a transmission loss of the image residual exists on a path. This reduces a loss (for example, only the loss of the image residual) of a third high-resolution image restored by the receiver, and there is even no loss (for example, a scenario in which the image residual is encoded by using a lossless encoding scheme). This improves the image quality.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0134">Optionally, the sender may use the following manner to reconstruct the second high-resolution image by using the second low-resolution image.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0135">Manner 1: The sender reconstructs the second high-resolution image by using the second low-resolution image and a neural network.

The convolution kernel parameter is used to restrict an operation performed by a convolution kernel. Therefore, the neural network in this embodiment of this application may be implemented in two steps: a first step is to design the network structure, and a second step is to train the neural network to obtain parameters of convolution kernels.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a neural network model according to an embodiment of this application.

The task objective implemented by the neural network in this embodiment is constructing, by using a low-resolution image, a high-resolution image covering image detail information. In other words, the neural network in this embodiment needs to have two functions: one function is to extract the image detail information, and the other function is to perform resolution conversion. Therefore, a network architecture of the neural network in this embodiment may include two parts: one part is a network layer (extraction layer for short) configured to extract the image detail information, and the other part is a network layer (conversion layer for short) configured to convert low resolution into high resolution. It should be understood that both the extraction layer and the conversion layer described herein may include at least one convolutional layer. The extraction layer may be implemented by using 1 to N convolutional layers, and the conversion layer may be implemented by using 1 to M inverse convolutional layers.

In the neural network shown in Table 4, after the partial operation of extracting the image detail information is performed, the operation of converting the low resolution into the high resolution is performed, and then the remaining operation of extracting the image detail information is performed.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0142">Although both neural networks of the two structures can reconstruct the second high-resolution image based on the second low-resolution image, Table 3 shows that the operation of extracting the image detail information is performed based on the low-resolution image, and Table 4 shows that the partial operation of extracting the image detail information in the neural network is performed based on the high-resolution image. Because a data amount of the high-resolution image is greater than a data amount of the low-resolution image, when the neural network shown in Table 4 reconstructs the second high-resolution image based on the second low-resolution image, a larger computation amount is occupied compared with a computation amount of the neural network shown in Table 3, but the extracted image detail information is more accurate. Therefore, in a specific implementation, a specific architecture of the neural network may be selected based on an actual requirement. It may be understood that although the foregoing example provides an example of the neural network applied to the image in the RBG format, a structure of a neural network corresponding to an image in a specific format is not limited in this embodiment of this application.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0143">After the architecture of the neural network is determined, the neural network may be trained, for example, in the following manner, to obtain the parameters of the convolution kernels: First, a training set for training the neural network is constructed, where the training set may include S groups of samples, and each group of samples includes a frame of input image X and a frame of label image Y. The input image X is a low-resolution image, and the label image Y is to-be-achieved target output after the low-resolution image is input into the neural network. S is an integer greater than or equal to 1.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0144">The S groups of samples may be obtained by using S high-resolution images. Specifically, an i<sup>th </sup>high-resolution image is used as an example, resolution conversion may be performed on the i<sup>th </sup>high-resolution image to obtain a low-resolution image corresponding to the i<sup>th </sup>high-resolution image. The low-resolution image is an input image Xi. i is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to S.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0145">In addition, frequency domain conversion (for example, Fourier transform, wavelet transform, or another space-domain-to-frequency-domain method) may be performed on the i<sup>th </sup>high-resolution image to obtain frequency domain information of the i<sup>th </sup>high-resolution image. Then, the frequency domain information of the i<sup>th </sup>high-resolution image may be extracted (for example, the frequency domain information is extracted by using a high-pass filter) to obtain high-frequency information of the i<sup>th </sup>high-resolution image. Finally, the high-frequency information of the i<sup>th </sup>high-resolution image is converted into an image. For example, the high-frequency information may be converted into the image in a frequency-domain-to-space-domain manner. For example, the high-frequency information of the i<sup>th </sup>high-resolution image may be converted into the image through inverse Fourier transform. In this case, the obtained image is a label image Yi of the input image Xi. A frequency of the foregoing high-frequency information is greater than or equal to a preset frequency threshold. It should be understood that the high-frequency information described herein is the image detail information. The preset frequency threshold may be determined based on an actual requirement.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0146">Second, an objective function of the neural network is constructed. An objective of training the neural network is to continuously adjust and optimize the parameters of the convolution kernels, so that an image Y&#x2032; output by the neural network based on the input image X is similar to the label image Y as much as possible. Therefore, the target function of the neural network may be defined as, for example, min&#x2225;Y&#x2212;Y&#x2032;&#x2225;2.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0147">Finally, the neural network is trained by using the constructed training set and the target function, until a value of the target function is less than or equal to a preset threshold. For how to train the neural network by using the constructed training set and the target function, refer to the conventional technology. Details are not described herein. In this case, the trained neural network model may be applied to the sender and the receiver, to reconstruct the second high-resolution image by using the second low-resolution image.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0148">It should be understood that the neural network model described in the foregoing example and the manner of training the neural network model are merely examples.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the method includes the following steps. (1) A sender converts a to-be-transmitted high-resolution video HR to a low-resolution video LR. Resolution of the original high-resolution video HR is higher than resolution of the low-resolution video LR. The to-be-transmitted high-resolution video HR may also be referred to as the original high-resolution video, and the resolution of the to-be-transmitted high-resolution video HR may be, for example, 4K or 8K.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0158">(2) The sender encodes the low-resolution video LR to obtain a bitstream LR_str of the low-resolution video LR. For example, the sender encodes the low-resolution video LR by using a general encoding and decoding protocol.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0159">(3) The sender decodes the bitstream LR_str of the low-resolution video LR to obtain a decoded low-resolution video LR&#x2032;. Resolution of the decoded low-resolution video LR&#x2032; is the same as the resolution of the low-resolution video LR.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0160">(4) The sender inputs the decoded low-resolution video LR&#x2032; to a neural network to obtain a high-resolution video HR_hf output by the neural network. The high-resolution video HR_hf includes high-frequency information of images in the high-resolution video HR, and excludes low-frequency information of the images in the high-resolution video HR.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0161">(5) The sender obtains a video residual Res_lf between the high-resolution video HR and the high-resolution video HR_hf. The video residual Res_lf is used to reflect the low-frequency information of the images in the high-resolution video HR. For example, the resolution of the high-resolution video HR is the same as resolution of the high-resolution video HR_hf. The sender may subtract pixel values of first pixels of the images in the high-resolution video HR from a pixel value of a second pixel in the high-resolution video HR_hf corresponding to the first pixel, to obtain a first pixel residual in the video residual Res_lf.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0162">(6) The sender encodes the video residual Res_lf to obtain a bitstream Res_str of the video residual Res_lf. For example, the sender encodes the video residual Res_lf by using a general encoding and decoding protocol. Alternatively, the sender encodes the video residual Res_lf by using an independent encoding scheme, for example, entropy encoding and an autoencoding network.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0163">(7) The sender sends the bitstream LR_str of the low-resolution video LR and the bitstream Res_str of the video residual Res_lf. Correspondingly, a receiver receives the bitstream LR_str and the bitstream Res_str.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0164">(8) The receiver decodes the bitstream LR_str to obtain the decoded low-resolution video LR&#x2032;. A decoding scheme used by the receiver to decode the bitstream LR_str is related to an encoding scheme used by the sender to encode the low-resolution video LR. To be specific, when the sender encodes the low-resolution video LR by using an encoding scheme of a specific protocol, the receiver needs to correspondingly decode the bitstream LR_str by using a decoding scheme of the protocol. Details are not described herein again.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0165">(9) The receiver inputs the decoded low-resolution video LR&#x2032; to the neural network to obtain the high-resolution video HR_hf output by the neural network. It should be understood that a neural network deployed at the receiver is the same as or at least approximately the same as a neural network deployed at the sender in terms of functions.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0166">(10) The receiver decodes the bitstream Res_str to obtain a decoded video residual Res_lf&#x2032;.

For example, the receiver adds a pixel value of a second pixel in the high-resolution video HR_hf to a pixel residual in the video residual Res_lf&#x2032; corresponding to the second pixel, to obtain a third pixel in the third high-resolution video HR_end corresponding to the second pixel.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0168">Although the foregoing uses an example in which the resolution of the high-resolution video HR is the same as the resolution of the high-resolution video HR_hf to describe how the sender obtains the video residual Res_lf and how the receiver restores the high-resolution video HR_end by using the video residual Res_lf, it should be understood that, when the resolution of the high-resolution video HR is different from the resolution of the high-resolution video HR_hf, the sender may obtain the video residual Res_lf after converting the resolution of one of the videos. Correspondingly, when restoring the high-resolution video HR_end based on the decoded video residual Res_lf&#x2032;, the receiver also needs to perform a corresponding resolution conversion operation. For details, refer to the foregoing description that the first resolution of the first high-resolution image is different from the third resolution of the second high-resolution image, an implementation and a principle thereof are similar.

It should be understood that this part of content is also implemented in the foregoing second manner of &#x201c;reconstructing the second high-resolution image by using the second low-resolution image&#x201d;. An implementation and a principle thereof are similar. Details are not described herein again.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0170">Similarly, transmission of a 4K video is used as an example. In this example, it is assumed that the sender processes the 4K video to obtain a 720p video and a 4K video residual C#. The 4K video residual C# is used to reflect image outline information of images in the 4K video (that is, used to reflect low-frequency information of the images in the 4K video). Compared with a 4K video residual used to reflect the low-frequency information and high-frequency information of the images in the 4K video, the 4K video residual C# includes a small amount of data. Therefore, when the 4K video residual C# in this embodiment is encoded, a large compression ratio may be used, for example, the compression ratio may reach 500 times.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0171">In this example, it can be learned from a calculation method of a formula (1) that the following transmission bit rate required for transmitting the 720p video B is:</p><p id="p-0180" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(1280&#xd7;720&#xd7;1.5&#xd7;8)&#xd7;30/50/1024/1024=6.3 Mbps.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0181" num="0172">A transmission bit rate required for transmitting the 4K video residual C# is:</p><p id="p-0182" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(3840&#xd7;2160&#xd7;1.5&#xd7;8)&#xd7;30/500/1024/1024=5.7 Mbps.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0183" num="0173">A sum of the two transmission bit rates is 12 Mbps. To be specific, when the 4K video is transmitted by using the solution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a transmission bit rate of the sender needs to reach 12 Mbps. Correspondingly, when receiving the 4K video, the receiver also needs to use the transmission bit rate of 12 Mbps.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0174">It can be learned from this example that, when a high-resolution video is transmitted in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, that is, when the high-resolution video is transmitted after being converted into a low-resolution video and a video residual used to reflect low-frequency information of images in the high-resolution video, because a transmission bit rate of the low-resolution video is far lower than a bit rate of the high-resolution video, and a data amount of the video residual used to reflect the low-frequency information of the images in the high-resolution video is small, a high compression ratio may be used for encoding, the high-resolution video can be transmitted by using only a low transmission bit rate, and the required transmission bit rate is within a transmission bit rate range supported by most transmission devices. Therefore, an application scenario of transmitting the high-resolution video in real time can be met, the high-resolution video is transmitted without a delay, and transmission efficiency is improved.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0175">In addition, because the encoded and decoded low-resolution video LR&#x2032; is used at both the sender and the receiver, the high-resolution video HR_hf that includes image detail information of the images in the high-resolution video HR is obtained. Therefore, the high-resolution video HR_hf obtained by the sender is completely the same as the high-resolution video HR_hf obtained by the receiver. Because the sender uses the high-resolution video HR_hf to calculate the video residual, and the receiver uses the decoded video residual to refine the high-resolution video HR_hf, the receiver may eliminate encoding and decoding losses of the low-resolution video LR by using the video residual, so that only encoding and decoding losses of the video residual exist on an entire transmission path, and the encoding and decoding losses of the low-resolution video LR no longer exist on the transmission path. This improves video transmission quality.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0176">The foregoing embodiment focuses on how to decompose, for transmission, a high-resolution image into a low-resolution image and an image residual used to reflect low-frequency information of the high-resolution image, to reduce a transmission bit rate of content of the high-resolution image. In the following, an embodiment of this application further provides another image transmission method. Although the method is also to decompose a high-resolution image into a low-resolution image and an image residual for transmission, the method focuses on how to eliminate a loss in a process of transmitting the low-resolution image. In this embodiment, the transmitted image residual may be an image residual used to reflect low-frequency information of the high-resolution image, an image residual used to reflect low-frequency information and high-frequency information of the high-resolution image, or an image residual used to reflect high-frequency information of the high-resolution image.

The image residual obtained by the sender based on the second high-resolution image and the first high-resolution image also covers the encoding and decoding losses of the first low-resolution image in the transmission process. In this way, after obtaining the second high-resolution image based on the second low-resolution image, the receiver may eliminate the loss of the first low-resolution image in the transmission process when combining the second high-resolution image and the image residual obtained through decoding. In this case, only a transmission loss of the image residual exists on a path. This reduces a loss (for example, only the loss of the image residual) of the third high-resolution image restored by the receiver, and there is even no loss for the third high-resolution image (for example, a scenario in which the image residual is encoded by using the lossless encoding scheme). This improves image quality. When the method is used to transmit the high-resolution video, image quality of the high-resolution video can be improved, and user experience is improved.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0183">To further illustrate the technical effect, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a structure of a transmission apparatus according to an embodiment of this application.
