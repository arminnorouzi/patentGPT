No. 62/988,772 filed on Mar. 12, 2020, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present systems, apparatuses, and methods lie in the field of implantable closure devices. The present disclosure relates to an implantable closure device to seal punctures or holes in Meninges membranes of the spinal cord and brain and prevent leakage of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the soft tissue space (i.e. fat, skin, muscle) that surround the Meninges membranes and CSF system. The disclosure also relates to methods for manufacture and use of the closure devices.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The Meninges are protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. These membranes (the dura, arachnoid, and pia layers as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) encapsulate the CSF to form a conduit that surrounds the spinal cord and the cerebral ventricles. Typically, a needle is used to puncture through the skin and Meninges membranes to gain access to the CSF. When the needle is removed, the hole created does not consistently seal due to the inelastic properties of the membranes, causing CSF leakage into the soft tissue that surrounds these membranes, which is not clinically desirable.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Closure devices exist that are used in the vascular system, for example, access closure devices, PFO closure devices, and ASD closure devices. However, none relate to closure of the Meninges for preventing the leakage of CSF.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, a need exists to overcome the problems with the prior art systems, designs, and processes as discussed above.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The systems, apparatuses, and methods described provide an implantable closure device to seal punctures or holes in meninges membranes of the spinal cord and brain and prevent leakage of the cerebrospinal fluid and methods for manufacture and use of the closure devices that overcome the hereinafore-mentioned disadvantages of the heretofore-known devices and methods of this general type and that provide such features with a unique structure having high efficiency in leakage prevention.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To close the puncture, or access site, the closure device incorporates a superelastic structure having the ability to be deformed into a low-profile shape for delivery into the puncture site then to expand radially to a preformed shape to engage and close the puncture site. This Meninges closure device can also incorporate a porous polymer structure that promotes the healing of the membranes to further reinforce sealing of the puncture site. The delivery and deployment of the closure device is conducted using clinically acceptable visualization techniques (e.g. Fluoroscopic, Endoscope, Computed Tomography Scan).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As used herein, materials that are super-elastic or superelastic include those alloys that belong to the larger family of shape-memory alloys and materials that reversibly deform in an equivalent manner. When mechanically loaded, a superelastic alloy deforms reversibly to very high strains (up to 10%) by the creation of a stress-induced phase. When the load is removed, the new phase becomes unstable and the material regains its original shape. Use of superelastic in regards to materials include those materials and alloys where no change in temperature is needed for the alloy to recover its initial shape. Superelastic devices take advantage of their large, reversible deformation and include antennas, eyeglass frames, and biomedical devices including stents. Nickel titanium (or Nitinol&#xae;) is an example of an alloy exhibiting superelasticity.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">With the foregoing and other objects in view, there is provided, a system for sealing punctures in Meninges membranes, comprising a hollow needle assembly comprising a hollow needle sheath assembly having a proximal end, a distal end, a sheath hub, and an outer diameter, and defining a sheath lumen extending from the proximal end to the distal end, and a needle having a needle hub and a shape substantially corresponding to the sheath lumen to traverse through the sheath lumen from the proximal end and out the distal end. The system includes an implantable, puncture-sealing, closure device comprising a set of first struts of a superelastic material that is expandable and contractable, the first struts having a steady state extended within a first strut plane, the first struts together defining a first center joint, a set of second struts of a superelastic material that is expandable and contractable, the second struts having a steady state extended within a second strut plane substantially parallel to the first strut plane, the second struts together defining a second center joint, and a plug segment. The plug segment is of a superelastic material that is expandable and contractable, defines a longitudinal axis between the first and second center joints, has a first end connected to the first center joint and a second end opposite the first end connected to the second center joint such that, in an uncompressed steady state, the first and second sets of struts are substantially parallel to one another, has a height between approximately 240 microns and approximately 300 microns, and has a steady state that, when uncompressed in a radial direction, is between 1.5 and 3 times the diameter of the needle sheath. The closure device is collapsible to fit and slide within the sheath lumen.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Generally, an implantable closure device for sealing an opening through a biologic tissue membrane against leakage of biological fluid is provided. The closure device includes a fluid sealing plug configured to be positioned at least partially within the opening through a biologic tissue membrane, and at least one retainer section configured to secure the fluid sealing plug at least partially within the opening.

The distal retainer section may include superelastic wire. The proximal retainer section may include a retainer structure including a plurality of expandable struts forming the proximal retainer section, and the expandable struts may be arranged radially to the longitudinal axis of the closure device.

In the implanted configuration, a diameter of the distal retainer section may be greater than a diameter of the fluid sealing plug. In the implanted configuration, the diameter of the distal retainer section may be about 1.25 to about 3.0 times a diameter of the opening and the diameter of the fluid sealing plug. In an implanted configuration, the distal retainer section may be disposed generally in a plane oriented substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the closure device.

The distal retainer section cover may include a porous polymer material. The closure device may include a proximal retainer section cover at least partially covering the proximal retainer section. The proximal retainer section cover may include a porous polymer material.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the closure device may include a porous polymer material within the fluid sealing plug. The porous polymer material may be coupled to one or both ends of the fluid sealing plug. The porous polymer material may include a plurality of fibers. The implantable closure device may include a marker configured to be detectable using a medical imaging technique.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another embodiment, an implantable closure device for sealing an opening through a biologic tissue membrane against leakage of biological fluid is provided. The implantable closure device is reconfigurable between a low-profile delivery configuration and an implanted configuration. The closure device includes a fluid sealing plug including superelastic wire and configured to be positioned at least partially within the opening through a biologic tissue membrane. The closure device also includes a plurality of retainer sections including superelastic wire and configured to secure the fluid sealing plug at least partially within the opening. The retainer sections include a distal retainer section including a plurality of radially oriented expandable struts configured to be disposed distally on the biologic tissue membrane, and a proximal retainer section including a plurality of radially oriented expandable struts configured to be disposed proximally on the biologic tissue membrane.

The fluid sealing plug is coupled to the proximal retainer section at the proximal end of the sealing plug. The closure device has a longitudinal axis defined generally as a centerline of the liquid sealing plug passing generally from the distal end of the liquid sealing plug to the proximal end of the liquid sealing plug through the center of the liquid sealing plug. The distal retainer expandable struts are arranged radially to the longitudinal axis of the closure device. The proximal retainer expandable struts are arranged radially to the longitudinal axis of the closure device.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an alternate embodiment, a closure device delivery system including a closure device and a loading device is provided.

The method includes deploying a distal retainer portion of a closure device distal to a distal surface of a biologic tissue membrane through an opening through the biologic tissue membrane, deploying a fluid sealing plug coupled to the distal retainer portion of the closure device at least partially into the opening, and deploying a proximal retainer portion coupled to the fluid sealing plug of the closure device proximal to a proximal surface of the biologic tissue membrane.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, deploying the distal retainer portion of the closure device includes transitioning the distal retainer portion from a delivery configuration to an implanted configuration.

Referring now to the figures of the drawings in detail and first, particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, there is shown a first exemplary embodiment of a Meninges superelastic closure device <b>1</b> in its pre-formed shape. This closure device incorporates two sets (distal and proximal ends of the device) of superelastic struts <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>. Extending between these struts is a superelastic plug segment <b>3</b>. The struts <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>are used for securing the closure device between the inner and outer surfaces of the Meninges while the plug segment <b>3</b> is used to seal the puncture through the three membrane layers. Strut lengths may range from 1.25&#xd7; to 3&#xd7; the diameter of the Meninges hole. The entire device is formed using superelastic wire (e.g., a nickel-titanium alloy such as Nitinol) configured to form these features. The size and number of wires used to create the device are configured to allow deployment through devices/instruments that are used to gain access to the cerebrospinal fluid space. The distal end of the wires are joined by a welding or bonding process (e.g., laser welding, adhesive encapsulation, polymer or metallic feature that accepts the individual wires) to form the distal wire joint <b>4</b> that provides a radiused feature to minimize trauma to any adjacent anatomical feature near or opposing the puncture site. The proximal end of the wires is also configured to be assembled and joined into a release housing <b>5</b> feature using similar methods as the distal wire joint <b>4</b>. The release housing <b>5</b> allows for a controlled delivery and deployment of the closure device <b>1</b>. The number of struts <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>on both the distal and proximal ends of the device may vary from two struts up to a maximum of thirty-two struts depending upon the size of hole to be closed and size of the delivery device. The sizes of wires used to form the device may also vary from 0.0127 mm (0.0005&#x2033;) in diameter to 0.127 mm (0.0050&#x2033;) in diameter to allow for the tailoring of the retention force to dislodge the device.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a cross-section of the closure device <b>1</b> in its deployed state across the three layers of the Meninges. As shown, the distal set of struts <b>2</b><i>a </i>and distal wire joint <b>4</b> reside in the CSF <b>9</b> space with the distal struts <b>2</b><i>a </i>in contact with the Pia mater <b>6</b> of the Meninges. The plug segment <b>3</b> then spans between the three layers of the Meninges and expands radially to create the seal through the individual membrane layers, the Pia mater <b>6</b>, the Arachnoid mater <b>7</b>, and the Dura mater <b>8</b>. It is desirable to have the plug segment <b>3</b> expand to a minimum of 0.75&#xd7; to account for any retraction of the membranes as the needle/access device is removed. Maximum expansion of the plug segment <b>3</b> is determined experimentally by the onset of a tear in the Meninges layers (estimated to be approximately 2&#xd7; the size of the resultant puncture hole). Also shown are the relative positioning of the proximal features of the closure device with the proximal struts <b>2</b><i>b </i>in contact with the Dura mater <b>8</b> and the release housing <b>5</b> extending into the soft tissue matter <b>10</b>. The struts <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i>may also be formed to allow for additional deflection towards the Meninges membranes for further securement of the closure device to the membrane layers. This deflection may vary from a line drawn perpendicular to the axis of the closure device <b>54</b> to an inward angle of up to approximately 15 degrees per strut.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0105">The remaining figures are used to demonstrate the method and accessory devices that are used to deploy the closure device. As mentioned above, deployment of the device is conducted using clinically acceptable visualization techniques and the closure device and delivery accessories include materials or geometric features that aid in the preferred visualization technique.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates the use of a needle assembly <b>11</b> inserted into the lumen <b>55</b> of the closure device's delivery sheath assembly <b>14</b>. The inner diameter of the sheath assembly <b>14</b> is designed to fit closely to the outer diameter of the needle assembly <b>11</b> while minimizing the gap in the annulus space between the devices (approximately 0.0254 mm (0.001&#x2033;) to 0.127 mm (0.005&#x2033;)). This fit is important to ensure minimal entrapment of the membrane layers during advancement while allowing for easy removal of the needle assembly <b>11</b> from the sheath assembly <b>14</b>. As shown, both assemblies are advanced together through the soft tissue and Meninges membranes until the needle tip <b>12</b> and the sheath tip <b>15</b> reside within the CSF <b>9</b> space. The relative distance between the needle tip <b>12</b> and the sheath tip <b>15</b> is controlled by the length of the sheath assembly <b>14</b> and the engagement of a sheath hub <b>16</b> and a needle hub <b>13</b> at the surface where the two hubs <b>16</b>, <b>13</b> are in contact, the needle/sheath interface <b>17</b>. It is desirable to position the sheath tip <b>15</b> just proximal to the lumen on the needle assembly <b>11</b>. It is noted that the leading edge(s) of the sheath tip <b>15</b> should be rounded (or tapered) to facilitate insertion through the soft tissue and Meninges membranes.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a constrained closure device <b>19</b> in preparation for insertion into the sheath assembly <b>14</b> (not shown). To constrain the constrained closure device <b>19</b>, a loading device <b>25</b> is used. This loading device has a lumen <b>56</b> extending through its body with a size that is the same as, or minimally smaller than, the lumen <b>55</b> of the sheath assembly <b>14</b>. The superelastic properties of the closure device <b>1</b> are now appreciated with the deformation of the distal and proximal constrained struts <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>configured to be opposed within the loading device <b>25</b>. This positioning of the struts <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>is important to ensure that each set of struts <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>will correctly engage the Meninges Pia membrane <b>6</b> and Dura membrane <b>8</b>, respectively, during deployment of the constrained closure device <b>19</b>. Also, spanning the distance between the two sets of constrained struts <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>resides the feature of the constrained closure device <b>19</b> as a constrained expandable plug segment <b>21</b>. The superelastic properties of the material used to construct the constrained closure device <b>19</b> is evident by the deformation of the features that comprise the device into an easily constrained state within the loading device <b>25</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> additionally discloses a pusher assembly <b>22</b>, which is configured to engage the constrained closure device <b>19</b> at the release housing <b>5</b> and control movement of the closure device <b>19</b> through each phase of deployment. The pusher assembly <b>22</b> includes a release wire <b>23</b> and a pusher stop <b>24</b>. The release wire <b>23</b> is generally comprised of a metallic structure (or rigid polymer structure) that allows the constrained closure device <b>19</b> to be advanced and retracted with approximately 1:1 movement between the physician's hand and the tip (the most distal end of the distal set of the struts <b>20</b><i>a</i>) of the closure device <b>19</b>. The pusher stop <b>24</b> may present as a removable component or be configured to include the ability to slide on the release wire <b>23</b>, or both. It is important to note that the pusher stop <b>24</b> must remain in its predetermined assembled position until it is deliberately or intentionally removed/repositioned by the physician.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the needle assembly <b>11</b> (not shown) removed from the sheath assembly <b>14</b> and engages distal edge features of the loading device distal end <b>57</b> into the cavity of the sheath hub <b>16</b> until the sheath/loading device interface <b>26</b> is created. It is important to maintain the position of the sheath tip <b>15</b> within the CSF <b>9</b> space while the sheath assembly <b>14</b> and loading device <b>25</b> are assembled. It is also important to note that, when creating this sheath/loading device assembly, all features of the constrained closure device <b>19</b> must remain housed within the lumen of the loading device <b>25</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> also depicts initiation of deployment of the constrained closure device <b>19</b>. To begin, the sheath assembly <b>14</b> and loading device <b>25</b> relative positioning must be held constant in their assembled positions, again with the sheath tip <b>15</b> in the CSF. The pusher assembly <b>22</b> is then slowly advanced to initiate the movement of the constrained closure device <b>19</b> towards the lumen <b>55</b> of the sheath assembly <b>14</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the constrained closure device <b>19</b> advanced entirely into the lumen <b>55</b> of the sheath assembly <b>14</b> by advancement of only the pusher assembly <b>22</b>. With the constrained closure device <b>19</b> now residing within the sheath assembly <b>14</b>, the loading device <b>25</b> may now be removed from the sheath hub <b>16</b> and set aside. When advancing the constrained closure device <b>19</b> into the sheath assembly <b>14</b>, it is important to maintain the position of the sheath tip <b>15</b> within the CSF <b>9</b> as shown.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0109">A first step in the deployment of the constrained closure device <b>19</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. As the pusher assembly <b>22</b> is slowly advanced, the extension of the distal expandable struts <b>2</b><i>a </i>open as they exit the sheath tip <b>15</b> and return to their originally pre-formed position. Once the distal set of struts <b>2</b><i>a </i>have expanded, their relative positioning to the Pia membrane <b>6</b> is determined by the distance the sheath tip <b>15</b> extends into the CSF <b>9</b> and original shape of the distal struts <b>2</b><i>a</i>. To ensure that only the distal strut section <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the constrained closure device <b>19</b> is deployed, the pusher stop <b>24</b> is pre-positioned on the release wire <b>23</b> so that the pusher stop <b>24</b> engages the sheath hub <b>16</b>, thereby preventing further advancement of the remaining features of the constrained closure device <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows the distal struts <b>2</b><i>a </i>in contact with the Pia membrane <b>6</b>. This positioning is accomplished by holding the relative positioning of the sheath assembly <b>14</b> and the pusher assembly <b>22</b> constant, then slowly retracting both assemblies <b>14</b>, <b>22</b> until resistance of the distal struts <b>2</b><i>a </i>engaging the Pia membrane <b>6</b> is felt (and observed).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates deployment of the expandable plug segment <b>3</b> and the proximal expandable struts <b>2</b><i>b</i>.

Once the pusher stop <b>24</b> has been moved to an appropriate position, the delivery sheath assembly <b>14</b> may be slowly retracted, while holding stable the position of the pusher assembly <b>22</b> until the expandable plug segment <b>3</b> and proximal set of expandable struts <b>2</b><i>b </i>have exited the sheath assembly <b>14</b>.
