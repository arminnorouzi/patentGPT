As a field flow fractionator, in addition to a centrifugal field flow fractionator, an asymmetric field flow fractionator (see, for example, Patent Document 1 listed below) or the like is known. In a field flow fractionator, by applying a field to a liquid sample in a flow path, the particles in the liquid sample are classified, and the classified particles in the liquid sample are detected by a detector.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When applying a field to a liquid sample in a flow path of a field flow fractionator, the particles in the liquid sample are likely to adhere to the flow path. Therefore, by calculating the recovery rate of the particles in the liquid sample, the validity of the analysis result is determined based on the recovery rate. The above-described recovery rate is obtained by dividing the peak area (the value of the numerator) in a case where a field is applied by the peak area (the value of the denominator) of the detection intensity in a case where a field is not applied.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As described above, in order to calculate the recovery rate of the particles in the liquid sample, it is necessary to perform the measurement in a state in which a field is not applied to the liquid sample. As a method of performing the measurement without applying a field to a liquid sample, for example, there are a first method and a second method. In the first method, a measurement is performed without applying a field to a liquid sample passing through a flow path in a field flow fractionator. In the second method, a measurement is performed by bypassing a liquid sample without making the liquid sample pass through a flow path in a field flow fractionator.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the first method, the measurement is simply performed without applying a field to a liquid sample, and therefore, there is an advantage that a configuration change, such as, e.g., addition of piping, is not required. However, even in a case where no field is applied to a liquid sample, the particles in the liquid sample passing through the flow path in the field flow fractionator adhere to the flow path, and therefore, there is a possibility that the recovery rate cannot be accurately calculated.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, in the above-described second method, the liquid sample does not pass through the flow path in the field flow fractionator, and therefore, the particles in the liquid sample do not adhere to the flow path. Therefore, the value of the denominator when calculating the recovery rate becomes an accurate value, and the recovery rate can be accurately calculated.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2014-518761</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A liquid sample passing through a flow path in a field flow fractionator is diluted in the flow path and reaches a detector. This is because the flow path in the field flow fractionator has a relatively large capacity. That is, a mobile phase is supplied to the flow path in the field flow fractionator at a constant flow rate, while the quantity of the sample injected into the mobile phase is constant. Therefore, the liquid sample is diluted in the flow path having a relatively large capacity, and then the classified particles in the liquid sample reach the detector.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the above-described second method, the liquid sample is bypassed without passing through the flow path in the field flow fractionator and detected by the detector, and therefore, the liquid sample is hardly diluted. For this reason, the detection signal from the detector may sometimes be saturated. It is conceivable to decrease the sensitivity of the detector to prevent the saturation of the detection signal from the detector. However, in this case, when the particles in the liquid sample are classified by applying a field to the liquid sample in the flow path, the classified particles in the liquid sample may not be detected by the detector.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As described above, in the second method, the detection signal from the detector may be saturated, and therefore, the recovery rate may not be calculated within the dynamic range of the detector. In order to avoid such a problem, it is conceivable to use a detector with a wide dynamic range. There, however, arises a new problem that the production cost of the device increases.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention has been made in view of the above-described circumstances. An object of the present invention is to provide an analysis system capable of preventing saturation of a detection signal from a detector without using a detector with a wide dynamic range.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">(1) An analysis system according to the present invention is provided with a mobile phase supply section, a sample injection device, a sample injection device, a field flow fractionator, a detector, a bypass flow path, and a flow path switching unit. The mobile phase supply section is configured to supply a mobile phase. The sample injection device is configured to inject a sample into the mobile phase supplied from the mobile phase supply section to produce a liquid sample. The field flow fractionator is configured to classify the particles in the liquid sample by applying a field to the liquid sample supplied from the sample injection device. The detector is configured to detect the particles in the liquid sample classified by the field flow fractionator. The bypass flow path is configured to supply the liquid sample from the sample injection device to the detector without via the field flow fractionator. The flow path switching unit is configured to switch a flow path to guide the liquid sample from the sample injection device to the field flow fractionator or the bypass flow path. The bypass flow path is provided with a concentration adjusting device for adjusting a concentration of the liquid sample supplied from the sample injection device. In a case where a sample with the same quantity as the sample supplied to the field flow fractionator is supplied to the bypass flow path, the concentration adjusting device dilutes the sample supplied to the bypass flow path such that a detection signal from the detector falls within a dynamic range at the time of analysis.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to such a configuration, it is possible to adjust the concentration of the liquid sample supplied to the detector via the bypass flow path by the concentration adjusting device provided in the bypass flow path. Even in a case where a sample with the same quantity as the sample supplied to the field flow fractionator is supplied to the bypass flow path at the time of analysis, the sample is diluted by the concentration adjusting device so that the detection signal from the detector falls within the dynamic range. This prevents the saturation of the detection signal from the detector without using a detector having a wide dynamic range.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">(2) The above-described analysis system may be further provided with an operation unit. The operation unit is configured to calculate a recovery rate of the particles in the liquid sample based on: a detection signal from the detector in a case where the liquid sample is supplied to the field flow fractionator and a field is applied; and a detection signal from the detector in a case where a sample with the same quantity as the sample supplied to the field flow fractionator is supplied to the bypass flow path.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">With such a configuration, it is possible to accurately calculate the recovery rate of the particles in the liquid sample based on the detection signal detected within the dynamic range of the detector.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">(3) The concentration adjusting device may include a buffer section. The buffer section has a capacity that allows the detection signal from the detector to fall within a dynamic range at the time of analysis in a case where a sample with the same quantity as the sample supplied to the field flow fractionator is supplied to the bypass flow path at the time of analysis.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to such a configuration, with a simple configuration in which only the buffer section is provided in the concentration adjusting device provided in the bypass flow path, it is possible to prevent the saturation of the detection signal from the detector in a case where a sample with the same quantity as the sample supplied to the field flow fractionator is supplied to the bypass flow path at the time of analysis.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">(4) A capacity of the buffer section may be the same or substantially the same as a capacity of the flow path of the liquid sample in the field flow fractionator.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to such a configuration, by diluting the sample at the buffer section having the same or substantially the same capacity of the flow path of the liquid sample in the field flow fractionator, it is possible to increase the intensity of the detection signal from the detector within the dynamic range at the time of analysis in a case where a sample with the same quantity as the sample supplied to the field flow fractionator is supplied to the bypass flow path. Therefore, it is possible to more accurately calculate the recovery rate of the particles in the liquid sample.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">(5) The capacity of the buffer section may be a capacity that allows the peak intensity of the detection signal from the detector to be the same or substantially the same as that at the time of analysis in a case where a sample with the same quantity as the sample supplied to the field flow fractionator is supplied to the bypass flow path at the time of analysis.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to such a configuration, in a case where a same with the same quantity as the sample supplied to the field flow fractionator is supplied to the bypass flow path at the time of analysis, the peak intensity of the detection signal from the detector can be set to the same level at the time of analysis and can increase the intensity of the detection signal from the detector within the dynamic range. Therefore, it is possible to more accurately calculate the recovery rate of the particles in the liquid sample.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">(6) The concentration adjusting device may be configured to dilute the liquid sample by mixing the mobile phase with the liquid sample supplied to the bypass flow path.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to such a configuration, by mixing the mobile phase with the liquid sample supplied to the bypass flow path, it is possible to arbitrarily adjust the concentration of the liquid sample supplied to the detector via the bypass flow path according to the quantity of the mobile phase to be mixed. Thus, in a case where a sample with the same quantity as the sample supplied to the field flow fractionator is supplied to the bypass flow path at the time of analysis, it is possible to adjust the detection signal from the detector to an optimum intensity within a dynamic range.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Effects of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the present invention, even in a case where a liquid sample with the same concentration as the liquid sample supplied to the field flow fractionator is supplied to the bypass flow path at the time of analysis, the liquid sample is diluted by the concentration adjusting device provided in the bypass flow path such that the detection signal from the detector falls within the dynamic range. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the saturation of the detection signal from the detector without using a detector with a wide dynamic range.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing a configuration example of an analysis system equipped with a centrifugal field flow fractionator according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an analysis system in a state in which a rotary valve has been switched from the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic front view showing a configuration example of a centrifugal field flow fractionator.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing another example of a concentration adjusting device.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing a configuration example of an analysis system according to another embodiment.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the analysis system in a state in which a first valve and a second valve have been switched from the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">EMBODIMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0011" level="2">1.
