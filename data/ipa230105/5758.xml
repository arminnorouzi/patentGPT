Meanwhile, the needs for enhancement in image quality of a camera are also high, and it is also necessary to achieve increase in pixel count and in frame rate in order to implement the enhancement in image quality for a solid-state imaging device. However, as the pixel count or the frame rate increases, also the amount of image data to be processed increases, and it becomes necessary to speed up output data of the solid-state imaging device. Such speeding up of output data increases the number of wires inside the package and increases the package size. In this regard, if an effort is made to reduce the package size by thinning the wires inside the package or by reducing the distance between the wires, then electromagnetic waves interfere with each other between the wires, causing noise to be generated. Therefore, routing of wires becomes long, and transmission loss of a signal occurs. Additionally, since terminals of the package become small, such a problem occurs that connection to an external substrate becomes difficult. Therefore, it has been proposed to place an antenna for transmission and reception inside a solid-state imaging device in the form of a CSP such that transmission and reception of data to and from an external substrate are performed by wireless communication (for example, refer to PTL 1).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="2">[PTL 1]</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2014-170811</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problems</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, according to the conventional technology described above, since an antenna is provided at part of a rewiring layer of the CSP, the antenna cannot be increased in size, and there is the possibility that the antenna installation area may be limited. Further, there is the possibility that radio waves from the antenna interfere with circuitry inside the solid-state imaging device, resulting in the possibility that transmission and reception to and from an external substrate may become unstable.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present technology has been created taking such a situation as described above into consideration, and it is an object of the present technology to eliminate restrictions in placement of an antenna for performing transmission and reception of a signal by wireless communication when the antenna is used together with a CSP.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problems</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present technology has been made to solve the problems described above, and a first aspect of the present technology is a semiconductor device including a chip size package and a substrate. The chip size package includes a semiconductor element and a connection portion that electrically connects the semiconductor element and an outside to each other. The substrate includes an antenna connected to the connection portion for performing transmission and reception of a signal by wireless communication.

Therefore, a package free from a problem regarding solder mounting can be realized while it is a package of a size equivalent to that of a semiconductor chip. Further, since the image data <b>20</b> of the imaging device can wirelessly be transmitted to and received from the external substrate <b>310</b>, there is no need to provide wires to establish connection to the external substrate <b>310</b>, so that there is no need to increase the wiring density in the package. Therefore, noise by interference of electromagnetic waves, which is caused by reduction in wiring distance in the package, can be reduced, and also routing of the wires can be shortened. Consequently, the transmission loss of a signal can also be reduced. Further, since it is possible to perform package assembly in a state of a wafer size of the solid-state imaging element <b>110</b>, the imaging device can be manufactured at a low cost.
