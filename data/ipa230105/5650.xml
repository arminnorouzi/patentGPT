Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a nano spintronic device using the spin current of a ferromagnetic material and a heavy metal channel. More particularly, the present invention relates to a spintronic device using a spin current flowing in a ferromagnetic material and a heavy metal channel, in which current flows in a pinned layer as well as in a channel so that switching in a free layer can be easily performed with a smaller intensity of current.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention was supported by the National Research and Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (2019M3F3A1A02071509), a National Research Council of Science &#x26; Technology (NST) grant (CAP-16-01-KIST), KIST Institutional Program (2E30600).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, a technique of using a spintronic element that stores information by controlling the magnetization direction of a magnetic material has been widely used.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A nano spintronic device using a magnetic material features non-volatility and is one of the promising next-generation information processing devices because it can control information at low power and high speed. The non-volatility of the spintronic element allows the supply of power to circuits that are not involved in a logic operation to be cut off each time the logical operation is performed, thereby lowering standby power and enabling low-power high-efficiency logic operation, a reset function, and high-speed arithmetic operation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The basic operational principle of a spintronic device is to control spin, which is an intrinsic physical quantity of electrons, with an electrical signal. This requires efficient writing of information by controlling the magnetization direction in a magnetic material with an electrical signal and fast and accurate reading of magnetization information electrically. To this end, the spintronic element typically uses a spin-torque technology, which is a collective term for a spin-transfer torque (STT) and a spin-orbit torque (SOT), for magnetization switching, and a magnetoresistance effect such as a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect and a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect to read magnetization information from a magnetic material.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a conventional spin-orbit torque memory, switching is performed in a free layer by the spin Hall effect occurring in a channel. A magnetic junction channel stores information on the basis of a resistance value difference between a state in which the magnetization directions of a pinned layer and a free layer are parallel and a state in which the magnetization directions are antiparallel. When the magnetization directions are parallel, the resistance value is relatively small, whereas when the magnetization directions are antiparallel, the resistance value is relatively large. In general, the pinned layer is used to read the magnetization value of the free layer. Therefore, a relatively large voltage is required for switching for storing magnetization information in the free layer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, Korean Patent Application Publication No. 10-2018-0045302 (Patent Document 1) discloses a spin synapse device using a spin orbit torque and an operation method thereof. The spin synapse device includes: an electrode formed on a substrate; a free layer formed on the electrode and having a movable magnetic domain wall that moves according to a spin orbit torque; a tunnel barrier layer made of a non-magnetic material and formed on the free layer; a first pinned layer formed on the tunnel barrier layer and having a fixed magnetization direction; a spacer layer formed on the first pinned layer; and a second pinned layer formed on the spacer layer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the case of the device disclosed in Patent Document 1, since the free layer in which the magnetic domain wall movement occurs according to the spin orbit torque is present, there is an advantage that the magnetization of the free layer can be reversed with a lower intensity of current than a magnetic element using a spin transfer torque. However, since the device has a structure in which the spin orbit torque is generated only at the interface between the electrode and the free layer, there is a problem in that a relatively large voltage needs to be applied to the electrode for the magnetization reversal in the free layer.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention has been made to solve the problems occurring in the related art described above. According to the present invention, by enabling current to flow not only in a channel but also in a pinned layer, torque is generated in both the upper portion and the lower portion of a free layer so that switching can be easily performed in the free layer with a smaller intensity of current. The objective of the present invention is to provide a nano spintronic device using the spin current of a ferromagnetic material and the spin current of a heavy metal channel.</p><p id="p-0012"
