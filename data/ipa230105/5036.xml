id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Apparatus and associated methods relate to presenting for selection services comprising at least one bundled set of healthcare services to be performed separately by respective providers, determining a bundle price for the at least one bundled set of healthcare services, and in response to receiving payment in an amount of the bundle price, generating a purchase data record selectively redeemable to receive each of the at least one bundled set of healthcare services, and transmitting a unique confirmation number generated for the purchase data record. One or more service of the bundled set may be a dental or veterinary service.

Some medical services may help improve or maintain a patient's health, based on disease prevention, diagnosis, or treatment. The practice of medicine encompasses medical procedures performed for a patient, which may include both preventive care and treatment. Medical service providers include doctors, hospitals, and health insurers. A provider may offer medical services to patients by provisioning medical resources such as, for example, laboratory, imaging, treatment, or surgical facilities, to provide the services. Some medical services may require specially trained or licensed medical professionals. For example, a medical practice providing diagnosis and treatment for joint pain may provide medical services through the work of an orthopedic specialist. In some scenarios, patient access to a specialized professional or facility may be limited by cost, or availability. Some specialized medical professionals and related facilities may be scarce.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A medical practice may also limit the medical procedures offered to patients based on the availability of specialized professionals and facilities at a given time or location as increasingly seen with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the services offered to a patient may be determined based on allocating surgeons to various surgical facility locations at specific times. Services supplied to patients may be limited to the allocated medical professionals and facilities, even when medical service demand exceeds supply at a given location or time. A medical practice providing many types of medical services may expend significant resources adapting the offered services to demand as cost and demand change. Some medical practices may fail to capture potential revenue lost when resources to provide medical services are underutilized relative to medical service demand.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The price of healthcare services varies depending on specialty, procedure, and physician practice. In the United States, many patients do not have access to a simple way to shop and compare the price of common medical procedures. Due to the current managed care-based payor system in the US, the cost of treatment is often determined by managed care organizations.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">These managed care organizations have specific formularies for drugs and procedures designed specifically to patients' individual health plans, which restrict the drugs and procedures available to patients in their plans. Patients have historically had no access to these price lists or formularies and have had very few tools to assist them in finding and comparing health care services or predetermining the cost of a procedure. Currently prospective patients who chose to compare medical costs are forced to conduct extensive, often inefficient, and time-consuming research to compare medical procedures prior to treatment.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The rising cost of healthcare is having a dramatic effect on the U.S. healthcare system. Healthcare costs continue to outpace pace inflationary growth, provider reimbursement rates continue to fall, and the cost of patient insurance premiums are increasing. To lower monthly premium costs, many patients are choosing to purchase (and employers are choosing to offer) high deductible health plans as an alternative to traditional higher premium PPO health plans.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">These high deductible plans require patients to pay cash payments for medical services until the high deductible is satisfied, and once this deductible has been met, the insurance carrier begins to cover medical costs. As a result, many patients are seeing exponential increases in out-of-pocket expenses for medical procedures and services. In addition to more patients selecting high deductible plans, many patients cannot afford increased payments and are becoming uninsured or underinsured. As the number of patients who are uninsured, underinsured, or on high deductible plans grows, the need for a mechanism that allows patients to find discounted medical services increases and an efficient payment system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Herein presented is an apparatus and associated methods for presenting users a selection of at least one bundled set of healthcare services provided discretely and/or individually by a plurality of respective providers, determining a bundle price for the bundled set of healthcare services, receiving payment for the user selected bundled set, generating a purchase data record selectively redeemable by the user to receive each of the bundled healthcare services in the bundled set, transmitting a unique confirmation number generated for the purchase data record to track the redemption status of the purchase data record, disbursing payment allocated from the received payment to the plurality of respective providers and updating the redemption status of the purchase data record as each of the plurality of services of the bundled set are redeemed.

Further, the terms and phrases used herein are not intended to be limiting but rather to provide an understandable description of the invention.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As stated above, herein presented is an apparatus and associated methods for presenting users a selection of at least one bundled set of healthcare services provided discretely and/or individually by a plurality of respective providers, determining a bundle price for the bundled set of healthcare services, receiving payment for the user selected bundled set, generating a purchase data record selectively redeemable by the user to receive each of the bundled healthcare services in the bundled set, transmitting a unique confirmation number generated for the purchase data record to track the redemption status of the purchase data record, disbursing payment allocated from the received payment to the plurality of respective providers and updating the redemption status of the voucher as each of the plurality of services of the bundled set are redeemed. The purchase data record may be a voucher.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A bundled set may comprise a plurality of services or products. The services or products may comprise, for example, healthcare services, drugs, follow-up services, primary services, or a secondary service related to a primary service. The healthcare services may further comprise dental services. The dental services may comprise primary services. The dental services may further comprise one or more secondary service related to a primary service. The healthcare services may further comprise veterinary services. The veterinary services may comprise primary services. The veterinary services may further comprise one or more secondary service related to a primary service. A bundled set may comprise a set of healthcare services to be performed separately by respective providers. In the present disclosure the term &#x201c;separately&#x201d; may be interchangeably used with either of the terms &#x201c;individually&#x201d; or &#x201c;discretely.&#x201d; The bundled set may be offered for purchase pre-paid at a bundle price. The bundle price may be a discounted price. The price may be discounted based on the location, time, or facility where at least one service of the bundled set will be performed. The price may be discounted based on a user's health insurance deductible. An amount of the received payment may be applied to the user's health insurance deductible. The bundle price may be determined based on the user's remaining health insurance deductible. Payment of the pre-paid bundle price may be received in virtual funds. Some implementations may disburse payment to providers of the services or products in the bundled set. The providers to which payment is disbursed may comprise a physician, a dentist, a dental hygienist, a dental lab, a veterinarian, a veterinary technician, a practice group, a hospital, or an insurer. A disbursed payment may comprise a plurality of payments allocated from a received payment, and the plurality of payments may be disbursed to a plurality of respective providers.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">An implementation in accordance with the present disclosure may use a processor to generate a unique confirmation number for the purchased pre-paid bundled set of healthcare services, store the unique confirmation number to a purchase data record, and transmit the unique confirmation number to a user. The purchase data record may be a voucher. In the present disclosure the term &#x201c;purchase data record&#x201d; may be interchangeably used with either of the terms &#x201c;voucher&#x201d; or &#x201c;voucher data record.&#x201d; The voucher data record may be stored or updated in a memory, or a data store operably coupled with the processor. The voucher data record may represent a voucher redeemable by the user to receive the at least one healthcare service of the bundled set of healthcare services. The voucher data record may comprise the unique confirmation number for the purchased bundled set of healthcare services. The voucher data record may further comprise a voucher redemption status for each healthcare service of the bundled set of healthcare services, permitting creation of a voucher that may be redeemed for a healthcare service purchased prepaid, and even more so, that said voucher can be used for each of the services of the bundled set of healthcare services separately. The voucher data record associated with the unique confirmation number is persistent and permits an individual bundled set of a group of bundled sets, or individual services comprising a bundled set of services, to be selectively redeemed.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The redemption status of each individual service or each individual bundled set may be updated in the data store or the memory to indicate the current voucher redemption status of each bundled set or each service in the bundled set of services, further enabling the same voucher uniquely identified by the confirmation number to persist for multiple service redemptions at different times and locations. The disclosed persistent voucher generation for selective redemption of bundled services provides a technical solution, necessarily rooted in computer and information technology disclosed herein, to the technical problem of persistently tracking and updating the redemption status for each service of a service bundle of services to be performed separately, as the individual services are selectively redeemed.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Exemplary embodiments of a transactional marketplace system in accordance with the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings.

It should of course be understood that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is intended as an example, not as an architectural limitation for different embodiments of the present invention, and therefore, the particular elements depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> should not be considered limiting with regard to the environments within which exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be implemented.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the particular components that are utilized for providing the provider pricing tool are integrated within system <b>100</b> in conjunction with the components of the system as described above with reference to the exemplary embodiments illustrated <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. More specifically, the pricing tool <b>137</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> as being implemented within procedure management service <b>133</b> included within provider portal <b>130</b>, and data store <b>114</b> further comprises a service pricing information database <b>114</b><i>m </i>and a cost adjustment information database <b>114</b><i>n </i>that are maintained by database server <b>112</b>, are accessed by application server <b>116</b> via database services provided at a front end by database server <b>112</b>, and retain information collected from a variety of data sources that is utilized in providing the services offered via the provider pricing tool within the network service provided by the application server, as described below in greater detail.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In the present exemplary embodiments, for use in conjunction with the physician service pricing information within service pricing information database <b>114</b><i>m</i>, a corresponding set of cost adjustment data can be compiled and maintained within cost adjustment information database <b>114</b><i>n </i>that can be applied to account for geographical variances in physician costs. The cost adjustment data can, for instance, be compiled from and/or determined based upon the Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCis), which is used along with RVUs in Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) provided by CMS to determine allowable payment amounts for medical procedures in a manner that reflects geographical variations in practice cost. GPCis are used to help standardize the differences in resource costs incurred in operating a private medical practice across geographic areas when those costs are compared with the national average costs for the physician work, practice expense, and malpractice insurance components of the fee schedule.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">More specifically, the CMS has established a GPCI for every Medicare payment locality for each of the three relative value unit components for a procedure (that is, the RVUs for work, practice expense, and malpractice), and the GPCis are applied in the calculation of a fee schedule payment amount by multiplying the RVU for each component times the GPCI for that component. A listing of the current GPCI locality structure, including state, locality area (and when applicable, counties assigned to each locality area), and the corresponding GPCis for each locality, can be obtained from the CMS website, and this information can be compiled and maintained within cost adjustment information database <b>114</b><i>n </i>by a back-end administrator of server system <b>110</b>. In exemplary embodiments, a specific cost adjustment factor can be determined based on the GPCI information for each designated locality area and maintained within cost adjustment information database <b>114</b><i>n</i>. For example, a standard rate adjustment factor for each designated locality area can be determined by calculating an average (or any other suitable aggregate or composite-based) factor by which the corresponding GPCis for the locality impact the standard national rate derived for each service. As another example, such a standard rate adjustment factor for each designated locality area can be derived directly from the Geographic Adjustment Factor (GAF) that is determined for the locality by CMS. The GAF for each designated locality area is calculated as the weighted average of the three GPCis, where the weights are the percentage of RVUs nationally made up by the PW, PE, and MP RVUs.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In another example, for each service for which the information record within service pricing information database <b>114</b><i>m </i>includes an indication that the service is offered as a primary service of a bundled set of services along with an indication that the primary service is required to be performed at an outside facility, the respective pricing information that is included in the information record for the use of the outside facility can be determined by whether the use of the outside facility is classified as a facility outpatient service or a facility inpatient service. For instance, for each facility outpatient service, the respective pricing information that is included in the information record for the use of the outside facility can be obtained from the APC price data that is maintained in association with CPT or HCPCS procedure codes by CMS. CMS assigns individual services classified according to HCPCS codes to APCs based on similar clinical characteristics and similar costs. Thus, APCs are essentially line-level fee schedules in which each HCPCS code for a service is assigned to one of hundreds of individual APCs, and for almost every APC, the fee is determined by multiplying a prospectively established scaled relative weight for the service's clinical APC by a conversion factor (CF) to arrive at a national unadjusted payment rate for the APC.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Accordingly, in exemplary embodiments, for each service for which a respective information record is maintained within service pricing information database <b>114</b><i>m </i>and a corresponding APC is provided by CMS, the corresponding national unadjusted payment rate for the facility outpatient service can be included in the set of pricing information of the respective information record for the service within service pricing information database <b>114</b><i>m. </i></p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In the present exemplary embodiment, for use in conjunction with the facility outpatient service pricing information within service pricing information database <b>114</b><i>m </i>discussed above, a corresponding set of cost adjustment data can be compiled and maintained within cost adjustment information database <b>114</b><i>n </i>that can be applied to account for geographic differences. The cost adjustment data for the facility outpatient service pricing information can, for instance, be compiled from and/or determined based upon the facility wage index that is maintained by the CMS.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In the present exemplary embodiment, for use in conjunction with the facility inpatient service pricing information within service pricing information database <b>114</b><i>m </i>discussed above, a corresponding set of cost adjustment data can be compiled and maintained within cost adjustment information database <b>114</b><i>n </i>that can be applied to account for geographic differences.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Similar to the example discussed above with regard to the cost adjustment data for the facility outpatient service pricing information, the cost adjustment data for the facility inpatient service pricing information can, for instance, be compiled from and/or determined based upon the facility wage index that is maintained by the CMS. As noted above, in exemplary embodiments, the facility wage index information can be obtained from CMS and maintained within cost adjustment information database <b>114</b><i>n. </i></p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In this regard, it should be noted that certain services for which the respective information record within service pricing information database <b>114</b><i>m </i>includes an indication that the service is offered as a primary service of a bundled set of services along with an indication that the primary service is required to be performed at an outside facility may facilitate a mapping of the use of the outside facility to both facility outpatient service price data and facility inpatient service price data. In exemplary embodiments, for such services, a back-end administrator of server system <b>110</b> can make a determination of which set of facility price data is more suitable to include in the set of pricing information of the information record. For example, such a determination may be based upon whether the particular service is more typically performed as a facility outpatient service or a facility inpatient service. In alternative exemplary embodiments, for each service for which the respective information record within service pricing information database <b>114</b><i>m </i>includes an indication that the service is offered as a primary service of a bundled set of services along with an indication that the primary service is required to be performed at an outside facility for which the use of the outside facility can be mapped to both facility outpatient service price data and facility inpatient service price data, respective information records can be maintained for the service as an outpatient facility service and for the service as an inpatient facility service within service pricing information database <b>114</b><i>m. </i></p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In this regard, anesthesia time is a continuous time from the start of anesthesia to the end of an anesthesia service, and one-time unit corresponds to a 15-minute interval, or fraction thereof, starting from the time the physician begins to prepare the patient for induction and ending when the patient may safely be placed under post-operative supervision and the physician is no longer in personal attendance.

The historical patient lifecycle state may be the patient's lifecycle state previous to the current invocation of process <b>1200</b>. The historical patient lifecycle state may be administratively assigned. The historical patient lifecycle state may be programmatically determined by the processor <b>604</b> as a function of patient medical data encoded by an EHR. The processor <b>604</b> may determine the historical patient lifecycle state based on, for example, patient medical data encoded by a previously processed EHR, administratively configured patient medical data, or an administratively configured lifecycle state. In illustrative examples, the EHR may encode patient physiological data such as, for example, a laboratory test report indicating the concentration of a substance in the patient's body, or a test result indicating a measured patient physiological parameter such as blood pressure, heart rate, weight, or height. The processor <b>604</b> may programmatically determine the historical patient lifecycle state based on, for example, operations such as comparing, or correlating, patient medical data encoded by an EHR with one or more range of similar data to determine the patient lifecycle state. In an illustrative example, the processor <b>604</b> may determine the patient lifecycle state to be new patient, well patient, acute care patient, chronic care patient, or recovering patient. Other patient lifecycle states may be determined by the processor <b>604</b> based on programmatically analyzing patient medical data such as laboratory results and measurements to determine correspondence with standardized or administratively determined medical data ranges. For example, at step <b>1210</b> the processor <b>604</b> may determine a patient with a blood pressure in a predetermined range is an acute care patient based on patient medical data encoded by an EHR.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">Then, the method continues at step <b>1215</b> with the processor <b>604</b> determining the current patient lifecycle state based on updated patient medical data. The processor <b>604</b> may programmatically determine the current patient lifecycle state based on updated patient medical data encoded by an EHR. The EHR encoding updated patient medical data may be provided as input to the system as a result of a patient's examination by a medical professional. The EHR encoding updated patient medical data may be provided as input to the system as a result of a measurement by a doctor during a patient visit. The EHR encoding updated patient medical data may be provided as input to the system as a result of a measurement remotely performed by a patient in a care context such as telemedicine, or self-care by the patient in the patient's home. The operations performed by the processor <b>604</b> to determine the current patient lifecycle state at step <b>1215</b> are in line with the operations performed by the processor <b>604</b> at step <b>1210</b> to determine the historical patient lifecycle state. In any case, the processor <b>604</b> at step <b>1215</b> determines the current patient lifecycle state based on evaluating patient medical data that has been updated. In this example, the patient medical data has been updated relative to the patient medical data analyzed by the processor <b>604</b> at step <b>1210</b> to determine the historical patient lifecycle state.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">Then, the method continues at step <b>1220</b> with the processor <b>604</b> comparing the historical patient lifecycle state determined by the processor <b>604</b> at step <b>1210</b> with the current patient lifecycle state determined by the processor <b>604</b> at step <b>1215</b>, to determine if a patient lifecycle event occurred based on the comparison.

The processor <b>604</b> may determine if the patient condition changed based on comparing archived patient medical data, such as, for example, a previous blood pressure measurement or laboratory test result, with patient medical data updated by a more recent measurement or result. For example, the processor <b>604</b> may determine patient condition changed if a more recent test result or measurement is in a different range than a previous test result or measurement. Upon a determination at step <b>1225</b> by the processor <b>604</b> patient condition changed, the method continues at step <b>1245</b> with the processor <b>604</b> indicating to the invoking process that a patient lifecycle event occurred.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">Upon a determination by the processor <b>604</b> at step <b>1225</b> the patient condition did not change, the method continues at step <b>1230</b> with the processor <b>604</b> performing a test to determine if the patient status changed. The processor <b>604</b> may determine if patient status changed based on administratively configured or programmatically determined patient status. The processor <b>604</b> may determine if patient status changed based on comparing archived patient data with updated patient data. The patient data used by the processor <b>604</b> to determine patient status may be medical, billing, payment, insurance, or other data. In an illustrative example, patient status may be new patient, active patient, inactive patient, former patient, referral patient, or referred patient. For example, the processor <b>604</b> may determine patient status changed from active to inactive if the patient has not kept an appointment for at least a predetermined time period. The processor <b>604</b> may determine the patient is a new patient if patient records were not previously accessible to the system. A referral patient may have been referred from another medical practice, and in view of this, patient care of such a patient may benefit from customized consideration, in line with what may be known by one of skill in the art. A referred patient may have specific goals resulting in the patient's referral to another medical practice, or to a specialist, for example. In an illustrative example, the referred patient may benefit from optional services offered through the specialist's practice. In any case, upon a determination by the processor <b>604</b> at step <b>1230</b> the patient status changed, the method continues at step <b>1245</b> with the processor <b>604</b> indicating to the invoking process that a patient lifecycle event occurred.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">Upon a determination by the processor <b>604</b> at step <b>1230</b> the patient status did not change, the method continues at step <b>1235</b> with the processor <b>604</b> performing a test to determine if another patient lifecycle event occurred. The operations performed by the processor <b>604</b> at step <b>1235</b> to determine if another patient lifecycle event has occurred may include comparing archived patient data with updated patient data encoded by an EHR received with a notification or administratively configured in the system. In any case the processor <b>604</b> may determine a patient lifecycle event other than a change in patient condition or status has occurred, based on comparing the archived and updated patient data, to determine if a change has occurred based on the comparison.
