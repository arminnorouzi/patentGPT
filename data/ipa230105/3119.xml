Super-hard cutter elements used in industrial tools or in rock-boring bits, for example, may be exposed in use to high temperatures, as well as to highly abrasive or erosive conditions. This makes it challenging to measure local cutting conditions or to gain information about material being cut, or material generated by the cutting process.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, drill bits used for boring into the earth for oil or gas exploration include arrays of PCD cutter elements, which are driven against rock deep beneath the earth's surface to cut through rock formations. In such operations, a bit may need to bore through several types of geological formations and an operator may wish to have an indication of the formation currently being bored.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a need for operators of cutting tools to gain insight into certain characteristics of workpiece material being cut. In particular, but not exclusively, operators of earth-boring bits may benefit from having near real-time indication of characteristics of rock in a formation being drilled.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Viewed from a first aspect, there is provided a sensor element for a cutting tool, comprising: a hard portion, having a first sensing surface;

the first electrode, the second electrode, the source and the current measurement device connected in an electrical circuit, arranged to generate a potential difference between the first electrode and the second electrodes, and to allow an electric current to flow between the first electrode and the second electrode, when the sensing surface contacts the external material, in response to the cutting tool engaging the external material in use; and to allow the current measurement device to indicate the magnitude of the electric current.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Viewed from a third aspect, there is provided a cutting tool, comprising a tool body and an example disclosed sensor element, attached to the tool body; operable to contact the sensing surface with external material when the cutting tool engages the external material in use.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Viewed from a fourth aspect, there is provided a method of using an example disclosed cutting tool, including engaging a workpiece body with the cutting tool to remove workpiece material from the workpiece body, and allowing the sensing surfaces of the sensor element to engage external material containing workpiece material cut from the workpiece body; generating a potential difference between the first electrode and the second electrode; generating an electric current to flow between the first electrode and the second electrode, through the external material contacted by the sensing surface; measuring the electric current; measuring the temperatures of the first electrode and the second electrode; determining the respective electrical resistance of the first electrode and the second electrode at the respective measured temperatures; and analysing the measured electric current to determine an electrical characteristic of the external material.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various example methods and systems are envisaged by this disclosure, of which various non-limiting, non-exhaustive examples and variations are described as follows.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some example arrangements, the first and/or the second electrode may comprise electrically conductive super-hard material. For example, the first electrode and/or the second electrode (and/or optionally one or more additional electrodes) may comprise or consist essentially of boron- or phosphorus-doped diamond, such as diamond manufactured by a chemical vapour deposition method.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some examples, first and second electrodes may be coterminous with the sensing surface, spaced apart by a gap distance on the sensing surface. One or both of the first and second electrodes may protrude from the sensing surface; and/or may be substantially coplanar with an adjacent area of the sensing surface; and/or may be recessed from the sensing surface (that is, the exposed area of at least one of the electrodes may be recessed from the sensing surface).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some example arrangements, the hard portion may comprise super-hard material such as single crystal diamond, polycrystalline diamond material, polycrystalline cubic boron nitride material, chemical vapour deposited diamond.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some example arrangements, the sensor element may be configured as a cutter element; the first sensing surface may comprise a working surface of the cutter element and may include a cutting edge and include a rake face area. For example, the sensor element may be implemented as a cutter element for an earth-boring bit, or a machine tool for machining a workpiece. An example sensor element may comprise a substrate portion a comprising cemented carbide material such as cemented tungsten carbide or other hard-metal material, in which the hard portion such as a volume of PCD (polycrystalline diamond) material is joined to the substrate at an interface boundary. The interface boundary may be substantially planar or non-planar. A metal network may extend through one or other or both of the substrate portion and the hard portion which may comprise the binder material binding the grains of hard material therein and may comprise, for example, cobalt, nickel or another Group VIII material. In some examples, one or other of the hard portion or the substrate portion may comprise multiple layers bonded thereto.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some example arrangements, the electrically insulating portion may comprise a volume of the hard material portion coterminous with the sensing surface. For example, the hard material portion may comprise polycrystalline diamond (PCD) material and include a surface volume that includes no more than about 2 wt. % metallic material. In some examples, the hard portion may comprise a first PCD volume that is electrically insulating and a second portion that may be electrically conducting, in which the first PCD volume may be coterminous with the sensing surface and extend a depth of about 100 microns to at least about 500 microns from the sensing surface; and the second PCD volume may extend from an interface boundary with the first PCD volume and a boundary of the hard portion, opposite the sensing surface. The first PCD volume may contain substantially no extending contiguous metallic portions, and/or less than about 2 wt. % metal (in electrically conducting form, such as elemental metal).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some example arrangements, the first electrode may be electrically connected to the source by the first set of thermocouple wires; and/or the second electrode may be electrically connected to the source by the second set of thermocouple wires. In other words, the first and/or the second set(s) of thermocouples may be operable to convey electric current between the source and one or both of the first and second electrodes, as well as electrically connected (in parallel) to voltage measurement devices, operable to measure the temperature at one or both electrodes.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some example arrangements, the sensor assembly may include a computer system, communicatively connected to the current measurement device, to receive measured electric current data from the current measurement device, the computer system configured to process the electric current data, to determine an electrical characteristic of the external material. In some example arrangements, the sensor assembly may include an impedance spectrometry system, operable to process a measured electric current having one or more frequency component. The source of the electric current may be configurable to generate varying electric current, having one or more frequency component, which may allow impedance and/or dielectric and/or other electrical characteristics of external material contacting the sensing surface to be estimated.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some example arrangements, a cutting tool comprising an example sensor element may be provided as an earth boring bit, in which a plurality of cutter elements may be attached to the earth-boring bit, operable to cut rock and bore a hole into the earth; the sensor element arranged on the earth-boring bit to allow the sensing surface of the sensor element which may comprise a working surface of the cutter element to contact rock being cut and/or to contact swarf material generated by an earth-boring operation, in which the swarf material may include chips of the rock.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some example arrangements, a method of using an example sensor assembly may include a computer-implemented method to process the measured electric current to calculate the electrical characteristic of the external material; and to calculate a quantity indicative of a mechanical characteristic of the workpiece material, based on the electrical characteristic.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Non-limiting example methods and systems will be described with reference to the appended drawings, of which:</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic drawing of an example sensor assembly, including a cross-section view through an example sensor element;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> show schematic perspective views of example sensor elements;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> show schematic example sensor assemblies having different configurations, both including cross-section views of example sensor elements;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a schematic partly perspective and partly cut-away views of an example earth-boring bit, including a sensor element configured as a cutting element mounted on the bit; and</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a schematic drawing of an example sensor element configured as a cutter element for an earth-boring bit (not included), shown in cross-section and in use, cutting material from a rock formation.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>7</b></figref>, example sensor elements <b>100</b> may be configured as cutter elements <b>100</b> for an earth-boring bit (<b>300</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).

Interstitial regions may include non-super-hard filler material, and/or interstitial regions may include voids. Examples of super-hard material may include single crystal diamond, polycrystalline diamond (PCD), cubic boron nitride (cBN), polycrystalline cBN (PCBN), diamond produced by chemical vapour deposition (CVDD), or diamond grains cemented by a hard material such as silicon carbide.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">A super-hard polycrystalline material may comprise an aggregation of a plurality of super-hard grains such as diamond or cBN grains, a substantial portion of which may be directly inter-bonded and may include interstitial regions among the super-hard grains.

Sintering aid for diamond may also be referred to as &#x201c;catalyst material&#x201d; for promoting the growth of diamond grains or the formation of diamond necks between adjacent diamond grains, under thermodynamically stable conditions for diamond. Catalyst material for diamond may also function as solvent material for carbon, and diamond sintering aid material may also be referred to as &#x201c;solvent/catalyst&#x201d; material. Examples of solvent/catalyst materials for diamond include iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co) and manganese (Mn), and certain alloys including at least one of these elements. PCD material may be produced by subjecting an aggregation of diamond grains to an ultra-high pressure (for example, at least about 6 GPa) and a high temperature (for example, at least about 1,200&#xb0; C.) in the presence of molten solvent/catalyst material. During the HPHT process, solvent/catalyst material may infiltrate through the interstitial regions among the diamond grains from an adjacent source, such as a Co-cemented tungsten carbide substrate. Consequently, PCD material may comprise or consist essentially of the inter-bonded diamond grains and interstitial regions containing Co.
