Typical inflatable cushions comprise a non-inverted seam because non-inverted seams provide for simple folding operations when using a folding machine. However, non-inverted seams are weaker than inverted seams and therefore the inflatable cushion must be reinforced for strength. Inverted seams provide improved strength and integrity but are not as easily folded using a folding machine. Therefore, there is a need for an airbag module comprising an inflatable cushion with an inverted seam that can be efficiently folded using current folding machines.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various implementations include an airbag module for protecting an occupant of a vehicle seat comprising an inflatable cushion, a folding tab, and an inflator.

The inflatable cushion <b>101</b> may be folded efficiently and consistently using modern folding machines. To use a folding machine, the inflatable cushion <b>101</b> detachably couples to the folding machine during the folding process, such as by detachably coupling a folding tab that is coupled to the inflatable cushion <b>101</b> to the folding machine.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">To couple the folding tab <b>140</b> to the inflatable cushion <b>101</b>, the folding tab <b>140</b> is placed upon a locator tab <b>116</b> and between the outer surface <b>104</b> of the first panel <b>102</b> and the outer surface <b>109</b> of the second panel <b>107</b> prior to coupling the outer surface <b>104</b> of the first panel <b>102</b> and the outer surface <b>109</b> of the second panel <b>107</b> to each other via the first seam <b>114</b>.

To ensure proper placement of the folding tab <b>140</b> onto the locator tab <b>116</b>, the locator tab <b>116</b> defines first alignment openings <b>118</b> that align with second alignment openings <b>143</b> defined by the inner portion <b>141</b> of the folding tab <b>140</b>. The inflatable cushion <b>101</b> comprises three folding tabs <b>140</b> and three locator tabs <b>116</b>, and each folding tab <b>140</b> and each locator tab <b>116</b> define two alignment openings <b>143</b>, <b>118</b>, respectively. In other implementations, the inflatable cushion may comprise any number of folding tabs and locator tabs, as well as any number of alignment openings per tab, as necessary for the intended purpose of locating the folding tab along the perimeter of the inflatable cushion. In other implementations, the locator tabs may be defined by the first panel or may be defined by both the first panel and the second panel.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The airbag module <b>100</b> may also comprise one or more alignment tabs <b>125</b> for properly aligning the first panel <b>102</b> and second panel <b>107</b> during assembly. The alignment tabs <b>125</b> are defined by the first perimeter portion <b>105</b> and second perimeter portion <b>106</b> of the first panel <b>102</b> and the first perimeter portion <b>110</b> and second perimeter portion <b>111</b> of the second panel <b>107</b>. The alignment tabs <b>125</b> of the first panel <b>102</b> align with alignment tabs <b>125</b> of the second panel <b>107</b> during assembly of the inflatable cushion <b>101</b>. Some of the alignment tabs <b>125</b> of the first panel <b>102</b> may align with portions of the locator tabs <b>116</b> defined by the first perimeter portion <b>110</b> of the second panel <b>107</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The outer portion <b>142</b> of the folding tab <b>140</b> extends internally toward a central region <b>123</b> of the second panel <b>107</b> after the first alignment openings <b>118</b> and second alignment openings <b>143</b> are aligned and before the first seam <b>114</b> is applied. Therefore, when the inflatable cushion <b>101</b> is reversed from the inside-out condition to the outside-out condition, the outer portion <b>142</b> of the folding tab <b>140</b> extends outward away from the central region <b>123</b> of the second panel <b>107</b> and at least partially beyond a perimeter <b>122</b> of the fully assembled inflatable cushion <b>101</b>. In other words, in the fully assembly condition the outer portion <b>142</b> of the folding tab <b>140</b> extends beyond the first seam <b>114</b> in a direction away from the first perimeter portion <b>105</b> of the first panel <b>102</b> and the first perimeter portion <b>110</b> of the second panel <b>107</b>. The outer portion <b>142</b> of the folding tab <b>140</b> defines tooling openings <b>144</b> which detachably couple the inflatable cushion <b>101</b> to the folding machine.
