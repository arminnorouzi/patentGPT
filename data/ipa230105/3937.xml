num="0001">One or more aspects of embodiments according to the present invention relate to a sensing module for wearable devices, and more particularly to a sensing module comprising a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) on a silicon substrate.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Digital healthcare is transforming the healthcare industry with a rising demand for real-time and on-demand analysis of various biomarkers for a range of purposes. Wearable devices (&#x201c;wearables&#x201d;) are now commonplace in the fields of wellness and healthcare (including for e.g. fitness tracking, general health monitoring, and medical condition management). For devices such as these, there is a desire for the sensing and measuring of biological parameters to be quick, non-invasive and of sufficient specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy. As a result, there is a desire to provide components suitable for use in non-invasive wearable devices that provide the necessary technical requirements for the biological parameters that are to be measured, but also that are conveniently small and that can be manufactured at a consumer-friendly price point. It is known that non-invasive sensing modules may find uses outside of the wearable device market, for example in robotics or remote sensing.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wearable devices should be robust, reliable and easy to wear and may include skin contact patches, wrist watches, rings, ear buds, head bands, and glasses frames</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, the present invention aims to solve the above problems by providing, according to a first aspect, an optical sensing module suitable for wearable devices, the optical sensing module comprising: a silicon or silicon nitride transmitter photonic integrated circuit (PIC), the transmitter PIC comprising: a plurality of lasers, each laser of the plurality of lasers operating at a wavelength that is different from the wavelength of the others; an optical manipulation region, the optical manipulation region comprising one or more of: an optical modulator, optical multiplexer (MUX); and additional optical manipulation elements; and one or more optical outputs for light originating from the plurality of lasers.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this way, an improved optical sensing module is provided that is suitable for wearable devices. Advantageously, the sensing module is capable of providing a compact platform with various optical components integrated. The various components enable a wide range of different measurements from the material (e.g. biological tissue) using a single platform, resulting in a single product capable of being used for a multitude of applications in both consumer and professional healthcare fields including the sensing and monitoring of various biophysical and biochemical biomarkers.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An optical sensing module of this invention may therefore produce light of at least two wavelengths and direct this light at the surface to be studied. This may correspond to the surface of biological material such as skin tissue. In a typical wearable device, the light penetrates the surface and is scattered so that a proportion of the light returns to the sensor module. Along its path through the biological tissue the light may be absorbed by analytes which may correspond to biomarkers themselves or to proxies for the biomarkers. Such a procedure is called diffuse reflectance spectrophotometry. Another form of sensing involves Raman scattering. In the case of Raman spectroscopy, the scattered light is at a different wavelength from the incident light. A person skilled in the art will be aware of many variants on these techniques which are called here spectroscopy.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For such spectroscopy, a silicon photonics (SiPh) chip may be used, onto which is integrated all, or a majority of the optical functions necessary to generate and transmit optical signals and to receive and interpret the returning optical signals. The transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) parts may be on one chip to form a single transmitter/receiver chip, or on more than one chip, such as a separate Tx and Rx chip device. The silicon photonics chip may be based upon an SOI structure where there is one buried oxide layer or on a double SOI structure where there are two (or more) buried oxide layers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Spectroscopy, such as absorption spectroscopy or Raman spectroscopy, works by applying interrogating light to the material, or sample under examination and detecting and analyzing the light received from the sample, which may be referred to as &#x201c;sample light&#x201d;. For the purpose of this disclosure the meaning of the term spectroscopy may include the monitoring and measuring of biological functions such as heart rate and blood pressure. Functions may be measured directly, or their properties imputed indirectly. For wearables, the material under examination may be biological tissue, which may be monitored on or through the skin of a person.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, or as an alternative to wearable devices, the sensing module may be used in hand-held devices.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention allows for a plurality of lasers to be used that may be switchable and identifiable other than by wavelength scanning. An advantage of this is that it is not necessary to scan as one might expect from in conventional laboratory spectrophotometry. It is therefore possible to use a wavelength agnostic detector. The detector may respond differently across the range (i.e. the output may vary for a given intensity of light across the wavelength range) but this can be compensated for. This contributes to considerable commercial advantages since it is cheaper and easier to have multiple light sources and a simple detector rather than a simple light source and a complex detector. Moreover, this way it is possible to use higher power pump sources (at a given wavelength) and therefore improve sensitivity and selectivity.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Optional features of the invention will now be set out. These are applicable singly or in any combination with any aspect of the invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Optionally, lasers may be FP lasers, external cavity DBR (RSOA+grating), or DFB lasers.

In this way, the light in the RSOAs and in the Si or SiN PIC waveguides stay in the same plane.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Optionally, the optical multiplexor (MUX) may take the form of an Echelle grating, specifically an integrated Echelle grating, or an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Optical manipulation elements may include one or more of: power taps, lens(es), power splitter(s), filter(s), mirror(s) and polarization rotator(s).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The Silicon or Silicon Nitride integrated circuit may be located on a silicon substrate.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The plurality of lasers may incorporate and heaters on DBR gratings or other phase tuning mechanisms and a wavelength locker control circuit.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Optionally, the wavelengths of the plurality of lasers is within the range 400 to 3000 nm. In some embodiments the lasers may all correspond to NIR wavelengths=1150 nm to 2500 nm. In some embodiments, all laser wavelengths may fall within one, or both of the following: 1150 nm upwards (using Si PIC); and 400-1150 nm (using SiN PIC).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Optionally, the transmitter PIC includes a laser array which operates on more than 30 different NIR and/or visible wavelengths. In some embodiments, the transmitter PIC includes a laser array which operates on up to 200 emitting wavelengths.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Although the optical sensing module is suitable for wearable devices, it is a multifunctional sensing module and could be used or adapted to be used in other situations. For example, there is a need for similar sensors in robotics. In addition to analyzing biomarkers and parameters of the human body, the sensing module may be used for other applications, particularly to analyze the materials of compositions of objects in close proximity to the optical output.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Optionally, the optical sensing module further comprises a plurality of LEDs, the LEDs operating at different wavelengths from the plurality of lasers and each LED operating at a wavelength which is different from the wavelengths of the other LEDs making up the plurality of LEDs.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Optionally, the LEDs may each have an operating wavelength which lies within the visible or NIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Visible and NIR wavelengths should be understood to fall within the range of 400 nm to 950 nm.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the plurality of LEDs includes LEDs which operate at 12 or more visible-wavelengths. In this way, the sensing module is a single module capable of non-invasive measurement of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), blood flow (pulse amplitude), local (LBT) and core body temperature (CBT), cuff-less measurements of blood pressure (BP), pulse oximetry (SpO2), breath rate (BR), total body hydration (TBH) and skin hydration (SH), blood alcohol (BA)/ethanol (C2H6O) and blood lactate (BL) contents, carboxyhemoglobin (HbC) and Methemoglobin (HbMet) and glucose.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Optionally, the optical manipulation region comprises a mirror to couple light from all of the plurality of lasers out of the optical sensing module at a single optical output.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the mirror is a passive mirror.

In some embodiments the mirror is external to the transmitter PIC and mounted on the substrate near the optical output of the PIC.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Optionally, the optical sensing module further comprises one or more photodetectors.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Optionally, the photodetector is located on the transmitter PIC such that the PIC is a transmitter/receiver PIC.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Optionally, a mirror or grating may be integrated into the PIC to steer the laser light through one or more layers of the PIC.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Optionally, the photodetector is located separately from the transmitter PIC.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Optionally, the silicon photonics receiver may comprise a silicon platform such that one or more waveguides are fabricated from silicon. In other embodiments, the silicon photonics receiver may comprise a SiN platform, such that one or more waveguides are fabricated from SiN.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The one or more photodetectors may include one or more Si-based photodetectors and/or one or more InGaAs-based photodetectors. They may also include one or more germanium photodetectors and/or one or more avalanche photodiodes.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Optionally, the one or more photodetectors are located on a separate chip that is vertically integrated and mounted on the same substrate shared with the transmitter PIC.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Optionally, the one or more photodetectors are located on a carrier beside the transmitter PIC.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Optionally, the one or more photodetectors includes a detector that receives an optical signal from the transmitter PIC to operate as a coherent detector.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A combiner network typically couples the optical signal from the transmitter to the coherent detector and may include one or more of: a switch, a network mixer, and/or a pass-through system.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Optionally, an optical output of the transmitter PIC is laterally displaced from an optical input which leads to the one or more photodetectors. In this way, transmit waveguides and receive waveguides are spaced by certain fixed amount e.g. 1-8 mm to maximize signal quality of parameters of interest at the photodetector (see, for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b> and <b>27</b></figref>, where separate photodetectors are used, photodetector spacing from the transmit emission point is strategically spaced, again with sensible spacing values corresponding to 1-8 mm.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Optionally, a single waveguide acts as a transmit waveguide a receiver waveguide.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Optionally, the one or more photodetectors comprised a plurality of photodetectors, each of the plurality of photodetectors operating over a different range of wavelengths.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Optionally, the silicon-based platform includes silicon nitride waveguides.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Optionally, the optical sensing module further comprises one or more of: laser driver(s), modulator driver(s), phase controller(s), TIA(s), power management IC(s), multiplexer circuit, micro-controller unit(s) (MCU), FPGA(s).

In this way, the single platform can support a wider range of wavelengths. In some embodiments, the Si or SiN waveguides are 3 &#x3bc;m waveguides.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Optionally, the plurality of lasers is placed onto the PIC via flip-chip die bonding or micro transfer printing. A detailed description of micro transfer printing (MTP) can be found in WO 2020/030641 A1).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Optionally, the plurality of lasers of the transmitter PIC include one or more pairs of pump and probe lasers, each of the pump and probe pairs configured to operate with a detector to form a Raman spectrometer. The detector may form part of the same PIC or may be separate. In being configured to operate as a Raman spectrometer, the pump and probe lasers have wavelengths selected to excite and Raman peaks in the material/body to be analyzed. Another consideration when selecting working wavelengths is compatibility with the material of the waveguides of the PIC. For example, the pump lasers may operate at a wavelength range of 1250-1700 nm, and the probe laser may operate at a wavelength range of 1300-1850 nm. In other embodiments, the probe lasers may operate at NIR wavelengths.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Optionally, the plurality of lasers includes a single pump laser and a plurality of probe lasers, each of the probe lasers having a wavelength corresponding to a resonance of interest.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Optionally, the plurality of lasers includes a plurality of probe lasers wherein each of the plurality of probe lasers is a fixed wavelength laser, the fixed wavelengths corresponding to Raman resonances of interest.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Optionally, the plurality of lasers comprises a tunable pump laser.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Optionally, the plurality of lasers includes at least one pair of pump probe lasers for Raman spectroscopy and also a plurality of unpaired lasers. In this way, Raman spectroscopy can be carried out using the pump-probe pairs of lasers and another spectroscopic technique such as spectrophotometry can be carried out by the unpaired lasers.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Optionally, the optical sensing module comprises a photodetector configured to make recording as a function over time and a tunable probe laser configured to sweep over a range of wavelengths corresponding to a Raman reflectance spectrum. In this way, if the photodetector is coupled to a reference arm which directly couples back to a tap collecting a portion of the tunable laser light, an interferometer is formed with the probe light collected externally from the chip. Thus, an optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) measurement can be taken.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Optionally, a bank of spirals with a switch may be incorporated in the reference arm between the probe laser and the photodetector to allow for adjustable ranging.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Optionally, one or more photodetectors or LEDs are located under one or more respective microlenses.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Optionally, one or more of the microlenses comprises a thin film stack of DBR filters. the thin film stack may consist of SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2 </sub>or SiO<sub>2</sub>/SiN layers. However, TiO<sub>2 </sub>or SiN could be replaced by other high refractive index film. Typically, a middle layer is quarter-lambda shifted to be resonant at transmission wavelength, with a thickness m-multiple of &#x3bb;/2. In one example there is 21 layers, but other numbers of layers are possible. The microlenses act to increase collection by the receiver.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Optionally, the optical sensing module comprises a processor configured to: apply a pre-trained algorithm to reflectance data taken at a wavelength corresponding to a water absorption peak, to convert reflectance measurements into a predicted temperature.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Where the sensor is a wearable device, the temperature being measured may be core temperature. Measuring temperature with a SiN platform enables a miniaturized wearable enablement of measurement at 970 nm water peak. Measuring temperature with a Si platform enables a miniaturized wearable enablement of measurement around 1450 nm water peak.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further optional features of the invention are set out below.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is the front side of an optical sensing module according to an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is the back side an optical sensing module according to an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is a cross section of an optical sensing module according to an embodiment of the present invention, the optical sensing module comprising a protective casing;</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is an optical sensing module with a reflecting mirror incorporated according to an embodiment of the present invention showing an embodiment where transmitted light passes through the substrate, as well as the possible pathways of backscattered light from tissue;</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a further perspective view of the optical sensing module shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a side view of a further optical sensing module according to an embodiment of the present invention which includes a reflecting mirror mounted on the substrate external from the transmitter PIC;</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a side view of a further optical sensing module according to an embodiment of the present invention which includes a reflecting mirror mounted on the substrate external from the transmitter PIC and light reflected at an angle different from that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a side view of a further optical sensing module according to an embodiment of the present invention which includes a reflecting mirror and a focusing lens or lenses mounted on the substrate external from the transmitter PIC;</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> is a is a side view of a further optical sensing module which includes an adjustable (e.g. MEMS) reflecting mirror and a focusing lens or lenses mounted on the substrate external from the transmitter PIC according to an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic of an optical sensing module according to an embodiment of the present invention, comprising a single transmitter/receiver PIC with integrated photodetectors;</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic of an optical sensing module according to an embodiment of the present invention, comprising a transmitter PIC and separate photodetectors;</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic of an optical sensing module according to an embodiment of the present invention, comprising a single transmitter/receiver (TRx) PIC and an integrated coherent photodetector;</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic of an optical sensing module according to an embodiment of the present invention, comprising a single transmitter/receiver (TRx) PIC and integrated photodetectors and a Silicon nitride SiN platform such that the working wavelengths of the device extend into the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

The optical sensing module <b>1</b> includes a transmitter photonic integrated circuit (PIC) <b>4</b> located on a substrate <b>2</b>. The PIC <b>4</b> includes a plurality of lasers, each laser of the plurality of lasers operating at a wavelength that is different from the wavelength of the others. The PIC also includes an optical manipulation region for manipulating the light in any way required prior to transmission via one or more optical outputs <b>12</b> to the surface to be analyzed. An optical element such as a mirror <b>10</b> (e.g. prism mirror) may be present. The optical manipulation region includes one or more of: an optical modulator, optical multiplexer (MUX); and additional optical manipulation elements such as power taps, lenses and power splitters.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The optical sensing module also includes a plurality on non-laser light sources such as LEDs, <b>5</b> (e.g. visible or near infrared wavelength LEDs). One or more photodetectors <b>3</b>, <b>6</b> also form part of the optical sensing module. In this embodiment, the photodetectors are located on the substrate but are not part of the PIC. As will be described in more detail in relation to later figures, it is possible for photodetectors to be located as an integral part of a transmitter/receiver PIC. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the plurality of photodetectors includes silicon photodetectors <b>3</b> and InGaAs photodetectors <b>6</b>. Photodetectors in germanium may also be used in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">An ASIC or microcontroller <b>11</b> is located on the substrate <b>2</b> of the optical sensing module. Electrical connector <b>13</b> provides electrical signals to the optical sensing module, and a protective casing <b>7</b> including a lid and a base, acts to cover the PIC and other components to minimize the risk of damage during use.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Once manipulated (e.g. multiplexed), light from the plurality of lasers exits the PIC <b>4</b> and therefore the optical sensing module <b>1</b> via one or more optical output ports <b>12</b>. Several geometries discussed in this disclosure enable efficient off-chip coupling, collimation, and focusing of laser sources with little or no chromatic aberration. In addition to this, they enable efficient collection of back-scattered light in a compact geometry that can be miniaturized to fit in a wearable device.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Light may be launched into free space from a waveguide facet (a &#x201c;launch facet&#x201d;) at or near the edge of a photonic integrated circuit (PIC). An optical element such as a mirror <b>10</b> may be present to take the light from the plane of the waveguide platform and translate it into a direction more suitable for interrogating the surface. The direction may be orthogonal or substantially orthogonal to the plane of the PIC. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, <b>3</b>C and <b>3</b>D</figref> a passive mirror with fixed reflection angle may be used, or an actively controlled MEMS mirror that allows for reflection of the laser light to be adjusted or swept over a range of angles such that a larger surface area can be investigated. The mirror can be placed onto the substrate <b>2</b> via a surface mount assembly process.

This geometry may use a shared excitation and collection path, bringing the back-scattered signal back on-chip for detection. The light may propagate through adjustable (powered) optics (or a &#x201c;focus lens&#x201d;) and be reflected into the sample (e.g., the skin of a person wearing a device (e.g., a watch)) by the adjustable (e.g., steerable) mirror (or &#x201c;scan mirror&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Back-scattered light from the surface of the skin, and from within a volume below the surface of the skin, returns to the launch facet (or, in some embodiments, a different waveguide facet) on the PIC to be analyzed.

In some embodiments, the adaptable optics can be used to focus to a point in the skin.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Confocal excitation and collection may also be performed using an adjustable focus, tip, and tilt off-axis parabolic mirror as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In this way, the functionality of the focusing lens and scan mirror have been combined into a single element that does not suffer from the chromatic aberration inherent in a lens. In the first geometry and in the second geometry, the ability to adjust the position of the focus of the illuminating light (and of the sensor) may be used to compensate for variations in the position of the sample relative to the sensing system. For example, for a sensing system in a watch, the position of the watch may shift relative to the skin of the wearer when the wearer moves. The focusing lens and scan mirror (or, in the second geometry, the adjustable focus, tip, and tilt off-axis parabolic mirror) may then be used to move the focus to a suitable sensing point relative to the surface of the skin (e.g., at a depth below the skin at which sufficient blood is present for sensing, and at which the intervening skin does not cause unacceptable optical loss). In some embodiments the focusing lens and scan mirror (or, in the second geometry, the adjustable focus, tip, and tilt off-axis parabolic mirror) are adjusted by (i) performing a search for a point at which the measured absorption spectrum is a plausible spectrum for blood, or by finding the surface of the skin (by its reflectance) and then moving the focus spot into the skin (by a predetermined distance, or until a plausible absorption spectrum for blood is sensed).</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">In a geometry of an optical sensing module <b>1101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> collection efficiency of the back-scattered signal may be improved by using a large area detector array comprising smaller photodetector pixels <b>1106</b>.

A thermoelectric cooler may be used to control the temperature of the PIC in any of the geometries described herein. The light illuminating the sample may be collimated, or it may be converging (e.g., focused at a point just below the surface of the skin), or it may be slightly diverging.

Some related art systems have complex receivers and have relatively low signal to noise ratio (SNR). A SiPh chip providing interrogating light may not have full wavelength scanning capability but may be capable of providing a range of interrogating wavelengths with high wavelength precision to yield spectroscopic data sufficient for the intended analysis&#x2014;for example, glucose in blood in the medically important range with required precision and accuracy. The system may be adaptable so that one day it is programmed to analyze for one (or one set) of analytes and at another time for another set.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Generally, for practical applications in wearable devices only selected wavelengths may be used.

In order to achieve high spectral discrimination, a laser line width can be narrow, e.g., less than 1 MHz, or in order to reduce coherent noise (multi-path interference noise), a laser linewidth can be broad e.g. up to 5 THz.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">The light sources are edge-emitting lasers, with power outputs each of approximately 10 mW and in some embodiments upwards to 100 mW or more. The lasers may be distributed feedback (DFB) lasers (but also distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) lasers, or FP (Fabry Perot) lasers), and may be tunable. In some embodiments, the lasers are VCSELs, mounted onto the Si substrate of the transmitter PIC or onto the substrate outside of the transmitter PIC. Mechanisms for mounting a VCEL onto the substrate may follow mechanisms described herein for mounting one or more LEDs onto the substrate. The lasers may be tunable over a relatively narrow range, for example simply to tune or lock the wavelength in response to the natural wavelength drift of devices, or they may be tunable over a wider range in order to change the operating wavelength of the laser in response to the demands of the spectroscopy. There is a balance between the number of lasers and the range of tuning, depending upon the analysis to be accomplished. In some embodiments, the greater the number of lasers the smaller the range of their tuning.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">The interrogating light may be varied in amplitude, phase, polarization, or in other optical properties or a combination of such optical properties. Any such variation with time of a property of the light may be referred to herein as &#x201c;dynamic&#x201d; or as &#x201c;modulation&#x201d; of the light. Generally, modulation may take the form of regular variations at a certain frequency or in a pattern giving rise to a data signal. Such variation or pattern may be used to identify the transmitter (e.g., if multiple transmitters (each of which may be a part of a respective spectrometer) are illuminating the same sample), the individual wavelength or the time of transmission. Pulsing of the light can also reduce the power consumption of the device and lead to longer battery life.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">It is important to understand that any two or more of the embodiments disclosed could be combined in order to result in an optical sensing module with multiple functions.

The received backscattered light may also be diverted, by a suitable coupler, from the waveguide connecting the multiplexer and the launch facet, if the launch facet is used to also receive the received backscattered light. Using the launch facet to receive the received backscattered light may have the advantage of increasing the extent to which the illuminated volume (under the surface of the skin) coincides with the sampled volume (from which light is backscattered) or to simplify the emission and collection optics. The laser may be chirped (e.g., by changing the laser drive current) or phase or amplitude modulated so that a radio frequency beat signal is formed at the coherent detector, allowing for homodyne or FMCW detection schemes which provide increases in signal to noise ratio or the ability to measure sample distance, velocity, or vibration via detection of Doppler shifts. It should be noted that the optical functions may be spread across more than one chip. For example, the lasers may be on a separate chip and there may be separate transmit and receive chips.

A reflection spectrometer measurement is made with the light reflected at a given wavelength, series of wavelengths or range of wavelengths. In a wearable device, the light receiving aperture of the spectrometer may be close to the transmitter aperture, for example within the range of 3 mm to 5 mm, or even the same as the transmitting aperture. Thus, measurement of absorption may rely upon scattering, frequently multiple scattering, of the light, thus making a diffuse reflection spectroscopy or diffuse reflection spectrophotometry measurement. Thus, there may be no single reflective path length, but rather a range of path lengths. This may complicate measurement, especially for coherent detection.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0170">The chip may also have a receive waveguide to capture the sample light and transfer it from the chip surface (for example, a facet or grating) to the detecting apparatus. The receive waveguide may be the same as or different from the transmit waveguide. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a receive aperture <b>006</b>. Where the system employs coherent detection there may be a combiner network <b>008</b> that combines the local oscillator light tapped from the laser sources with the sample light and both may be detected and measured at a balanced photodiode network <b>009</b>. The receiver may be wavelength agnostic, typically using a germanium photodetector or an avalanche photodiode. The detector may be a balanced detector. The receiver may be a coherent detector in which case it may receive (local oscillator) light from the laser sources in transmitter in addition to the collected sample light. Where the receiver and transmitter are integrated on the same chip, for example an SiPh chip, the connection between the transmitter and receiver may be a SiPh waveguide.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0171">The system may operate one wavelength at a time, in which case, the wavelength may be identified temporally. If more than one wavelength is transmitted the detector circuit may distinguish wavelengths or combinations of wavelengths. This may be done by applying and monitoring for identifying modulation (as mentioned above), e.g., frequency tones on the transmitted radiation. Groups of wavelengths may similarly be identified. In some circumstances it may be beneficial to transmit a number of wavelengths simultaneously and then to switch off wavelengths individually or in groups of wavelengths. In this way, intensities of light of certain wavelengths received at low intensities (for example, as a result of high scattering or high absorbance) may be determined with greater accuracy. The DBR filters on photodetectors described elsewhere in this application serve a similar purpose.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0172">The analytical process is described in more detail in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. The system may be set up to measure one or more partial spectra. A partial spectrum may include a single wavelength which provides a diagnostic of one or a combination of analytes. It may have one or more data points for each spectrum. A partial spectrum may represent a region of the whole spectrum, for example a part of the NIR spectral range (1150 nm-2500 nm). The calculation of the concentration may be based upon internal or external calibration, may be in respect of absolute or ratios of spectral data. There may be algorithms built into a data processor to calculate a concentration of an analyte, or a concentration of an analyte relative to the concentration of an internal or external standard. In the method depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, wavelengths are first selected to construct the partial spectrum. These selected transmitted wavelengths may be locked with wavelength lockers. Radiation is subsequently received at a detector. In this case, the detector is advantageously wavelength agnostic. Wavelengths are identified at the detector and reflectance measured at each wavelength. A partial spectrum is created from the reflectance measurement. The concentration of the analyte can then be calculated from the spectrum. Calculation may be achieved via the algorithms embedded or from an algorithm set up by the on-board computer, CPU, or FPGA.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0173">In some embodiments, the total optical power output is less than 10 mW. In some embodiments the total power output is greater than 10 mW. The waveguides including the output waveguide are large waveguides (which can handle high power with low loss). Such waveguides may have a height of between 0.5 microns and 5 microns (where, e.g., in a SiPh chip fabricated on an SOI wafer the height may be measured from the buried oxide (BOX) layer (which may operate as a lower cladding layer) to the top of the waveguide, the direction of the measurement being perpendicular to the plane of the SOI wafer).</p><p id="p-0169" num="0174">Changes in relative powers may be used as a spectroscopic technique by changing the emphasis of the observed wavelengths and the overall power may be used to change the physical depths of interrogation. The modulators may almost completely switch off or shutter the light. VOAs may operate much more slowly than other types of modulators (e.g., a VOA may have a bandwidth of 1 kHz and a modulator may have a bandwidth of 10 GHz). Modulators may be used to impose a signal (e.g., an identifying modulation such as a pseudorandom bit pattern or a frequency tone) on the light of a given wavelength to enable that light to be identified at the detector where the receiving photodetector is agnostic of wavelength (i.e., has substantially constant sensitivity over a substantial portion of the operating wavelength range). A shutter may be used to switch off the light so that the PD dark current may be compensated for and noise may be measured and then cancelled or used in error calculations.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0175">The lasers may be tunable over the Tx PIC operating wavelength range. One or more fixed wavelength laser(s) may be reference wavelengths. The lasers may be switched in sequence (i.e., switched on one at a time) or some or all lasers may be switched on together. The lasers may be DFB lasers with gratings made in the Si. In some embodiments, there is no need for isolators placed between the laser and the sample medium. This may be an advantage over LEDs, which may require isolators. Light from the multiplexer output waveguide may be focused by one or more lenses and may be directed by a mirror. The power of the lasers may be adjusted singly or in concert. In some embodiments, the SNR is measured, and used to correct for noise. In some embodiments, the power or the location of illumination are varied to gain maximum SNR. Interrogating light may be coupled to the sample, and sample light may be coupled to the receiver, by any of several systems and methods described herein.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0176">The detector may have one or more wavelength filters (or none). Detection may be direct or coherent with possible enhanced SNR. Amplitude, phase, and frequency modulation of lasers are all available and can provide various information about the sample or enhance the SNR. Varying power may enable interrogation of the sample by depth from surface&#x2014;e.g. the depth below the skin for a wearable device. For low intensity radiation, (scattered) sample light may only be detected from a shallow depth since the effective contribution of deeper scattering may be in the noise or effectively below the detection threshold. For a material homogeneous with depth, as source light intensity is increased, the proportion of light from deeper levels may theoretically be the same as for the low intensity, but scattered light from deeper levels may be detectable. For a sample inhomogeneous with depth, the result may be more complex. For example, absorbance, scattering and analyte concentration may vary (singularly or otherwise) with depth and so varying the light intensity at source could produce a non-linear result at the detector. Depending upon the relationship of the scattering particle size to the wavelength of light, the sample light may be polarized and if scattering varies with depth then so may polarization.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0177">The lasers (which may be III-V lasers) may be made by integrating III-V chips into the SiPh chip by flip-chip die bonding or micro transfer printing (MTP). The SiPh chip may have fiducials that may be used for alignment during the bonding or micro transfer printing process. Depending on the application, the area of the SiPh chip may be less than 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. In some embodiments, the waveguides maintain polarization, which may be advantageous if polarization is important (i.e. TE and TM may reveal information, e.g., if a change in polarization state upon scatting from a sample reveals some information about the characteristics of the sample).</p><p id="p-0173" num="0178">The spectroscopy transmission chip (or &#x201c;transmitter&#x201d;) may be a SiPh, silicon on oxide chip (also known as a silicon on insulator (SOI) chip) or it may be a double SOI chip&#x2014;i.e. with two oxide layers). It may include a single output/illumination spot/waveguide. In some embodiments, a chip includes a plurality of transmitters, or a transmitter has a plurality of outputs, and, e.g., each output may have a different analytical purpose. Each transmitter may have multiple output wavelengths, multiplexed. The interrogating light may be a combination of wavelengths and temporal effects (e.g., different wavelengths at different times).</p><p id="p-0174" num="0179">The control circuitry or algorithms may be capable of analyzing for more than one analyte, and capable of applying more than one wavelength successively or simultaneously. They may include software to work out (i) the best combination of wavelengths, and (ii) the power to be transmitted at each wavelength within the chosen wavelength range to analyze for a chosen analyte. The algorithms may include artificial intelligence (AI) software. The control circuitry or algorithms may include software to analyze multiple analytes. An algorithm may estimate and then refine the optimum number of wavelengths, the reference or standard wavelengths (i.e., the wavelengths expected to provide good performance) for a given analysis. The partial spectrum measured by the spectrometer may be a spectrum measured over one or more sub-bands, or one or more discrete wavelengths within the wavelength range of interest. The algorithms may estimate the concentrations of one or more analytes and one or more other components in the sample, e.g., by fitting the partial spectrum to a combination of the spectra expected for each of the analytes and other components. In some embodiments, other characteristics of the sample or of a system connected to the sample may be measured without estimating analyte concentrations. For example, it may be that the absorption spectrum of blood just below the surface of the skin of a person or animal is affected by the core temperature of the person or animal, as a result of changes in the blood's chemical composition, which may depend on the core temperature. In such a case, it may be possible to infer the core temperature directly from knowledge of how the spectrum changes with core temperature, without knowledge of how the chemical composition of the blood changes with core temperature.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0180">The receiver chip may comprise a focal plane array detector.

A large waveguide silicon photonics (SiPh) platform may be used in the transmitter or the receiver, with waveguides having a height of approximately 1 to 3 microns. The transmitter may be capable of transmitting with multiple, adaptive wavelengths, at one or more outputs. Laser light may have the necessary power and (narrow) linewidth to be suitable for use as the interrogating light. The wavelength combination used may be adjusted to the analytical purpose.

The measurement may occur using wavelengths around the water peak at 1450 nm which allows the light to penetrate a few millimeters into the skin and probed the dermis. Operating at this wavelength enables use of Si Photonic integrated circuits since the wavelength is higher than the 1120 nm absorption band edge of Si. Benchtop laboratory measurements have demonstrated sensitivity to temperature (Examining water in model membranes by NIR spectroscopy and multivariate analysis&#x2014;2018.pdf) with maximum sensitivity to temperature changes of each side of the water curve occurring at &#x2dc;1390 nm and &#x2dc;1546 nm and these changes in absorption are opposite to one another with an isosbestic point between them near the water peak at 1450 nm.

For example, 970 nm light allows the light to penetrate deeper into the tissue and measure tissue temperatures for deeper tissue structures. The 970 nm light also has higher tissue scattering and more relative absorption from other absorbers such as hemoglobin and lipids that will obfuscate the water temperature peak shift. The 1450 nm water peak has higher absorption, so the light doesn't penetrate as deep into the tissue and is ideal for a measurement of skin temperature.

Stimulated Raman scattering involves illuminating the sample target area with Raman pump light as well as with probe light at the stokes peak of interest and has been shown to boost detection sensitivity by 4-5 orders of magnitude (See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6,560,478 B1, U.S. Pat. No. 6,560,478 B1).</p><p id="p-0257" num="0297">Traditional Raman spectroscopy has been performed at NIR wavelengths with Raman pump wavelengths around 800 or 1064 nm. Raman scattering is fundamentally stronger around 800 nm due to a stronger scatter cross-section at lower wavelengths due to the v4 dependence on the Raman scattering cross-section. Detectors at wavelengths above 1150 nm also have more noise and lower sensitivity, providing a further challenge for detecting Raman signals at these higher wavelengths. On the other hand when doing in-vivo spectrophotometry of tissue, depth penetration of the light into tissue, and absorption of light by background tissue between the surface of the skin and the point being measured is an issue, especially when the signal being measured is weak as in non-linear spectroscopy such as Raman spectroscopy. The challenges of Raman spectroscopy at longer wavelengths are partially compensated for by the fact that longer wavelengths (up to 1800 nm initially or, eventually to 3000 nm) have less absorption in the tissue permitting deeper penetration into the tissue and less absorption and scattering of the Stokes shifted light as it travels back to the detector for measurement. Furthermore eye-safety power limits for IR wavelengths above 1150 nm are higher, allowing for higher Raman pump laser powers potentially to be used.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0298">When using Si Photonic integrated circuits to make a Raman spectrometer, it has been found that it is desirable to perform the spectroscopy with light wavelengths that are above 1120 nm, the band-gap of silicon.

As with previous embodiments, a taper <b>2207</b> (e.g. a buried interposer taper) may be present to convert an input point <b>6070</b> with a larger cross section (e.g. 12&#xd7;12 um) into a waveguide platform with a smaller cross section (e.g. 3&#xd7;3 um).</p><p id="p-0290" num="0330">Interferometric embodiments are described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>61</b></figref> shows a PIC <b>6101</b> comprising coherent CW excitation Raman spectroscopy with interferometric detection (OFDR) for depth detection and hyper spectral Raman. A pump laser <b>6103</b> has a fixed wavelength &#x3bb;<sub>p </sub>(e.g. 570 nm) ad a probe laser <b>6133</b> is tunable over a range of wavelengths (e.g. 884 to 632 nm) and can be for example a RR-based tunable laser. In contrast to the previous embodiment, the controller <b>6144</b> is this time attached to the probe laser rather than the pump laser. A waveguide locker is located at the fixed pump laser, which takes the form of a DBR laser. A band MUX combines the pump and probe outputs into a single output from the PIC. In this embodiment, the detector is an ultra-sensitive detector such as an avalanche photodiode (APD) or single photon avalanche detector (SPAD). Collecting coherent detector readings as a function of time as probe wavelength sweeps across Raman reflectance spectrum allows for OFDR (optical frequency domain reflectometry) measurement which gives spectrum vs distance. Optionally, a bank of spirals with a switch may be incorporated in the reference path to allow for adjustable ranging. A long spiral waveguide heater can be integrated on top of or in close proximity to the spiral waveguide to provide for fine phase tuning of the OFDR reference arm and additional fine ranging. In the embodiment shown, a path length adaptor such as a waveguide spiral with waveguide heater may be located in the reference path between the controlled output of the probe laser and the local oscillator input of the coherent detector to adjust path length matches arm length to d (sets range). The distance between the focused spot on the surface (e.g. skin) and the collection optics (e.g. collection lens) of the receiver portion is chosen to be d/2. In some embodiments, an output lens at the transmitter portion of the PIC may be a restoring or sweeping lens. In an alternative embodiment (not shown, the PIC of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>61</b></figref> may be combined with &#x201c;regular&#x201d; spectrophotometer lasers.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0331">Raman SRS light detection is stronger in the more traditional Raman wavelength range of 830 to 1064 nm as mentioned above. Any of the above PIC versions and pump-probe wavelength schemes could be replaced by PICs that use silicon nitride SOI PIC platform that supports wavelengths in the range 500-2500 nm. In this way, traditional pump wavelengths of e.g. 830 nm could be used, and probe wavelengths of 890 nm to 1064 nm could be used to cover the range 0 to 2900 cm-1 wavenumber. Alternatively, the probe laser could be fixed at 1064 nm, and array of pump lasers ranging from 830 nm to 1050 nm could be used. The InGaAs PD in other embodiments would then be replaced with a Si CCD detector for higher detection sensitivity.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-27" num="01-27"><claim-text><b>1</b>.-<b>27</b>.
