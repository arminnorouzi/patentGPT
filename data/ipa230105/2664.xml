The present disclosure also relates to water-based wellbore fluids including the fluid loss control agent of the present disclosure and to methods of drilling, completion and working over of a wellbore utilizing the same.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Subterranean deposits of natural resources such as gas, water and crude oil, are commonly recovered by drilling wellbores to tap subterranean formations or zones containing such deposits. Various fluids are employed in drilling a wellbore and preparing the wellbore and an adjacent subterranean formation for the recovery of material therefrom. For example, a drilling fluid is a complex mixture of chemicals that is circulated through the wellbore to cool and lubricate the drill bit, suspend formation cuttings, lift them to the surface, and control formation pressure during the drilling of the wellbore. Such mixture of chemicals may include, for example, viscosifiers, dispersants, emulsifiers, weighting agents, fluid loss control agents, pH control agents, salts, lubricants, select polymers, corrosion inhibitors or biocides that enable the drilling fluid to meet the needs of the particular drilling operation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Drilling fluids can be classified as either oil-based drilling fluids or water-based drilling fluids depending upon the character of the continuous phase of the fluid. Oil-based drilling fluids generally use hydrocarbon oil as the main liquid component with clays or colloidal asphalts to provide the desired viscosity along with other additives including emulsifiers, polymers and weighting agents. Water may also be present, but in an amount not usually greater than 50 volume percent of the entire composition. If more than about 5 volume percent of water is present, the fluid is often referred to as an invert emulsion, i.e., water-in-oil emulsion.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Water-based drilling fluids generally include viscosifiers, fluid loss control agents, weighting agents and other additives including lubricants, emulsifiers, corrosion inhibitors, salts and pH control agents. Water makes up the continuous phase of the fluid and is usually present in any amount of at least 50 volume percent of the entire composition. Oil may also be present in minor amounts but will typically not exceed the amount of the water so that the fluid will retain its character as a water continuous phase material.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various types of water-based drilling fluids may be used in drilling operations including potassium-based fluids, salt water-based fluids, seawater-based fluids, silicate-based fluids and lime-based fluids. Potassium-based fluids are the most widely accepted water-based fluid for drilling water-sensitive shales since potassium ions can attach to and stabilize clay surfaces and can also help hold the cuttings together to minimize dispersion into finer particles. Salt water-based fluids contain varying amounts of dissolved sodium chloride as a major component whereas seawater-based fluids are designed for offshore drilling whose make-up water is taken from the ocean. Silicate-based fluids contain sodium or potassium silicate as the inhibitive component while lime-based fluids are saturated with lime and calcium hydroxide.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Unfortunately, fluid loss from these water-based drilling fluids often occurs in the wellbore resulting in severe downhole problems. For example, an excessive amount of filter cake can build up on the walls of the wellbore causing the drill pipe to become stuck thus making it difficult to remove from the wellbore. Also, fluid loss may lead to sloughing and caving in of shale formations. Further, electrical logging of the wellbore can be adversely affected due to fluid loss.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various natural polymers (for e.g. cellulosic polymers, starches, modified starches, carboxymethylcellulose/polysaccharide) and synthetic polymers (for e.g. polyacrylamide and styrene/butadiene) are commonly added to control fluid loss from the water-based drilling fluids into the subterranean formations. However, some wellbores into which the water-based drilling fluids are pumped have relatively high downhole temperatures and/or pressures at which traditional fluid loss control agents are unstable. As such, traditional fluid loss control agents may fail to serve their purpose of providing fluid loss control downhole. Moreover, synthetic styrene/butadiene copolymers are known to cause formation damage.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As more and more challenging conditions are encountered in wellbore operations, there has arisen a need for improved fluid loss control agents which may be used in water-based drilling fluids to improve the drilling fluids tolerance to fluid loss at high temperatures and pressures with minimal or no effect on the drilling fluids rheological properties.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure provides a latex comprising a non-crosslinked copolymer of non-carboxylated monomers for use as a fluid loss control agent in a wellbore fluid.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a wellbore fluid including the fluid loss control agent of the present disclosure and a water-based fluid.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method for modifying the fluid loss properties of a water-based wellbore fluid including adding the fluid loss control agent of the present disclosure to the wellbore fluid.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In still another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method for conducting an oilfield operation including placing the wellbore fluid including the fluid loss control agent of the present disclosure and a water-based fluid into a wellbore.

For example, conventional methods can be used to prepare the wellbore fluids in a manner analogous to those normally used to prepare conventional wellbore fluids. In one representative procedure, a desired quantity of the water-based fluid, the latex comprising the non-crosslinked copolymer according to the present disclosure and any other remaining components are added sequentially or at the same time with continuous mixing. Formulation may take place prior to introducing the wellbore fluid into a wellbore and/or within a wellbore itself. Thus, in an embodiment, the wellbore fluid may be prepared at the wellsite. Alternatively, the wellbore fluid may be prepared offsite and transported to the well site before being placed into the wellbore.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0054">According to another embodiment, the wellbore fluid of the present disclosure can be placed into a wellbore and used to service the wellbore in accordance with suitable procedures. For example, when the intended use of the wellbore fluid is as a drilling fluid or drilling mud, the wellbore fluid can be circulated down through a hollow drill stem and out through a drill bit attached thereto while rotating the drill stem to thereby drill the wellbore. The drilling fluid can be flowed back to the surface in a circulatory repetitive path such as to lubricate the drill bit, deposit a filter cake on the walls of the wellbore and to continuously carry drill cuttings to the surface.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0055">In some embodiments, if sealing of a particular interval of the wellbore is needed, a solution of the wellbore fluid may be injected into such an interval, in addition to other intervals, such as in a pill. The wellbore fluids described herein may be used in conjunction with any drilling or completion operation. In particular, the wellbore fluid of the present disclosure may be injected into a work string, flow to bottom of the wellbore, and then out of the work string and into the annulus between the work string and the casing or wellbore. This treatment is typically referred to as a &#x201c;pill.&#x201d; The pill may be pushed by injection of other wellbore fluids such as completion fluids behind the pill to a position within the wellbore which is immediately above a portion of the subterranean formation where fluid loss is suspected. Injection of wellbore fluids into the wellbore is then stopped, and fluid loss will then move the pill toward the fluid loss location. Positioning the pill in a manner such as this is often referred to as &#x201c;spotting&#x201d; the pill. Injection of such pills is often through coiled tubing or by a process known as &#x201c;bullheading.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0061" num="0056">Thus, according to one embodiment, there is provided a method of reducing fluid loss in a wellbore comprising the step of adding to a wellbore fluid a latex comprising a non-crosslinked copolymer of non-carboxylated monomers in accordance with the present disclosure; and circulating the wellbore fluid during drilling of the wellbore.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0057">In another embodiment, there is provided a method of reducing fluid loss in a wellbore comprising the step of monitoring drilling fluid losses during drilling of the wellbore; and if fluid losses exceed an acceptable level, injecting a latex comprising the non-crosslinked copolymer of non-carboxylated monomers in accordance with the present disclosure into the wellbore.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0058">As noted above, upon introducing a wellbore fluid of the present disclosure into a wellbore, a filter cake may be formed which provides an effective sealing layer on the walls of the wellbore thereby preventing undesired invasion of fluid into the subterranean formation through which the wellbore is drilled. Filter cakes formed from wellbore fluids disclosed herein include copolymers of non-carboxylated monomers and may have unexpected properties. Such properties may include increased pressure blockage, reliability of blockage, and increased range of formation pore size that can be blocked. These filter cakes may provide filtration control across temperature ranges up to greater than 400&#xb0; F.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0059">Where the subterranean formation is a low permeability formation such as shales or clays, the filter cakes formed using the wellbore fluids and methods of the present disclosure prevent wellbore fluid loss and filtrate loss by effectively blocking at least some of the pores of the low permeation formation. This may allow for support of the formation by maintaining sufficient pressure differential between the wellbore fluid column and the pores of the wellbore. Further, the filter cakes formed by wellbore fluids of the present disclosure may effectively seal earthen formations. These filter cakes are stable at elevated temperatures, and may also effectively seal low permeability formations. Before taking the well into production, filter cake in the producing region may be removed, such as by using a variety of techniques known in the art. For example, filter cakes according to present disclosure may be removed using a breaker fluid comprising an acidic aqueous solution. Examples of acids that may be used include strong mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, and organic acids, such as citric acid, lactic acid, malic acid, acetic acid, and formic acid. The breaker fluid may have a pH below 4, or below 3 in another embodiment. In other embodiments, the filter cake may be removed using a breaker liquid comprising a natural polymer degrading enzyme, for example, a carbohydrase. Examples of such enzymes include amylases, pullulanases, and cellulases. In yet other embodiments, the filter cake may be removed using a washing liquid comprising an oxidizing agent, such as sodium hypochlorite.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0060">According to yet another embodiment, there is generally provided a method of drilling a wellbore through a subterranean rock formation including:</p><p id="p-0066" num="0061">a) pumping a drilling fluid comprising water-based fluid and a latex comprising a non-crosslinked copolymer according to the present disclosure into tubing placed in the wellbore and through nozzles in a drilling bit attached to a bottom end of the tubing while rotating the bit to detach cuttings from the rock formation;</p><p id="p-0067" num="0062">b) transporting the cuttings up an annulus between the tubing and wellbore wall, the cuttings transport being facilitated by the flow of the drilling fluid;</p><p id="p-0068" num="0063">c) using an apparatus to remove at least some of the cuttings from the drilling fluid after it exits the wellbore at the surface to form a cleaned drilling fluid;</p><p id="p-0069" num="0064">d) pumping the cleaned drilling fluid down the tubing again thereby repeating the process until the desired interval of the subterranean rock formation has been drilled.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0065">According to still another embodiment there is generally provided a method for completing a wellbore that penetrates through a porous and permeable subterranean formation comprising:</p><p id="p-0071" num="0066">a) pumping a completion fluid comprising a water-based fluid and a latex comprising a non-crosslinked copolymer according to the present disclosure into production tubing placed within the wellbore so that the formation fluid pressure and/or losses of completion fluid to the formation are controlled;</p><p id="p-0072" num="0067">b) performing the operations required to complete the well (such as perforating a casing, under-reaming (widening the wellbore diameter), fracturing the formation, placing gravel packs for the purpose of sand-control, installing sand screens, installing production tubing and packers);</p><p id="p-0073" num="0068">c) displacing the completion fluid from the production tubing; and</p><p id="p-0074" num="0069">d) allowing production to commence or injection to begin.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0070">According to still another embodiment, there is generally provided a method for of working over a wellbore that penetrates through a porous and permeable subterranean formation comprising:</p><p id="p-0076" num="0071">a) pumping a workover fluid comprising a water-based fluid and a latex comprising a non-crosslinked copolymer according to the present disclosure into production tubing placed within the wellbore so that a completed interval and production tubing is at least partly filled with the workover fluid;</p><p id="p-0077" num="0072">b) performing the operations required to repair the well (such as removing the production tubing, milling out the packer, sealing intervals that delivered unwanted high water-cut, re-perforating, fracturing the formation, placing gravel packs and or sand screens for the purpose of sand-control, installing new production tubing and packers);</p><p id="p-0078" num="0073">c) displacing the workover fluid from the production tubing; and</p><p id="p-0079" num="0074">d) allowing production to commence or injection to begin.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0080" num="0075">An exemplary latex comprising a non-crosslinked copolymer according to the present disclosure (&#x201c;Example 1&#x201d;) was added to several different wellbore fluids to determine its effects on fluid loss and rheology of the wellbore fluids.
