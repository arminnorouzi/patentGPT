id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a hydrophobized silica-based granular material, the preparation and the use thereof for thermal and acoustic insulation as well as the corresponding thermal insulating compositions thereof.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Effective thermal insulation of houses, industrial plants, pipelines and suchlike is an important economic problem. The majority of insulation materials based on organic substances, such as polyurethane foams, are combustible and only usable at relatively low temperatures. These disadvantages are not exhibited by the hitherto less widespread thermal insulating materials based on inorganic oxides, for example highly porous silicon dioxide.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">WO 2010126792 A2 discloses compositions with a thermal conductivity of not greater than 50 mW/(mK), comprising a silica aerogel component, a surfactant, either an inorganic or an inorganic binder-containing formulation, e.g. cement, gypsum, lime, acrylate, and optionally other components. Specifically, the high viscous mixture of cement/grout/acrylate/hydrophobic aerogel material with weight ratios of 0.24/0.28/0.15/0.33 can be cured in a mold to give a compound with thermal conductivity of 29.5 mW/(mK).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The use of hydrophobized silica particles as fillers in thermal insulation compositions based on the waterborne formulations is preferred compared to that of hydrophilic silicas. In the latter case, the pores of the silica material would readily be filled with a hydrophilic formulation and cannot impart additional thermal insulating properties to the final composition. The porous structure of the hydrophobized materials, on the contrary, remains intact upon mixing with waterborne formulations.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One technical problem with compositions comprising thermal-insulating silica-based granules is associated with fines. The presence of fines that are the particles with relatively small particle size in a formulation, normally lead to a rapid viscosity increase with increased amount of such particles added to the formulation. In the case if the composition needs to be applied via spray techniques, such fines must be separated beforehand, which means considerable material loss and additional efforts for solid particle handling. It is desirable to avoid the formation of such fines by minimizing attrition of silica-based granules during their incorporation into thermal-insulating compositions. This can be achieved by using more mechanically stable silica-based granules.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">WO 2006097668 A1 discloses a granular thermal insulation material comprising hydrophobic fumed silicon dioxide and an opacifier, which is produced by mixing a hydrophobic silicon dioxide with opacifier and subsequent densification to give granules having a size of 0.25 to 2.5 mm. Importantly, it is impossible or at least difficult to densify the hydrophobized silica powder to obtain granules of relatively low density useful for thermal insulation applications. Such granules comprising such hydrophobized silicas are usually not sufficiently mechanically stable or have relatively high tamped density of typically 250 to 450 g/L, which affect negatively their thermal insulation properties.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">EP 0725037 A1 describes granules having a median grain diameter of 10 to 120 &#x3bc;m, BET surface area of 40-400 m<sup>2</sup>/g, cumulative pore volume of &#x3e;2 nm of 0.5-2.5 mL/g, tamped density of 220-700 g/L based on hydrophobic fumed silica for use as a catalyst support. Granules of this kind are produced by spray-drying of aqueous dispersions containing hydrophilic silica, followed by optional thermal treatment and/or silanization at temperatures of 150 to 1100&#xb0; C. The examples 3, 4, and 8 show hydrophobized granules thermally treated at 700&#xb0; C. prior to hydrophobization with a silane. These granules show pore volume of 1.51-1.68 mL/g and tamped density of 300-420 g/L. Though being mechanically stable, such granules possess particular combination of physical properties, such as relatively high tamped density and relatively low pore volume, disadvantageous for using them in thermal insulation applications.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">WO 2017036744 A1 describes preparation of hydrophobized silica thermal insulating molding bodies, such as silica granules, by preparation a wet mixture containing silica powder, at least one binder, e.g. a silane, an organic solvent containing at most trace amounts of water, and evaporation of the solvent and granulation of the wet mixture. During the preparation of this wet mixture and/or during the granulation process, hydrophobization of silica takes place. The thus prepared granules are completely hydrophobized, e.g. contain a relatively low amount of free silanol groups on their surface. Moreover, such granules comprising hydrophobized silica can be insufficiently mechanically stable, as no additional densification is applied. This, in turn, reflects in their relatively low skeletal density, as determined by Hg porosimetry.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">WO 2018134275 A1 discloses a granular thermal insulation material with an increased mechanical stability, prepared by thermal treatment at 200-1200&#xb0; C. of a densified mixture of silica and at least one IR-opacifier followed by hydrophobization with a silane. The specific examples of this patent application show preparation of hydrophobized silica-based granules, wherein the hydrophobization step is carried out by treatment of hydrophilic granules with vapour of HMDS. The granules prepared in this way are mechanically stable. However, due to their relatively high hydrophobicity, it may be challenging to incorporate such granules into polar coating systems, e.g. water-based polymer compositions.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Hydrophobic silica powders can be prepared by treatment of the corresponding hydrophilic materials with silanes and optionally water, as described for example in EP 0686676 A1 or DE 102006039273 A1. Such hydrophobic silicas are usually characterized by their high hydrophobicity (high methanol wettability) and consequently, low compatibility with polar solvents. One conceivable way to improve the compatibility of such hydrophobized silica materials with polar systems would be to decrease the amount of silanes used for the hydrophobization. Thus, EP 1433749 A1 describes preparation of partially hydrophobic silicas having a silanol group density of 0.9-1.7 SiOH/nm<sup>2 </sup>particle surface, which can be incorporated into the water-based resins. The preparation of such partially hydrophobic particles is carried out by using a reduced amount of 0.015-0.15 mmol silane pro g of a silica with a BET surface area of 100 m<sup>2</sup>/g. The resulting silicas have a carbon content of 0.3-1% by weight and a relatively low methanol wettability (methanol number of 0-15). Thus, such silica particles are compatible with polar systems due to the absence of a major part of hydrophobic groups on its surface, but are much less hydrophobic. Considering the teaching of EP 0686676 A1, it seems to be generally impossible to have silica particles having both high hydrophobicity and a good compatibility with polar systems.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">EP 3447038 A1 relates to producing silica-based granules for thermal insulation, which are suitable for incorporation in water-based formulations. This good compatibility with water-based systems is achieved in EP 3447038 A1 by at least partial thermal degradation of hydrophobic groups present on the surface of the hydrophobized silica granules by applying a thermal treatment step. This approach, however, inevitably leads to a simultaneous reducing of hydrophobicity. Thus, methanol wettability of such thermally treated granules is significantly lower (20-30%) than that of the corresponding non-treated granules (40-45%). Achieving both high hydrophilicity and high hydrophobicity of the granules seems to be challenging starting from EP 3447038 A1.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problem and Solution</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, good compatibility of highly hydrophobic silica-based materials with typical waterborne coating formulations, such as waterborne acrylate formulations often remains a problem. Thus, silica particles hydrophobized with typical hydrophobic treatment reagents like hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) either remain separated out from the aqueous acrylate binder system upon mixing or form the cracks in the final cured coating film. Therefore, there is a need for new hydrophobized silica materials, particularly, mechanically stable granules, which would be compatible with waterborne formulations and would allow preparing of compositions with high silica material loading, good thermal insulation properties, high homogeneity before and after curing, and low cost.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The technical problem addressed by the present invention is that of providing a thermal insulating silica-based hydrophobized granular material with an increased mechanical stability, high hydrophobicity and with an increased polarity, and having a particle size distribution suitable for incorporation into polar systems, such as water-based thermal-insulation compositions. Such granular material should provide good thermal-insulating and rheological properties to the thermal-insulating composition it is incorporated into. These granules should also be obtainable in a simple and economically viable way. Another technical problem is to provide such thermal-insulation compositions with pronounced hydrophobic and water-repellent properties, which would efficiently hinder penetration of humidity through the coating layer and impart water and dirt-repelling, protective and anticorrosion properties to the treated surface.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It was found that all technical problems addressed above can efficiently be solved according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention provides silica-based granular material comprising silica and at least one IR-opacifier selected from the group consisting of silicon carbide, titanium dioxide, zirconium dioxide, ilmenites, iron titanates, iron oxides, zirconium silicates, manganese oxides, graphites, carbon blacks and mixtures thereof, hydrophobized with a surface treatment agent comprising a silicon atom, wherein the granular material has:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">a) a cumulative pore volume of pores&#x3e;4 nm of more than 2.5 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, as determined by the mercury intrusion method according to DIN ISO 15901-1;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">b) a tamped density of 140 g/L to 290 g/L;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">c) a number of silanol groups relative to BET surface area d<sub>SiOH </sub>of at least 0.5 SiOH/nm<sup>2</sup>, as determined by reaction with lithium aluminium hydride.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">d) a number of silicon atoms in the surface treatment agent relative to BET surface area d<sub>[Si]</sub> of at least 1.0 [Si atoms]/nm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The hydrophobized silica-based granular material according to the invention solves the above-mentioned technical problems.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The hydrophobized granular material according to the invention is mechanically stable and does not suffer from any substantial mechanical attrition during its handling and incorporation into liquid compositions. Moreover, such granular material is well compatible with waterborne formulations, which enables one to achieve high loading of such granules, for example in the thermal insulation compositions, providing simultaneously good thermal insulation properties, high homogeneity before and after curing. The insulating compositions with hydrophobized granular material of the invention can contain surprisingly high amounts of fine particles of the hydrophobized granular material and still possess relatively low viscosity. The low viscosity of such compositions does not preclude their easy application, e.g. via spay techniques onto the surfaces to be isolated. Additionally, there is no need to separate the fine particles before their incorporation into the liquid composition. Composition comprising the hydrophobized silica-based granular materials of the invention possess pronounced hydrophobic and water-repellent properties, which efficiently hinder penetration of humidity through the coating layer and impart water and dirt-repelling, protective and anticorrosion properties to such compositions.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The Granular Material</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the present invention, the terms &#x201c;granular material&#x201d;, &#x201c;granulate&#x201d; and &#x201c;granules&#x201d; are used as alternatives and are understood to mean a grainy, readily pourable, free-flowing particulate solid material.

Ed. 17 (1945) pp. 782-786 and pp 787-791, is based on measurement of the volume of mercury pressed into a porous solid body as a function of the pressure applied. Only the pores into which mercury can penetrate, i.e. generally the pores with a pore diameter of &#x3e;4 nm, at the maximal pressure applied, e.g. 417 MPa, are detected. Liquid mercury, not wetting the surface of a probe porous solid body, penetrates the pores only under pressure.

The IR-opacifier is selected from the group consisting of silicon carbide, titanium dioxide, zirconium dioxide, ilmenites, iron titanates, iron oxides, zirconium silicates, manganese oxides, graphites, carbon blacks and mixtures thereof.

The hydrophilic particles, by contrast, have a high affinity for polar media such as water. The hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic materials can typically be achieved by the application of appropriate nonpolar groups to the silica surface. The extent of the hydrophobicity of a hydrophobic oxide, e.g. silica can be determined via parameters including its methanol wettability, as described in detail, for example, in WO2011/076518 A1, pages 5-6. In pure water, a hydrophobic silica separates completely from the water and floats on the surface thereof without being wetted with the solvent. In pure methanol, by contrast, a hydrophobic silica is distributed throughout the solvent volume; complete wetting takes place. In the measurement of methanol wettability, a maximum methanol content at which there is still no wetting of the silica is determined in a methanol/water test mixture, meaning that 100% of the silica used remains separate from the test mixture after contact with the test mixture, in unwetted form. This methanol content in the methanol/water mixture in % by volume is called methanol wettability. The higher the level of such methanol wettability, the more hydrophobic the silica. The lower the methanol wettability, the lower the hydrophobicity and the higher the hydrophilicity of the material.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0086">The granular material of the present invention

The thermal insulating composition according to the invention can comprise at least one binder, which joins the individual parts of the cured composition to one another and optionally to one or more fillers and/or other additives and can thus improve the mechanical properties of the cured composition. Such a binder can contain organic or inorganic substances. The binder optionally contains reactive organic substances. Organic binders can, for example, be selected from the group consisting of (meth)acrylates, alkyd resins, epoxy resins, gum Arabic, casein, vegetable oils, polyurethanes, silicone resins, wax, cellulose glue and mixtures thereof. Such organic substances can lead to the curing of the thermal insulating composition used, for example by evaporation of the solvents, polymerization, crosslinking reaction or another type of physical or chemical transformation. Such curing can take place, for example, thermally or under the action of UV radiation or other radiation. Both single (one) component (1-C) and multicomponent systems, particularly two component systems (2-C) can be applied as binder. Particularly preferred for the present invention are water based or miscible with water (meth)acrylate based binders and epoxy resins (preferably as two-component systems).</p><p id="p-0169" num="0157">The most organic based binder materials like (meth)acrylates and epoxy resins have particular thermal limitations and cannot be used at temperatures above 150&#xb0; C. In contrast to that, the siloxane based materials (silicone resins) are generally more thermostable and can be applied up to the temperature of about 600&#xb0; C. without thermal degradation. Such organosiloxane binders (silicone resins) or hybrid systems containing silicone based and other organic ingredients are particularly preferred for the use in the composition of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0158">In addition to the organic binder or as an alternative thereto, the thermal insulating composition of the invention can contain inorganic curable substances. Such inorganic binders, also referred to as mineral binders, have essentially the same task as the organic binders, that of joining additive substances to one another. Furthermore, inorganic binders are divided into non-hydraulic binders and hydraulic binders. Non-hydraulic binders are water-soluble binders such as calcium lime, Dolomitic lime, gypsum and anhydrite, which only cure in air. Hydraulic binders are binders which cure in air and in the presence of water and are water-insoluble after the curing. They include hydraulic limes, cements, and masonry cements. The mixtures of different inorganic binders can also be used in the thermal insulating composition of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0159">The thermal insulating composition of the invention may comprise 10 to 90% by weight of a hydrophobized granular material and 10 to 90% by weight of the sum of binder and optionally present solvents, preferably water. The weight ratios of the hydrophobized granular material and of the binder/solvents in such a thermal insulating composition may significantly vary depending on the amount of water and/or other solvents present in the thermal insulating composition. Thus, in a ready for application (&#x201c;wet&#x201d;, &#x201c;liquid&#x201d;) thermal insulating composition, the ratio of the binder, which may contain water or other solvents, is normally higher. In this case, the thermal insulating composition of the present invention may contain 10% to 60% by weight, more preferably 15% to 50% by weight of the inventive hydrophobized granular material, and 40% to 90% by weight, more preferably 50% to 85% by weight of the sum of the solvents and an inorganic and/or an organic binder. After applying of such a &#x201c;wet&#x201d; thermal insulating composition onto the surface to be isolated, the solvents are usually at least partially removed, leaving a &#x201c;dried&#x201d;, usually solid thermal insulating composition containing 20% to 90% by weight, more preferably 30% to 70% by weight of the hydrophobized granular material of the invention, and 10% to 80% by weight, more preferably 20% to 60% by weight of an inorganic and/or an organic binder.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0160">The curing of the thermal insulating composition can be achieved by at least partial polymerization and/or removal of the solvent. Depending on the system used, this step can preferably take place at a temperature of from 0 to 500&#xb0; C., particularly preferably from 5 to 400&#xb0; C., very particularly preferably from 10 to 300&#xb0; C. The curing can take place in the presence of air or with exclusion of oxygen, for example under a protective-gas atmosphere of nitrogen or carbon dioxide. Said step can take place under standard pressure or under a reduced pressure, for example under vacuum.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0161">Apart from the hydrophobized granular material and the binder, the thermal insulating composition according to the invention can additionally contain at least one solvent and/or filler and/or other additives.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0162">The solvent used in the composition of the invention can be selected from the group consisting of water, alcohols, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, esters, aldehydes, ketones and the mixtures thereof. For example, the solvent used can be water, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentane, hexane, benzene, toluene, xylene, diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, ethyl acetate, and acetone. Particularly preferably, the solvents used in the thermal insulating composition have a boiling point of less than 300&#xb0; C., particularly preferably less than 200&#xb0; C. Such relatively volatile solvents can be easily evaporated or vaporized during the curing of the thermal insulating composition according to the invention. Most preferably, the thermal insulating composition of the invention contain water as a sole solvent.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0163">In one embodiment of the invention, a mixture of the hydrophobized granular material of the invention, preferably based on fumed silica, and of a hydrophobized silica aerogel granular material is employed in a thermal insulating composition. In such case, the ratio of the hydrophobized granular material of the invention to aerogel material is preferably from 10:1 to 1:1, by weight.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0164">The thermal conductivity of the thermal insulating composition, measured according to EN 12667:2001 by the method with the guarded hot plate and the heat flow meter instrument, at a mean measurement temperature of 10&#xb0; C., a contact pressure of 250 Pa under an air atmosphere and at standard pressure (1 atm), is preferably less than 70 mW/(mK), more preferably less than 50 mW/(mK), more preferably from 10 mW/(mK) to 45 mW/(mK), especially preferably from 15 mW/(mK) to 40 mW/(mK) and most preferably from 20 mW/(mK) to 35 mW/(mK).</p><p id="p-0177" num="0165">Use of the Granular Material and of the Thermal Insulating Composition</p><p id="p-0178" num="0166">The hydrophobized granular material according to the invention and/or the thermal insulating composition based thereon can in general be used for thermal and/or acoustic insulation, particularly for the acoustic and/or thermal insulating of walls, roofs, houses and thermal insulating of industrial plants, parts of industrial apparatuses, tanks, process pipes, ducts, pipelines and suchlike.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0167">The thermal insulating composition comprising the granular of the invention can be applied on the surface to be isolated by any suitable method, such as brushing, spraying, troweling, immersion coating etc.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0180" num="0168">Analytical Methods.
