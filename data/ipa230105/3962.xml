id="p-0001" num="0000">An optical element driving unit includes a stationary body, a carrier, a supporting mechanism and an electromagnetic driving assembly. The supporting mechanism is connected to the carrier and the stationary body and provides the carrier with a degree of freedom of movement relative to the stationary body. The carrier can be driven to move by the electromagnetic driving assembly. The electromagnetic driving assembly includes a driving coil, a driving magnet and a ferromagnetic element. The driving coil is disposed on the carrier. The driving magnet is disposed on the stationary body. The ferromagnetic element is one-piece formed and embedded in the carrier, and the ferromagnetic element includes a magnetic field guiding part and an electrical connection part. The magnetic field guiding part faces the driving coil and/or the driving magnet. The electrical connection part is exposed on a surface of the carrier and electrically connected to the driving coil.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img

Therefore, featuring high image quality becomes one of the indispensable features of an optical system nowadays. Furthermore, due to the rapid changes in technology, electronic devices equipped with optical systems are trending towards multi-functionality for various applications, and therefore the functionality requirements for the optical systems have been increasing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, there is an increasing demand for electronic devices featuring compact size, but conventional optical systems are difficult to meet both the requirements of high image quality and compactness. Conventional camera modules usually have functionalities such as auto focus, optical image stabilization and optical zoom. However, in order to achieve the above functionalities, the structure of the camera modules becomes more complex and the size thereof also increases, and thus, the size of electronic devices equipped with the camera modules also increases. Usually, it is difficult to install a driving mechanism that can effectively drive optical elements to move in a limited storage space of a conventional optical lens system, so that the requirement of miniaturization of the optical lens system may be compromised in order to increase the storage space for the driving mechanism to be installed therein and thereby an effective driving force for driving the optical elements can be provided by the driving mechanism.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one aspect of the present disclosure, an optical element driving unit includes a stationary body, a carrier, a supporting mechanism and an electromagnetic driving assembly.

id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the following detailed description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the disclosed embodiments. It will be apparent, however, that one or more embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are schematically shown in order to simplify the drawing.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The present disclosure provides an optical element driving unit. The optical element driving unit includes a stationary body, a carrier, a supporting mechanism and an electromagnetic driving assembly. The carrier is configured for at least one optical element to be disposed thereon, and the carrier has at least one degree of freedom of movement relative to the stationary body. The optical element can be a lens element, a mirror, a light shielding element, a prism or a filter. Furthermore, the carrier can be considered, for example, a lens carrier and a prism carrier in accordance with the type of optical element. Moreover, the stationary body can be, for example, a casing, a platform, or another carrier served as a basis for the aforementioned carrier. The supporting mechanism is connected to the carrier and the stationary body, and the supporting mechanism provides the carrier with said at least one degree of freedom of movement relative to the stationary body.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The electromagnetic driving assembly is configured to move the carrier relative to the stationary body. The electromagnetic driving assembly includes a driving coil, a driving magnet and a ferromagnetic element. The driving coil is disposed on the carrier. The driving magnet is disposed on the stationary body and disposed corresponding to the driving coil. The ferromagnetic element is embedded in the carrier, such that the ferromagnetic element with the carrier enjoys the at least one degree of freedom of movement. Moreover, the ferromagnetic element can be integrally formed with the carrier. Specifically, the ferromagnetic element can be embedded in the carrier via, for example, insert molding process. However, the present disclosure is not limited to the above manner. In some other configurations, the ferromagnetic element can be embedded in the carrier (thermoplastic carrier) by, for example, hot riveting process. The ferromagnetic element is one-piece formed and includes a magnetic field guiding part and a first electrical connection part. The magnetic field guiding part faces at least one of the driving coil and the driving magnet. The first electrical connection part is exposed on the surface of the carrier. The first electrical connection part is electrically connected to the driving coil. Therefore, the ferromagnetic element has both functions of magnetic field guidance and circuit connection, so that the number of components of the optical element driving unit can be minimized so as to increase manufacturing efficiency.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to the present disclosure, by adding an electrically conductive ferromagnetic element disposed on the carrier, the optical element driving unit can guide the magnetic field distribution of the electromagnetic driving assembly so as to increase the driving force and improve the arrangement of the driving coil in a limited space while satisfying the requirement of electrical connection of the driving coil, so that the design flexibility can be increased.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The driving magnet can have a corresponsive surface facing both the magnetic field guiding part and the driving coil, and the magnetic field guiding part is located farther away from the corresponsive surface than the driving coil to the corresponsive surface. Therefore, owing to the arrangement described above, the magnetic field distribution of the driving magnet can be properly guided so as to increase the magnetic flux through the driving coil.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The magnetic field guiding part of the ferromagnetic element can be surrounded by the driving coil. Therefore, owing to the arrangement described above, the magnetic field guiding part can be magnetized by the driving coil so as to increase the magnetic field intensity of the driving coil.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The supporting mechanism can include a flat spring, and the flat spring is electrically conductive. The ferromagnetic element can further include a second electrical connection part. The second electrical connection part is connected to the flat spring, and the flat spring and the driving coil are electrically connected in series via the second electrical connection part and the first electrical connection part. Therefore, the driving coil and the flat spring can be prevented from direct contact with each other, which may affect the flatness of the flat spring, so as to increase assembly yield rate; furthermore, the arrangements of the flat spring and the driving coil in a limited space can be improved while satisfying the requirement of electrical connections of the flat spring and the driving coil, so that the design flexibility can be increased.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The second electrical connection part can include a contact portion and an elastic portion. The contact portion is in physical contact with the flat spring, and the elastic portion is connected to the contact portion and constantly exerts an elastic force on the contact portion towards the flat spring. Therefore, the electrical connection between the ferromagnetic element and the flat spring can be achieved and the warpage of flat spring occurring during a welding process can be prevented so as to increase assembly yield rate.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The carrier can include a barrel part and a mounting part. The optical element is disposed on the barrel part, and the barrel part, the supporting mechanism, the driving coil and the ferromagnetic element are all disposed on the mounting part. Therefore, the optical element can be disposed on the barrel part first, and then, the optical elements and the barrel part are together disposed on the mounting part so as to improve manufacturing process. However, the present disclosure is not limited to the above configuration where the carrier is a two-piece component. In some other embodiments, the carrier can be one-piece formed by injection molding process, and the carrier includes an inner surface in physical contact with the optical element. Therefore, assembly errors can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The ferromagnetic element can be formed with a shearing surface, a tearing surface and a cutting surface by stamping process. The tearing surface is opposite to the shearing surface, and the cutting surface is connected to the shearing surface and the tearing surface. Moreover, the driving coil is not in physical contact with the tearing surface. In a stamping process, the ferromagnetic element is formed with a shearing surface, a tearing surface opposite to the shearing surface and a cutting surface connected to the shearing surface and the tearing surface. There is a roll-over at the intersection of the shearing surface and the cutting surface formed due to shaping deformation, and there is a burr at the intersection of the tearing surface and the cutting surface formed due to the tear during fracture. Therefore, by the design that the driving coil is arranged not in physical contact with the tearing surface of the first electrical connection part, the risk of the driving coil being cut off by the burr can be prevented. Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>, which show a ferromagnetic element ME formed by stamping process. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>, a sheet metal SHM is cut off during a cutting process by a punch PU and a die LD so as to form the ferromagnetic element ME. Please also refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>, which is an enlarged view of region EL<b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>. As seen, the ferromagnetic element ME has a roll-over DR formed due to shaping deformation at the intersection of the shearing surface SS and the cutting surface CS, and a burr BR formed due to the tear during fracture at the intersection of the tearing surface TS and the cutting surface CS after the stamping process.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The first electrical connection part of the ferromagnetic element can be disposed on a bar structure of the carrier. The part of the tearing surface located at the first electrical connection part faces the bar structure, and the part of the shearing surface located at the first electrical connection part is in physical contact with the driving coil. Therefore, the tearing surface facing and covering the carrier can prevent the driving coil form being cut off by the burr. Moreover, the driving coil can include two wire ends, and one of the wire ends surrounds the bar structure and is in physical contact with the shearing surface of the first electrical connection part so as to achieve electrical connection. Therefore, when the wire end is fixed on the bar structure, the electrical connection between the driving coil and the ferromagnetic element is also achieved at the same time, thereby reducing assembly steps.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The optical element driving unit can further include a light blocking layer disposed on the ferromagnetic element. Furthermore, at least one part of the ferromagnetic element can be not covered by the carrier, and the light blocking layer is disposed on the part of the ferromagnetic element not covered by the carrier. Therefore, light can be prevented from being reflected by the ferromagnetic element, so that optical properties may not be affected. For instance, in the imaging optical module, light reflected by the ferromagnetic element may cause flare and thus affect image quality. Moreover, the light blocking layer can also work as a damping layer having a damping function. In one configuration, the carrier can have a glue recess at which the exposed part of the ferromagnetic element is located, and the light blocking layer can be a damper disposed in the glue recess, such that the vibration of the carrier in movement can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The optical element driving unit can further include an electrical insulating barrier layer disposed on the ferromagnetic element. Furthermore, at least one part of the ferromagnetic element can be not covered by the carrier, and the electrical insulating barrier layer is disposed on the part of the ferromagnetic element not covered by the carrier.
