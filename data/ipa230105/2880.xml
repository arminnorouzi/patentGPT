PVD involves vaporization of a material that then condenses on a surface, forming a coating layer. PVD can result in the deposit of macroparticles, which are often considered a defect. The macroparticles may be loosely bound to the coated layer. Mechanical processes can be used to remove these macroparticles, but removal leaves pinholes, which are also often considered defects. For example, cathodic arc evaporation (CAE), a form of PVD, involving a high current, low voltage arc on the surface of a cathodic target produces macroparticles. Because macroparticles and pinholes are recognized as defects, great effort to eliminate or reduce the size and quantity of macroparticles is afforded.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Coatings with bioactive properties can be useful for various purposes. Bioactive refers to a material having biological effects or physiological effects on living things. For example, a bioactive material includes a material resulting in a modification in the normal biological function or a physiological mechanism of a living thing. Bioactive, as used herein, includes beneficial and detrimental effects to microorganisms or modifications to the normal functioning of a microorganism. One common bioactive material is antimicrobial substances. Antimicrobial coatings serve many purposes. Generally, antimicrobial coatings inhibit the growth or kill microbes like viral, bacterial or fungal organisms. One particularly relevant example includes preventing the spread of communicable diseases by the use of antimicrobial materials. Antimicrobial materials may also serve hygienic purposes. The desire to prevent the spread of disease and for heightened hygiene has resulted in significant efforts to develop antimicrobial materials. The use of antimicrobial materials in health care facilities and health treatments can provide significant benefits. Health facilities, such as hospitals, present unique environments that combine high concentrations of germs and individuals with vulnerable immunities. Therefore, facilities such as hospitals greatly benefit from antimicrobial surfaces. Antimicrobial materials for medical equipment can reduce the burden of disinfecting and prevent the spread of disease. Further, affordable antimicrobial surfaces could present benefits on any surface that comes into contact with living things. For example, surfaces involved in cooking or commonly touched surfaces like doorknobs could greatly benefit from antimicrobial properties. Even primarily decorative surfaces, if affordable, could benefit from antimicrobial characteristics and assist in inhibiting the spread and growth of harmful or undesirable antimicrobial life.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">But producing antimicrobial materials can be difficult and expensive. Further, antimicrobial properties may have other undesirable properties. For example, some antimicrobial materials may be too soft. Other antimicrobial materials may have poor abrasion resistance. Microban&#xae; is an antimicrobial coating that includes silver particles dispersed in an organic matrix. Antimicrobial coatings involving an organic matrix may have the aesthetic appearance of paint. In some applications, the appearance of paint may be undesirable. Some antimicrobial coatings may use nanoparticle vapor deposition to deposit nanoparticles with antimicrobial properties on the surface of a coating. For example, ABACO&#xae; from Protec, is an antimicrobial coating using nanoparticles. However, the use of nanoparticles can be complex and expensive. Further such coatings may have delicate surfaces or poor abrasion resistance. Another example of antimicrobial materials includes various metals. For example, silver is known to have antimicrobial properties. However, as stated above silver can be expensive, and its properties may not be suitable for many applications. For example, the appearance or abrasion resistance of silver may be unsuitable for certain applications.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a need for an antimicrobial coating that solves one or more of these problems or offers an alternative to current antimicrobial materials.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In at least one aspect, a bioactive coated substrate is provided.
