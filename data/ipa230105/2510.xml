There are two directions to increase the energy density, one of which is to develop active materials with high energy density such as high-nickel material, silicon-carbon material, and silicon-oxide material; the other of which is to reduce an application amount of additives in a slurry system, so as to increase an addition amount of the active materials, for example, by using a conductive agent with high conductivity, an adhesive with high viscosity, a dispersant having good dispersing performance and the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Lithium carboxymethyl cellulose plays roles of stabilizing a slurry, dispersing active substances and assisting adhering in a preparation of the slurry of a negative electrode plate of a lithium-ion battery. However, the lithium carboxymethyl cellulose belongs to a polymer material having poorer conductive performance, which may inhibit an exhibition of the electrochemical performance of the active substances while coated on the active substances. Furthermore, the viscosity of the existing lithium carboxymethyl cellulose is limited, therefore the addition amount is larger, usually 1.0% to 1.5%, which further increases the production cost, moreover, a performance in carboxymethyl cellulose still has much space for promotion.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of this, the present application provides a lithium carboxymethyl cellulose with high viscosity, which can reduce an application amount of the lithium carboxymethyl cellulose in preparing a negative electrode plate of a lithium-ion battery, and can promote an energy density and an electrochemical performance of the lithium-ion battery.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to achieve the above-described object, the present application firstly provides a preparation method for a high-viscosity lithium carboxymethyl cellulose, comprising the following steps:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">mixing a cellulose, a cross-linking agent, and a sodium hydroxide solution in an ethanol solution, filling with nitrogen gas to form an inert atmosphere after vacuumizing to remove air, performing an alkalization reaction under the inert atmosphere, subjecting a reaction product to an etherification under normal pressure to obtain a crude CMC-Na;
