Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of ON-to-OFF time of a pass transistor rather than by power dissipation, as in linear power supplies, resulting in high power conversion efficiency. Switched-mode power supplies may also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear power supply, and accordingly are quite useful in portable electronic devices.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The characteristic switching operation of an SMPS means that the output voltage of the SMPS is not flat, but includes a ripple voltage. A ripple voltage is very undesirable when powering noise-sensitive circuitry, such as radio frequency (RF) circuitry. Accordingly, the output of an SMPS is generally regulated to essentially eliminate the ripple voltage.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of a prior art electronic circuit <b>100</b> powered by an SMPS <b>102</b>. As illustrated, the SMPS <b>102</b> outputs a supply voltage <b>104</b> that includes a ripple voltage. A low drop-out (LDO) regulator <b>106</b> having a sufficiently high Power Supply Rejection Ratio filters out the SMPS output voltage ripples and provides an essentially constant DC power output voltage <b>108</b>. The &#x201c;clean&#x201d; voltage output from the LDO regulator <b>106</b> may then be provided to noise-sensitive circuitry <b>110</b>, which may be, for example, RF circuitry including mixers, low noise amplifiers (LNAs), phase locked loops (PLLs), voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs), etc.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An LDO regulator is a DC linear voltage regulator that can regulate an output voltage even when the supply voltage is very close to the output voltage. LDO regulators avoid switching noise (as no switching takes place), generally have a small device size (as neither large inductors nor transformers are needed), and often have a relatively simple circuit architecture (usually comprising a voltage reference, an amplifier, and a pass transistor).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A trend in the power supply industry has been to increase the switching frequency of SMPSs embodied (at least in part) in integrated circuits (ICs) in order to scale down the size of needed inductors and reduce the die area required for the SMPS. For example, the trend has been to move from a switching frequency of about 100 kHz to about 1 MHz. However, high switching frequencies lead to high frequency output ripple voltage, which must be filtered out when powering noise-sensitive circuitry. Accordingly, an LDO regulator <b>106</b> must have a very high Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR), which is a conventional measure of the capability of an LDO regulator <b>106</b> to suppress any power supply variations to its output signal.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One way of achieving high PSRR (and thus low noise) in an LDO regulator is to couple two or more LDO stages in a series cascade. Each LDO stage provides moderate isolation from the input power supplied by an SMPS. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a prior art embodiment of a 2-stage LDO regulator <b>200</b>. Stage 1 of the LDO regulator <b>200</b> is a dependent stage that includes a secondary reference voltage source <b>202</b>, such as a voltage buffer, coupled to a primary reference voltage input <b>204</b>, such as an on-chip band gap voltage source or an off-chip reference voltage source (e.g., supplied by another chip or stable voltage source via a die pin). The output of the reference voltage source <b>202</b>, V<sub>REF1</sub>, is applied to a relatively large input decoupling capacitor C<sub>REF1 </sub>and to the control input of a conventional LDO circuit, LDO<b>1</b>. A power input, V<sub>IN</sub>, to LDO<b>1</b> is the supply voltage <b>104</b> of an SMPS (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). A decoupling capacitor C<sub>LDO1 </sub>filters noise from the output, V<sub>LDO1</sub>, of LDO<b>1</b>, supplies instant demand of LDO<b>1</b> output currents, and provides a charge reservoir for smoothing the output against switching loads.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Stage 2 of the LDO regulator <b>200</b> is the output stage of the LDO regulator <b>200</b>, and includes a conventional LDO circuit, LDO<b>2</b>, having a control input coupled to the primary reference voltage input <b>204</b> and to a relatively large input decoupling capacitor C<sub>REF2</sub>. The output, V<sub>LDO1</sub>, of LDO<b>1</b> from Stage 1 is coupled as the power input to LDO<b>2</b>. A decoupling capacitor C<sub>LDO2 </sub>filters noise from the output, V<sub>LDO2</sub>, of LDO<b>2</b>, supplies instant demand of LDO<b>2</b> output currents, and provides a charge reservoir for smoothing the output against switching loads. The output, V<sub>LDO2</sub>, of LDO<b>2</b> is an essentially constant DC power output voltage <b>108</b> at a circuit output V<sub>OUT</sub>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The various capacitors shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> are typically implemented as off-chip components, but in some applications may be on-chip. In some variants, REF<b>1</b> may be independent of REF<b>2</b>, but care would need to be taken to let Stage 1 power up before Stage 2 in order to provide adequate power to Stage 2.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The overall PSRR of a multi-stage LDO regulator is the sum (in dB) of the PSRR of the individual LDO stages. Thus, for the 2-stage LDO regulator <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, PSRR<sub>total </sub>(dB)=PSRR<sub>LDO1</sub>+PSRR<sub>LDO2</sub>. By cascading LDO stages, each stage need not guarantee a high PSRR by itself, and accordingly its design trade-offs can be relaxed. For example, DC gain per stage can be lower than for a single LDO, which allows for an increase in bandwidth per stage, which is desirable for extending high PSRR to high frequencies (e.g., about 1 MHz).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In high PSRR/low noise LDO regulator designs, it is usually required that the reference voltage inputs for the LDOs be filtered with relatively large input decoupling capacitors, such as C<sub>REF1 </sub>and C<sub>REF2 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The presence and size of the input decoupling capacitors results in relatively slow power up and power down times for the reference voltage source, and hence for the multi-stage LDO regulator <b>200</b> as a whole. Similarly, the presence and size of the output decoupling capacitors (e.g., C<sub>LDO1 </sub>and C<sub>LDO2 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which may be of similar capacitance value as the input decoupling capacitors C<sub>REF1 </sub>and C<sub>REF2 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), along with a typically poor ability of LDO circuits to sink current at their outputs, results in relatively slow LDO output discharge times for each LDO shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and hence for the multi-stage LDO regulator <b>200</b> as a whole. (Note that &#x201c;power down time&#x201d; and &#x201c;discharge time&#x201d; are used interchangeably and to mean any condition in which the output voltage is required to be reduced, thereby requiring charge on the output decoupling capacitors to be sinked to a reference node).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a graph <b>300</b> showing voltages V<sub>REF2</sub>, V<sub>REF1</sub>, V<sub>LDO1</sub>, and V<sub>LDO2 </sub>as a function of time for an example modeled embodiment of the multi-stage LDO regulator <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. When enabled, the primary or &#x201c;lead&#x201d; voltage reference V<sub>REF2 </sub>at capacitor C<sub>REF2 </sub>in Stage 2 ramps up sharply (&#x2dc;0.02 sec) from zero volts to a maximum value (&#x2dc;2.4V in this example), which defines a &#x201c;charge&#x201d; period starting at dotted line <b>302</b>. The secondary voltage reference V<sub>REF1 </sub>at capacitor C<sub>REF1 </sub>in Stage 1 is relatively slow (&#x2dc;0.5 sec.) to ramp up from zero volts to a maximum value (&#x2dc;1.3V in this example). As a result, the output voltage at capacitor V<sub>LDO1 </sub>in Stage 1 is relatively slow (&#x2dc;0.65 sec.) to ramp up from zero volts to a maximum value (&#x2dc;2.8V in this example), and the output voltage at capacitor V<sub>LDO2 </sub>in Stage 2 is relatively slow (&#x2dc;0.5 sec.) to ramp up from zero volts to a maximum value (&#x2dc;2.4V in this example).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Similarly, during a &#x201c;discharge&#x201d; period starting at dotted line <b>304</b>, the primary voltage reference V<sub>REF2 </sub>at capacitor C<sub>REF2 </sub>in Stage 2 decays fairly rapidly, but the rates of decay of the voltages V<sub>REF1</sub>, V<sub>LDO1</sub>, and V<sub>LDO2 </sub>are slower and all different from the rate of decay of the primary voltage reference V<sub>REF2</sub>, owing to the varying discharge rates of associated capacitors.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Fast power up and power down times for a multi-stage LDO regulator are desirable in order to meet the needs of downstream powered circuitry, which may be specified by a product developer as expecting power within a set amount of time after the LDO regulator is enabled, and as expecting power to be absent (off) a set amount of time after the LDO regulator is disabled. Accordingly, there is a need for a multi-stage LDO regulator that exhibits fast power up and power down times. The present invention meets this and other needs.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention encompasses circuits and methods that provide for fast power up and power down times in a multi-stage low drop-out (LDO) regulator.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, a multi-stage LDO regulator circuit includes a primary reference voltage input; a dependent LDO stage including a secondary reference voltage source coupled to the primary reference voltage input, and an associated LDO circuit including (1) a control input coupled to an input capacitor and to the secondary reference voltage source; (2) an output coupled to an output capacitor; (3) a power input configured to be coupled to a voltage source external to the LDO regulator circuit; and (4) an input transconductance amplifier configured to charge and/or discharge the input capacitor to achieve a desired charge level within a specified time independently of the value of the input capacitor; and an output LDO stage coupled to the primary reference voltage input and including an associated LDO circuit including (1) a control input coupled to an input capacitor and to the primary reference voltage input, (2) an output coupled to an output capacitor, and (3) a power input coupled to the output of the dependent LDO stage.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, an output transconductance amplifier is coupled and configured to charge and/or discharge the output capacitor to achieve a desired charge level within a specified time independently of the value of the output capacitor.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In general, the transconductance amplifiers of each stage are configured to charge and/or discharge an associated capacitor in synchronism with a voltage present on the primary reference voltage input.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.

In multi-stage LDO regulators, such embodiments need to be designed with care. For example, the reference voltage sources may be coupled to different capacitor values, or may be coupled to the same capacitor values but have different output impedances, which in either case could lead to very different power up and power down times for the capacitive nodes and thus of the multi-stage LDO regulator as a whole. As another example, a multi-stage LDO regulator tends to be designed as a Class A amplifier, which provides a weak and not well controlled discharge strength for the output voltage side of the regulator. Embodiments of the present invention are therefore designed to adapt the current flowing to or from certain capacitive nodes so as to charge or discharge those nodes within the same time period independently of the capacitor values and independently of the output impedance of the reference voltage sources.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram of a first embodiment of a fast power up/down multi-stage LDO regulator circuit <b>400</b>. The circuit <b>400</b> is similar in structure to the 2-stage LDO regulator <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and functions in the same manner after power up and before power down. However, to provide for a fast power up and/or power down capability, a transconductance amplifier (also known as a &#x201c;Gm amplifer&#x201d;) <b>402</b><i>a</i>, <b>402</b><i>b</i>, <b>402</b><i>c</i>, is coupled to one or more capacitive nodes to be rapidly charged and/or discharged. A Gm amplifier sources or sinks a current proportional to a difference in voltage of its two inputs. In some embodiments, one or both of the inputs to a Gm amplifier may be scaled (e.g., by a resistive divider) to bias the output of the Gm amplifier.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a symbolic depiction of a typical Gm amplifier <b>500</b>.

In some embodiments, the Gm amplifier <b>500</b> has an ENABLE input configured to receive a control signal that selectively enables or disables the Gm amplifier <b>500</b>. As a person of ordinary skill will understand, the Gm amplifiers <b>402</b><i>a</i>, <b>402</b><i>b</i>, <b>402</b><i>c </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> are typically disabled in normal operation to ensure that their outputs do not compete or conflict with the output of any LDO stage.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a graph showing the output I<sub>OUT </sub>of the Gm amplifier <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> as a function of V<sub>POS</sub>&#x2212;V<sub>NEG </sub>(graph line <b>501</b>). In a range bracketed by the dotted lines <b>502</b><i>a</i>, <b>502</b><i>b</i>, I<sub>OUT </sub>is directly proportional to V<sub>POS</sub>&#x2212;V<sub>NEG</sub>. The proportionality factor is called the transconductance, Gm, of the device, and is essentially the slope of graph line <b>501</b> between the dotted lines <b>502</b><i>a</i>, <b>502</b><i>b</i>.
