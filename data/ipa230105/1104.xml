No. 62/939,275, filed Nov. 22, 2019, entitled &#x201c;Device and Method for Standardizing Site Assessment of Catheter Insertion Site&#x201d;, the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates generally to a system and method for site assessments of catheter insertion site and/or dressing.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Catheter site assessments are routine observations performed by nurses (or physicians, technicians, and other clinicians) on patients that have an intravenous catheter (peripheral or central). The nurse inspects the catheter insertion site to confirm: the catheter is patent and functioning; the catheter is properly in place and has not been dislodged; the dressing is secure, is not peeling, dirty or other compromised; and the skin around the catheter insertion site is not discolored, warm, or soft.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Site assessments are instrumental in detecting if there are any catheter-related complications (including infiltrations, extravasations, phlebitis, dislodgement, etc.) or local site infections. These assessments are expected to be performed at a fixed frequency, depending on the type of catheter, infusate, and patient-specific risk factors. For example, infusing vancomycin (a venous irritant) through a peripheral IV catheter (PIVC) requires a nurse to assess the catheter site every 2 hours to ensure there is no infiltration. The site assessments can be performed as a standalone observation or as part of another procedure (medication delivery, dressing change, overall patient assessments etc.). The site assessments are documented in the electronic medical record (EMR).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Site assessments typically involve the following: inspecting the IV catheter insertion site for redness, swelling, or bruising (the patient's other extremity may be utilized for comparison); assessing for tenderness and swelling through palpating the skin around the catheter site; assessing the condition of the transparent catheter dressing, including if it is clean, dry, and securely adhered to the skin around the insertion site; assessing if any additional securement is used to keep the dressing intact (e.g. additional tape, bandages etc.); assessing the catheter for patency, typically by flushing the catheter with saline or heparin; and assessing products used to secure and stabilize the catheter (particularly for central lines). In the EMR, the nurse will also document the reasons for continuing to use the catheter, and assess for signs of infiltration, phlebitis, dislodgement, and migration.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are several challenges with site assessments, including: site assessments are inherently subjective, and depends heavily on the observer's awareness and experience; a less experienced floor nurse may observe a site to appear normal while a trained nurse may spot early signs of infiltration or phlebitis; patient-specific factors (e.g. skin color, skin folds, natural discoloration) can confound results; variability in products used to secure and stabilize catheters, leading to variable catheter-related outcomes; little data or evidence to help nurses identify what is an acceptable versus unacceptable catheter site (e.g. how much dressing peeling is acceptable, how much local redness is acceptable); due to documentation overload, nurses may copy and paste assessments, without even observing it on the patient; high frequency site assessments create a workflow and documentation burden for the nurse, which increases likelihood of resorting to short-cuts; and site-assessments are not tracked or validated for accuracy since the only data available is that documented by the nurse in the EMR. There is also an opportunity to evaluate if site assessments can be used as predictors of an impending catheter-related complication, including comparison of a site over time to enable earlier detecting of complications.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect or embodiment, a method for site assessments of a catheter insertion site and/or dressing includes: scanning the catheter insertion site and/or dressing with an image capture device and/or sensor; selecting a patient baseline site location and skin tone; recording a baseline condition using a computing device; determining a site assessment rate using a computing device; prompting a clinician to make a site assessment of the catheter insertion site and/or dressing using a computing device; and recording site assessment information in an electronic medical record using a computing device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The method may further include: scanning a proposed catheter insertion site prior to insertion of a catheter with the image capture device and/or sensor.

Additionally, two units may be in communication with each other even though the information transmitted may be modified, processed, relayed, and/or routed between the first and second unit. For example, a first unit may be in communication with a second unit even though the first unit passively receives information and does not actively transmit information to the second unit. As another example, a first unit may be in communication with a second unit if at least one intermediary unit (e.g., a third unit located between the first unit and the second unit) processes information received from the first unit and communicates the processed information to the second unit. In some non-limiting embodiments, a message may refer to a network packet (e.g., a data packet and/or the like) that includes data. It will be appreciated that numerous other arrangements are possible.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, systems and methods for site assessments of a catheter insertion site and/or dressing are shown. The system may provide a clinician with pre-defined images of sites for the clinician to simply pick the image that is closest to the site on the patient they are observing. This will allow images to be tied to a standard scale, and enable analytics to tie scale to outcome. This will further enable earlier intervention if it is found that certain types of site issues lead to negative outcomes (e.g. peeling of dressing). For example, one or more of the categories currently described in the EMR (e.g. dressing status as &#x201c;clean, dry, intact&#x201d; vs &#x201c;clean, intact, with new drainage&#x201d;, etc., Phlebitis Grading Scale, infiltration) will have images to illustrate to the clinician what each subcategory grade is visualized as. To further enable this scale to standardize assessments, different images may be provided to illustrate different skin tones or placement on the body (e.g. placement on a patient's hand versus in the area of inflection on their elbow may look different).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, a system <b>10</b> for site assessments of a catheter insertion site and/or dressing <b>12</b> may include one or more image capture devices <b>14</b>, one or more sensors <b>16</b>, and one or more computing devices <b>18</b> in communication with the one or more image capture device <b>14</b> and the one or more sensors <b>16</b>.

The reference marker(s) <b>20</b> could further serve as a reference for surface compressibility of the skin and potentially have areas of defined compressibility that enables calibration of a tissue density measurement device. The reference marker(s) <b>20</b> may be incorporated into a full dressing, a full dressing overlay, a dressing frame, and/or a dressing sticker.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The system <b>10</b> may include the following: image capture (optical, thermal, depth, etc.); density/stiffness meter; capture of other parameters e.g. reflectance, refraction of light (to assess wetness); spectroscopic features which can be used for color calibration, or indicate infective or immune processes; stereoscopic imaging, radar, or other 3D depth techniques, to determine a three dimensional profile of the dressing, catheter insertion site, or area where the catheter is subdermal in order to, for example, detect inflammation, swelling or infiltration; electrical characteristics like impedance; and/or reactive dye that could be incorporated into dressing or applied to insertion sites.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some aspects or embodiments, the system <b>10</b> will automatically show the clinician images similar to the patient's actual skin tone and location of the catheter based on initial imaging of the catheter insertion site and/or dressing <b>12</b> prior to catheter insertion. In other aspects or embodiments, the clinician may have to select which image set is most reflective of the patient's coloring during initial patient setup, or there may be multiple panels shown for the placement site assessment, and thereafter images similar in tone to the patient will be provided.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one aspect or embodiment, the system <b>10</b> will assess the catheter insertion site and/or dressing <b>12</b> (with an optical, thermal, depth and/or reflectance based image and/or force based measurements to assess tissue stiffness). This will enable the computerized assessment of: whether the catheter is properly in place, has not been dislodged, whether the dressing is secure, is not peeling, dirty or otherwise compromised, and/or if the skin around the catheter insertion site is not discolored, warm or soft (via colorimetric analysis and/or thermal analysis at multiple points on the image. By asking the clinician to take images prior to and repeatedly following insertion, the computing device <b>18</b> will have the ability to observe, record, and/or evaluate site progression over time and compare it with outcomes from other patients to enable the computing device <b>18</b> to detect and predict occurrence of catheter-related complications (including infiltrations, extravasations, phlebitis, dislodgement) or local site infections.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Computerized assessment may include: &#x201c;deep learning&#x201d;, predictive analytics, data mining, or other pattern recognition as one of the methods of training an image classifier with a set of images where the status is known. The computerized assessment may include machine learning, image processing, artificial intelligence, and/or object detection.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Pattern recognition computations may further identify trends between images and/or within single images. For example, if the temperature profile of the catheter insertion site <b>12</b> is initially uniform, but then starts to demonstrate formation of a hot spot or cold spot, it might indicate that phlebitis or infiltration/extravasation, respectively, are starting to occur. A similar colorimetric analysis may also be performed to assess bruising.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition to imaging the catheter insertion site and/or dressing <b>12</b> itself, a more comprehensive image of the patient may also be used to assess status. For example, with catheters placed on or near the hand, imaging and image analysis of the fingers may serve to assess if blood flow to the fingers has been compromised (e.g. if a dressing is too tight or if infiltration/extravasation has led to restriction of blood flow).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">To further standardize assessments, in some aspects or embodiments, the assessments of the catheter insertion site and/or dressing <b>12</b> may be performed dynamically based on patient specific parameters. For example: catheter type and location; infusate/current medications (e.g. vesicants and other irritant drugs may warrant more frequent assessment); patient status (e.g. patients with developmental venous anomalies (DVA) will require more frequent site assessments); patient physiology (age, sex, BMI, comorbidities, e.g. older patients may have more fragile veins or patients with a history of frequent intravenous injections); activities of daily living index/mobility patients who are more mobile may be more likely to accidentally dislodge a catheter during regular movement; history of vascular access complications (dislodgement, vesicants, vein depletion/fragility); and other factors identified based on trends of prior patients with similar parameters that are found to warrant extra monitoring.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The system <b>10</b> may include sensors and systems to calculate or measure the degree of patency of an IV line.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one aspect or embodiment, a standardized assessment may be utilized with pictures and/or words that are representative of various states of the catheter insertion site and/or dressing <b>12</b>. The images may be color coded based on patient skin type to give a more representative assessment. An image of the catheter insertion site and/or dressing <b>12</b> may be captured to determine and record if the site is clean, dry, intact, and/or to determine and record where the catheter has been placed and whether it has been placed properly. The system may include a dynamic recommendation of when site assessment should be performed based upon patient specific parameters which may include one or more of the following: catheter type; infusate (e.g. vesicants and other irritant drugs may warrant more frequent assessment); and patient status (e.g. DVA patients will require more frequent site assessments).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The system <b>10</b> may utilize various dressing assessment tools. In one aspect or embodiment, pre-defined images may be provided to standardize dressing assessment by a nurse. Different images for different skin tones may be provided. The computing device <b>18</b> can automatically determine what image set to provide based on an image of the patient to determine skin tone.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The use of standardized images may be utilized during the following scenarios: before catheter placement to determine skin tone and patient specific &#x201c;normal&#x201d;; following initial placement to assess quality of placement and site selection (e.g. near point of inflection, if line is kinked, if line is taped down well, if site was shaved, if dressing is intact/well adhered); during dressing changes to assess change when skin is directly able to be observed, e.g., skin coloration, wound dryness (versus wet because of fluid leakage or blood leakage, etc.); and between dressing changes, e.g., before line accesses or at defined time points or combination thereof. The time period may be defined based on patient specific parameters (e.g., age (toddlers more likely to have IV taken out due to mobility)), mobility, recent pump disconnects (e.g., may indicate patient went to recovery room), other patient parameters (hairiness, mental condition, e.g., psychosis or other psychological issues may make patient more likely to pull out IV, etc.), as well as what is being infused (e.g., vesicants or other irritant drugs may require more frequent assessments) to assess intactness of dressing and changes of dressing integrity and site, i.e., skin and area around catheter. During these scenarios, the following catheter issues may be evaluated: line dislodgment or migration (catheter may have indicator to demonstrate skin insertion level and assessment of the distance between that and skin may indicate dislodgement or migration, or visual evidence of catheter tip or portion of catheter being out of vein); line kinks; dressing intactness; site cleanliness (shaved/hair removed); and site (dry/not wet, no blood, no fluid present, patient not sweating).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The image capture device <b>14</b> and/or sensor <b>16</b> are utilized to record site characteristics and may include both images and/or other measurements, as discussed above. The image may have a color spot to enable auto-adjustment of color in different lighting. The image may also include a thermal image. The image may include reflectance of light (to assess wetness: blood, sweat, fluid leak). In addition to the image, the system <b>10</b> may also take measurement of tissue stiffness or compressibility, e.g. via pressure, tension meter, force gauge, etc. via the sensor <b>16</b>. An energy source, such as a light source, pressure source, tension source, heat source, acoustic/vibration source that is used to stimulate the test area, and a corresponding sensor that detects transmitted or reflected energy to assess a property of the test area that indicates its status may be utilized. Any of these energy sources can be modulated to test multiple sample points or characteristics.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Various computer-implemented methods of site assessment may be utilized including, for example, the following: a method to compare baseline parameters of site prior to placement with variation over time to identify changes and/or trends indicative of or predicative of negative outcomes; a method which utilizes colorimetric analysis; a method which utilizes thermal analysis; a method which uses other property analysis (e.g. reflectance or other surface property assessment); a method assessing site during dressing changes (i.e., bare skin) over time or site through/under dressing; and/or a method that may draw conclusions about changes in skin color or shape or tissue compressibility (e.g., look at shadows created in image correcting for angle and other artifacts to assess if swelling is present) and other changes potentially indicative of swelling (e.g. blanching of skin, differences in light reflection or refraction).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The system <b>10</b> may present a clinician with a series of images captured over a predetermined period of time, such as every 2 hours or every 4 hours, with the images being corrected for orientation, color, lighting, angle, shadows, and other image characteristics to enable comparison of how elements of a site, such as redness or swelling, are progressing over time. These elements may be highlighted within the images presented to the clinician and may include a length scale or other type of scale. The images presented to a clinician may be enhanced with information or other indicators obtained by computer-aided image analysis of the image or previously captured images.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The system <b>10</b> may be configured to detect fluid buildup under skin, fluid buildup under dressing (blood, pus, wetness, oozing wound, etc.) and determine differences in shine, temperature, color (e.g. red blood), or combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The system <b>10</b> may evaluate finger coloring, for sites close to fingers/on hand (or even further up arm), to see if circulation is compromised, which is a sign of infiltration/extravasation.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The system <b>10</b> may determine changes in temperature across skin, which may indicate phlebitis/infection for increases in temperature at the site or infiltration/extravasation for decreases in temperature.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The system <b>10</b> may determine if the dressing is too tight based on blanching of skin or other indications of improper dressing.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Images/readings taken from the catheter insertion site and/or dressing <b>12</b> may be used to document the site directly without computerized analysis in one aspect or embodiment.
