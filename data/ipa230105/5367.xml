While multiple parking spaces may be available at a venue, some parking spaces may satisfy a driver's preferences more than others, but the driver is not able to ascertain as much without spending time driving around the venue to investigate. Moreover, when a driver arrives at a venue, relatively few parking available spaces may be scattered widely across a parking zone. If the driver does not have time to search for a preferable parking space, the driver may be forced to take the first available parking space even if it is not preferable.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore, autonomous vehicles are becoming more prevalent and they may generally handle parking by traveling from a starting location to a destination at which the vehicle simply parks in the first available facility/parking space, or parks in a predetermined zone. The predefined zones or other first available parking selection of an autonomous vehicle may not satisfy the preferences of the passenger. In addition, a driver/passenger may not wish to spend the time required to define the predetermined zone according to their preferences or may make mistakes in doing so.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one embodiment, example systems and methods associated with parking preference estimation system are disclosed. The disclosed parking system can automatically learn driver parking selection preferences over time based on parking candidate decision comparisons without the need for the driver to manually input any parking preferences. For example, in one or more implementations the disclosed embodiments can use a hypothesis approach to generate training data over time, adjust the training data to eliminate less relevant data entries based on certain conditions, and train a decision model to estimate driver preferences based on the remaining training data.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, in situations when multiple parking candidates may be available the disclosed system can receive a set of parking candidates as input to the decision model and output a parking recommendation that is estimated to be in line with driver preferences as learned from historical data.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, a system is disclosed for providing parking candidate recommendations. For example, in one approach the disclosed system includes a memory storing machine-readable instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to generate training data based at least in part on: 1) trajectory data indicating a trajectory of a vehicle during a plurality of parking events, each in which a driver of the vehicle selected a parking candidate from among a plurality of parking candidates, and 2) attribute data indicating attributes of each of the plurality of parking candidates, remove, from the training data, data associated with at least one available parking candidate based on one or more conditions that indicate the driver did not consider the at least one available parking candidate, and train a decision model, based on remaining training data, to estimate a preferred parking candidate for the driver from among a set of available parking candidates.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another approach, a disclosed method includes generating training data based at least in part on: 1) trajectory data indicating a trajectory of a vehicle during a plurality of parking events, each in which a driver of the vehicle selected a parking candidate from among a plurality of parking candidates, and 2) attribute data indicating attributes of each of the plurality of parking candidates, removing, from the training data, data associated with at least one available parking candidate based on one or more conditions that indicate the driver did not consider the at least one available parking candidate; and, training a decision model, based on remaining training data, to estimate a preferred parking candidate for the driver from among a set of available parking candidates.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, a non-transitory computer-readable medium is disclosed.

As used herein &#x201c;driver&#x201d; refers to an individual operating a vehicle, either as a manual driver or an operator/passenger of an autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicle. A driver, as such, may prefer that his/her vehicle be parked in a parking area and/or parking space that meets certain criteria. For example, a driver may prefer to park his/her electric vehicle in a parking area that includes charging stations, or a may prefer to park in a parking space that is covered or near a particular entrance to a mall. Typically, if a driver prefers a parking area/space with particular attributes, the driver must expend time and effort driving around, manually searching for available parking candidates that meet the preferred criteria.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, although the driver may be aware of his/her preferences, the driver may not wish to spend time or energy inputting instructions into a system, e.g., a vehicle system, to enable the system to assist in locating a preferred parking candidate (i.e., a preferred parking area, preferred parking space, etc.).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">To solve these problems, embodiments of a parking preference estimation system and associated methods are disclosed herein to automatically learn driver preferences regarding parking candidate criteria, automatically recommend a parking candidate from among a plurality of available parking candidates and generate directions to the parking candidate. The disclosed parking preference estimation system can, in one or more embodiments, use a hypothesis approach to create a decision model for a given driver based on historical data that indicates the driver's actions in parking events, including the driver's selections of parking candidates and decisions to bypass available parking candidates.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The parking preference estimation system can generate training data based on the historical data and train the decision model to estimate which parking candidate out of a plurality of parking candidates the driver would prefer. In one or more embodiments, the parking preference estimation system improves the quality of the training data (and thereby the performance of the decision model) by eliminating data associated with at least one available parking candidate from the training data based on one or more conditions. The one or more conditions can indicate that the at least one available parking candidate was likely noticed but not considered by the driver during the parking event due to one or more aspects of the environment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As used herein, a &#x201c;parking event&#x201d; refers to a sequence of maneuvers leading up to and concluding with the parking of the vehicle. A &#x201c;parking candidate&#x201d; refers to either a parking area (e.g., a garage, parking lot, roadside parking, etc.) or an individual parking space. An &#x201c;available parking candidate&#x201d; refers to a parking candidate that is currently open for a vehicle to park in. An &#x201c;available parking space&#x201d; refers specifically to a parking space that is currently unoccupied.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one or more embodiments, to obtain the training data the disclosed parking preference estimation system automatically identifies one or more attributes of an available parking space and determines a respective score for the attribute that can be used to characterize the attribute. As used herein, &#x201c;attributes&#x201d; refers to one or more of: 1) physical characteristics of a parking space (e.g., width, length, in shade, covered, uncovered, space between parking lines and a nearest parked car, etc.); 2) contextual characteristics of the parking space (e.g., proximity to an entrance, proximity to a specific object such as charge station or cart return station, etc.); 3) regulatory characteristics of the parking space (e.g., a regulatory status of a space, such as handicap parking or reserved space or visitor space, cost to park in the space, etc.); or 4) other traits associated with a parking candidate and/or environment around the parking candidate.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Generally, the disclosed parking preference estimation system can identify available parking candidates and attributes of the available parking candidates based on, for example: 1) retrieving metadata about the available parking candidates from a database (e.g., a map database) according to a current location of the subject vehicle, 2) using one or more machine perception components to analyze sensor data and identify signs proximate to the parking candidates, characteristics of the surrounding environment, and/or markings on a surface of the ground in a vicinity of the parking candidate, 3) communicating with a parking area system to retrieve the attributes, etc.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, one embodiment of a parking preference estimation system 100 is illustrated. While arrangements will be described herein with respect to the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b>, it will be understood that embodiments are not limited to a unitary system as illustrated. In some implementations, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> may be embodied, for example, as a cloud-computing system, a cluster-computing system, a distributed computing system, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) system, or part of a vehicle operation system. The parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> is illustrated and discussed as a single device for purposes of facilitating clear description and discussion but should not be interpreted to limit the overall possible configurations in which the disclosed components may be configured. For example, the separate modules, memories, databases, and so on may be distributed among various computing systems in varying combinations.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one or more embodiments, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> is communicably connected to a parking navigation system <b>105</b>. The parking navigation system <b>105</b> can obtain a current position and destination of vehicle as input, determine a travel path for the vehicle, and identify available parking candidates along the travel path. The parking navigation system <b>105</b> can provide the available parking candidates as input to the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b>, which can output a recommended parking candidate or ranking of candidates. Upon receiving the recommended parking candidate or ranking of candidates, the parking navigation system <b>105</b> can determine a recommended route to an available parking facility/space. In some embodiments, the parking navigation system <b>105</b> offers facility-level navigation, which guides a user to a recommended parking facility (e.g., parking lot, roadside parking, etc., within a geographical area). In some embodiments, the parking navigation system <b>105</b> may additionally offer space-level parking navigation within the recommended parking facility.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> includes various elements.

In any case, the processor <b>110</b> is an electronic device such as a microprocessor, an ASIC, or another computing component that is capable of executing machine-readable instructions to produce various electronic outputs therefrom that may be used to control or cause the control of other electronic devices.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> includes a memory <b>120</b>. The memory <b>120</b> can store machine-readable instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to execute various actions, functions or tasks as described below. In one or more embodiments, the memory <b>120</b> can store, among other things, a score module <b>140</b>, a training module <b>130</b> and a decision module <b>150</b>. The memory <b>120</b> can be implemented as a random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), a hard-disk drive, a flash memory, or other suitable memory for storing the modules <b>130</b>, <b>140</b> and <b>150</b>. The modules <b>130</b>, <b>140</b> and <b>150</b> are, for example, constructed as computer-readable instructions that when executed by the processor <b>110</b> cause the processor <b>110</b> to perform the various functions disclosed herein.

Thus, in one embodiment, the datastore <b>160</b> stores data and/or databases used by the modules <b>130</b>, <b>140</b> and <b>150</b> in executing various determinations and functions disclosed herein. Such data and/or databases can include a parking attributes database <b>170</b>, which stores characteristics and attributes of parking candidates, a vehicle trajectory database <b>175</b>, which stores historical geographical locations and parking events of user vehicles, and a parking preference database <b>178</b>, which stores driver preference estimates in the form of parking preference models associated with participating vehicles.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one or more embodiments, the parking attributes database <b>170</b> maintains attribute data associated with one or more types of attributes of parking candidates (e.g., parking facilities or parking spaces). Some example parking facility attributes can include: the number of available spaces, the total number of parking spaces, the number of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, the number of available EV charging stations, geographical locations of the facility, geographical locations of parking entrances, geographical locations of points-of-interest around the parking facility, parking fee, parking regulations, customer reviews, average arrival rate of vehicles, ease of parking indicator (e.g., average size of parking spaces, etc.), recent history of availability, etc. Some example parking space attributes can include: current availability, recent history of availability, estimated time when the space becomes available, average arrival rate of vehicles, EV charging station proximity, handicapped parking designation, compact car parking designation, dimension of the parking space, geographical location of the parking space, safety indicator (e.g., distance from security cameras/street lights, etc.), ease of parking indicators (e.g., if the space is located at a corner of a parking lot, traffic volume of the adjacent road segment, availability of adjacent spaces, etc.), covering, etc.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one or more embodiments, the vehicle trajectory database <b>175</b> stores location data associated with one or more participating vehicles that utilize the services of the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b>.

In some embodiments, the parking navigation system <b>105</b> offers facility-level navigation, which guides a user to a recommended parking facility (e.g., parking lot, roadside parking, etc.). In some embodiments, the parking navigation system <b>105</b> can additionally offer space-level parking navigation within the recommended parking facility. To provide these functions, the parking navigation system <b>105</b> and the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can perform learning phase and recommendation phase operations.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the learning phase, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> and parking navigation system <b>105</b> obtain trajectory data and attribute data associated with a plurality of parking events completed by a subject vehicle <b>205</b> to generate training data and use conditional analysis to adjust the training data.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in one or more embodiments the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can, over time, obtain location data <b>210</b> associated with multiple parking events completed by a subject vehicle <b>205</b> and store the information in the vehicle trajectory database <b>175</b>. For example, in one or more embodiments the subject vehicle <b>205</b> can transmit the location data <b>210</b> to the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> when the subject vehicle <b>205</b> completes a parking event. In one or more embodiments the location data <b>210</b> can include geographical location data, such as map path data, GPS point data, or other information that can provide details of a path navigated by the subject vehicle <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition, in one or more embodiments the subject vehicle <b>205</b> can transmit sensor data <b>215</b> indicating attributes of available parking candidates detected along a path navigated by the subject vehicle <b>205</b>. For example, for the purposes of determining a parking space recommendation, the attributes can include, dimension of the parking space, geographical location of the parking space, safety indicator (e.g., distance from security cameras/streetlights, etc.), ease of parking indicators, etc., as described above. For the purposes of determining a parking facility (e.g., garage, parking lot, etc.) recommendation, the attributes can include, for example, the number of available spaces detected, the total number of parking spaces, the number of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, etc., as described above. The parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can store the attributes in the parking attributes database <b>170</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, in one or more embodiments the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can obtain additional attribute data <b>225</b> from other attribute sources <b>220</b>, such as sensor data from other participating vehicles, data from facilities, data from stationary cameras, etc. Accordingly, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can obtain data that will function as the basis for training data to train a decision model for the subject vehicle <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can defer generating a parking recommendation for the subject vehicle <b>205</b> during the learning phase. For example, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can defer generating a parking recommend until after it has obtained a threshold amount of data in the parking attributes database <b>170</b> and the vehicle trajectory database <b>175</b> associated with the subject vehicle <b>205</b>. After a threshold amount of data associated with the subject vehicle has been obtained, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can operate in the recommendation phase for the subject vehicle <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the recommendation phase, the parking navigation system <b>105</b> can request a parking recommendation for the subject vehicle <b>205</b> based on available parking candidates <b>260</b> identified on a current or upcoming route of the subject vehicle <b>205</b>. The parking navigation system <b>105</b> can identify parking candidates, i.e., candidate parking lots (for facility-level navigation) or candidate available parking spaces (for space-level navigation), based on one or more different information sources.

In one or more embodiments, the parking navigation system <b>105</b> can obtain relevant information from external systems to aid in identifying parking candidates. For example, a parking facility security camera, road-side camera or other sensor infrastructure can monitor a parking area and in so doing generate data (e.g., image data, video data, etc.) that can be used to identify available parking spaces a parking facility or street. The parking navigation system <b>105</b> can obtain the data and determine occupancy/vacancy of a parking space by applying an image processing algorithm, e.g., to video streams from security cameras. In one or more embodiments, the parking navigation system <b>105</b> can collect data from occupancy sensors that detect the presence of vehicles in parking spaces by wireless signals. In other embodiments, the parking navigation system <b>105</b> can determine availability of parking spaces based on data obtained from on-board sensors (e.g., cameras, sonars, radars, lidars, etc.) of participating vehicles that travel in a parking facility.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Other techniques can be used to identify parking candidates. In any case, the parking navigation system <b>105</b> obtains/processes information (e.g., from a facility, from sensor infrastructure, from other vehicles, etc.) to identify available parking candidates and transmits the available parking candidates <b>260</b> to the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Upon receiving the available parking candidates <b>206</b>, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can search the vehicle trajectory database <b>175</b> and retrieve trajectory data associated with parking events completed by the subject vehicle <b>205</b> at operation <b>230</b>. For each of a plurality of parking events, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can determine a parking search path at operation <b>235</b>. The parking search path, or search path, refers to a segment of vehicle navigational trajectory during which the driver is searching for a parking candidate (i.e., a parking facility or a parking space). The search path ends with completion of the parking event and starts at a determined location, distance or time before the completion of the parking event.

For example, in one or more embodiments when the parking candidate is a facility the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can determine the starting point of the search path to be a predetermined distance (e.g., 500 meters) from the location of parking event. When the parking candidate is a parking space, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can determine the starting point of the search path to be an entry point to the parking facility, etc., based on map data.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can identify available parking candidates along or around the search path at operation <b>240</b>. For facility-level recommendations, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can identify all parking facilities around the parking search path based on map data. In some embodiments, the system may retrieve available parking facilities whose distance from the parking search path is no more than a predefined threshold.

For example, as one condition the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can determine to include data associated with an available space s<sub>i </sub>in the hypothesis f<sub>j</sub>(x<sub>1,1</sub>, x<sub>i,2</sub>, . . . , x<sub>i,m</sub>)&#x3c;f<sub>i</sub>(x<sub>n,1</sub>, x<sub>n,2</sub>, x<sub>n,m</sub>) analysis only if the speed of the subject vehicle <b>205</b> is less than a predefined threshold when the subject vehicle <b>205</b> is passing the available space s<sub>i</sub>. In applying this condition, it is assumed that speed is an indicator of attention, which in turn is an indicator or evidence of consideration. When the subject vehicle <b>205</b> moves faster than the threshold while passing s<sub>i</sub>, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can determine that the driver did not consider s<sub>i </sub>as a relevant candidate space to a degree that warrants inclusion in the decision model training data.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0059">Using conditions to identify and remove less relevant samples from the training data can improve the accuracy of the decision model estimations. The parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> may additionally/alternatively apply one or more other conditions to identify samples for removal from the training data based on, for example, a change of vehicle speed (deceleration or acceleration) or based on a lateral distance threshold to the parking space when passing s<sub>i</sub>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0060">After the conditional removals, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can use the remaining training data to train a decision model that is tailored to the specific driver of subject vehicle <b>205</b>. In one or more embodiments, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> executes a regression technique based on the training data to estimate the utility function f<sub>j </sub>of the decision model, for each user j, that best satisfies inequalities in the training data or best maps input (e.g., attribute indicators of a set of available candidates) to desired output (e.g., selected candidate). In one or more embodiments, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can use linear regression, logistic regression, deep neural network-based regression, or other types of regression techniques using the hypothesis approach for generation of unsupervised labeled data to determine the utility functions.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0061">In one or more embodiments, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can use the utility function to calculate a utility value of candidate parking spaces that are received from the parking navigation system <b>105</b> and determine rankings of the candidates accordingly. In one or more embodiments, the parking navigation system <b>105</b> selects the candidate with the highest utility value as the recommended candidate.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0062">In one or more embodiments, instead of directly estimating the utility function f<sub>j </sub>the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can use decision trees to model a driver's parking selection. In this case, the decision tree takes factor-wise utility scores of a pair of candidate parking spaces s<sub>a </sub>and s<sub>b </sub>as input and estimates which candidate parking space the driver prefers, e.g.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Input: (x<sub>a,1</sub>, x<sub>a,2</sub>, . . . , x<sub>a,m</sub>), (x<sub>b,1</sub>, x<sub>b,2</sub>, . . . , x<sub>b,m</sub>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0069" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Output: s<sub>a </sub>or s<sub>b </sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0070" num="0063">The parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can train a decision tree for a driver of given vehicle using the training data associated with the vehicle. The parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can train multiple decision trees corresponding respectively to drivers of multiple vehicles.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an example of the subject vehicle <b>205</b> arriving at a parking area <b>400</b> at which the parking navigation system <b>105</b> has identified a set [a, b, c . . . n] of available parking spaces, e.g., including parking spaces <b>410</b>, <b>420</b>, <b>430</b>. The parking area <b>400</b> can include, for example, an EV charging station <b>450</b>. When the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> receives the set of candidate parking spaces from the parking navigation system <b>105</b>, it determines whether a threshold amount of data associated with the subject vehicle <b>205</b> has been obtained to create a decision model.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0065">When the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> determines that it has not obtained the threshold amount of data, no further recommendation/estimation action is taken for this parking event. When the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> determines that it has obtained the threshold amount of data, it generates a decision model specific to the subject vehicle <b>205</b> to estimate which candidate the driver of the subject vehicle <b>205</b> would prefer.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0066">In a utility function implementation, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> first calculates criterion-wise scores of each candidate parking space in the received set [a, b, c . . . n] of available parking candidates. In an implementation in which the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> uses regression techniques to estimate the utility function f<sub>j</sub>, it applies the function to the criterion-wise scores to calculate the utility of each candidate parking space. In one or more embodiments, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can rank the candidate parking spaces in a descending order of the utility and return the results to the parking navigation system <b>105</b>. The parking navigation system <b>105</b> can determine the candidate with the highest utility as estimated to be the driver's most preferred parking space out of the set and generate instructions to navigate to the candidate parking spaces in order of rank until a parking space is obtained and the parking event thereby ends.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0067">In an implementation in which the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> uses decision trees to model drivers' parking selection, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> estimates results of pair-wise comparisons of all possible pairs of candidate parking spaces within the set. The candidate determined to be preferable to the largest number of other candidates is estimated to be the driver's preferred parking space out of the set.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0068">For example, assume the set is limited to three candidate parking spots, a set of [a, b, c] (e.g., parking spaces <b>410</b>, <b>420</b>, <b>430</b>). The parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> applies the decision tree associated with subject vehicle <b>205</b> to all the possible pairs within the set: (a, b), (b, c) and (c, a). For each pair, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> estimates which spot is likely to be preferred by the driver of subject vehicle <b>205</b>. The following represents example comparison results:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0069">a is preferred to b</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0070">b is preferred to c</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0071">a is preferred to c</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0076" num="0072">In this example case, parking space a is estimated to be the most preferable spot as it is preferred over the largest number (2) of other candidate spots. Accordingly, the parking preference estimation system <b>100</b> can return parking space a as output to the parking navigation system <b>105</b> in response to an input of set [a, b, c]. The parking navigation system <b>105</b> can generate navigational directions to parking space a.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b></figref> shows a flowchart <b>500</b> of operations for one or more embodiments of the disclosed parking preference estimation system <b>100</b>.
