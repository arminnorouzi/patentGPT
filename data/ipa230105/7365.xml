For example, during a live streaming of content, there can be certain periods (or moments) that the secondary content can be inserted (e.g., advertisement breaks). The nominal duration of the secondary content can be determined by a primary content server (e.g., main program server) and inserted into a manifest file. During one of those periods, a client can communicate with a secondary content server (e.g., advertisement server) to stream and/or playback secondary content. The secondary content server sends the secondary content to the client with a duration that matches the exact duration that is indicated in the original manifest file. For example, the duration of a secondary content break can be fixed by the primary content server prior to insertion of the secondary content and the client can switch from the secondary back to the main program at the known fixed time. However, early termination of the secondary content in this case can be difficult to achieve, or not achievable, and the quality of playback cannot be predicted in many cases.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some cases, during the streaming or playback of the secondary content (e.g., advertisement content), the primary content server may want to the client to stop streaming the secondary content and switch back to the primary content (e.g., main program) sooner than initially planned. Such cases can be referred to as the early termination of secondary content. The present disclosure includes embodiments that enable a content server to signal that a period may be terminated early and that a manifest file may have one or more early termination periods. Further, the present disclosure includes embodiments in which one or more expected behaviors during the early termination of the secondary content is indicated. Therefore, a client can decide if it is capable of supporting early termination functionality during playback and provide the expected behavior or warn against it. Further, information can be communicated to a secondary content server through the client to allow better fitted secondary content to be provided for early termination periods.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a system (<b>100</b>) according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The system (<b>100</b>) includes a first server (<b>110</b>), a second server (<b>120</b>), and an information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>). Early termination of content such as advertisements in Internet media streaming can be provided. The first server (<b>110</b>) can provide primary content (e.g., a main program) and signal the possibility of shortening secondary content (e.g., advertisement content) from an intended duration. For example the first server (<b>110</b>) can include a primary content server. The first server (<b>110</b>) enables characteristics of the secondary content to be signaled to second server (<b>120</b>) and the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>). Thus, a streaming session can be improved by allowing for the early termination of secondary content. The functions of the first server (<b>110</b>) can be distributed among a plurality of servers in some embodiments.

The manifest file is an MPD (<b>300</b>) according to an embodiment. The MPD (<b>300</b>) describes a DASH media presentation and can be in the form of an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document. The manifest file could correspond to other streaming formats such as HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) for example. The MPD (<b>300</b>) can include a sequence of one or more periods (e.g., periods (<b>310</b>A-<b>310</b>C)). Each period can include one or more adaptation sets. Each adaptation set can include one or more representations. Further, each representation can include one or more segments. The MPD (<b>300</b>) can define formats to announce HTTP uniform resource locators (URLs), or network addresses, for downloading the segments of data.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A period can be defined by a period element in an MPD element. The period can provide an opportunity for secondary content insertion. In certain circumstances, the MPD is offered such that a next period is a continuation of content in a previous period, possibly the immediately following period or in a later period (e.g., after an advertisement period has been inserted).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">An adaptation set can be described by an adaptation set element. Adaptation set elements can be contained in a period element. The adaptation set can include alternate representations (i.e., only one representation within an adaptation set is expected to be presented at a time). All representations contained in one adaptation set can represent the same media content components and therefore contain media streams that are considered to be perceptually equivalent. The adaption set and the contained representations can contain sufficient information such that seamless switching across different representations in one adaptation set is enabled.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Representations can be described by a representation element. Representation elements are contained in an adaptation element, as noted above. The representation can be one of the alternative choices of the complete set or subset of media content components comprising the media content during a defined period. The representation can start at the start of the period (e.g., PeriodStart) and continue until the end of the period (i.e., the start of the next period or the end of the media presentation). Each representation can include one or more media streams, where each media stream is an encoded version of one media content component.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As noted above, each representation can include one or more segments. In an embodiment, the segment can be referenced by an HTTP-URL included in an MPD. The HTTP-URL can be defined as an &#x3c;absolute-URI&#x3e; according to IETF RFC 3986, for example, with a fixed scheme of &#x201c;http&#x201d; or &#x201c;https&#x201d;, possibly restricted by a byte range if a range attribute is provided together with the URL. The byte range can be expressed as byte-range-spec as defined in IETF RFC 2616, for example. It can be restricted to a single expression identifying a contiguous range or bytes. In an embodiment, the segment can be included in the MPD with a data URL, for example as defined in IETF RFC 2397.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Each segment referenced through an HTTP-URL in the MPD can be associated with a segment availability interval (e.g., a time window in wall-clock time at which the segment can be accessed via the HTTP-URL). Representations can be assigned segment information through the presence of elements base URL, segment base, segment template, and/or segment list. The segment information can provide information on the location availability and properties of all segments contained in one representation.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, MPD information for the MPD (<b>300</b>) can include early termination information.

A client, such as the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can receive or acquire the original manifest file, for example at step (S<b>402</b>). The original manifest file can indicate that early termination of periods is possible, or permitted. Further, the original manifest file can indicate one or more capabilities that are required and/or preferred for the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) to perform early termination of secondary content. As noted above, the manifest information (e.g., MPD information) and the primary content can be provided by different servers in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">After receiving the original manifest file, the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can start streaming the primary content. For example, the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can requests the primary content stream from the first server (<b>110</b>) at step (S<b>404</b>) and receive the primary content stream at step (S<b>406</b>). The primary content stream can be requested based on information (e.g., HTTP-URLs referencing segments of the primary content) included in the original manifest file.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The first server (<b>110</b>) can update the manifest file by inserting a secondary content period (e.g., advertisement period). The manifest file update can include a default period fall back and/or information to be communicated to the second server (<b>120</b>). For example, an MPD update can include an XLink period with a default period fallback and/or the information to be communicated to the second server (<b>120</b>). The MPD update is sent to the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one embodiment, at step (S<b>408</b>), the first server (<b>110</b>) can provide a manifest file update notification to the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>). The MPD update notification can be received according to any one or more update mechanisms. For example, the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can obtain updates using any one or a combination of the following update mechanisms: (i) streaming of a representation of the default period and parsing event boxes (e.g., in-band events in different segments) to receive any MPD expiration event, (ii) pulling of the MPD (e.g., based on a minimum update period) to see if the MPD is updated, and/or (iii) establishing of a Server and Network-assisted DASH (SAND) channel to receive a MPD expiry message if supported. The MPD expiration event can correspond to a MPD validity expiration event that is included in the primary content stream and includes an inband event carrying an MPD expiration message. The minimum update period used for MPD pulling can be indicated by an @minimumUpdatePeriod attribute included in the MPD element.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In response to the MPD update notification, the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can send an MPD update request to the first server (<b>110</b>) at step (S<b>410</b>). At step (S<b>412</b>), the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can receive the manifest file update information. For example, the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) receives the MPD update information in response to the MPD update request. The MPD update information can include additional information (e.g., timing information) about the early termination properties of the secondary content period.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, the manifest file update information includes an XLink that is resolved by the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>). For example, the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can send an XLink request to the second server (<b>120</b>) at step (S<b>414</b>), and receive replacement period information in response to the XLink request at step (S<b>416</b>).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">At step (S<b>418</b>), the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can send a request for secondary content to the second server (<b>120</b>) (e.g., advertisement server). For example, the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can generate the request based on an XLink included in MPD or the MPD update information. The request can optionally include information about early termination properties, for example in the XLink query string.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">At step (S<b>420</b>), the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can receive the secondary content from the second server (<b>120</b>). For example, the second server (<b>120</b>) streams or otherwise sends the secondary content to the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Since early termination is possible, the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can receive MPD update information that indicates timing information (e.g., shortened timing information) for the early termination. For example, the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can obtain updates using any one or a combination of the update mechanisms described above, for example (i) parsing of in-band events (e.g., for an MPD expiration event), (ii) pulling of the MPD, and/or (iii) using a SAND channel if supported. The update mechanism used to obtain timing information for the early termination can be determined based on the additional information about the early termination properties received at step (S<b>412</b>) for example.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In response to the MPD update notification, the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can send an MPD update request to the first server (<b>110</b>) at step (S<b>424</b>). At step (S<b>426</b>), the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can receive the manifest file update information. For example, the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) receives the MPD update information in response to the MPD update request. The manifest file update information can include the timing information for the early termination of the secondary content period.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can end the secondary content period with a new duration when the timing information for the early termination is received. The information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can then continue streaming the primary content from the first server (<b>110</b>). For example, the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) requests the primary content stream from the first server (<b>110</b>) at step (S<b>428</b>) and receives the primary content stream at step (S<b>430</b>).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Various parameters can be provided for early termination signaling. One or more parameters can be used to signal behavior of the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) during a transition (e.g., from secondary content back to primary content). However, segments may not be aligned when the secondary content is terminated early. Possible behaviors during the transition can include inserting a gap in playback during the transition, loss of quality during the transition, and/or overlap decoding and seamless switching.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">One or more parameters can be used to signal the update mechanism for updating the MPD updates (e.g., during streaming of the primary content or the secondary content period). One or more exemplary MPD update mechanisms can include the MPD pulling, inband events, and the use of SAND, as described above.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">A parameter can be used to signal shortest/minimum advanced notice time information (e.g., the shortest advanced duration to termination point (SAD)). For example, the first server (<b>110</b>) can be restricted to never give notice to the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) for early termination later than the SAD duration to the actual point of early termination (e.g., in wall clock time).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further, a parameter can be used to signal shortest/minimum content duration information such as guaranteed ad duration (GAD). For example, for early termination of secondary content, the first server (<b>110</b>) may be able to guarantee a minimum duration that it would not terminate the secondary content from the secondary content break point.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The possibility that secondary content can be terminated early can be signaled in the manifest file. One or more capabilities that are required or preferred during the termination of the secondary content can also be signaled in the manifest file. For example, an indication that early termination of the secondary content is permitted and/or the one or more required or preferred capabilities can be signaled at a top level of the manifest file. Therefore, the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can determine whether it can support any required capabilities, and if supported, start streaming of the content.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In MPEG DASH, initial early termination information can be provided in an MPD element. In some embodiments, the information can be provided in an essential property or supplemental property descriptor of the MPD element. The essential property descriptor can specify information about the containing element that is considered essential by the media presentation. The supplemental property descriptor can specify supplemental information about the containing element that may be used by the DASH client for optimizing the processing. Required capabilities can be indicated in the essential property descriptor and preferred capabilities can be indicated in the supplemental property descriptor for example. When a capability is preferred, the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can decide to behave differently.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A specific scheme URL (e.g., http://dashiforg/guidelines/earlyterminatingcontent) can be defined for the initial early termination information. A value of the descriptor can indicate the one or more capabilities (e.g., required or preferred) during the early termination switch back. Exemplary values are included in the behavior table illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. For example, a numerical value 1 can indicate that a gap in playback during a transition from the secondary content back to the primary content is acceptable (e.g., a gap caused by looking for a next intra-coded picture frame). A numerical value of 2 can indicate that the loss of quality during the transition is acceptable (e.g., playback could start from a predicted frame before reaching a next intra-coded picture frame). A numerical value of 3 can indicate that overlap decoding and seamless switching is to be performed during the transition (e.g., decode a frame such as an I frame before the switch to the secondary content and a frame after the switch back to the primary content).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the initial early termination information can be signaled using a new element in the manifest file. In one embodiment, the initial early termination information can be signaled in a new child element in the MPD element level. For example, the initial early termination information can be signaled using an early termination element as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Events can be used to indicate the one or more MPD update mechanisms that the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) can use to obtain MPD update information (e.g., early termination acquisition information, additional timing information, and/or early termination update information). The events can be provided in the MPD or within a representation in order to signal aperiodic information to the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>). Events of the same type can be summarized in an event stream that is specified by an element (e.g., EventStream) in a period element.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, event streams can be multiplexed with representations by adding the event messages as part of the segments. The events streams can be present in selected representations, in one or several selected adaptation sets only or in all representations. An inband event stream that is present in a representation can be indicated by an element (e.g., an InbandEventStream element) on the adaptation set or representation level.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, early termination information can be signaled at a period level. A benefit of this approach is that each period can have its own characteristics in terms of an MPD update event mechanism. A specific scheme URI (e.g., http://dashif.org/guidelines/earlyterminatingcontent) can be defined for an event. A value of the event can be used to indicate the possible MPD update mechanism during the period. In an embodiment, the value can be any combination of the numerical values in the table illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. For example, a numerical value of 1 can indicate MPD pulling is used. A numerical value of 2 can indicate that an inband event is used (e.g., an inband event such as an MPD validity expiration event containing an MPD expiration message included in the primary content stream). A numerical value of 4 can indicate the use of SAND (e.g., the use of out-of-band SAND signaling to indicate the expiration of the MPD). One or more of the MPD update mechanisms can be applied at the MPD level, instead of the period level, in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Any combination of values indicating different MPD update mechanisms can be added together to signal the availability of more than one MPD update mechanism. For instance, value 3 can indicate that both MPD pulling and inband events can be used to obtain MPD updates. The message data or body of an event element (e.g., messageData), or message data of an inband event (e.g., message_data) can include additional information such as minimum content duration information (e.g., GAD) and/or minimum advanced notice timing information (e.g., SAD). The events can be inserted along with MPD validation expiry information (e.g., inband MPD validation expiry events, MPD event for an MPD update). The duration and presentation time, presentation time delta, and/or presentation time offset can be set to identical values of the corresponding MPD update validation expiry event (e.g., the event has identical timing as of the corresponding MPD update event).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The second server (<b>120</b>) (e.g., secondary content or advertisement server) can benefit from receiving early termination acquisition information that indicates whether its content may be terminated early. The early termination acquisition information can be provided with additional information (e.g., timing information). Using the early termination acquisition and/or additional information, the second server (<b>120</b>) could provide secondary content with a shorter duration. For example, the shorter secondary content can include advertisement content that fits within GAD duration and therefore would not be interrupted even if subjected to early termination. The secondary content can include advertisement content with segment duration shorter than SAD. Therefore, the possibility of better switching if the secondary content is terminated early can be provided. The shorter secondary content could be selected based on any combination of the timing information in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, the secondary content can be acquired using an XLink. The XLink can contain query strings that describe parameters corresponding to the early termination acquisition and/or additional information. The first server (<b>110</b>) can require the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) to insert the early termination acquisition and/or additional information, using a URLQueryInfo element of the DASH specification for example. An example is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, &#x201c;earlytermination=1&#x201d; can indicate the possibility of early termination. For &#x201c;sad=N&#x201d;, N can define an amount of time (e.g., N seconds) for the SAD parameter. For &#x201c;gad=M&#x201d;, M can define an amount of time (e.g., M second) for the GAD parameter. The information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) receiving such a manifest can add the query string to the remote period XLink request. The second server (<b>120</b>) can parse this query to determine that early termination is possible and one or more associated timing characteristics. The second server (<b>120</b>) can select between different secondary content or versions of a secondary content based on whether early termination is possible and/or the one or more associated time characteristics to provide better suitable content. For example, the second server (<b>120</b>) can provide replacement period information for the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>) to retrieve the better suitable content.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary method (<b>900</b>) that can be performed by the information processing apparatus (<b>130</b>).

At step (S<b>960</b>), the secondary content is output for display during the period based on whether the secondary content is terminated early.
