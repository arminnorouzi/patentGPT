More particularly, the present application involves a truck tire tread that is directional in which the J shaped sipe is oriented relative to the rolling direction to reduce or eliminate abnormal wear.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Manufacturers of heavy commercial vehicle tires have made progress in developing tire architectures and tire materials that allow increase in the wear resistance of tire treads and the reduction of the rolling resistance of tires while at the same time improving their level of grip and resistance to road hazard. Irregular tread wear (also called &#x201c;uneven wear&#x201d; or &#x201c;abnormal wear&#x201d;) is a great concern for heavy commercial vehicle tires as it can progressively induce tire vibrations that become sensed by the driver through the steering wheel. It can also make for a poor looking wear pattern. Both of these undesired effects often lead to the tire being removed from service at an early stage of its wear life. Generally, the more the tire is put through a slow-wearing usage, the more irregular wear is affecting the removal mileage. This is why resistance to irregular wear is of paramount importance for truck tires in so-called long haul steer, drive, and trailer usage.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known to include structural features in tires to achieve certain performance benefits. For instance, thin cuts into the tread known as sipes can be used in tires in order to improve performance on snow, ice, and water, and to help manage heat generated in the tire. However, the placement of sipes into the tread may cause cracks to be formed at the bottom end of the sipe. In order to address this cracking, it is known to put teardrops into the bottom of the sipes. A teardrop is an enlargement of the sipe bottom and is typically circular in cross-sectional shape which increases the radius of the sipe bottom to reduce stress concentrations and minimize the risk of crack initiation. Sipe bottom cracking may occur more often in the shoulder area of the tire, but it can occur anywhere sipes are present on the tread. For drive axle tires with sipes in the shoulder, a rather large teardrop is needed to sufficiently reduce the cracking due to the torque acting on the tire. However, such a large diameter teardrop, possibly 4-5 millimeters in diameter, can cause other problems with the shoulder such as creating unwanted compression on an edge of the block at the sipe due to the undercut formed by the large teardrop. This undercut may lead to abnormal wear at the edge of the block. Although ways of stopping cracks from forming in one part of the sipe are known, they may in turn cause abnormal wear at another portion of the tire. As such, there remains room for variation and improvement in the design of sipes in tire treads.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A full and enabling disclosure of the present invention, including the best mode thereof, directed to one of ordinary skill in the art, is set forth in the specification, which makes reference to the appended figures, in which:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a heavy truck tire.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a top plan view of a portion of tread in accordance with one exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of a portion of the tread of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line <b>5</b>-<b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line <b>6</b>-<b>6</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a J shaped sipe in accordance with another exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a J shaped sipe in accordance with yet another exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a top plan view of a portion of tread that has angled J shaped sipes in accordance with yet another exemplary embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The use of identical or similar reference numerals in different figures denotes identical or similar features.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings.

The J shaped sipe <b>30</b> has a main portion <b>32</b> that extends into the tread <b>10</b>, and a curved portion <b>38</b> that extends from the main portion <b>32</b>. The curved portion <b>38</b> extends under the trailing edge <b>26</b> such that the J shaped sipe <b>30</b> is oriented completely forward or substantially forward relative to the rolling direction <b>24</b>. A teardrop <b>44</b> may be located at a curved portion end <b>42</b> of the curved portion <b>38</b>.

In this regard, the tire <b>12</b> is not designed for nor used with a car, motorcycle, or light truck (payload capacity less than 4,000 pounds), but is instead designed for and used with heavy duty trucks such as 18 wheelers, garbage trucks, or box trucks. The tire <b>12</b> may be a steer tire, a drive tire, a trailer tire, or an all position tire, although in a preferred embodiment the tire <b>12</b> is a drive tire. The tire <b>12</b> includes a carcass <b>64</b> onto which a tread <b>10</b> is disposed thereon. The central axis <b>66</b> of the tire <b>12</b> extends through the center of the carcass <b>64</b>, and the axial direction <b>20</b>, which can be called the width direction <b>20</b>, of the tire <b>12</b> is parallel to the central axis <b>66</b>. The radial direction <b>18</b> of the tire <b>12</b> can be referred to as the thickness direction <b>18</b> and is perpendicular to the central axis <b>66</b>. The tread <b>10</b> is located farther from the central axis <b>66</b> in the radial direction <b>18</b> than the carcass <b>64</b>. The tread <b>10</b> extends all the way around the carcass <b>64</b> in the circumferential direction <b>22</b> of the tire <b>12</b> and circles the central axis <b>66</b> 360 degrees.

The five ribs <b>52</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> can be classified as a center rib <b>70</b>, two intermediate ribs <b>68</b>, <b>72</b>, and two shoulder ribs <b>52</b>, <b>74</b>. The shoulder ribs <b>52</b>, <b>74</b> are on the ends of the tread <b>10</b> in the axial direction <b>20</b>, but in some embodiments sacrificial ribs could be located even more outboard than the shoulder ribs <b>52</b>, <b>74</b>. The intermediate ribs <b>68</b>, <b>72</b> are just inboard of the shoulder ribs <b>52</b>, <b>74</b> and are separated therefrom by shoulder grooves that extend in the circumferential direction <b>22</b>. The center rib <b>70</b> is between the two intermediate ribs <b>68</b>, <b>72</b> in the axial direction <b>20</b>.

The tread <b>10</b> has a first tread edge and an oppositely disposed second tread edge in the axial direction <b>20</b>. The rolling tread width of the tread <b>10</b> extends from one edge to the other edge and is the portion of the tread <b>10</b> that is designed to engage the ground <b>16</b> when the tire <b>12</b> is new before any tread <b>10</b> wear has occurred. The tire <b>12</b> can be a brand new tire with the carcass <b>64</b> and tread <b>10</b> formed at the same time with both being brand new.

The curved portion <b>38</b> is broken up into a plurality of curved thicker gapped zones <b>56</b> and curved thinner gapped zones <b>58</b> across the width of the curved portion <b>38</b> along the axial direction <b>20</b>. Eight curved thinner gapped zones <b>58</b> and nine curved thicker gapped zones <b>56</b> are present and alternate with one another across the axial width of the J shaped sipe <b>30</b>. However, any number may be present in other embodiments. The curved thicker gapped zones <b>56</b> are present at the first axial end <b>60</b> and the second axial end <b>62</b>.

More than 50% of the entire axial width <b>54</b> includes a curved portion <b>38</b> that has a curved portion thickness t<sub>2 </sub>that is the smallest curved portion thickness t<sub>2 </sub>of the J shaped sipe <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The driving torque acting on tires <b>12</b> causes the crack to form &#x201c;behind&#x201d; the sipe in the direction opposite to the rolling direction <b>24</b>, causing crack propagation underneath the leading edge <b>28</b>. Since the orientation of the crack propagation is defined by the driving torque and consequently by the rolling direction <b>24</b>, the bottom of the J shaped sipe <b>30</b> can be designed to reduce or minimize cracking at this location. The curved portion <b>38</b> creates a void under the trailing edge <b>26</b> of the J shaped sipe <b>30</b> which decrease the compression stiffness at the trailing edge <b>26</b> of the block which in turn decreases the contact stress as the tire <b>12</b> rolls through contact. This decrease may be enough to cause an increase in wear rate at the trailing edge <b>26</b> and eventually generate abnormal wear. To limit this compression, the curved portion <b>38</b> may have a thickness less than the rest of the J shaped sipe <b>30</b> such as the main portion <b>32</b> and the teardrop <b>44</b>. The thickness t<sub>2 </sub>of the curved portion <b>38</b> may be 0.2 millimeters which is the preferred thickness t<sub>2</sub>. This thickness t<sub>2 </sub>can be along the entire axial width <b>54</b>, or may be along just portions of the entire axial width <b>54</b> for manufacturability. The teardrop <b>44</b> may provide additional reinforcement at the bottom tip of the J shaped sipe <b>30</b> and reduce the risk of cracking at the tip.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> which goes through one of the curved thinner gapped zones <b>58</b>. The J shaped sipe <b>30</b> has a main portion <b>32</b> that has an opening <b>34</b> located at the upper surface <b>14</b>. The opening <b>34</b> cuts the shoulder rib <b>52</b> into a pair of blocks one being forward of the opening <b>34</b>, and the other being rearward of the opening <b>34</b>. As the tread <b>10</b> rotates into the contact patch with the ground <b>16</b> in the rolling direction <b>24</b>, the block forward of the opening <b>34</b> enters the contact patch first and engages the ground <b>16</b> before the block rearward of the opening <b>34</b>. A trailing edge <b>26</b> of the block forward of the opening <b>34</b> is defined by the upper surface <b>14</b> and the main portion <b>32</b> at the opening <b>34</b>. A leading edge <b>28</b> of the block rearward of the opening <b>34</b> enters the contact patch after the trailing edge <b>26</b>, but is called the leading edge <b>28</b> because it is the leading edge of the block that is rearward of the opening <b>34</b>. The trailing edge <b>26</b> and the leading edge <b>28</b> can be edges that are lines, or edges that include some amount of planar or curved surface as the transition of the upper surface <b>14</b> to the main portion <b>32</b> may be a sharp corner, curved, or have any type of transitional shape. The trailing and leading edges <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> may be a portion of the J shaped sipe <b>30</b> but could also be a portion of the sipe <b>30</b> along with the upper surface <b>14</b>, an interior surface of the tread <b>10</b>, or any combination. The edges <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> are still a part of the tread <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The main portion <b>32</b> of the J shaped sipe <b>30</b> extends from the opening <b>34</b> in the radial direction <b>18</b> and is the longest portion of the J shaped sipe <b>30</b>. The main portion <b>32</b> is defined by a forward wall <b>46</b> and a rearward wall <b>48</b> that are both planar, but need not be in other embodiments of the tread <b>10</b>. The main portion <b>32</b> extends in the radial direction <b>18</b> until reaching a bottom end <b>36</b>. The main portion <b>32</b> is thus defined from the opening <b>34</b> to the bottom end <b>36</b>. The curved portion <b>38</b> extends from the bottom end <b>36</b> into the tread <b>10</b> to a curved portion end <b>42</b>. The transition from the main portion <b>32</b> to the curved portion <b>38</b> at the bottom end <b>36</b> may be visible in that the size of the J shaped sipe <b>30</b> changes at this point. If the relative thicknesses of the main portion <b>32</b> and the curved portion <b>38</b> are the same then the bottom end <b>36</b> can be identified as being the location when the J shaped sipe <b>30</b> begins to curve to thus signify the start of the curved portion <b>38</b>. The J shaped sipe <b>30</b> is shown as being oriented in the radial direction <b>18</b>, but in other embodiments the J shaped sipe <b>30</b> can be inclined relative to the radial direction <b>18</b> so that it extends at an angle to the radial direction <b>18</b> either forward or rearward. The J shaped sipe <b>30</b> can be angled from 5-30 degrees, from 20-35 degrees, or up to 45 degrees to the radial direction <b>18</b> in accordance with certain exemplary embodiments.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The curved portion <b>38</b> extends a length that is less than that of the main portion <b>32</b>. The curved portion <b>38</b> extends both in the radial direction <b>18</b> and the circumferential direction <b>22</b>. The curved portion <b>38</b> has a bottom curved wall <b>40</b>. The radius of the bottom curved wall <b>40</b> can be the same along its entire length, or there may be multiple radii of curvature of the bottom curved wall <b>40</b> from the bottom end <b>36</b> to the curved portion end <b>42</b>. The main portion <b>32</b> and the curved portion <b>38</b> may thus roughly form the shape of a J so that the sipe <b>30</b> can be referred to as a J shaped sipe <b>30</b>. The bottom curved wall <b>40</b> is concave in shape.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The curved portion <b>38</b> is oriented relative to the main portion <b>32</b> so that the curved portion <b>38</b> extends completely, or at least partially, in the rolling direction <b>24</b> forward of the main portion <b>32</b>.

The J shaped sipe <b>30</b> may be at the top of the tire <b>12</b> when being measured. It should be noted that the immediately described parameters include embodiments where the curved portion thickness t<sub>2 </sub>is 0.0 millimeters. This can be accomplished if the curved portion <b>38</b> is formed via a very thin cut through the rubber of the shoulder rib <b>52</b>. For example, if the curved portion <b>38</b> were formed via cutting instead of molding. With a 0.0 millimeter curved portion thickness t<sub>2</sub>, the top curved wall <b>50</b> touches the bottom curved wall <b>40</b> such that there is no spatial separation between these walls <b>40</b>, <b>50</b> although they are cut.

With these dimensions, d<sub>1 </sub>may be from 3 millimeters to 4.95 millimeters. Such dimensions may be optimal dimensions for performance and manufacturability of the J shaped sipe <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0038">The curved thicker gapped zone <b>56</b> of the J shaped sipe <b>30</b> is illustrated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> which is a cross-sectional view taken along line <b>6</b>-<b>6</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> showing the bottom portion of the J shaped sipe <b>30</b>. The curved portion <b>38</b> at the curved thicker gapped zone <b>56</b> has a larger curved portion thickness t<sub>2 </sub>than at the curved thinner gapped zone <b>58</b>. In zone <b>56</b>, the curved portion thickness t<sub>2 </sub>may be equal to the main portion thickness t<sub>1</sub>. In some embodiments, there are no distinct zones <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, but the curved portion <b>38</b> has the same curved portion thickness t<sub>2 </sub>across the entire axial width <b>54</b>. This thickness t<sub>2 </sub>in these embodiments may be 0.2 millimeters or may be from 0.1-1.0 millimeters. Applicant has discovered that the dimension t<sub>2 </sub>that is very small (on the order of up to 1.0 millimeters) provides material in this area that limits compression and thus prevents abnormal wear at the trailing edge <b>26</b>. One reason why different zones <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> are present is due to manufacturability. The J shaped sipe <b>30</b> is formed by a sipe forming feature in the mold. A very thin sipe forming feature that can form the very thin, curved portion <b>38</b> may break when the very thin sipe forming feature is extracted from the tread <b>10</b> during molding. To help prevent this, the sipe forming feature can be made thicker with the inclusion of thicker portions. These thicker portions make the sipe forming feature stronger but also form the curved thicker gapped zones <b>56</b>. Although the curved thicker gapped zones <b>56</b> are formed in the J shaped sipe <b>30</b>, they may still allow the J shaped sipe <b>30</b> to achieve abnormal wear prevention or minimization since the J shaped sipe <b>30</b> will have the curved thinner gapped zones <b>58</b> that add material in the area of the curved portion <b>38</b> to resist abnormal wear at the trailing edge <b>26</b>. Aside from having a larger curved portion thickness t<sub>2 </sub>in zones <b>56</b>, the cross-sectional shape and the rest of the size of the J shaped sipe <b>30</b> is the same. Although shown with the two different zones <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, any number of differently sized zones are possible in other arrangements, and embodiments exist in which only a single zone is present in which the size of the J shaped sipe <b>30</b> is the same across the entire axial width <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0039">The J shaped sipe <b>30</b> is arranged so that added material is present just forward of the main portion <b>32</b> and thus under and/or forward of the trailing edge <b>26</b>. This added material can be present in the curved portion <b>38</b> to reduce compression of the curved portion <b>38</b> during rolling of the tread <b>10</b> and prevents or minimizes abnormal wear. This arrangement results in less or no abnormal wear at the trailing edge <b>26</b>. When saying the curved portion <b>38</b> has added material it is to be understood that the added material simply means that the curved portion <b>38</b> has a thickness that is small, and in most cases the thickness of the curved portion <b>38</b> is smaller than the thickness of the main portion <b>32</b>. This increased material in the J shaped sipe <b>30</b> functions as a compression limiter that reduces the drop in stress at the trailing edge <b>26</b> which minimizes the risk of abnormal wear.
