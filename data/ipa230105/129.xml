Typically, the stuffed and shaped shells are then fried in oil.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, the shells are formed, filled, and shaped by hand. Accordingly, the mixture of bulgur and ground beef paste is first formed into a ball, and the cook then uses their thumb to shape the ball into a cup shape.

Configurations provide a kibbeh-making device that is small, affordable, and simple enough for typical home use, such as while resting on a countertop or tabletop, and that automatically stuffs the outer shell with the filling.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in configurations a kibbeh-making attachment <b>100</b> may be attached to an auxiliary power output <b>102</b> of a stand mixer <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The stand mixer <b>101</b> could be any countertop-sized, stand mixer having an auxiliary power output <b>102</b> for mixer accessories. Such stand mixers are readily available to consumers and professional cooks. The auxiliary power output <b>102</b> is a rotational drive for the mixer accessories. In configurations, instead of the auxiliary power output <b>102</b>, the kibbeh-making attachment <b>100</b> could be coupled to the primary <b>103</b> power output of the stand mixer <b>101</b>. The primary <b>103</b> power output is the output that is usually vertical and that drives the implement, such as beaters, dough hooks, and whisks, in the mixing bowl of the stand mixer <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of the kibbeh-making attachment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, illustrated without the stand mixer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of the kibbeh-making attachment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> in exploded view. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a sectional view of the kibbeh-making attachment, as defined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of an example dual auger of the kibbeh-making attachment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an exploded view of the dual auger of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, the kibbeh-making attachment <b>100</b> may include a housing <b>104</b>, a housing sleeve <b>105</b>, a dual auger <b>106</b>, an extruder cap <b>107</b>, and a press handle <b>108</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>6</b></figref> show generally how these components may be assembled together into the kibbeh-making attachment <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The housing <b>104</b> is configured to contain the housing sleeve <b>105</b>, the dual auger <b>106</b>, the extruder cap <b>107</b>, and the press handle <b>108</b>. The housing <b>104</b> may include a first chute <b>109</b>, a second chute <b>110</b>, and a conveyance chamber <b>111</b>. The first chute <b>109</b> is configured to provide the shell material to the dual auger <b>106</b>, as more fully described below. The shell material is the material for the outside shell of the kibbeh, which, as noted above, is often made from a raw mixture of bulgur and ground beef paste. The second chute <b>110</b> is configured to provide filling material to the dual auger <b>106</b>, as more fully described below. The filling material is the material to be stuffed within the outside shell of the kibbeh. As noted above, the filling material is often made from a cooked mixture of ground beef, onions, and pine nuts. The conveyance chamber <b>111</b> is the chamber in which the shell material and the filling material are conveyed from the first chute <b>109</b> and the second chute <b>110</b> to the extruder cap <b>107</b>, as more fully described below. In configurations, the conveyance chamber <b>111</b> may include a step <b>119</b> in a portion of the conveyance chamber <b>111</b> aligned with the second chute <b>110</b>. The step <b>119</b> may help to prevent the filling material from becoming trapped within the conveyance chamber <b>111</b> out of reach of the dual auger <b>106</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the step <b>119</b> occupies that portion of the conveyance chamber <b>111</b> where the outer auger <b>116</b> (discussed below) does not extend.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Each of the first chute <b>109</b> and the second chute <b>110</b> may include a hopper <b>112</b> to hold additional shell material and filling material. As illustrated, there may be a wall or other separator between the two hoppers <b>112</b> to avoid mixing of the filling material and the shell material within the hoppers <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The housing sleeve <b>105</b> is configured to substantially surround and support an attachment end <b>113</b> of a center beam <b>114</b> of the dual auger <b>106</b>, allowing the center beam <b>114</b> to rotate within the housing sleeve <b>105</b>. As used in this disclosure, &#x201c;substantially surround&#x201d; means largely or essentially extending around, without requiring perfect encircling. In configurations, the housing sleeve <b>105</b> is also configured to mate the kibbeh-making attachment <b>100</b> to the stand mixer <b>101</b>. Accordingly, the housing sleeve <b>105</b> may include one or more protrusions <b>115</b>, slots, or other features to interface with the particular stand mixer <b>101</b>, as different stand mixers may require different interfaces.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In configurations, the kibbeh-making attachment <b>100</b> may include a converter or adaptor (not illustrated) to permit the kibbeh-making attachment <b>100</b> to be compatible with a variety of stand mixer styles.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As illustrated, the dual auger <b>106</b> has concentric augers: an outer auger <b>116</b> and an inner auger <b>117</b>, each of which rotates about the center beam <b>114</b> of the dual auger <b>106</b>. The attachment end <b>113</b> of the center beam <b>114</b> is configured to couple to the stand mixer <b>101</b>. Hence, rotary motion and torque from the stand mixer <b>101</b> is transferred to the kibbeh-making attachment <b>100</b> by way of the attachment end <b>113</b> of the center beam <b>114</b>. The center beam <b>114</b> is configured to spin about its longitudinal axis. The attachment end <b>113</b> may include features to interface with the particular stand mixer <b>101</b>, as different stand mixers may require different interfaces.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The outer auger <b>116</b> is configured to convey shell material from the first chute <b>109</b> to an outlet end <b>118</b> of the extruder cap <b>107</b>, the extruder cap <b>107</b> being at an outlet end of the conveyance chamber <b>111</b>. To do so, the outer auger <b>116</b> spins about the center beam <b>114</b> and against the relatively fixed wall (i.e. one that does not spin with the center beam <b>114</b>) of the conveyance chamber <b>111</b>. The spinning action tends to push the shell material toward the outlet end <b>118</b> of the extruder cap <b>107</b>. In configurations, the conveyance chamber <b>111</b> may include a reverse spline <b>120</b> on the interior wall of the conveyance chamber <b>111</b>. The reverse spline <b>120</b> includes a helical wind direction that is opposite in direction to the helical wind direction of the outer auger <b>116</b> to promote movement of shell material within the conveyance chamber <b>111</b>. For example, when the outer auger <b>116</b> is viewed from the attachment end <b>113</b> of the inner auger <b>117</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the helical wind direction of the outer auger <b>116</b> is counterclockwise. Hence, from the same viewpoint, the helical wind direction of the reverse spline <b>120</b> is clockwise. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the outer auger <b>116</b> does not extend beyond, and preferable does not substantially extend into, the path defined by the second chute <b>110</b>. Accordingly, the outer auger <b>116</b> would not obstruct the passage of filling material from passing from the second chute <b>110</b> to the inner auger <b>117</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The inner auger <b>117</b> is configured to convey filling material from the second chute <b>110</b> to the outlet end <b>118</b> of the extruder cap <b>107</b>. To do so, the inner auger <b>117</b> spins about the center beam <b>114</b> against the relatively fixed chamber extension <b>121</b> of the extruder cap <b>107</b> (i.e. the chamber extension <b>121</b> does not spin with the center beam <b>114</b>). The spinning action tends to push the shell material toward the outlet end <b>118</b> of the extruder cap <b>107</b>. In configurations, the extruder cap <b>107</b> may include a reverse spline <b>126</b> on the interior wall of the extruder cap <b>107</b>. The reverse spline <b>126</b> includes a helical wind direction that is opposite in direction to the helical wind direction of the inner auger <b>117</b> to promote movement of filling material within the extruder cap <b>107</b>, particularly the chamber extension <b>121</b> of the extruder cap <b>107</b>. For example, when the inner auger <b>117</b> is viewed from the attachment end <b>113</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the helical wind direction of the inner auger <b>117</b> is counterclockwise. Hence, from the same viewpoint, the helical wind direction of the reverse spline <b>126</b> is clockwise.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As most clearly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the inner auger <b>117</b> may include one or more drive extensions <b>123</b> to transfer rotational motion and torque of the inner auger <b>117</b> to the outer auger <b>116</b>. In configurations, the outer auger <b>116</b> may include receptacles <b>128</b> to accept the drive extensions <b>123</b> of the inner auger <b>117</b> and to align the outer auger <b>116</b> to the inner auger <b>117</b> (both rotationally about the center beam <b>114</b> and longitudinally along the length of the inner auger <b>117</b>).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As illustrated, the extruder cap <b>107</b> may include the chamber extension <b>121</b>, the outlet end <b>118</b>, and a converging chamber <b>122</b>. The chamber extension <b>121</b> extends into the conveyance chamber <b>111</b>, but typically not further than the inner auger <b>117</b> extends into the conveyance chamber <b>111</b> from the outlet end <b>118</b> of the extruder cap <b>107</b>. Stated another way, the chamber extension <b>121</b> extends into the conveyance chamber <b>111</b> to a point that is between the first chute <b>109</b> and the second chute <b>110</b>. The chamber extension <b>121</b> provides a relatively fixed surface (one that does not spin about the center beam <b>114</b>) against which the inner auger <b>117</b> may rotate to convey the filling material. As illustrated, the chamber extension <b>121</b> may have the form of a right cylinder.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The converging chamber <b>122</b> is configured to gather, compress, and shape the shell material before the shell material leaves the extruder cap <b>107</b>. The filling material and the shell material pass through the outlet end to exit the extruder cap <b>107</b>. In configurations, the converging chamber <b>122</b> also helps ensure a homogeneous mass flow rate during shell extrusion. In configurations, the converging chamber <b>122</b> also reduces the diameter of the shell material, so that the diameter of the shell material, upon leaving the extruder cap <b>107</b>, is close to the outer diameter of the filling material upon leaving the extruder cap <b>107</b>. In different configurations, the shell outlet sizing can be made smaller or larger to produce a desired kibbeh shell wall thickness depending on preferences of the consumer. In configurations, the extruder cap <b>107</b> is threaded to the housing <b>104</b>. In such configurations, the direction to tighten the extruder cap <b>107</b> onto the housing <b>104</b> via the threads is preferably the same direction that the dual auger <b>106</b> spins during normal operation to prevent the extruder cap <b>107</b> from loosening during normal operation.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated, the press handle <b>108</b> is configured to simultaneously push shell material through the first chute <b>109</b> and filling material through the second chute <b>110</b>. In the illustrated configuration, the press handle <b>108</b> includes a single handle <b>124</b> and two plungers <b>125</b> extending from the single handle <b>108</b>. In configurations, the two plungers <b>125</b> may have different lengths. Such configurations may be useful, for example, to create a lag between the extrusion of the shell material and the extrusion of the filling material. Hence, if it is desired that the shell material begin extruding before the filling material, the plunger <b>125</b> that corresponds to the first chute <b>109</b> may be longer than the plunger <b>125</b> that corresponds to the second chute <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each of the components discussed above may be made from, for example, food grade plastic, although other materials could be used in configurations.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As noted, configurations provide a kibbeh-making device that is simple enough for typical home use, such as while resting on a countertop or tabletop. In that regard, the weight of the kibbeh-making device preferably does not exceed ten pounds (4.5 kilograms). More preferably, the weight of the kibbeh-making device preferably does not exceed 7.5 pounds (3.4 kilograms). Even more preferably, the weight of the kibbeh-making device preferably does not exceed five pounds (2.3 kilograms). In addition, the kibbeh-making device, when assembled as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, preferably would fit entirely within a box having a volume of 6000 cubic inches (0.09832 cubic meters). This concept of fitting entirely within a box having a given volume is referred to in this disclosure at the &#x201c;cube size.&#x201d; More preferably, the kibbeh-making device preferably would have a cube size that does not exceed 3500 cubic inches (0.05735 cubic meters). Even more preferably, the kibbeh-making device preferably would have a cube size that does not exceed 1000 cubic inches (0.01639 cubic meters). Accordingly, the kibbeh-making device is small enough (in both weight and size) for a typical human user to be able to move the kibbeh-making device by hand from place to place.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">To use the illustrated configuration of the kibbeh-making attachment <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, a user would connect the kibbeh-making attachment <b>100</b> to a stand mixer <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Next, the user would insert shell material into the first chute <b>109</b> (and perhaps the hopper <b>112</b> corresponding to the first chute <b>109</b>) and filling material into the second chute <b>110</b> (and perhaps the hopper <b>112</b> corresponding to the second chute <b>110</b>). The user would then insert the press handle <b>108</b>, inserting one of the two plungers <b>125</b> into the first chute <b>109</b> and the other of the two plungers <b>125</b> into the second chute <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">While maintaining some pressure on the press handle <b>108</b> (to ensure a constant supply of the shell material and the filling material to the conveyance chamber <b>111</b>), the user may turn on the stand mixer <b>101</b> to provide rotation to the center beam <b>114</b> of the dual auger <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">When activated, the dual auger <b>106</b> conveys the shell material through the conveyance chamber <b>111</b> by way of the outer auger <b>116</b>, and the dual auger <b>106</b> conveys the filling material through the conveyance chamber <b>111</b> by way of the inner auger <b>117</b>. The shell material then passes through the converging chamber <b>122</b> and out the outlet end <b>118</b> of the extruder cap <b>107</b>. The filling material passes through the extruder cap <b>107</b> and out the outlet end <b>118</b> of the extruder cap <b>107</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">By exiting the extruder cap <b>107</b> at the same time, the shell material surrounds the filling material, forming an extrusion with shell material on the outside and filling material on the inside. The user may then clip the extruded material to a desired length, pinch the shell material closed on each end, and form the kibbeh piece.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The process may continue until the desired number of kibbeh pieces are obtained.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">While the device has been described as a kibbeh-making attachment, the disclosed concepts could be applied to make products other than kibbeh, including other food products that have an outer layer surrounding an inner filling.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition, while the discussion above focuses on using a stand mixer, other mechanical input methods and apparatus could be used to provide rotational energy to drive the kibbeh-making attachment. For example, in configurations the kibbeh-making attachment may be driven instead by another electric motor or by a manual crank configured to rotate the center beam <b>114</b> of the dual auger <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In that regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a perspective view of an example of a kibbeh-making attachment, according to an example configuration, shown attached to a hand crank. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a sectional view of the kibbeh-making attachment, as defined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.

In addition, the kibbeh-making attachment <b>200</b> may include a support stand <b>227</b> to support the housing <b>104</b>, for example, on a countertop or other similar surface. Otherwise, the kibbeh-making attachment <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>8</b></figref> may have the same features as described above for the kibbeh-making attachment <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Illustrative examples of the disclosed technologies are provided below.
