Therefore, people spend a lot of manpower and material resources on the scientific researches of synthetic diamond, and have successfully invented two methods for synthesizing diamond. A first method is a static pressing method that uses a high-temperature, high-pressure mechanical equipment to convert graphite into single crystal diamond through phase transformation. At present, this technology has been relatively mature and popular, but this method has large investment in equipment and complex raw materials, and the product particle size is on the order of mm.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A second method is a dynamic pressure synthetic method, in which an impact dynamic high-pressure high-temperature condition is created by the explosion of an explosive, so that graphite is converted into polycrystalline diamond with a particle size on the order of &#x3bc;m in the time scale on the order of &#x3bc;s. The dynamic high-pressure synthetic technology does not require huge and expensive mechanical equipment, and is a new technology for synthesizing new materials. Now only a few companies such as DuPont in the US have fully mastered this technology, and really realize the industrialization.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Compared with monocrystalline diamond, polycrystalline diamond differs not only in crystal structure and particle size, but also quite differs in performances. Polycrystalline diamond has excellent grinding performance, and can be used in the fields of high-grade, high-precision, advanced technologies such as aviation, aerospace, precision ceramics, LED chips, and sapphire substrates. Besides, polycrystalline diamond also has many excellent properties, and has a wide application prospect in national defense and civilian fields.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Diamond and graphite are allotropic crystals of carbon elements, and to artificially synthesize diamond, it would naturally have been readily conceivable to use graphite as a synthetic raw material. A pressure-temperature phase diagram of carbon is a unit complex phase diagram, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The phase diagram provides temperature and pressure regions in which graphite and diamond are stably present. In a diamond stable region with a relatively high pressure, a graphite-type crystal structure is unstable, and the graphite must be converted into diamond to reduce its own free energy; in contrast, in the graphite stable region with a relatively low pressure, the diamond type polycrystalline structure is unstable, and it should be converted into graphite to reduce its own energy. This multiphase phase diagram of carbon tells people that to synthesize diamond by explosive impact, at least the following requirements must be met:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">firstly, a suitable detonation synthesis device must be developed to create a certain high-temperature, high-pressure condition, so that the graphite is converted into diamond;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">secondly, the diamond phase existing in high temperature and high pressure should be preserved, when unloaded from transient detonation to normal temperature and normal pressure, preventing graphitization; and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">thirdly, as explosion is a process that is quite hard to control, the technical difficult problem of diamond recovery must be solved.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The existing technological difficulties mainly focus on improving the conversion rate and recovery rate of diamond while synthesizing high-purity polycrystalline diamond with dynamic high pressure, and the costs also need to be reduced to the maximum extent to realize industrial production.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The technical problem to be solved by the present disclosure is that the existing detonation process of diamond has the problems of a low conversion rate and difficult recovery. The present disclosure provides a double-tube connection structure for detonation synthesis, a detonation synthesis device for solving the problems, and application thereof.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present disclosure is realized through the following technical solutions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A double-tube connection structure for detonation synthesis includes a drive tube, a sample tube, and end plugs provided at two ends of the sample tube, wherein the drive tube is sleeved outside the sample tube, and a cavity exists between the drive tube and the sample tube and between the drive tube and the end plugs; fixing components are further included, and a top portion port and a bottom portion port of the drive tube are each covered by the fixing component; after an explosive is detonated at the top portion, a detonation wave is transferred sequentially from top to bottom, and under impacting action, the drive tube performs convergent sliding motion towards an axis of the sample tube from top to bottom, so that the drive tube is sequentially wrapped from top to bottom around a top end plug of the sample tube, the sample tube, and a bottom end plug of the sample tube.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Taking the detonation impact synthesis of diamond as an example, the detonation impact synthesis of diamond is to introduce a strong shock wave into a mixture of graphite and copper powder, and a transient effect of thousands of degrees of temperature and hundreds of thousands of atmospheres is generated by the strong shock wave, to convert the graphite into the diamond; this transient violent process is completed within tens of &#x3bc;s to hundreds of &#x3bc;s, thus the dynamic high-pressure synthetic process itself is quite difficult to regulate and control, and the sealing end plugs at the end portions of the sample tube are easily blasted away, causing the sample to fly off, then the conversion rate is low, and the recovery is extremely difficult.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The double-tube connection structure of the sample tube and the drive tube designed in the present disclosure enables the end portion of the drive tube to perform convergent motion (poly heart movement) and plastic deformation, and further tightly wrap the end plug, can effectively prevent the sealing end plugs at the end portions of the sample tube from being blasted away, and facilitates improving the conversion rate and recovery rate.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Therefore, the drive tube in the present disclosure mainly can achieve the following two functions, one is acting as a carrier for absorbing explosive energy, wherein when the drive tube impacts the sample tube, the energy is transferred to the sample to generate a high-temperature, high-pressure condition for converting graphite into diamond, and the other is that after explosion, when the drive tube collides in cavity flight with the end plug and the sample tube at a high speed, the collision pressure of the drive tube with the end plug and the sample tube is far higher than the Hugoniot elastic limit of the material of the drive tube itself, the material enters a plastic zone, and undergoes a convergent effect (poly heart effect) and plastic deformation, so that the drive tube is tightly wrapped around the sample tube and sealing end plugs at two ends, preventing the end plugs from being blasted away, and enabling the raw material sample to be completely sealed in the sample tube; and the drive tube, the sample tube, and the sealing end plugs at two ends constitute a composite tube with very high strength by means of a strengthening effect of detonation, to form a complete recovery container of diamond sample, which can well seal the sample obtained when reaching a pressure of more than 20 GPa and a high temperature of several thousand degrees after impact loading.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, along the entire axial position of the sample tube, a circumferential equidistant gap between an inner wall of the drive tube and an outer wall of the sample tube serves as a cavity. In the present disclosure, no obstacle is designed between the drive tube and the sample tube, which is beneficial to ensure the uniform propagation of the detonation wave, so as to form high-temperature high-pressure synthesis condition, and the drive tube is allowed to perform convergent motion and plastic deformation to be tightly wrapped around the sample tube and the end plugs to form a composite tube with two ends closed.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, an outer diameter of a part of the end plug for being in wrapping contact with the drive tube is smaller than an outer diameter of the sample tube.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As a preferred solution, it is designed in such a manner that an outer diameter of a part of the end plug for being in wrapping contact with the drive tube is smaller than an outer diameter of the sample tube. In this way, when the high-pressure detonation product pushes the drive tube to perform convergent motion towards the axis of the end plug, a caliber of the drive tube after the shrinkage at the small diameter part of the end plug is smaller than that after the shrinkage at the sample tube, therefore, the drive tube automatically forms an end portion constriction structure, further improving the tightening effect on the end plug.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, the end plug is in a tapered structure, and a large diameter end of the tapered structure is connected to the sample tube.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Designing the end plug in a tapered structure facilitates stable downward transmission of the detonation wave while improving the fastening effect of the drive tube to the end plug.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, after detonation, when the detonation wave is transferred to a joint between an end portion of the drive tube and the fixing component, the joint between the end portion of the drive tube and the fixing component is disconnected, and the fixing component flies outwards under the action of tensioning wave (tensile wave).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">From detonation physics, it can be known that in the air, when a cylindrical charge is detonated from an end plane, a ratio of mass (M1) and energy (E1) propagating in a detonation wave motion direction to mass (M2) and energy (E2) propagating in a direction opposite to the detonation wave motion direction is: M1/M2=4/5, E1/E2=16/11. At the end portions of the device, namely a top end and a bottom end of the sample tube, when the high-pressure detonation product is expanded in a divergent manner in the air, the tensioning wave will be generated, and when the tensioning wave is at the end portion of the sample tube and has enough strength, the orifice of the sample tube at the end portion may be broken, so that the sample in the tube is sprayed/jetted and leaked. In order to avoid the tensioning area (stretch zone) at the end portion, the fixing component is set at each of the end portions of the sample tube and the drive tube. The fixing component, after gaining momentum, flies outward and takes away the momentum, so that the end portion of the sample tube avoids the tensioning area, effectively preventing the orifice of the recovery container at the end portion from breaking, and achieving the purpose of completely recovering the sample.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further, for the fixing component mounted at the top portion of the drive tube, it includes a fixing ring and at least one layer of cover plate; the fixing ring has one end connected to the top portion of the drive tube and the other end connected to the cover plate, the cover plate is configured to seal the cavity; the fixing component mounted at the bottom portion of the drive tube includes a fixing ring and a base, and the fixing ring has one end connected to the bottom portion of the drive tube and the other end connected to the base, and the base plays a fixing and supporting role.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The cover plate in the present disclosure is configured to fix the sample tube, the drive tube and the fixing ring, and seal a top opening of the cavity between the sample tube and the drive tube, so as to prevent the explosive from entering the cavity. The base is configured to fix and support the drive tube and the sample tube.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Further, the end portion of the drive tube and the end portion of the fixing ring are spliced with each other to form a coaxial barrel structure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the present disclosure, the drive tube and the fixing ring are connected by a splicing structure, which not only can ensure that the fixing ring can smoothly fly out and take away the momentum during the detonation process, but also can simplify the structure to the maximum extent and reduce the cost.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further, a limiting ring I extending outwards in an axial direction is provided on an end surface of the bottom portion or the top portion of the drive tube, a limiting ring II extending outwards in an axial direction is provided on an end surface of corresponding fixing ring, and connection between the drive tube and the fixing ring is realized through the limiting ring I and the limiting ring II with one sleeved over the other.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">On one hand, the connection structure between the drive tube and the fixing ring is greatly simplified, which is beneficial to reduce the manufacturing cost and the cost of loading and unloading; on the other hand, when the high-pressure detonation product pushes the end portion of the drive tube to make a convergent motion, the joint between the fixing ring and the drive tube will not produce any resistance.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further, the fixing component further includes a fixing block, the fixing block is provided in the fixing ring, and the fixing block has one end connected to the end plug, and the other end connected to the cover plate or the base.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The fixing block and the fixing ring are added to the end portions of the sample tube and the drive tube. After these blocks and rings gain momentum, they fly outward and take away the momentum, which can effectively protect the end portions of the recovery container, and facilitate the complete recovery of the sample. In order to protect the end portion of the sample tube and take away as much momentum as possible, the weight of the fixing ring and the fixing block can be increased, for example, a metal ring or metal block structure is adopted.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present disclosure also discloses a detonation synthesis device, which includes a housing, and also includes the above double-tube connection structure for detonation synthesis disposed in the housing, wherein a chamber between an inner wall of the housing and an outer wall of the drive tube is filled with a main explosive, bottom ends of the drive tube and the sample tube are mounted on a tray through the fixing component, and the tray is configured to seal a bottom end of the housing, and a top end of the housing is provided with a detonation component.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The present disclosure substantially provides a cylindrical surface sliding detonation double-tube impact synthesis device. After detonation at the top end of the device, a detonation wave is formed, the detonation wave propagates from top to bottom along the outer wall of the drive tube at a steady speed, and a high-pressure detonation product behind a detonation wave front pushes the drive tube to perform convergent sliding motion towards the axis of the device. During cavity flight, on an explosive-drive tube interface, due to the interaction between the compressional wave and rarefaction wave, the drive tube will continuously obtain energy from the explosive to continuously accelerate. Due to the convergent effect, the more the drive tube converges towards the axis, the higher its free-surface velocity will be. After the drive tube collides with the sample tube at a high speed, a stable detonation shock wave system is formed in the sample, and traverses the whole sample from top to bottom, so that the sample is uniformly compressed. Thus, the conversion rate of the present disclosure is quite high, reaching 90% or more, and the sample can be recovered by 100%.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further, the detonation component includes a primer, a detonator fixing plate, and a detonator, wherein the primer is laid flat on a top layer of the main explosive, the primer is provided thereon with the detonator fixing plate, and the detonator fixing plate is fixed thereon with the detonator.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The above double-tube connection structure for detonation synthesis or the above detonation synthesis device can be used to convert low pressure phase materials into high pressure phase materials or to pulverize hard materials, wherein the high pressure phase materials include diamonds, carbides, nitrides, borides.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The present disclosure further provides a high-strength composite tube, wherein the high-strength composite tube is made after detonation of the above double-tube connection structure for detonation synthesis or the above detonation synthesis device.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The present disclosure further provides a high-strength pressure vessel, wherein the high-strength pressure vessel is made after detonation of the above double-tube connection structure for detonation synthesis or the above detonation synthesis device.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The present disclosure further provides a preparation method of the above high-strength composite tube and/or high-strength pressure vessel, wherein the high-strength composite tube and/or the high-strength pressure vessel is made after detonation of the above double-tube connection structure for detonation synthesis or the above detonation synthesis device.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The high pressure, high temperature, and high strain rate generated by the explosion and impact action form a unique comprehensive means of acting on substances. It has a wide application prospect. Besides being used for synthesizing diamond, the above device can also be widely applied to develop other new materials, for example, it can be used for synthesizing wurtzite type and sphalerite type boron nitride with hardness second to that of diamond, and can also be used for synthesizing ceramics with carbide, boride, and nitride structure such as TiC, TiB2, B4C, and SiC, which are light-weight and high-temperature resistant structural ceramics urgently required by many high-technology departments. In addition, it also can be used to pulverize super-hard materials, such as diamond, which are difficult to pulverize under normal circumstances, making them suitable for various different uses.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The present disclosure has the following advantages and beneficial effects.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">1. The sample tube and drive tube connection structure provided in the present disclosure enables the end portions of the drive tube to perform convergent motion and plastic deformation, and further tightly wrap the end plugs, can effectively prevent the sealing end plugs at the end portions of the sample tube from being blasted away, and facilitates improving the conversion rate and recovery rate. Therefore, the drive tube in the present disclosure mainly can realize the following two functions, one is acting as a carrier for absorbing explosive energy, wherein when the drive tube impacts the sample tube, the energy is transferred to the sample to generate a high-temperature high-pressure condition for converting graphite into diamond, and the other is that after explosion, when the drive tube collides with the end plugs and the sample tube at a high speed in cavity flight, the collision pressures of the drive tube with the end plugs and the sample tube are far higher than the Hugoniot elastic limit of the material of the drive tube itself, the material enters a plastic zone, and undergoes a convergent effect and plastic deformation, so that the drive tube is tightly wrapped around the sample tube and sealing end plugs at two ends, preventing the end plugs from being blasted away, and enabling the raw material sample to be completely sealed in the sample tube to promote the complete reaction of the raw material sample; and the drive tube, the sample tube, and the sealing end plugs at two ends constitute a composite tube with very high strength by means of a strengthening effect of detonation, to form a recovery container of diamond sample, which can well seal the sample obtained when reaching a pressure of more than 20 GPa and a high temperature of several thousand degrees after impact loading.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">2. The configuration of the present disclosure facilitates taking away the momentum, prevents the end portions of the sample tube from breaking. At the end portion of the device, when the high-pressure detonation product is expanded in a divergent manner in the air, the tensioning wave will be generated, and when the tensioning wave is at the end portion of the sample tube and has enough strength, the orifice of the sample tube at the end portion may be broken, so that the sample in the tube is sprayed and leaked. In order to avoid the tensioning areas at the end portions, the fixing rings and the fixing blocks are provided at the top ends and/or the bottom ends of the sample tube and the drive tube. The fixing rings and the fixing blocks, after gaining momentum, fly outward and take away the momentum, so that the end portions of the sample tube avoids the tensioning area, effectively preventing the end portions of the recovery container from breaking, and achieving the purpose of completely recovering the sample.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">3. The fixing ring and the fixing block provided in the present disclosure facilitate stable transmission of the detonation waves moving to the sample tube. As there is a detonation distance from unstable to stable when the explosive is just detonated, adding the fixing block and the fixing ring of appropriate height on the top also can play a role in keeping away from the unstable detonation area of the explosive.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">To synthesize diamond by the detonation impact, a strong shock wave is introduced into the mixture of the graphite and the copper powder, and the transient effect of thousands of degrees of temperature and hundreds of thousands of atmospheres is generated by the strong shock wave, to convert the graphite into the diamond; and the copper powder is used as a quenching agent, to enable the diamond phase, which is stable at a high temperature and a high pressure, to be preserved at a low temperature and a low pressure. The present disclosure makes this transient violent process controllable and adjustable and manageable according to people's requirements.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The present disclosure has important significance for breaking technical blockade and realizing industrial production of the polycrystalline diamond. The explosion synthesis or shock wave synthesis of new materials has become a new important technology in material researches, and this new technology has wide application prospect.

A Certain High-Temperature High-Pressure Condition can be Created, so that Graphite is Converted into Diamond, and a High Conversion Rate is Obtained.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The present embodiment substantially provides a cylindrical surface sliding detonation double-tube impact synthesis device. After the explosive is detonated at the top end of the device, a detonation wave is formed in the explosive, the detonation wave propagates from top to bottom along the outer wall of the drive tube at a steady speed, and a high-pressure detonation product behind a detonation wave front pushes the drive tube to perform convergent motion towards the axis of the device. During cavity flight, on an explosive-drive tube interface, due to the interaction between the compressional wave and rarefaction wave, the drive tube will continuously obtain energy from the explosive to continuously accelerate. Due to the convergent effect, the more the drive tube converges towards the axis, the higher its free-surface velocity will be. After the drive tube and the sample tube collide with each other at a high speed, a shock wave forms a stable detonation impact system in the sample tube, and traverses the whole sample from top to bottom, so that the sample is uniformly compressed. Thus, the conversion rate of the present disclosure is quite high, reaching 90% or more.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">2. Graphitization can be Prevented.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">An impact compression process is accompanied by an unloading process of pressure. In the unloading process, in order to reduce the reverse phase change from diamond to graphite as much as possible, doping a metal powder (such as copper powder) with good thermal conductivity into the sample can achieve the effect of impact quenching, and this requirement can be met by selecting an appropriate mixing ratio of graphite to metal powder.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">3. High Recovery Rate.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As the collision pressure between the drive tube and the sample tube is far higher than the Hugoniot elastic limit of the material of the drive tube itself, the material enters a plastic zone, and through the convergent effect and plastic deformation, the drive tube is tightly wrapped around the sample tube and sealing plugs at two ends, and the drive tube, the sample tube, and the sealing plugs at two ends constitute a composite tube with very high strength through the detonation action, becoming a recovery container for the diamond generated. Besides, at the end portion of the device, when the high-pressure detonation product expands in a divergent manner into the air, the tensioning wave will be generated, and when the tensioning wave is at the end portion of the sample tube and has sufficient strength, an orifice of the sample tube may be broken, and the sample in the tube may be jetted and leaked. To avoid a tensioning zone (stretch zone) at the end portion of the sample tube, the fixing block and the fixing ring are added at the end portions of the sample tube and the drive tube, in this way, the end portion of the recovery container can be effectively protected from being blasted away. The recovery rate of diamond can reach 100%.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">After the diamond is synthesized by means of detonation impact, the sample (namely, mixture of diamond, graphite, and copper powder) is taken out from the recovery container of the composite tube, to undergo selective oxidation acid treatment, so as to separate out the diamond in the sample, and then subsequent purification operations such as screening and grading of the diamond are performed.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In conclusion, the detonation synthesis device provided in the present disclosure can meet the high-temperature high-pressure condition for converting graphite into diamond, so that the sample graphite is uniformly compressed and converted into high-purity polycrystalline diamond in the device. The conversion rate is unprecedentedly improved to 90% or more; and the converted product, high-purity polycrystalline diamond, is completely recovered, with the recovery rate reaching 100%.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The inventors have successfully synthesized high-purity nano-structured polycrystalline diamond through the device, the conversion rate reaches 90% or more, the converted product, high-purity nano-structured polycrystalline diamond, is fully recovered by 100%, with the particle size being normally distributed in 0-32 &#x3bc;m, and the industrialized production can be fully realized.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The above-mentioned embodiments have further illustrated the objectives, the technical solutions, and the beneficial effects of the present disclosure in detail.
