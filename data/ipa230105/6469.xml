level="1">1. Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various embodiments of the disclosure relate to a wireless power transmitting device, a wireless power receiving device, and a method for operating the same.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As the demand for mobile communication increases, or as the degree of integration of electronic devices increases, the portability of electronic devices such as mobile communication terminals may be increased, and better convenience may be provided in use of multimedia functions. For example, as touchscreen-integrated displays replace traditional mechanical (button-type) keypads, electronic devices may come more compact while functioning as an input device. For example, as the mechanical keypad may be omitted from the electronic device, portability of the electronic device may be improved. As the display area may be expanded to the area which used to be occupied by the mechanical keypad, the electronic device may provide a larger screen while remaining the same size and weight as when the mechanical keypad was included.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Use of an electronic device with a larger screen may give more convenience in, e.g., web browsing or multimedia playing. A larger display may be adopted to output a larger screen, but providing a larger screen may be limited by the portability of the electronic device. To address this issue, a display using organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) may secure the portability of the electronic device while providing a larger screen. For example, a display using (or an electronic device equipped with) organic light emitting diodes may implement a stable operation even if it is made quite thin, so that the display may be applied to an electronic device in a foldable, bendable or rollable form.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A wireless power receiving device may include a resonance circuit for wirelessly receiving power. Depending on the angle (or direction) of a magnetic force line formed by a wireless power transmitting device, introduced to the resonance circuit, an eddy current (e.g., induced current based on Faraday's law) formed in the resonance circuit may vary in strength and, accordingly, the charging efficiency may vary as well. There are multiple parameters (e.g., relative distance or relative height) that vary the angle (or direction) of the magnetic force line coming to the resonance circuit and affect the charging efficiency. However, regardless of the plurality of parameters (because the magnetic force line is not visually recognized), a user may place the wireless power receiving device for charging, and thus charging efficiency may be reduced. Further, when changing the state of placement of the wireless power receiving device to adjust a plurality of parameters affecting the charging efficiency to enhance charging efficiency, it is difficult for the user to directly determine the plurality of parameters, thereby making it difficult to properly change the state of placement of the wireless power receiving device.

For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the slit <b>305</b> may be formed in the upper portion of the second conductor (e.g., the outer portion in the +Z direction), or may be formed in a side portion (e.g., the outer portion in the +X direction or the &#x2212;X direction). The slit <b>305</b> may be formed in a side portion without being limited thereto. Based on formation of the slit <b>305</b> in the coil (e.g., the second conductor <b>301</b><i>b</i>), the coil (e.g., the first conductor to third conductor <b>301</b><i>a</i>, <b>301</b><i>b</i>, and <b>301</b><i>c</i>) may be used as a resonance circuit <b>301</b> (namely, a resonator) including a capacitor and an inductor. For example, components (e.g., an impedance matching circuit, at least one capacitor) of the wireless power transmitting device <b>101</b> may be connected to two opposite ends of the slit <b>305</b>. The wireless power transmitting device <b>101</b> may amplify the power to be transmitted through the amplifying circuit and then provide the amplified power through an impedance matching circuit (not illustrated) to the coil (e.g., the resonance circuit <b>301</b>) including the slit <b>305</b>. Accordingly, a magnetic field may be generated from the coil (e.g., the resonance circuit <b>301</b>) including the slit <b>305</b> based on the supplied current, and thereby, power (e.g., the power <b>105</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may be wirelessly transmitted to the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> (e.g., wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">According to various embodiments, the strength of the magnetic field formed in the XZ plane may be larger than the strength of the magnetic field formed in the XY plane based on the AC current received through the slit <b>305</b>. For example, referring to (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the directions of the AC current applied through the slit <b>305</b> at each time point may be opposite to each other with respect to the XY plane in the first conductor <b>301</b><i>a </i>and the third conductor <b>301</b><i>c</i>.

As an example, with respect to the XY plane, AC current may flow clockwise in the first conductor <b>301</b><i>a </i>and counterclockwise in the second conductor <b>301</b><i>b </i>and, alternately, may flow counterclockwise in the first conductor <b>301</b><i>a </i>and clockwise in the second conductor <b>301</b><i>b</i>. Due to this, the magnetic field (hereinafter, a first magnetic field) generated from the first conductor <b>301</b><i>a </i>and the magnetic field generated from the third conductor <b>301</b><i>c </i>may be generated in opposite directions with respect to the inside (e.g., center O) and be thus canceled off. Thus, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, the strength of the magnetic field formed in the Z-axis direction (+Z-axis direction or &#x2212;Z-axis direction) with respect to the inside (e.g., center O) of the resonance circuit <b>301</b> may be low (or no magnetic field may be formed). As another example, referring to (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the direction of the AC current applied through the slit <b>305</b> at each time point may correspond (or be identical) for all the conductors (e.g., the first to third conductors <b>301</b><i>a</i>, <b>301</b><i>b</i>, and <b>301</b><i>c</i>) with respect to the XZ plane. As an example, with respect to the XZ plane, AC current may flow counterclockwise in the first to third conductors <b>301</b><i>a</i>, <b>301</b><i>b</i>, and <b>301</b><i>c </i>and, alternately, flow counterclockwise in the first to third conductors <b>301</b><i>a </i>to the third conductor. As described above, AC current may flow in opposite directions in the first conductor <b>301</b><i>a </i>and the third conductor <b>301</b><i>c </i>at a time point with respect to the XY plane. However, referring to (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, AC current may flow in directions corresponding to each other (or identical to each other) (e.g., +X direction or &#x2212;X direction) in the first conductor <b>301</b><i>a </i>and the third conductor <b>301</b><i>c </i>with respect to the XZ plane at a time point. For example, the directions of the current <b>321</b> flowing through the first conductor <b>301</b><i>a</i>, the current <b>319</b> flowing through the third conductor <b>301</b><i>c</i>, and the current <b>323</b> flowing through the second conductor <b>301</b><i>b </i>may be the same at each time point. As an example, current flows in the second conductor <b>301</b><i>b </i>in the direction (e.g., counterclockwise or clockwise) corresponding to the direction (e.g., +X direction or &#x2212;X direction) of the AC current flowing in the first conductor <b>301</b><i>a </i>and the third conductor <b>301</b><i>c</i>, with respect to the XZ plane and may resultantly correspond (or identical) for all of the conductors (e.g., the first to third conductors <b>301</b><i>a</i>, <b>301</b><i>b</i>, and <b>301</b><i>c</i>) with respect to the XZ plane. Thus, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, a magnetic field may be formed in the Y-axis direction (e.g., +Y-axis direction or &#x2212;Y-axis direction) with respect to the inside (e.g., center O) of the resonance circuit <b>301</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">According to various embodiments, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, an eddy current (e.g., a current inducted based on Faraday's law) may be inducted in the resonance circuit <b>301</b> of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> by the magnetic field formed in the resonance circuit <b>301</b>.

Referring to <b>601</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, when the resonance circuit <b>510</b><i>a </i>of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> is positioned in the Z-axis direction (or direction of 90 degrees) from the resonance circuit <b>560</b><i>a </i>of the wireless power transmitting device <b>101</b>, the angle at which the resonance circuit <b>510</b><i>a </i>of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> becomes perpendicular to the magnetic force line is an angle close to 0 degrees and, in this case, the charging efficiency may be highest. In other words, the angle of rotation of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> may be determined to provide the highest charging efficiency per position. If the angle of the resonance circuit <b>510</b><i>a </i>of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> is changed from 0 degrees, the charging efficiency may gradually reduce as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> and, when approaching 0 degrees, the charging efficiency may increase. Meanwhile, the position of electrical components <b>611</b> (e.g., a display or battery) having conductivity, which is disposed in the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b>, may also influence the charging efficiency. For example, if the electric components <b>611</b> are positioned between the resonance circuit <b>510</b><i>a </i>of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> and the resonance circuit <b>560</b><i>a </i>of the wireless power transmitting device <b>101</b>, the magnetic force line of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b>, transferred to the resonance circuit <b>510</b><i>a </i>by the electric components <b>611</b>, may be blocked so that the charging efficiency of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> may be lowered. Thus, although not illustrated, charging efficiency may be relatively higher when the angle of the resonance circuit <b>510</b><i>a </i>is 0 degrees than when the angle of the resonance circuit <b>510</b><i>a </i>in which the electric components <b>611</b> are positioned between the resonance circuit <b>510</b><i>a </i>of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> and the resonance circuit <b>560</b><i>a </i>of the wireless power transmitting device is 180 degrees. As a result, when the angle of the resonance circuit <b>510</b><i>a </i>is 0 degrees, the charging efficiency of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> may be maximized. Further, referring to <b>602</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, when the resonance circuit <b>510</b><i>a </i>of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> is positioned in a direction of about 45 degrees from the resonance circuit <b>560</b><i>a </i>of the wireless power transmitting device <b>101</b>, the angle at which the resonance circuit <b>510</b><i>a </i>of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> becomes perpendicular to the magnetic force line may be around 30 degrees. Further, referring to <b>603</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, when the resonance circuit <b>510</b><i>a </i>of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> is positioned in the Y-axis direction (or direction of 0 degrees) from the resonance circuit <b>560</b><i>a </i>of the wireless power transmitting device <b>101</b>, the angle at which the resonance circuit <b>510</b><i>a </i>of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> becomes perpendicular to the magnetic force line may be around &#x2212;30 degrees. In an embodiment, the position of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> with respect to the wireless power transmitting device <b>101</b> and the angle of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> may be determined based on the attributes (e.g., distance, angle, or angle of rotation) as described above, so that the angle of the resonance circuit <b>401</b> showing the highest charging efficiency per position may correspond to the value of each of the attributes (hereinafter, a reference value). As an example, referring to <b>630</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, if the relative angle of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> with respect to the wireless power transmitting device <b>101</b>, among the attributes, is 0 degrees, and the folding angle (O) between the two housings <b>631</b> and <b>632</b> of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b>, among the attributes, is 150 degrees, the angle of rotation in the state in which the resonance circuit <b>510</b><i>a </i>is positioned in a 0-degree direction of the wireless power transmitting device <b>101</b> is 30 degrees, so that the charging efficiency may be the highest.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0116">Similar to the experiment of detecting the highest charging efficiency at a specific angle of rotation and the specific angle, other attributes may also be experimented (or tested) so that the value of each of the attributes exhibiting the highest charging efficiency may previously be obtained, and the obtained values may be stored in the memory of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b>. Performing the experiment (or test) may mean identifying the charging efficiency of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> while adjusting the values of at least some of the attributes and obtaining the values of the attributes exhibiting the highest charging efficiency. For example, an experiment of detecting charging efficiency may be performed while changing the value of only one attribute, with the values of the other attributes among the plurality of attributes fixed and, during the experiment and/or as a result of the experiment, the value of the one attribute and the fixed values of the other attributes may be obtained at the time when the charging efficiency is the highest. However, without being limited to those described, the experiment may be conducted in various manners. As an example, it may be detected that charging efficiency is maximized when the folding angle (&#x3b8;) becomes 150 degrees while conducting the experiment by changing the folding angle (&#x3b8;) at the relative angle of 0 degrees as described above, and the corresponding values may previously be stored in the memory of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b>.

According to various embodiments, the processor <b>530</b> may obtain the value of each of the plurality of attributes using the sensor <b>520</b>. In an embodiment, the processor <b>530</b> may obtain values for attributes (e.g., folding angle, folding form, sliding distance, or sliding form) associated with the relative position between the wireless power receiving device and the housings using the above-described first sensor (e.g., a hall sensor, an angle sensor, a strain sensor, a distance sensor, or a gyroscope sensor (or a tilt sensor), or an image sensor). In another embodiment, the processor <b>530</b> may identify values for height, distance, and/or angle using the above-described second sensor (e.g., UWB communication circuit). However, without being limited to those described, the processor <b>530</b> may identify the value for each attribute (e.g., height, distance, and/or angle) by receiving, through the communication circuit, the value for each attribute (e.g., height, distance, and/or angle) identified in the external electronic device (e.g., the wireless power transmitting device <b>101</b>).</p><p id="p-0119" num="0117">According to various embodiments, in case the identified charging efficiency is less than a threshold, the processor <b>530</b> may provide content for enhancing charging efficiency.

If at least one attribute to be changed is determined, the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> may identify the current value for the at least one determined attribute using the sensor <b>520</b> and/or receive the current value for at least one attribute from the wireless power transmitting device <b>101</b>. Meanwhile, in case it is determined that there is no attribute to be changed among the plurality of attributes, the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> may provide an error message (e.g., output it through the output device <b>545</b>). As an example, in case an object disturbing charging exists between the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> and the wireless power transmitting device <b>101</b>, it may be determined that there is no attribute to be changed among the plurality of attributes. Thus, the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> may provide an error message to allow the user to remove the object disturbing charging. According to various embodiments, the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> may output content for changing attribute. For example, the content may include information for guiding to change a specific attribute (e.g., an attribute selected to be changed) from the current value to the reference value. In an embodiment, referring to <b>750</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, the content may include at least one of information about the optimal state or information about the current state <b>751</b>. As an example, when the content is a screen, the information about the current state <b>751</b> may include text for the charging time currently required to fully charge the battery (hereinafter, full charge time) and an image corresponding to the current value of the attribute to be changed, and the information about the optimal state <b>753</b> may include an image corresponding to a state in which the attribute is changed to the reference value and text for the charging time required to fully charged the battery when the attribute is changed to the reference value and may also include text instructing to change the attribute. For example, the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> may previously store images corresponding to the respective vehicles of the attributes, obtain an image corresponding to the value of the attribute (e.g., the current value or reference value of the attribute) among the stored images and include it in the screen, but is not limited thereto (e.g., previously stores an image for the wireless power receiving device corresponding to a specific value for each attribute and deforms the stored image as much as the difference between the specific value and the current reference value and includes it). As an example, the text instructing to change attribute may be determined based on a result of comparison between the reference value and current value of the attribute to be changed. For example, the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> may identify the size relationship as a result of comparison between the current value and reference value of the attribute and determine text corresponding to the size relationship for guiding to change the attribute. As an example, in case the current value of the attribute is lower than the reference value, the wireless power receiving device may determine text instructing to increase the attribute and output the determined text and, in case the current value is higher than the reference value, determine text instructing to decrease the attribute and output the determined text. As another example, the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> may identify the difference as a result of comparison between the current value and reference value of the attribute and determine text for guiding to change the attribute as much as the identified difference. For example, in case the difference between the current value and reference value of the attribute is a first difference, the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> may determine text instructing to change (or increase or decrease) the attribute by the first difference and output the determined text. Without being limited to those described, text representing a degree, rather than a specific numerical value, may be determined for the attribute to be changed, and the text may be determined according to the degree of difference. According to an embodiment, in a case where the attribute to be changed is distance, the information about the current state <b>751</b> may include an image for the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> spaced apart by the current value for the distance from the wireless power transmitting device <b>101</b> and current full charge time, and the information about the optimal state <b>753</b> may include an image for the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> spaced apart by the distance (e.g., a reference value for distance) that should be changed from the wireless power transmitting device <b>101</b> and the full charge time therefor, and text instructing to change the distance (e.g., &#x201c;Increase the distance&#x201d; or &#x201c;decrease the distance&#x201d;). The user may recognize the image and text displayed on the screen and reposition or transform the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> to allow the attribute (e.g., distance) to be changed accordingly. Similarly, the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> may provide the information about the current state <b>751</b> and the information about the content for the optimal state <b>753</b> through an output device <b>545</b> other than the display. As an example, the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> may output a sound for the information about the current state <b>751</b> and the information about the optimal state <b>753</b> through a speaker. In another embodiment, the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> may provide content including information about a plurality of states <b>761</b> as illustrated in <b>760</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>. For example, the information about the plurality of states <b>761</b> may include information associated with charging for values for which the attribute is changeable. As an example, in a case where the content is a screen, the information about the plurality of states may include a plurality of images corresponding to a plurality of values between the current value and reference value of the attribute to be changed, the values of the respective attributes of the plurality of images, and full charge time associated with each of the plurality of images. For example, in case the attribute to be changed is distance, the value of the distance is a first value, and the reference value of the distance is a second value, an image for the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> corresponding to each of the second value and a plurality of values between the first value and the second value (e.g., an image for the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> spaced apart from the wireless power transmitting device <b>101</b> by the corresponding value), a value of distance associated with each image, and a full charge time of each in a position associated with each image may be displayed. Accordingly, the user may properly change the attribute of the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> to correspond to one image among the plurality of images, in the current situation. As another example, in case a plurality of attributes are selected as attributes to be changed, the information about the plurality of states <b>761</b> may include information for guiding to change for each of the plurality of attributes.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0138">According to various embodiments, in operation <b>709</b>, the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> may again determine whether the charging efficiency is less than the threshold and, unless the charging efficiency is less than the threshold (or equal to or greater than the threshold), provide content indicating that the charging efficiency is greater than or equal to the threshold in operation <b>711</b>. For example, after providing the content, the wireless power receiving device <b>103</b> may again perform the operation of comparing the charging efficiency with the threshold and, based on a result of the comparison, output content.
