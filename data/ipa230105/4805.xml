Conventional document execution environments enable users to view and execute documents, but do not provide intelligent analyses of document contents. To provide an improved, efficient, and more reliable document execution experience to the user, there is a need for a system that analyzes content based on characteristics of the documents, and provides recommendations to users of the document execution environment based on this analysis.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A method for detecting high-risk passages in a document within a document execution environment is described herein.

A document execution environment enables a party (e.g., individuals, organizations, etc.) to create and send documents to one or more receiving parties for negotiation, collaborative editing, electronic execution (e.g., electronic signature), automation of contract fulfilment, archival, and analysis. Within the document execution environment, a receiving party may review content and/or terms presented in a digital document, and in response to agreeing to the content and/or terms, can electronically execute the document. In some embodiments, the receiving party provides the sending party (e.g., the party that created and sent the document for execution) with feedback on the content and/or terms in the document received for execution. In some embodiments, the receiving party completes and/or contributes to a portion of the content and/or terms in the document. Additionally, the sending party may access and/or share data associated with the document within the document execution environment, such as a time and location at which the receiving party accesses, views, and/or executes the document. In some embodiments, the receiving and/or sending parties also have access to archival data of similar documents. In some embodiments, the document execution environment enables payments between the receiving and sending parties. DocuSign, Inc's e-Signature product is an example of functionality that is implemented within a document execution environment. A document execution environment and example functionality is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,634,975, issued Apr. 25, 2017, and U.S. Pat. No. 10,430,570, issued Oct. 1, 2019, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The system environment described herein can be implemented within an online document system, a document execution system, or any type of digital transaction management platform. It should be noted that although description may be limited in certain contexts to a particular environment, this is for the purposes of simplicity only, and in practice the principles described herein can apply more broadly to the context of any digital transaction management platform. Examples can include but are not limited to online signature systems, online document creation and management systems, collaborative document and workspace systems, online workflow management systems, multi-party communication and interaction platforms, social networking systems, marketplace and financial transaction management systems, or any suitable digital transaction management platform.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The processes described herein help users identify passages in documents within the document execution environment that are associated with a level or risk or liability that exceeds one or more user- or entity-defined thresholds. The document execution environment inputs a passage to a machine learned model trained on historical documents, the machine learned model configured to output the passage's associated risk. The document execution environment accordingly identifies high-risk and/or anomalous passages that differ from similar passages of the same type, which thereby triggers a set of actions. For example, the document execution environment enables users to compare and contrast high-risk passages with similar passages in other documents within the document execution environment. Thus, the document execution environment is able to improve automation of the document review process.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example document execution environment <b>100</b> in which high-risk passages within documents can be identified, in accordance with one or more embodiments. As described above, the document execution environment <b>100</b> enables a sending party to create and send digital documents for electronic execution to one or more receiving parties. The receiving parties may review, modify, and execute the documents. The document execution environment <b>100</b> uses a machine learned model to identify high-risk passages in a document sent for execution. As used herein, a &#x201c;high-risk passage&#x201d; refers to a passage associated with a risk that exceeds a risk threshold, though it should be noted that passages identified as high-risk may in practice not be particularly risky (for instance, if the risk threshold is low). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the document execution environment includes a document for execution <b>110</b>, a client device <b>120</b>, a set of training documents <b>130</b>, and a high-risk passage detection engine <b>140</b>, each communicatively interconnected via a network <b>180</b>. In some embodiments, the document execution environment includes components other than those described herein. For the purposes of concision, the web servers, data centers, and other components associated with an online document execution environment are not shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The document for execution <b>110</b> is analyzed to identify high-risk passages within the document. Each document for execution <b>110</b> can include one or more passages (e.g., legal clauses, financial terms, and the like) that each associated with a passage type. Examples of documents for execution <b>110</b> include but are not limited to: a sales contract, a permission slip, a rental and/or lease agreement, a liability waiver, a financial document, an investment term sheet, a purchase order, an employment agreement, a mortgage application, and so on. The document execution environment <b>100</b> receives the document for execution <b>110</b> from the sending party via the client device <b>120</b> (or receives instructions to create the document within the document execution environment <b>100</b> from the client device <b>120</b>) and provides it to the receiving party (not illustrated in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), for instance, for signing. It should be noted that although examples are given herein in the context of a single document, the document execution environment <b>100</b> can coordinate the creation, viewing, editing, and signing of any number of documents (e.g., thousands, millions, and more) for any number of users or accounts, and for any number of entities or organizations.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The client device <b>120</b> provides the document for execution <b>110</b> to the document execution environment <b>100</b>. The client device <b>120</b> is a computing device capable of transmitting and/or receiving data over the network <b>190</b>. The client device <b>120</b> may be a conventional computer (e.g., a laptop or a desktop computer), a cell phone, or a similar device. The client device <b>120</b> enables a user (e.g., of the sending party) to create and/or provide the document for execution <b>110</b> to the document execution environment <b>100</b>. After the document execution environment <b>100</b> determines that a passage in the document for execution <b>110</b> is high-risk, the client device <b>120</b> notifies the user of the high-risk passage and/or provides, to the user, a related passage from another document for comparison. In some embodiments, the client device <b>120</b> simultaneously displays the high-risk passage and the related passage within two interface portions of a user interface of the client device <b>120</b>. Likewise, in some embodiments, the threshold level of risk or a passage type can be received from the user (for instance, via the client device <b>120</b>) for use in identifying high-risk passages within the document.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The training documents <b>130</b> serve as a training set of information for training the machine learned model to determine levels of risk associated with passages in documents for execution <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, one or more users responsible for creating and/or managing the training documents <b>130</b> manually curate and/or provide, to the document execution environment <b>100</b>, a type of passage and a level of risk associated with each of the passages in the training documents <b>130</b>. For example, the training set of information can include historical documents associated with the document execution environment <b>100</b>, each historical document including one or more passages associated with specified passage types and specified levels of risk.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The high-risk passage detection engine <b>140</b> identifies high-risk passages within the document for execution <b>110</b> using a machine learned model <b>160</b>. In response to identifying a high-risk passage, the high-risk passage detection engine <b>140</b> identifies at least one related passage of the same passage type from another document in the document execution environment <b>100</b>. The high-risk passage detection engine <b>140</b> presents to the user, via the client device <b>120</b>, the high-risk passage and the related passage for comparison. In some embodiments, the high-risk passage detection engine <b>140</b> identifies high-risk passages in more than one document for execution. Likewise, the high-risk passage detection engine <b>140</b> can detect high-risk passages and/or documents across an account (such as an account associated with a user or a company), or can detect high-risk passages and/or documents across an organization. The high-risk passage detection engine <b>140</b> includes a server <b>150</b>, which hosts and/or executes a machine learned model <b>160</b> and a database <b>170</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The server <b>150</b> stores and receives information from the document execution environment <b>100</b>. The server <b>150</b> may be located on a local or remote physical computer and/or may be located within a cloud-based computing system. The server <b>150</b> accesses the document for execution <b>110</b>, for instance by receiving it from the client device <b>120</b>, by retrieving the document from storage associated with the document execution environment <b>100</b>, and the like. In some embodiments, the server <b>150</b> identifies the passages and the respective passage types within the document for execution <b>110</b>. It should be noted that in some embodiments, the document for execution <b>110</b> is provided to and stored by a system other than server <b>150</b>. In these embodiments, the high-risk passage detection engine <b>140</b> can perform one or more risk detection operations configured to determine a level of risk associated with the document, passages within the document, and/or with the system that stores the document.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The machine learned model <b>160</b> is configured to determine a level of risk associated with a passage within the document for execution <b>110</b>, based on various factors, including but not limited to a passage type of the passage. The machine learned model <b>160</b> is trained on a training set of information. The training set of information includes the training documents <b>130</b>, each including passages associated with a level of risk and a passage type. After being trained, the machine learned model <b>160</b> is applied to passages identified within the document for execution <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the machine learned model <b>160</b> is applied to a plurality of passages within the document for execution <b>110</b> to determine an overall level of risk associated with the document for execution <b>110</b>. In other embodiments, the machine learning model <b>160</b> is applied to a plurality of passage across a plurality of documents for execution <b>110</b>, associated with one or more accounts, or associated with one or more organizations or entities. The machine learned model <b>160</b> then outputs a determined associated level of risk for each passage within the one or more documents for execution <b>110</b>, for instance based on a passage type of each passage.

As described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the machine learned model <b>160</b> takes, as input, passages within the document for execution <b>110</b> to determine a level of risk associated with each of the passages. The machine learning model <b>160</b> determines the level of risk based on, for example, types of the passages, a type of the document for execution <b>110</b>, an industry associated with the document for execution <b>110</b>, and so on. The high-risk passage detection engine <b>140</b> identifies passages that have a determined risk above a threshold level (e.g., a high-risk passage) and presents the high-risk passage to the user of the client device <b>120</b> along with a related passage of the same type from another document. In some embodiments, the high-risk passage detection engine <b>140</b> provides recommendations to the user to mitigate the risk associated with the high-risk passage.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The high-risk passage detection engine <b>140</b> trains the machine learned model <b>160</b> using a training set of information <b>200</b> (e.g., &#x201c;the training set <b>200</b>&#x201d;). The training set <b>200</b> includes passages <b>210</b> (e.g., passages found within the training documents <b>130</b>), each associated with a passage type <b>220</b> and a level of risk <b>230</b>. In some embodiments, the training set <b>200</b> additionally includes actions that help mitigate each passage's risk (not included in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The passages <b>210</b>, the associated passage types <b>220</b> and risks <b>230</b>, and the actions resulting in risk mitigation may be provided via client devices (which may be substantially similar to the client device <b>120</b>) to the document execution environment <b>100</b>. In other embodiments, the document execution environment <b>100</b> may automatically identify the passages <b>210</b>, their associated passage types <b>220</b> and risks <b>230</b>, and/or actions resulting in risk mitigation to add to the training set <b>200</b>. In other embodiments, a user of the document execution environment <b>100</b> may manually input or curate a subset of the passages <b>210</b>, passage types <b>220</b>, associated risks <b>230</b>, and the actions resulting in risk mitigation. It should be noted that the information included in the training set <b>200</b> may be representative of historical documents within the document execution environment <b>100</b>. The training set <b>200</b> may also include information about the training documents <b>130</b> from which the passages <b>210</b> originate, and the machine learned model may be trained on this additional information. Examples of this information may include, for each document: a type of the document, size of the document, languages within the document, region in which the document originated, characteristics associated with the sending and receiving party of the document (e.g., size, industry, location of headquarters, revenue, corporate structure), types or categories of information or passages within the document, and the like. In some embodiments, the training set <b>200</b> includes additional information about documents (e.g., document lifecycle data) associated with a system, customer and/or organization of the document execution environment <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The passages <b>210</b> are portions of a document, and may include text, images, or other material of any length. In some embodiments, a passage <b>210</b> corresponds to a legal clause, a business clause, financial agreement text, and the like. For example, a training document <b>130</b> may include a plurality of passages <b>210</b>, each corresponding to a different header within the document. In some embodiments, the passages <b>210</b> are manually flagged, for instance by a document creator, while in other embodiments, the passages <b>210</b> are identified automatically, for instance based on a header associated with the passage, based on a signature or initials field associated with the passage, or based on any other characteristic associated with the passage. It should be noted that not every portion of a document or of text within a document may be considered a &#x201c;passage&#x201d; for the purposes of the description here. Each passage <b>210</b> is associated with a passage type <b>220</b> and a risk <b>230</b>. The associated passage type <b>220</b> characterizes content of the passage as corresponding to a particular category of the passage. Examples of passage types include but are not limited to an indemnity clause, a merger and integration clause, a severability clause, a fees clause, a damages clause, a pricing clause, a purchase clause, a payment clause, and so on.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The associated risk <b>230</b> characterizes a level of risk and/or liability associated with the content of each passage <b>210</b>. For example, risk may be defined as a legal risk, a liability, a financial exposure, a business implication, and the like. The risk <b>230</b> associated with a passage may be based on the passage type <b>220</b>, content of the passage, a type, organization, and/or industry associated with the document from which the passage originated, a position or identity of the sending and/or receiving party, and so on. In some embodiments, the risk <b>230</b> may be designated by one or more models configured to identify anomalies in each passage <b>210</b> and/or differences in the passage <b>210</b> as compared to passages of the same type from other documents within the document execution environment <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, an organization and/or customer associated with the document from which the passage originated specifies a custom definition of risk. The risk <b>230</b> can be represented numerically, for instance, as a likelihood that the passage will result and/or has resulted in legal risk, categorically (e.g., &#x201c;high-risk&#x201d;, &#x201c;moderate risk&#x201d;, &#x201c;low risk&#x201d;), or in any other suitable way. In some embodiments, the risk <b>230</b> is designated as above or below a threshold level of risk. Users of the document execution environment <b>100</b>, network administrators, security personnel, and/or an entity associated with the document execution environment <b>100</b> may define the threshold level of risk and/or liability. In some embodiments, the threshold level of risk and/or liability may be determined automatically (e.g., by an algorithm configured to determine a level of risk acceptable to an entity associated with the document). The threshold level of risk and/or liability may vary based on the passage type <b>220</b>, the type of document from which the passage originated, an industry associated with the document, and so on. In some embodiments, a risk threshold corresponds to a particular passage type, a monetary value associated with a passage, a number of signatories associated with the passage, and the like. Accordingly, for a document that includes multiple passages, for instance each with a different passage type, the risk threshold associated with each passage may vary.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As mentioned above, in some embodiments, the training set <b>200</b> includes actions that resulted in mitigation of the risk <b>230</b> associated with one or more passages. The mitigating actions can be actions that were taken in response to training passages having an above threshold level of risk (e.g., high-risk passages). Examples of mitigating actions include risk driven actions, such as replacing the high-risk passages with lower-risk content, flagging the high-risk passages for further review from additional users that may be most qualified to review the type of passage, requiring additional signatories on documents including the high-risk passages, limiting access to documents including the high-risk passages, notifying an entity (such as the receiving party, the sending party, an account manager, or a network administrator) of the high-risk passage, and the like. The actions may also include risk driven reporting, such as presenting dashboards with graphics and information associated with the high-risk passages, notifying a user of the sending and/or receiving party of the document of other passages impacted by the high-risk passages, and so on. In some embodiments, the actions are determined based on feedback from a sending and/or receiving party of the document, one or more authors of the high-risk passages, from an account or network manager, automatically by algorithm, or based on any other suitable criteria. In some embodiments, the actions are determined based on information about the documents from which the high-risk passages originate, such as a geographic region, language, and/or industry associated with the documents.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The training set <b>200</b> may be separated into a positive training set and a negative training set. The positive training set includes a subset of the passages <b>210</b>, associated passage types <b>220</b>, and associated risks <b>230</b> that are designated (for instance, by the users of the document execution environment <b>100</b>) as above a threshold level of risk, as well as any associated actions taken to mitigate the associated risk <b>230</b>. The negative training set includes another subset of the passages <b>210</b>, associated passage types <b>220</b>, and associated risks <b>230</b> that are designated as below a threshold level of risk.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The high-risk passage detection engine <b>140</b> uses supervised or unsupervised machine learning to train the machine learned model <b>160</b> using the positive and negative training sets of the training set <b>200</b>. Different machine learning techniques may be used in various embodiments, such as linear support vector machines (linear SVM), boosting for other algorithms (e.g., AdaBoost), neural networks, logistic regression, na&#xef;ve Bayes, memory based learning, random forests, bagged trees, decision trees, boosted trees, or boosted stumps. The training of the machine learned model <b>160</b> helps the machine learned model <b>160</b> identify relationships between the passages <b>210</b>, associated passage types <b>220</b>, associated risks <b>230</b>, and any actions taken to mitigate their associated risks <b>230</b>. In other words, training the machine learned model <b>160</b> enables the machine learned model <b>160</b> to identify the relationships between documents within the document execution environment <b>100</b>, passages within the documents, and risks associated with the passages to determine levels of risk associated with subsequently received passages in documents for execution <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The trained machine learned model <b>160</b>, when applied to identified passages <b>240</b> within the document for execution <b>110</b>, determines a level of risk associated with each of the passages <b>240</b>. The trained machine learned model <b>160</b>, in some embodiments, determines a passage type of each of the passages <b>240</b>, and based on the determined passage type, determines a risk associated with each passage. In some embodiments, the trained machine learned model <b>160</b> determines the risk associated with each passage based on characteristics of the document for execution <b>110</b> (e.g., a document type, a region, a language, an industry). The trained machine learned model <b>160</b> (or the high-risk passage detection engine <b>140</b> or any other suitable component) determines whether the determined risk associated each passage exceeds a risk threshold. In some embodiments, an organization and/or company associated with the document for execution <b>110</b> provides the high-risk passage detection engine <b>140</b> with a custom definition of risk, based on which the machine learned model <b>160</b> outputs the associated level of risk. Passages <b>240</b> determined to be associated with an above-threshold risk (e.g., the high-risk passages <b>250</b>) are identified for display to a user. In some embodiments, the high-risk passages <b>240</b> originate from a plurality of documents for execution <b>110</b>, one or more user accounts, or one or more organizations or entities. The passage type of each of the passages <b>240</b>, determined by the trained machine learned model <b>160</b>, may be any of the passage types <b>220</b> associated with the passages <b>210</b> in the training set <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the trained machine learned model <b>160</b> outputs recommended mitigating actions for the user to take that increase a probability of mitigating the risk associated with the high-risk passage <b>250</b>. The recommended mitigation actions may be presented within a dedicated interface portion or an interface overlay, and may include an interface element that, when interacted with, cause one or more of the mitigating actions to be performed. In some embodiments, the high-risk passage detection engine <b>140</b> may automatically perform one or more of the recommended actions associated with the high-risk passage <b>250</b>, for instance in response to the determined risk associated with a passage exceeding the risk threshold by more than a threshold amount. In some embodiments, the high-risk passage detection engine <b>140</b> automatically performs the recommended actions after a passage of a threshold amount of time without action by a user.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In response to the trained machine learned model <b>160</b> identifying the high-risk passages <b>250</b>, the high-risk passage detection engine <b>140</b> displays a high-risk passage <b>250</b> to the user via the client device <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the high-risk passage detection engine <b>140</b> identifies, from another document in the document execution environment <b>100</b>, a related passage of the same type as the high-risk passage <b>250</b>.
