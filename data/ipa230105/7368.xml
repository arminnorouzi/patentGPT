Telecommunications equipment mounts <b>10</b> installed on parapet walls <b>12</b> are known (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). However, since parapet walls <b>12</b> typically are not structural load bearing walls, they typically do not have sufficient capacity to support multiple pieces of telecommunications equipment <b>14</b>, such as, antennas and remote radio units. Therefore, technicians installing telecommunications equipment <b>14</b> on a parapet wall <b>10</b> must secure the equipment <b>14</b> to both the parapet wall <b>12</b> and the roof (or other structure) which can result in damage to both structures. There may be a need for telecommunications equipment mounts that are suitable for use on parapet walls without the risk of damage, while also reducing costs and allowing for easy installation.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A first aspect of the present invention is directed to a telecommunications equipment mount.

The lower rails <b>202</b>, vertical rails <b>204</b>, and upper rails <b>206</b> are coupled together to define a closed structure having a top <b>200</b><i>t</i>, a bottom <b>200</b><i>b</i>, and at least three sides <b>200</b><i>s </i>(see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) with an open interior cavity <b>210</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>6</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the rails <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> of the stabilization frame <b>200</b> define a structure <b>200</b> having a rectangular prism (or cuboid) shape with a length L<sub>SF</sub>, a width W<sub>SF</sub>, and a height H<sub>SF</sub>. The stabilization frame <b>200</b> has a sufficient height H<sub>SF </sub>such that the vertical rails <b>204</b> (i.e., the sides <b>200</b><i>s</i>) of the stabilization frame <b>200</b> extend above an edge <b>12</b><i>e </i>of a mounting structure <b>12</b>, i.e., above the top edge <b>12</b><i>e </i>of a parapet wall <b>12</b> when the stabilization frame <b>200</b> sits on a rooftop <b>16</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). In some embodiments, the stabilization frame <b>200</b> may have a length L<sub>SF </sub>in the range of about 30 inches to about 40 inches, a width W<sub>SF </sub>in the range of about 45 inches to about 55 inches, and a height H<sub>SF </sub>in the range of about 40 inches to about 50 inches. For example, in some embodiments, the stabilization frame <b>200</b> has a length L<sub>SF </sub>of 36 inches, a width W<sub>SF </sub>of 50 inches, and a height H<sub>SF </sub>of 42 inches. As discussed in further detail below, in some embodiments, the weight of the stabilization frame <b>200</b> is sufficient to ballast the mount <b>100</b> on a mounting structure <b>12</b> when telecommunications equipment <b>14</b> is secured to the mount <b>100</b> (i.e., the weight of the stabilization frame <b>200</b> is equal to or greater than the total weight of the telecommunications equipment <b>14</b> (and a mounting pipe <b>550</b>) secured to the mount <b>100</b>).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the bottom <b>200</b><i>b </i>of the stabilization frame <b>200</b> may comprise one or more cross-beam rails <b>208</b>. The cross-beam rails <b>208</b> may provide additional structural support to the stabilization frame <b>200</b>, for example, when the stabilization frame <b>200</b> has an open bottom <b>200</b><i>b</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, in some embodiments, the stabilization frame <b>200</b> comprises two cross-beam rails <b>208</b> that are coupled to the lower rails <b>202</b> and intersect in the center of the bottom <b>200</b><i>b </i>of the stabilization frame <b>200</b> dividing the bottom <b>200</b><i>b </i>into four sections A-D. In some embodiments, more than two cross-beam rails <b>208</b> may be used to divide the bottom <b>200</b><i>b </i>into more than four sections. For example, in some embodiments, the stabilization frame <b>200</b> may comprise three cross-beam rails <b>208</b> that divide the bottom <b>200</b><i>b </i>of the stabilization frame <b>200</b> into six sections.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, in some embodiments, the cross-beam rails <b>208</b> (together with the lower rails <b>202</b>) may be configured to hold weighted items <b>150</b> to help further ballast the mount <b>100</b> on a mounting structure <b>12</b>. For example, in some embodiments, each of the lower rails <b>202</b> may have a flange <b>202</b><i>a </i>that extends inward and parallel relative to the bottom <b>200</b><i>b </i>of the stabilization frame <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, each cross-beam rail <b>208</b> has two flanges <b>208</b><i>a</i>, each flange <b>208</b><i>a </i>extending outwardly in an opposite direction and parallel relative to the bottom <b>200</b><i>b </i>of the stabilization frame <b>200</b>. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the flanges <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>208</b><i>a </i>together form a ledge around the periphery of each of the section A-D. The flanges <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>208</b><i>a </i>are configured such that a weighted item <b>150</b> is prevented from passing through the bottom <b>200</b><i>b </i>of the stabilization frame <b>200</b> when the item <b>150</b> is placed within the cavity <b>210</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The flanges <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>208</b><i>a </i>are also configured support and hold the weighted item <b>150</b> within the respective section A-D.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the bottom <b>200</b><i>b </i>and sides <b>200</b><i>s </i>of the stabilization frame <b>200</b> may comprise one or more panels <b>212</b> to enclose the cavity <b>210</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the bottom <b>200</b><i>b </i>comprises a panel <b>212</b> within each section A-D to create a closed bottom <b>200</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;. A closed bottom <b>200</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; may provide additional support when holding heavier weighted items <b>150</b> within the cavity <b>210</b>. Adding weighted items <b>150</b> to the interior cavity <b>210</b> of the stabilization frame <b>200</b> may help to further ballast the mount <b>100</b> on a mounting structure <b>12</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), for example, when heavier telecommunications equipment <b>14</b> is being secured to the mount <b>100</b>. The ability to add weighted items <b>150</b> to the mount <b>100</b> may also help to mitigate or eliminate the need to further secure the mount <b>100</b> to a mounting structure <b>12</b> (e.g., bolting the mount <b>100</b> to the mounting structure <b>12</b> or rooftop <b>16</b>).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, each mounting member <b>300</b> extends outwardly from, and perpendicular to, one of the sides <b>200</b><i>s </i>of the stabilization frame <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, the mount <b>100</b> may comprise two mounting members <b>300</b> (also referred to as a &#x201c;double sector&#x201d; mount <b>100</b>), each mounting member <b>300</b> extending outwardly from a different side <b>200</b><i>s </i>of the stabilization frame <b>200</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A-<b>6</b></figref>). The mounting member <b>300</b> extends outwardly from the stabilization frame <b>200</b> a sufficient distance D<sub>MM </sub>(i.e., equal to the length of the mounting member <b>300</b>) such that an end <b>300</b><i>e </i>of the mounting member <b>300</b> extends over an edge <b>12</b><i>e </i>of a mounting structure <b>12</b>, for example, a parapet wall (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). For example, in some embodiments, the mounting member <b>300</b> may extend outwardly from the side <b>200</b><i>s </i>of the stabilization frame <b>200</b> a distance D<sub>MM </sub>in the range of about 20 inches to about 40 inches. Double sector telecommunications equipment mounts <b>100</b> of the present invention (i.e., mounts <b>100</b> having two mounting members <b>300</b>) may be used, for example, at a corner <b>12</b><i>c </i>of the mounting structure <b>12</b> (e.g., the corner <b>12</b><i>c </i>of a parapet wall <b>12</b> on a rooftop <b>16</b>) (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, each of the brace members <b>400</b> may comprise a first bracket <b>402</b> and a second bracket <b>404</b>.
