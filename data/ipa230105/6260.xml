For example, the volume change due to charge and discharge causes the all-solid-state battery to be unstable in structure; and the solid electrolyte in the all-solid-state battery deteriorates because of its reaction with moisture in the air. The following techniques are known for dealing with such problems.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Literature 1 discloses a technique on an all-solid-state battery that includes an electrode laminate having a resin layer arranged on its side surface, and that leads to an improvement of the adhesiveness between the electrode laminate and the resin layer. Patent Literature 2 discloses a technique on an all-solid-state battery including a housing and an electrode stack between which a solid electrolyte is arranged for the improvement of the strength. Patent Literature 3 discloses a technique on a fully-solid battery including electrode layers and solid electrolyte layers that have greater areas than the electrode layers, and that are disposed in a manner covering these electrode layers. Patent Literature 4 discloses a technique on an all-solid-state battery including an electrode stack that is entirely covered with resin layers for the improvement of moisture resistance. Patent Literature 5 discloses a technique on a bipolar type lithium ion battery including single cells that are stacked on each other via a sticky resin layer for the suppression of slippage.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">Patent Literature 1: JP 2019-192610 A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0006">Patent Literature 2: JP 2014-235990 A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0007">Patent Literature 3: JP 2018-142534 A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0008">Patent Literature 4: WO 2014/007215 A1</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0009">Patent Literature 5: JP 2017-73374 A</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0010">A laminate housing formed by covering a metal layer with a resin layer is known as a housing of an all-solid-state battery. An all-solid-state battery is produced by sealing an electrode structure in such a housing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0011">When an all-solid-state battery is produced using a laminate housing, a conductive foreign object may be mixed in between the housing and a current collector layer or a tab part which is arranged on the outermost layer of an electrode structure. When such a conductive foreign object is present, stress may be concentrated on the conductive foreign object by outside pressure, thereby causing an inner resin layer of the laminate housing to be partially missing. Outside pressure may also cause stress to concentrate on (a) corner portion(s) of the current collector layer arranged on the outermost layer of the electrode structure, thereby causing the inner resin layer of the laminate housing to be partially missing. When the resin layer of the laminate housing is partially missing, the metal layer and the current collector layer in the housing are electrically connected to each other directly or via the conductive foreign object, thereby causing the battery to short-circuit, which is problematic. The all-solid-state battery may be stressed as described above not only after produced but also in thermocompression bonding for sealing the electrode structure in the laminate housing.
