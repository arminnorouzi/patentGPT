Technological advances in IC materials and design have produced generations of ICs where each generation has smaller and more complex circuits than the previous generation. In the course of IC evolution, functional density (i.e., the number of interconnected devices per chip area) has generally increased while geometric size (i.e., the smallest component (or line) that can be created using a fabrication process) has decreased. This scaling-down process generally provides benefits by increasing production efficiency and lowering associated costs. Such scaling-down has also increased the complexity of processing and manufacturing ICs.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A lithography exposure process forms a patterned photoresist layer for various patterning processes, such as etching or ion implantation. In a lithography exposure process, a photosensitive layer (resist) is applied to a surface of a semiconductor substrate, and an image of features defining parts of the semiconductor device is provided on the layer by exposing the layer to a pattern of high-brightness light. As semiconductor processes evolve to provide for smaller critical dimensions, and devices become smaller and increase in complexity, including the number of layers, a way of accurately patterning the features is desired in order to improve the quality, reliability, and yield of the devices.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aspects of the present disclosure are best understood from the following detailed description when read with the accompanying figures.

Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As used herein, &#x201c;around&#x201d;, &#x201c;about&#x201d;, &#x201c;approximately&#x201d;, or &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; shall generally mean within 20 percent, or within 10 percent, or within 5 percent of a given value or range. Numerical quantities given herein are approximate, meaning that the term &#x201c;around&#x201d;, &#x201c;about&#x201d;, &#x201c;approximately&#x201d;, or &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; can be inferred if not expressly stated.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The advanced lithography process, method, and materials described in the current disclosure can be used in many applications, including fin-type field effect transistors (FinFETs). For example, the fins may be patterned to produce a relatively close spacing between features, for which the above disclosure is well suited. In addition, spacers used in forming fins of FinFETs can be processed according to the above disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Lithography may use one of two types of developing processes: a positive tone development (PTD) process and a negative tone development (NTD) process. The PTD process uses a positive tone developer, which refers to a developer that selectively dissolves and removes exposed portions of the resist layer. The NTD process uses a negative tone developer, which refers to a developer that selectively dissolves and removes unexposed portions of the resist layer. The PTD process uses aqueous-based developers and aqueous-based rinse solutions. The NTD process uses organic-based developers and organic-based rinse solutions. Both PTD processes and NTD processes have drawbacks when attempting to meet lithography resolution demands for advanced technology nodes. For example, both PTD processes and NTD processes have been observed to cause resist pattern swelling, leading to insufficient contrast between exposed portions and unexposed portions of the resist layer (in other words, poor resist contrast) and resulting in deformation, collapse, and/or peeling problems.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Some embodiments of this disclosure relate to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device and more specifically to the semiconductor device including a resist layer over a substrate. Because a blowing gas process is performed after forming the resist layer, an edge of the resist layer can be flattened. As a result, the processing quality and the production yield are improved.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flow chart of a method M of manufacturing a semiconductor device (e.g., including a substrate and a resist layer thereon) in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure.

For example, when the negative tone developer such as a hydrophobic organic solvent applied to the exposed portions of the positive tone resist, the unexposed (hydrophobic) portions of the positive tone resist are dissolved by the NTD and the exposed (hydrophilic) portions of the positive tone resist remain after the developing process to form a patterned resist layer.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some other embodiments, the resist layer includes a negative tone material (sometimes called a negative tone resist). When a developer is the positive tone developer, portions of the negative tone resist exposed to radiation become insoluble (or exhibit decreased solubility) to the developer, and unexposed portions of the negative tone resist remain soluble to the developer. When a developer is a negative tone developer (NTD), portions of the negative tone resist exposed to radiation become soluble to the developer, and unexposed portions of the negative tone resist remain insoluble to the developer.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">At operation <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the substrate is rotated at an initial speed, and at operation <b>113</b>, a rotational speed of the substrate is adjusted (e.g., increased) to a main speed.

In some embodiments, the substrate support stage <b>210</b> rotates at a low speed (initial speed) at first, and then the rotational speed of the substrate support stage <b>210</b> is increased to a main speed.

For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>, the blowing gas process is performed to flatten the hump <b>317</b> of the resist layer <b>315</b> such that a flatted resist layer <b>315</b>&#x2032; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) is formed. In other words, the blowing gas process is performed to the hump <b>317</b> of the resist layer <b>315</b> to reduce a height of the hump <b>317</b>. In some embodiments, if the gas is blown before the rotational speed is adjusted (e.g., increased) to the main speed (e.g., at the initial speed), the photoresist material <b>310</b> would not be coated on the entire substrate <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the blowing gas process is performed by using the nozzle <b>230</b>&#x2032; to blow a gas onto the resist layer <b>315</b>.

For example, the substrate <b>20</b> has a center region A<b>1</b> and an edge region A<b>2</b> surrounding the center region A<b>1</b>. The outlet <b>232</b>&#x2032; of the nozzle <b>230</b>&#x2032; is directly above the edge region A<b>2</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> during the blowing gas process.

For clarity, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows an enlarged view of the substrate <b>20</b> and the resist layer <b>315</b>&#x2032;. In some embodiments, the patterned radiation <b>350</b> has a wavelength less than about 250 nm, such as DUV radiation (e.g., 248 nm radiation from a KrF laser or 193 nm radiation from an ArF laser), EUV radiation, x-ray radiation, e-beam radiation, ion-beam radiation, and/or other suitable radiation. In some embodiments, the patterned radiation <b>350</b> is EUV radiation, which may refer to radiation having a wavelength of about 1 nm to about 100 nm. In some embodiments, the EUV radiation has a wavelength of about 10 nm to about 15 nm (e.g., about 13.5 nm). The exposure process can be in air or liquid (immersion lithography), or vacuum (e.g., when implementing EUV lithography and/or e-beam lithography). In some embodiments, the radiation is patterned using a mask having an IC pattern defined therein, such that the patterned radiation forms an image of the IC pattern on the resist layer <b>315</b>&#x2032;. The mask transmits, absorbs, and/or reflects the radiation depending on the IC pattern, along with mask technologies used to fabricate the mask.

PEB can promote the cross-linking of polymer and/or suppression of reactions of other resist components with the polymer.

For example, at operation <b>190</b>, the method M can proceed with additional fabrication operations on the semiconductor device. In some embodiments, the operation <b>190</b> includes a fabrication process using the patterned resist layer as a mask to pattern the material layer on the semiconductor device. Specifically, the material layer is etched, such that the material layer includes a pattern corresponding with a pattern of the patterned resist layer. In some embodiments, doped regions are formed in the material layer, such that the material layer includes a doped pattern corresponding with a pattern of the patterned resist layer.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>. An additional fabrication process is performed on the semiconductor device using the patterned resist layer <b>310</b>&#x2032; as a mask. For example, the fabrication process is applied within opening(s) <b>316</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>) of the patterned resist layer <b>310</b>&#x2032;, while other portions of the semiconductor device covered by the patterned resist layer <b>310</b>&#x2032; are protected from being impacted by the fabrication process. In some embodiments, a pattern of the opening <b>316</b> in the resist layer <b>310</b>&#x2032; is extended into the layer to be patterned or substrate <b>20</b> to create a pattern of opening(s) <b>22</b> in the substrate <b>20</b>, thereby transferring the pattern in the resist layer <b>310</b>&#x2032; into the substrate <b>20</b>&#x2032;. The pattern is extended into the substrate <b>20</b>&#x2032; by etching, using one or more suitable etchants. The resist layer <b>310</b>&#x2032; is at least partially removed during the etching operation in some embodiments. In other embodiments, the resist layer <b>310</b>&#x2032; is removed after etching the substrate <b>20</b>&#x2032; by using a suitable photoresist stripper solvent or by a photoresist ashing operation. In some embodiments, a deposition process is performed to fill the opening(s) <b>22</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> with a material, thereby forming IC features (e.g., conductive material lines <b>380</b>) over the substrate <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>.
