In some countries, around 30% of the adult population suffer from chronic insomnia. In general, people with sleeping disorders are also more likely to have other health issues, some of which may be chronic. People with health issues (e.g., a sleep disorder and another health issue) are more likely to be involved in accidents. For some people, it is challenging to get enough oxygen when sleeping due to breathing patterns changing during the resting state. Getting insufficient oxygen during sleep can result in hypoxia and/or hypoxemia. A variety of sleep aid technologies exist to help a person get sufficient oxygen when sleeping.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Most of these sleeping aid technologies require direct engagement between an operator and a physical device. Direct engagement can add additional issues of comfort and usability layered upon those in which the operator or user wishes to initially solve. Some types of devices penetrate into a user's nostrils and are used to open up nasal passages allowing the user to breath larger amounts of air. However, it is easy for a user to inadvertently remove these type of devices during sleep due, mitigating any benefits the device might have provided.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Other types of devices either keep the mouth open (e.g., mouth guards) or keep the mouth closed (e.g., head wraps) physically altering the mechanical construct of the user's body. However, such physical alterations can cause continued and ongoing discomfort resulting in difficulty while attempting to relax and fall asleep. The instructions on these other types of devices state time is needed for one to get used to using them, which reduces the likelihood of them being an immediate solution even if they were effective.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further types of devices are strapped onto the operator user's mouth and nose to pressurize the air introduced directly into their body (e.g., a CPAP machine).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Many devices have the potential to introduce pathogens and other harmful matter into inspired aired. CPAP machines often include basic air filters. However, CPAP machines can be uncomfortable and even feel claustrophobic to some wearers. CPAP tubing can also impede movement making sleep difficult. Depending on mask configuration, a mask can create pressure sores and it is generally annoying wearing a mask while sleeping. CPAP machines also introduce a myriad of other well-known potentially harmful issues associated with general machine cleanliness and maintenance issues.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Research into relaxation and general feeling of wellbeing associated with rest has explored other mechanisms, including introducing sounds or smells into a sleeping environment. For example, white noise, soothing rhythmical sounds, and therapeutic aromas have been found to promote restful states. Sleeping environment quality, for example, air temperature, humidity level, etc., can also be controlled to reduce particle counts and unpleasant or harmful Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As such, people with health issues or that are seeking ways to have their body and mind to recover are forced to choose from a multitude of technologies and or machines when attempting to address factors which effect one's perception of wellbeing.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Aspects of the invention include devices, systems, and methods for enhancing a user's sleep.

It is to be understood that the disclosure of the invention in this specification includes all possible combinations of such particular features. For example, where a particular feature is disclosed in the context of a particular aspect or embodiment of the invention, or a particular claim, that feature can also be used, to the extent possible, in combination with and/or in the context of other particular aspects and embodiments of the invention, and in the invention generally.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Where reference is made herein to a method comprising two or more defined steps, the defined steps can be carried out in any order or simultaneously (except where the context excludes that possibility), and the method can include one or more other steps which are carried out before any of the defined steps, between two of the defined steps, or after all the defined steps (except where the context excludes that possibility).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">&#x201c;Exemplary&#x201d; is used herein to mean &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any aspect described in this document as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Throughout the drawings, like reference characters are used to designate like elements. As used herein, the term &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupling&#x201d; may indicate a connection. The connection may be a direct or an indirect connection between one or more items. Further, the term &#x201c;set&#x201d; as used herein may denote one or more of any item(s), so a &#x201c;set of items&#x201d; may indicate the presence of only one item or may indicate more items. Thus, the term &#x201c;set&#x201d; may be equivalent to &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; as used herein.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Aspects of the invention provide a quality resting and sleeping experience by improving air quality in the immediate local environment surrounding an individual when resting or sleeping. In one aspect, an air delivery system is integrated into a pillow or other soft item (e.g., matters topper, stuffed animal, etc.). The air delivery system can deliver concentrated, pressurized, and or altered gaseous flowing elements to a user that is resting on or bear the pillow or other soft item. In doing so, the air delivery system is design to give relief to those having difficulty obtaining the quality sleep needed to rest, recover, and heal from daily physical and mentally taxing activities.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Sleeping restfully is problematic to millions of individuals and typically in many cultures, a bed, mattress, or cushion, and pillows are used to support the individual during their sleep and resting state. Due to the commonality of this arrangement and the significant time a person spends attempting to sleep within a set environment, it can be appropriate to utilize these common elements to deliver a healthy and relaxing experience to facilitate one's ability to enter into and maintain a healthy sleeping habit.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Previously disclosed devices and products out on the market deliver treated air directly to an individual's nose and mouth by way of mask and harness or are passive in nature as to be inserted into the mouth or nasal openings in an attempt to keep open the individual's air passageways during sleep. Both of these types of configurations are uncomfortable and have the tendency to impede the relaxed state needed in such a way that it takes a noted amount of time to adjust to these types of devices to benefit from them. In the alternative, other delivery methods are ambiguous and generalized since they are designed to treat the entire house or room versus the individual in a customized and prescriptive manner.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Accordingly, aspects of the invention uniquely address an individual's needs by addressing the immediate proximal space within the targeted individual's environment in such a way as to customize, transform and treat the user's immediately proximal airspace as to create a superior and improved resting and sleeping experience.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">One component of the invention includes a flexible or soft supportive framing of which is resiliently collapsible in a manner as to ensure continued and proper fluidic communication and delivery within and or adjacent to the framework while remaining comfortable to the user resting on or adjacent to the flexible supportive frame. The framework itself in one embodiment allows for the fluid transfer within or in an alternative embodiment, adjacent to the frame so the flexible or resiliently collapsible nature of the frame does not impede the efficiency by restricting the fluidic flow within or adjacent to the supportive framing. Such a framework can be the supportive elements such as those composing a pillow and another alternative embodiment is a resilient framework configured to accept a supportive or pillow like structure within its framework thus adaptable to accept a range of supportive forms.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Aspects of the invention adventurously move air directly from the acceleration, pressurization and treating module through a flexible, resilient hollow profile. The resilient hollow profile forms a framing or is adjacent to the framing and by way of an outlet vent assembly proximal to the individual's mouth and nose transfers air without the outlet vent having to make direct contact with the person's mouth or nose. Furthermore, since the fluidic elements travel through an enclosed channel or supportive frame and not the structural material of the pillow, mattress and or cushion itself, allows for an easier to maintain and clean and healthier system.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In its one embodiment, the device has a fluid pressure generator which consists of a powered motor and a fan blade element which by the way of the controller, user interface, changes the motor and fan's on and off state and operational speed of the fan therefore controlling the airspeed and fluidic flow throughout the device. Air drawn into the fan is then circulated into a manifold which can have one, two or a plurality of structural flow tubes which create a semi resilient frame or structure. At the distal end of the flow tubes after the manifold, a vent or outlet is assembled to ensure a controlled directional flow when exiting the vent assembly.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an alternative embodiment, the intake prior to or post fluid pressure generator, a filter unit such as a HEPA filter is in fluid communication allowing any air moving through the filter to be cleaned of particles, optionally if a carbon material is added, VOCs can be trapped as well. Other filtering methods and materials can be added to capture and transform the original intake once passed through the filtering elements.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Continuing in an alternative embodiment, post filters, an additive stage can be configured whereas an additional element or elements can be added to the fluidly moving air such as formulated gases made to improve one's health or recovery. For example, additional oxygen known to help in recovery from heavy exercise or to reduce snoring can be added by way of a pressurized canister and an adjustable dosing cycle valve in which a controlled or prescribed amount would be added to the stream of air fluidly moving through the system. Other soothing elements such as eucalyptus oil known to provide respiratory relief can be vaporized and added as well. These are only some of the examples of additional additives others, such as vitamin supplements in a vaporized or fluidly aromatic form can be added during this stage.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In another embodiment, the dosing of additional supplemental elements can be regulated by way of the controller, the user setting, an integrated circuit with firmware, and a user input interface in which the user can select the desired settings.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In another embodiment, pressure sensors can be added to ensure the unit only operates when the person is in proximity to the outlet vents. In yet another embodiment, additional sensors can be assembled onto the device as to sense vibrations, sound, and movement to track the user's sleep state profile, store the information and or transmit it by wire or wirelessly to a device such as a phone, tablet, computer or smart watch with a program or application in which the stored information is presented and the device controls could be accessed through the application as well. The information collected would be accessible and presented in a meaningful way to the user by offering user selectable choices. Alternatively, or in unison, information could be stored, accessed, and communicated by way of the apparatus itself using visual, sound, haptic communications, and other means.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Aspects of the invention include a semi rigid and resilient framework which can be interlaced within a supportive element which constructs a pillow, mattress, cushion, or any other soft sided object including a plush object for younger people like toys, animals, and characters. The tube-like assembly has at least one outlet placed in proximity to where the individual would naturally rest their head as to facilitate proximal intake breathing from the device's vented outlet. Alternatively, another embodiment is where the semi rigid hollow assembly structure embedded within an optional padded soft frame which interfaces with most off the shelf standard pillows. Versions which interface with car and seat cushions, mattresses, and or covers, along with tent like structures hereby disclosed as well.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Aspects of in the invention can utilize cooling fluids as well as elements in gas form to create a multitude of embodiments of which have been disclosed. Other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the disclosed detailed descriptions along with the accompanying drawings. The embodiments described and illustrated herein are exemplary and are not meant to limit the scope of the invention in any way including limiting its portable nature and where the device can be utilized and what form the device takes due to its soft sided frame construction.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a top view of pillow <b>101</b>.
