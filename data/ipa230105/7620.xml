The steps shown in the flowcharts of the accompanying drawings may be executed in a computer system such as a computer system including a set of computer-executable instructions. Although logical orders are shown in the flowcharts, in some cases steps shown or described may be performed in orders different from those herein. An information processing method according to an embodiment of the present disclosure is described below from the terminal side. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flowchart of an information processing method according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the method may include the steps as follows.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Step S<b>102</b>, a terminal determines information or service that needs to be transmitted. In this embodiment, the information that needs to be transmitted by the terminal may be positioning information that needs to be transmitted in a network in a positioning scenario, or may also be vehicle information, etc. The service that needs to be transmitted by the terminal may be corresponding to a service transmission requirement, and may be a time-sensitive network (TSN for short) service, or may also be other services supported by the terminal, such as a service of ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC for short)/TSN, or may also be a service of URLLC/TSN corresponding to packet data unit (PDU for short) session control requested to be established; or may also be a requested service requiring a high-precision clock and so on.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Step S<b>104</b>, the terminal requests system information from a network device when the terminal is determining transmission of the information or the service. In this embodiment, when the terminal is determining transmission of the information or the service, the terminal may trigger to send a request to the network device, to trigger, through the request, the network device to send the system information, so that the terminal meets the requirement of the transmission of the information or the service mentioned above through the system information. The network device may include a 5G base station (gNB) and a core network.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an implementation, the system information mentioned above in this embodiment is valid system information for enabling the terminal to normally perform information transmission or service transmission, and the system information may be high-precision clock information, positioning information, vehicle to X (V2X) information, and the like. For example, when the system information is clock information, based on the requirement of TSN service transmission, when a TSN service is transmitted in the 5G network, the terminal needs to ensure time synchronization with the network device, which may be to meet the time synchronization accuracy requirement of 1 &#x3bc;s, then the network device needs to send the clock information in the system information to the terminal, and the terminal performs time synchronization with the network device according to the clock information sent by the network device, thereby meeting the requirement on time synchronization accuracy. The specific clock information may be reference clock information (referenceTimeInfo), and the clock information may also be referred to as time information.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this embodiment, through the steps S<b>102</b> and S<b>104</b> mentioned above, firstly the information or the service that needs to be transmitted is determined, and the terminal being determining transmission of the information or the service is taken as a trigger condition to trigger the network device to send the system information, which clarifies the judgment condition for the terminal to trigger the request process, and ensures that the terminal can request the system information from the network device when needed, thereby ensuring the integrity and certainty of the system information request process, which solves the technical problem of the uncertainty of the system information request process, and achieves the technical effect of ensuring the integrity and certainty of the system information request process. The above method of this embodiment will be further described below.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As an optional implementation, step S<b>104</b> the terminal requests the system information from the network device includes: if there is invalid system information when the terminal is determining the transmission of the information or the service, the terminal requests the system information from the network device. In this embodiment, the terminal may have invalid system information when determining the transmission of the information or the service, that is, there is no valid system information when the terminal is determining the transmission of the information or the service, and then the terminal is triggered to request system information from the network device. So, the above lack of valid system information, that is, there being invalid system information is the trigger condition for the terminal to request the system information from the network device. In an implementation, there being invalid system information mentioned above may include but is not limited to, not saving the required system information, such as not saving valid high-precision clock information, and may also be saved system information having expired, a serving cell having changed, a tracking area having changed, determining that there is no valid system information, or other information which may be taken as a condition for triggering the terminal to request system information from the network device, and there's no particular limitation on this here.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As an optional implementation, the system information is sent by the network device through at least one of the following information: a system information block (SIB for short), or radio resource control (RRC for short) information. The RRC information includes RRC reconfiguration information and/or downlink direct transfer information DLinformationtransfer. The system information block (SIB) may include an SIB for sending clock information, an SIB for sending positioning information, and an SIB for sending Vehicle-to-X V2X information. In this embodiment, the terminal requests the system information from the network device, and the network device can determine the way to send the system information to the terminal. In an implementation, the system information may be sent to the terminal by the network device through the system information block (SIB), that is, the network device may broadcast the system information block to the terminal, and the system information block may include an SIB for sending clock information (for example, the SIB is SIB9), may also include an SIB for sending positioning information (for example, the SIB is PosSIB), or may also include an SIB for sending vehicle to X (vehicle to X, V2X for short) information (for example, the SIB may be SIB21, SIB26). In an implementation, the system information in this embodiment may also be sent to the terminal by the network device through radio resource control (RRC) information, that is, the network device may broadcast RRC information to the terminal, and the RRC information may be RRC reconfiguration information (dedicated system information delivery dedicatedSystemInformationDelivery), and it may also be downlink direct transfer information (DLinformationtransfer).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As an optional implementation, the step S<b>104</b> that the terminal requests the system information from the network device includes: the terminal requests the system information from the network device based on indication information corresponding to the information or the service. In this embodiment, the information or the service corresponds to the indication information, and the indication information may be used to indicate the service that the terminal requests to be transmitted. For example, the indication information may be used to indicate that the service currently requested by the terminal is a service of URLLC/TSN, a PDU session requested to be established corresponds to a service of URLLC/TSN, a service requested requires a high-precision clock, or a service supported by the terminal includes a URLLC/TSN service. The terminal in this embodiment may obtain the indication information, and request system information from the network device according to the indication information.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As an optional implementation, the terminal requesting the system information from the network device based on the indication information of the information or the service includes: the terminal sends a system information demand request (which may be an on-demand SI request) to the network device based on the indication information; and the terminal obtains the system information, where the system information is sent by the network device in response to the system information demand request.
