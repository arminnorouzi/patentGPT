More specifically, this disclosure relates to a core particle that is free of talc and includes tapioca starch, potato starch, at least one anionic surfactant, and at least one amphoteric surfactant.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many personal care products are formulated to provide consumers with effective cleansing as well as additional benefits. Conventional products such as body washes, facial washes, shampoos and bar soaps provide cleansing and lather benefits consumers have come to expect. Since the development of synthetic detergents, formulators have been able to provide cleansing with desirable foam properties which consumers equate with cleansing efficiency. However, these traditional cleansing products present various challenges. Most of these products are liquid based, can be messy, difficult to dose properly and tend to leak during transport. Solid based technologies such as bar soaps and shampoo bars are perceived as harsh, messy and do not provide an excessive amount of foam. Furthermore, these conventional products are sold in large packaging and volumes, which commits the consumer to a specific fragrance or product benefit for an extended period.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Unit dose products have been accepted in the laundry and dishwashing fields because these products have advantages of being convenient, easy to dispense, and provide the opportunity to customize each wash for the benefits the consumer is seeking. Similar advantages are desired by consumers in the personal care space. For example, cosmetic articles intended to be used once to cleanse the skin or hair are well known for their practical benefits. Disposable wipes impregnated with a liquid cosmetic formulation are suitable for single use but requires disposal of the nonwoven sheet. Travel sized and single use toiletries are available but demand the use of more packaging and are not environmentally friendly. Single use bar soaps, wash cards, soap paper and other forms of single use soap exist but utilize raw materials that consumers do not want in their products such as talc, sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Consumer demand for natural beauty products has been a growing trend for years and has led to the rise of &#x201c;free from&#x201d; advertisements on the front of various products. Key attributes in demand are biodegradable and sustainable raw materials, as well as products &#x201c;free from&#x201d; sulfates, alcohol, parabens, talc and other things consumers perceive as less than beneficial. In cleansing applications, sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate have been effectively used for years. These anionic surfactants are excellent cleansing agents and foam very well. However, these materials clean so well that they can be perceived as harsh and irritating to consumers and therefore have gained a negative reputation in the marketplace. Formulating to meet all these desired demands is technically difficult and limits the choice of raw materials available to the formulator.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are some products on the market that are environmentally friendly and consumer friendly, but still have additional drawbacks. Loose anhydrous powder, such as that disclosed in WO 2019/001940, does not solve the problems of single use, customization, or remaining free from talc. Foaming cleansing powders on the market are also loose powders, which are messy and difficult for consumers to dose. Still other products crumble during shipping thereby forming a coarse and gritty texture that is not commercially desirable. Moreover, these types of compositions use propylene glycol and not water thus reducing commercial desire among consumers and also tend to have a rough hand feel because of the use of rice starch.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there remains an opportunity for improvement. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the present disclosure will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description of the disclosure and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and this background of the disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This disclosure provides an encapsulated cleansing composition that is free of talc and that includes a core particle including (1) tapioca starch, (2) potato starch, (3) at least one anionic surfactant, and (4) at least one amphoteric surfactant. The encapsulated cleaning composition also includes a coating that is disposed about at least a portion of the core particle and that includes a polysaccharide.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This composition is surprisingly advantageous as it readily disintegrates and provides flash foam which can be then used to cleanse the skin and hair. The cleansing composition is also gentle, mild and moisturizing to the skin. Moreover, the composition is free from talc. Talc is used in powder formulations to contribute slip and a silky skin feel. In the instant composition, the combination of potato and tapioca starches surprisingly provides the desired skin feel without the need for talc.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of

to limit the encapsulated cleaning composition. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented in the preceding background or the following detailed description.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Embodiments of the present disclosure are generally directed to encapsulated cleaning composition and methods for fabricating the same. For the sake of brevity, conventional techniques related to cleaning compositions may not be described in detail herein. Moreover, the various tasks and process steps described herein may be incorporated into a more comprehensive procedure or process having additional steps or functionality not described in detail herein. In particular, various steps in the manufacture of cleaning compositions are well-known and so, in the interest of brevity, many conventional steps will only be mentioned briefly herein or will be omitted entirely without providing the well-known process details.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Encapsulated Cleaning Composition:</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">This disclosure provides an encapsulated cleansing composition that is free of talc and that includes a core particle including (1) tapioca starch, (2) potato starch, (3) at least one anionic surfactant, and (4) at least one amphoteric surfactant. The encapsulated cleaning composition also includes a coating disposed about at least a portion of the core particle and includes a polysaccharide. Each is described in greater detail below. It is contemplated that when describing individual components of the encapsulated cleaning composition such as the (1) tapioca starch, (2) potato starch, (3) at least one anionic surfactant, and (4) at least one amphoteric surfactant, any of the weight percents described below may be based on a weight of the encapsulated cleaning composition as a whole or on a weight of the core particle as a whole (not including the weight of the coating). Similarly, when any component (not including the coating) is described as being part of, or included in, the encapsulated cleaning composition, those of skill in the art will recognize that this may also mean that the component is part of the core particle itself.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The cleansing compositions disclosed are useful in cleansing the skin, body, and/or hair, while remaining gentle and moisturizing. The combination of potato and tapioca starch with the polysaccharide coating can provide a pressed powder with sufficient strength and rigidity to withstand packaging and shipping, but the product is soft enough to crush in the consumer's hand and instantly transform into foam with water. The formulation is mild and gentle, moisturizing, naturally based and environmentally friendly.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, this disclosure provides the encapsulated cleaning composition (<b>20</b>) (hereinafter referred to as an &#x201c;encapsulated composition&#x201d;). The encapsulated composition (<b>20</b>) includes a core particle (<b>22</b>), as also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>. The core particle (<b>22</b>) is typically a solid but may be gel-like. Alternatively, the core particle (<b>22</b>) may have both solid portions and gel-like portions. In one embodiment, the core particle (<b>22</b>) is a tablet, as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>. In other embodiment, the core particle (<b>22</b>) is a capsule or caplet, as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref>. In another embodiments, not shown in the Figures, the core particle is a cube as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>. In still other embodiments, the core particle (<b>22</b>) is selected from the group of briquettes, pills, pellets, bricks, sachets, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the core particle (<b>22</b>) has a coin shape or a compressed cylindrical shape. In one embodiment, the core particle (<b>22</b>) is further defined as a &#x201c;massive body&#x201d; which, as is known in the art, refers to a solid shape (typically a porous solid shape) that includes a mixture of particulates. The particulates may be particulates of the (1) tapioca starch, (2) potato starch, (3) at least one anionic surfactant, and (4) at least one amphoteric surfactant described below. The core particle may be described as a plurality of particles of crushed powder. For example, the (1) tapioca starch, (2) potato starch, (3) at least one anionic surfactant, and (4) at least one amphoteric surfactant may be combined to form a shape (shaped body), e.g. in a mold. The shaped body may then be coated with a coating (<b>24</b>), which may also be referred to as an encapsulant or protective layer, as described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The core particle (<b>22</b>) is not limited in shape, size, or mass. In various embodiments, the core particle (<b>22</b>) has a weight of from about 0.01 to about 20, about 0.05 to about 20, about 0.1 to about 20, about 0.5 to about 20, about 1 to about 19.5, about 1.5 to about 19, about 2 to about 18.5, about 2.5 to about 18, about 3 to about 17.5, about 3.5 to about 17, about 4 to about 16.5, about 4.5 to about 16, about 5 to about 15.5, about 5.5 to about 15, about 6 to about 14.5, about 6.5 to about 14, about 7 to about 13.5, about 7.5 to about 13, about 8 to about 12.5, about 8.5 to about 12, about 9 to about 11.5, about 9.5 to about 11, about 10 to about 10.5, about 2.5 to about 13, about 0.5 to about 5, or about 5 to about 20, grams. It is contemplated that the entire encapsulated cleaning composition may also have a weight as described above or even up to about 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30, grams. However, it is also contemplated that smaller or larger core particles can be used. In various non-limiting embodiments, it is contemplated that all values and ranges of values, both whole and fractional, between and including the aforementioned values, can be utilized herein.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, the core particle (<b>22</b>) is in the form of granules. The core particle (<b>22</b>) can be small fractionated objects formed from solid particles aggregated together, of variable shapes and sizes. They may be regular or irregular in shape. They may in particular have a spherical shape, a square shape, a rectangular shape, or an elongated shape such as rods. In particular, the core particle (<b>22</b>) can be in the form of small fractionated objects, which can have varied shapes, generally a regular shape and typically a spherical shape or well-calibrated (uniform) spherical shape. In one embodiment, spherical particles are quite particularly preferred.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The (average) size of the particles is not particularly limited and can be from about 1 to about 5000 &#x3bc;m, from about 50 to about 5000 &#x3bc;m, from about 100 to about 3500 &#x3bc;m, or from about 200 to about 3000 &#x3bc;m. In other embodiments, the particles have an (average) size of about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . . . 10 . . . 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500 . . . up to about 5000, &#x3bc;m. The size of the particles can be determined by manual sieving or via a mechanical calibrator, and also by laser particle size analysis, using for example the Malvern Mastersizer 3000. In various non-limiting embodiments, it is contemplated that all values and ranges of values, both whole and fractional, between and including the aforementioned values, can be utilized herein.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Starch can be used in pressed powder tablets because it is compressible, inert, fee flowing, cost effective and exhibits good disintegration properties. Water can be incorporated into dry powder starches to bind the starches together through interactions such as hydrogen bonding. The addition of water encourages stronger interaction between the starch hydroxyl groups which helps give strength and hardness to the final pressed powders.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The instant encapsulated composition and/or core particle may include water or may be free of water. In various embodiments, the water is present in an amount of from about 1 to about 30, about 5 to about 25, about 10 to about 20, about 10 to about 15, about 15 to about 20, weight percent based on a total weight of the core particle and/or encapsulated composition. In various non-limiting embodiments, it is contemplated that all values and ranges of values, both whole and fractional, between and including the aforementioned values, can be utilized herein.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Free of Talc:</heading><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The encapsulated composition and/or core particle is typically free of talc. In various embodiments, the encapsulated composition includes less than 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.5, or 0.1, weight percent of talc based on a total weight of the core particle and/or encapsulated cleaning composition. In other embodiments, the encapsulated composition is completely free of talc. In various non-limiting embodiments, it is contemplated that all values and ranges of values, both whole and fractional, between and including the aforementioned values, can be utilized herein.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Starch:</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As first introduced above, the encapsulated composition and/or core particle includes (1) tapioca starch, (2) potato starch, (3) at least one anionic surfactant, and (4) at least one amphoteric surfactant. The (1) tapioca starch and the (2) potato starch are used to achieve desired benefits as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b> and <b>24</b></figref>. Natural starch is comprised of amylose which is linear and amylopectin which is branched. Starches from different sources contain different proportions of these components which contribute to different properties. Additionally, the source of the starch, e.g. potato or tapioca leads to different starches having different particle shapes and sizes. These properties of various starches influence the end results of formulating with these raw materials. For example, tapioca starch typically cannot be used alone because it becomes too compact and cannot be broken apart easily.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Corn starch has irregular polyhedron shaped granules having a diameter of from about 5 to about 20 &#x3bc;m, while rice starch also has irregular polygon shaped particles having a size of about 3 to about 8 &#x3bc;m, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>. The smaller sized particles and irregular shapes provide a rougher perception to the final product instead of a soft, powdery crumble.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The encapsulated composition and/or core particle is typically free of corn and/or rice starch and/or any other non-potato or non-tapioca starch. In various embodiments, the encapsulated composition and/or core particle includes less than 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.5, or 0.1, weight percent of corn and/or rice starch and/or any other non-potato or non-tapioca starch based on a total weight of the core particle and/or encapsulated cleaning composition. In other embodiments, the encapsulated composition and/or core particle is completely free of corn and/or rice starch and/or any other non-potato or non-tapioca starch. In various non-limiting embodiments, it is contemplated that all values and ranges of values, both whole and fractional, between and including the aforementioned values, can be utilized herein.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this disclosure, (2) potato starch and (1) tapioca starch are used in combination to provide strength to the encapsulated composition as a pressed powder, as well as a gentle crumble and soft feel. Potato starch has one of the largest particle sizes of native starches averaging from about 18 to about 60 &#x3bc;m. The larger particles are spherical and smooth in shape, giving a very silky skin feel due to the ball bearing effect. Tapioca starch has irregular round spheres with smaller particle sizes of from about 5 to about 25 &#x3bc;m. The combination of the large and smaller particles allows for close packing and interaction during compression. This provides the strength to a pressed powder to hold up during packaging, shipping and consumer use.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Various combinations of (1) tapioca starch and (2) potato starch are set forth in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>20</b></figref> which visually show various physical properties.
