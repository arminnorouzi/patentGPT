Among rare earth sintered magnets, Nd-based sintered magnets, referred to as Nd magnets, hereinafter, have a high remanence (designated Br, hereinafter). They are used, for example, in drive motors in hybrid cars and electric vehicles, motors in electric power steering systems, motors in air conditioner compressors, and voice coil motors (VCM) in hard disk drives. While Nd magnets having high Br are used in motors for various applications, Nd magnets having higher values of Br are desired for manufacturing motors of smaller size.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">On the other hand, rare earth sintered magnets reduce their coercivity (designated H<sub>cJ</sub>, hereinafter) at high temperature, with irreversible thermal demagnetization taking place. For this reason, the rare earth sintered magnets intended for use in motors mounted on various vehicles, especially electric vehicles are required to have higher values of H<sub>cJ</sub>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Prior art means for enhancing the Br of Nd magnets are divided into an approach from the composition aspect and an approach from the manufacturing aspect. The known approach from the composition aspect includes the method of reducing the content of R to increase the proportion of R<sub>2</sub>T<sub>14</sub>X phase in Nd magnet and the method of reducing the amount of additive elements which form a solid solution with R<sub>2</sub>T<sub>14</sub>X phase to reduce Br.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, it is known that as the content of R or other additive elements is reduced, the H<sub>cJ </sub>of rare earth sintered magnets relating to heat resistance is lowered. Particularly when the content of R is reduced, there are risks like a loss of sintering ability and abnormal grain growth in the sintering step of Nd magnet where densification occurs with the accompanying creation of liquid phase. Thus, for the purpose of obtaining Nd magnets having better properties, it is important to achieve a high Br while suppressing a drop of H<sub>cJ </sub>due to the reduced content of R or other additive elements. Although it is generally known to add heavy rare earth elements such as Dy and Tb in order to suppress a drop of H<sub>cJ </sub>or to increase H<sub>cJ</sub>, this approach is not always regarded preferable because heavy rare earth elements such as Dy and Tb are rare resources and expensive and the addition of such elements can invite a drop of Br.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The known approach from the manufacturing aspect includes a method of increasing the amount of a lubricant (e.g., saturated fatty acids and esters thereof) which is added to a powder prior to shaping for improving the degree of orientation of R<sub>2</sub>T<sub>14</sub>X phase, and a method of adjusting manufacture conditions, typically increasing the magnetic field applied upon shaping.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, it is recognized that when the amount of a lubricant which is added to a powder prior to shaping is increased, the resulting Nd magnet often experiences a noticeable drop of H<sub>cJ </sub>because of the presence of much C originating from the lubricant although an increased Br is available owing to the improved degree of orientation. Also, for the purpose of increasing the magnetic field applied upon shaping for the orientation of R<sub>2</sub>T<sub>14</sub>X phase, an electromagnet for creating a magnetic field must be of larger size, which requires enlargement of an associated installation and contraction of a magnetic field space, failing to gain industrial efficiency.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Meanwhile, one known means for enhancing the H<sub>cJ </sub>of Nd magnets is size reduction of crystal grains. This mainly intends to reduce the particle size of fine powder during fine pulverization of the starting alloy prior to shaping, thereby obtaining crystal grains of small size at the end of sintering. It is known that in a certain range of particle size, H<sub>cJ </sub>increases in linear proportion to a size reduction.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">When a magnet material is finely pulverized below a certain level, a lowering of the pulverizing capability during fine pulverization and the concentration of impurities (mainly oxygen and nitrogen) in the finely pulverized material becomes high as a result of an increase of reactivity of finely pulverized material. As a result, the H<sub>cJ </sub>of Nd magnet lowers, or even when an increase of H<sub>cJ </sub>is observed, the grain boundary diffusion technique (to be described later) is difficult to apply. For ameliorating these problems, Patent Document 1 discloses to change the jet gas during fine pulverization to an inert gas such as He or Ar.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The other method of enhancing the H<sub>cJ </sub>of Nd magnets is known from Patent Documents 2 and 3 which relate to a method of letting a heavy rare earth element (e.g., Dy or Tb) selectively collect at grain boundary phase in the Nd magnet (referred to as grain boundary diffusion technique, hereinafter). This method involves the steps of depositing a compound of heavy rare earth element such as Dy or Tb onto the magnet surface as by coating, and effecting heat treatment at high temperature. For main phase grains in the Nd magnet, a structure having a high concentration of Dy or Tb is formed only in a region of a main phase grain in close vicinity to the grain boundary. A high H<sub>cJ </sub>enhancement effect is achieved while restraining a drop of Br.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Patent Document 1: WO 2014/142137</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Patent Document 2: WO 2006/044348</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Patent Document 3: WO 2013/100010</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The method of Patent Document 1 and the grain boundary diffusion technique of Patent Documents 1 and 2, however, have the following problems.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Patent Document 1 proposes the method of changing the jet gas for fine pulverization to inert gas such as He or Ar, which is difficult to comply with industrial production when a cost difference from nitrogen gas is taken into account. Also, the grain boundary diffusion technique is quite effective for achieving a high coercivity, but suffers from the problem that the H<sub>cJ </sub>enhancement effect is substantially lost when the content of additive elements or extraneous R in the Nd magnet is reduced for enhancing the Br of Nd magnet or when the amount of impurity elements (e.g., carbon, oxygen and nitrogen) increases as a result of increasing the amount of lubricant to promote orientation. Since the extent of H<sub>cJ </sub>enhancement effect is limited, it is necessary to increase the coercivity H<sub>cJ </sub>of the magnet-forming material itself prior to the grain boundary diffusion when the magnet is used in the application of electric vehicles and the like where high heat resistance is required.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">An object of the invention, which has been made under the above-mentioned circumstances, is to provide a rare earth sintered magnet meeting both high Br and high H<sub>cJ </sub>by taking an approach different from the fine pulverization during manufacture and grain boundary diffusion as proposed in the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Making extensive investigations to attain the above object with a focus on the impurity amount, average crystal grain size, and degree of orientation of a rare earth sintered magnet, the inventors have found that a rare earth sintered magnet having excellent magnetic properties including both high Br and high H<sub>cJ </sub>is obtained when the contents of O, N and C which are generally regarded as impurities in rare earth sintered magnets are reduced, the average crystal grain size of the magnet is controlled to or below 4.0 &#x3bc;m, and the degree of orientation meets a specific relationship to the average crystal grain size.

If the average crystal grain size exceeds 4 &#x3bc;m, it may be difficult to obtain a high H<sub>cJ</sub>, failing to attain the object of the invention. The average crystal grain size may be measured, for example, by the following procedure. First, a cross section of a sintered magnet is polished to mirror finish. The magnet is immersed in an etchant, for example, Vilella reagent (mixture of glycerol, nitric acid and hydrochloric acid in a ratio of 3:1:2) to selectively etch the grain boundary phase. The etched cross section is observed under a laser microscope. An image analysis is made on the image observed, and the cross-sectional area of individual grains is measured, from which the diameter of equivalent circle is computed. An average grain size is computed based on the data of the area fraction of each grain size.

Though not well understood, the reason is presumed as follows. In general, the reduction of crystal grain size is achieved by reducing the size of fine particles prior to shaping and sintering. As the fine powder particle size becomes smaller, the surface area of fine powder becomes larger. Then, the frictional resistance among fine particles increases to disturb orientation of fine particles during shaping in a magnetic field. In the inventors' experiment regarding a quantity of such change, for a fine powder corresponding to an average crystal grain size of up to 4 &#x3bc;m, a detrimental change of 0.26% is recorded relative to a decrement of 1 &#x3bc;m in crystal grain size. It is known that a high value of Br is not achievable from a fine powder having a low degree of orientation whereas a sharp drop of H<sub>cJ </sub>occurs in case of too high a degree of orientation. Examining these phenomena comprehensively, the inventors have discovered that high values of Br and H<sub>cJ </sub>are consistently available when the degree of orientation meets the relationship (1).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0039">From the aspect of taking advantage of the potential of the material to acquire high values of Br, the degree of orientation Or (%) is preferably at least 96%, more preferably at least 97%. The magnet should preferably meet the relationship (1) as well as a degree of orientation in the preferred range and an average crystal grain size of up to 4 &#x3bc;m.

With respect to the content of these incidental impurities, up to 0.10% by weight of total incidental impurities based on the total of the constitutional elements and incidental impurities is permissible although the content of incidental impurities is preferably as low as possible.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0043">Next, the method of preparing the rare earth sintered magnet according to the invention is described.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0044">The method of preparing the rare earth sintered magnet involves steps which are basically similar to the steps used in the conventional powder metallurgy method and not particularly limited. Generally, the method involves the steps of melting raw materials to form a starting alloy having a predetermined composition, pulverizing the starting alloy into an alloy fine powder, compression shaping the alloy fine powder under a magnetic field into a compact, and heat treating the compact into a sintered magnet.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0045">First, in the melting step, metals or alloys as raw materials for necessary elements are weighed so as to meet the predetermined composition. After weighing, the raw materials are melted, for example, by high-frequency induction heating. The melt is cooled to form a starting alloy. For casting of the starting alloy, the melt casting technique of casting in a flat mold or book mold or the strip casting technique is generally employed. Also applicable herein is a so-called two-alloy technique involving separately furnishing an alloy approximate to the R<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>14</sub>B compound composition that constitutes the main phase and an R-rich alloy serving as liquid phase aid at the sintering temperature, crushing, then weighing and mixing them. Since the alloy approximate to the main phase composition tends to allow &#x3b1;-Fe phase to crystallize depending on the cooling rate during casting and the alloy composition, the alloy is preferably subjected to homogenizing treatment in vacuum or Ar atmosphere at 700 to 1,200&#xb0; C. for at least 1 hour, if desired, for the purpose of homogenizing the structure to eliminate the &#x3b1;-Fe phase. When the alloy approximate to the main phase composition is prepared by the strip casting technique, the homogenizing treatment may be omitted. To the R-rich alloy serving as liquid phase aid, not only the casting technique mentioned above, but also the so-called melt quenching technique are applicable.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0046">The pulverizing step is a multi-stage step including, for example, coarse pulverizing and fine pulverizing steps. In the coarse pulverizing step, for example, a jaw crusher, Brown mill or pin mill, or hydrogen decrepitation may be used. In the practice of the invention, hydrogen decrepitation is preferably employed for the purpose of reducing 0, N and C contents to acquire improved magnetic properties though not critical. Particularly when the alloy has been formed by strip casting, hydrogen decrepitation is preferably applied. Typically, a coarse powder which has been coarsely pulverized to a size of 0.05 to 3 mm, especially 0.05 to 1.5 mm is obtained.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0047">In the fine pulverizing step, a technique of pulverizing the coarse powder, for example, on a jet mill using a non-oxidative gas stream such as N<sub>2</sub>, He or Ar may be employed. In the fine pulverizing step, the coarse powder is preferably pulverized to a size of 0.2 to 15 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 0.5 to 10 &#x3bc;m. Since impurities O and N in the rare earth sintered magnet are mainly introduced in the fine pulverizing step, the jet mill atmosphere must be controlled for the O and N contents in the magnet can be adjusted. The O content in the rare earth sintered magnet is adjusted by controlling the O content and the dew point of the jet mill atmosphere. Preferably the pulverization atmosphere is controlled to an oxygen concentration of up to 1 ppm and a dew point of &#x2212;60&#xb0; C. or lower.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0048">Also, the N content in the rare earth sintered magnet may be adjusted, for example, by (A) a technique of finely pulverizing on a jet mill with He or Ar gas jet, (B) a technique of finely pulverizing on a jet mill with N<sub>2 </sub>gas jet while introducing hydrogen, or (C) a technique of finely pulverizing hydrogen-containing coarse powder on a jet mill with N<sub>2 </sub>gas jet. When technique (B) of introducing hydrogen gas or technique (C) of using hydrogen-containing coarse powder is used, hydrogen preferentially adsorbs to the active surface created by pulverizing action to prevent adsorption of nitrogen, for thereby reducing the N content in the rare earth sintered magnet.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0049">In either one or both of the steps of coarsely and finely pulverizing the starting alloy, a lubricant such as a saturated fatty acid or ester thereof may be added for enhancing the orientation or alignment of particles during the subsequent step of shaping the powder in a magnetic field. In the lubricant adding step, there arises the ambivalent problem that increasing the amount of the lubricant added is generally effective for promoting orientation, but carbon originating from the lubricant forms more R&#x2014;CON phase in the rare earth sintered magnet to bring about a considerable drop of H<sub>cJ</sub>. When the fine powder resulting from technique (C) of finely pulverizing hydrogen-containing coarse powder is used herein, the amount of the lubricant added to the fine powder is preferably increased for promoting orientation. In the method of preparing the rare earth sintered magnet from such fine powder, since internal hydrogen is released during heat treatment, the hydrogen acts to decompose the lubricant (having chemically adsorbed to fine particle surfaces) through carbonyl reductive reaction or the like, and hydrogen gas-induced cracking reaction forces further decomposition and dissociation to highly volatile lower alcohols. Consequently, the C content remaining in the rare earth sintered magnet is reduced.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0050">In the shaping step, the alloy powder is compression shaped into a compact by a compression shaping machine while applying a magnetic field of 400 to 1,600 kA/m for orienting or aligning powder particles in the direction of axis of easy magnetization. The compact preferably has a density of 2.8 to 4.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The compact preferably has a density of at least 2.8 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>from the aspect of establishing a compact strength for easy handling. For further increasing the strength of the compact as shaped, a binder such as PVA or fatty acid may be added to the powder. Also, the compact preferably has a density of up to 4.2 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>from the aspects of establishing a sufficient compact strength and preventing any disordering of particle orientation during compression to acquire an appropriate Br. The shaping step is preferably performed in an inert gas atmosphere such as nitrogen or Ar gas to prevent the alloy fine powder from oxidation.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0051">The heat treatment step is to sinter the compact resulting from the shaping step in a non-oxidative atmosphere such as Ar gas or in high vacuum. In the inventive method using the hydrogen-containing coarse powder resulting from technique (C), the compact is preferably held at 200 to 600&#xb0; C. for 5 minutes to 10 hours in a non-oxidative atmosphere or low vacuum atmosphere to prevent the occurrence of cracks due to a temperature drop and temperature difference in the compact associated with the release (endothermic reaction) of hydrogen gas in the compact, before the compact is fired. Most often, the sintering step is preferably carried out by holding at a temperature of 950&#xb0; C. to 1,200&#xb0; C. for 0.5 to 10 hours. Subsequently, the sintered body may be heat treated at a temperature lower than the sintering temperature for the purpose of enhancing H<sub>cJ</sub>. This heat treatment after sintering may be heat treatment in two stages including high-temperature heat treatment and low-temperature heat treatment or a single low-temperature heat treatment. The high-temperature heat treatment is preferably to heat treat the sintered body at a temperature of 600 to 950&#xb0; C. The low-temperature heat treatment is preferably to heat treat the sintered body at a temperature of 400 to 600&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0052">In this way, a rare earth sintered magnet within the scope of the invention is obtained. For the rare earth sintered magnet, the average crystal grain size can be easily measured, for example, through observation under a laser microscope as mentioned above. Specifically, the average grain size is determined by grinding and mirror finishing the magnet, etching the surface with an etchant such as Nital solution or Vilella reagent, taking a reflection electron image of the etched surface, and performing image analysis. Also, the degree of orientation can be measured by the electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis as mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0053">In a further embodiment, the rare earth sintered magnet thus obtained is subjected to grain boundary diffusion treatment, specifically ground to a desired shape, covered with a diffusion source, and further heat treated in the state that the diffusion source is present on the magnet surface. The diffusion source is one or more members selected from oxides of R<sup>1</sup>, fluorides of R<sup>2</sup>, oxyfluorides of R<sup>3</sup>, hydroxides of R<sup>4</sup>, carbonates of R<sup>5</sup>, basic carbonates of R<sup>6</sup>, single metal or alloys of R<sup>7 </sup>wherein each of R<sup>1 </sup>to R<sup>7 </sup>is at least one element selected from rare earth elements. The means of securing the diffusion source to the magnet surface may be a dip coating technique of dipping the sintered magnet in a slurry of the powdered diffusion source to coat the magnet with the slurry and drying, a screen printing technique, or a dry coating technique such as sputtering or pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The temperature of grain boundary diffusion treatment is lower than the sintering temperature and preferably at least 700&#xb0; C. From the aspect of obtaining the sintered magnet having improved structure and magnetic properties, the treatment time is preferably 5 minutes to 80 hours, more preferably 10 minutes to 50 hours, though not particularly limited. The grain boundary diffusion treatment causes R<sup>1 </sup>to R<sup>7 </sup>to diffuse from the coating to the magnet for thereby achieving a further increase of H<sub>cJ</sub>. Although the rare earth element to be introduced by the grain boundary diffusion treatment is designated R<sup>1 </sup>to R<sup>7 </sup>for the sake of description, any of R<sup>1 </sup>to R<sup>7 </sup>is included in the R component in the rare earth sintered magnet at the end of grain boundary diffusion treatment. The diffusion source containing R<sup>1 </sup>to R<sup>7 </sup>is preferably a metal, compound or intermetallic compound containing HR which is at least one element selected from Dy, Tb and Ho because these elements are more effective for increasing H<sub>cJ</sub>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0054">Although the invention requires only that the rare earth sintered magnet meet the element composition and relationship (1), it is preferred that the magnet further meet relationship (2) or (3). Although it is unnecessary that the magnet contains R introduced by grain boundary diffusion as the R element, it is preferred that the magnet also contain R introduced by grain boundary diffusion because higher values of H<sub>cJ </sub>are available and the object of meeting both high Br and high H<sub>cJ </sub>is more effectively attained. In this regard, it is known that since R<sup>1 </sup>to R<sup>7 </sup>are introduced by grain boundary diffusion, the resulting magnet has a characteristic distribution of R concentration. Specifically, it is known that the concentration (RE) of R element on the magnet surface having the diffusion source deposited thereon and the concentration (RC) of R element at the center of the magnet meet the relationship: RE&#x3e;RC.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0072" num="0055">Examples and Comparative Examples are given below for further illustrating the invention, but the invention is not limited thereto.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Examples 1 to 3</heading><p id="p-0073" num="0056">By furnishing Nd metal, Pr metal, Dy metal, ferroboron alloy, electrolytic Co, Al metal, Cu metal, Ga metal, Si metal, zirconium metal, and electrolytic iron (all metals are of purity 99%), weighing and mixing them in a predetermined ratio, melting them, and casting by the strip casting method, there was obtained a starting alloy in flake form having a thickness of 0.2 to 0.4 mm. The flake form starting alloy was pulverized by hydrogen decrepitation in a pressurized hydrogen atmosphere into coarse pulverized powder.

By coating the slurry and drying, a coating of terbium oxide was formed on the surface of the Nd magnet block. The Nd magnet block having the coating was subjected to high-temperature heat treatment including heating in vacuum at 950&#xb0; C. for 5 hours and cooling down to 200&#xb0; C. at a cooling rate of 20&#xb0; C./min, for grain boundary diffusion of terbium.

which met the contents of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon and the conditions of relationship (1) displayed high values of Br and H<sub>cJ</sub>, and H<sub>cJ </sub>after grain boundary diffusion. By contrast, the magnet of Comparative Example 1 which had higher contents of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon displayed a low value of H<sub>cJ </sub>after sintering, and the H<sub>cJ </sub>enhancement effect by grain boundary diffusion treatment was small, failing to acquire a satisfactory coercivity H<sub>cJ</sub>. The magnet of Comparative Example 2, in which relationship (1) was not met and the amount of lubricant added was small, displayed insufficient orientation and failed to acquire satisfactory Br. The magnet of Comparative Example 3 had a larger crystal grain size and displayed a low value of H<sub>cJ </sub>prior to grain boundary diffusion treatment, indicating an inferior value of H<sub>cJ </sub>to Examples 1 to 3 despite a noticeable H<sub>cJ </sub>enhancement effect by grain boundary diffusion treatment.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0063">It has been demonstrated that the rare earth sintered magnets of Examples 1 to 3 within the scope of the invention show values of H<sub>cJ </sub>after grain boundary diffusion in excess of 27 kOe, and are fully useful in the application requiring high heat resistance, typically electric vehicles. Also, values of Br in excess of 13.7 kG are obtained, indicating possible size reduction of motors or the like.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
