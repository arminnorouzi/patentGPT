The compositions provide temporary straightening properties to the hair. The disclosure also relates to methods of using the compositions to style the hair.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Consumers with curly or wavy hair often desire to temporarily straighten their hair for a change in appearance. In addition, reducing the curls of very curly hair may increase the manageability and ease of styling of such hair.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Traditional hair-straightening products generally include heavy galenics or oils, which may leave an undesirable greasy or oily feeling. Products that provide hold, such as styling gels, can also give straightening effects, but these products typically flake on the hair. In addition, many hair straightening products involve heat or chemical treatments that may cause damage to the hair fibers and/or irritate the scalp.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As such, consumers desire new and improved compositions that can provide straightening effects to curly or wavy hair, and at the same time impart various additional advantageous properties to the hair such as softness, smoothness, shine, and/or frizz control.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It has now surprisingly been found that compositions comprising a particular combination of components as described herein are able to temporarily straighten curly or wavy hair without the use of heat or harsh chemicals, while at the same time delivering additional advantageous sensorial benefits to the hair.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure relates to compositions for styling hair, such as curly or wavy hair.

In certain embodiments, compositions according to the disclosure comprise at least two humectants.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Non-limiting humectant compounds that can be chosen include, for example, polyhydric alcohols, such as C2-C8 or C3-C6 polyhydric alcohols. By way of example, glycerol (glycerin), propylene glycol, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol, hexylene glycol, dipropylene glycols, diethylene glycol, and diglycerol may be chosen.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Additional non-limiting examples of humectants that can be chosen include hyaluronic acid, sugars such as sorbitol or xylitol, or beta-fructans, for example inulin. Mixtures of two or more humectants can also be chosen.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The humectants can be present in the composition in a total amount ranging from about 0.1% to about 10%, such as from about 0.5% to about 8%, or about 1% to about 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, including all ranges and subranges thereof.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Fatty Acids</heading><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Optionally, the compositions may comprise at least one fatty acid. For example, useful fatty acids include straight or branched chain fatty acids, which may be saturated or unsaturated. The fatty acids may, in some embodiments, have from 8 to 30 carbons, such as, for example, from 8 to 25, from 8 to 22, from 8 to 20, from 8 to 18, or from 8 to 16 carbons. In some cases, the fatty acid has from 12 to 30, from 12 to 25, from 12 to 22, from 12 to 20, or from 12 to 18 carbons. In further cases, the fatty acids may comprise C8-C22 or C14-C22 fatty groups, which may be saturated or unsaturated linear alkyl chains. The fatty acids may optionally have fatty groups chosen from stearate, isostearate, linoleate, oleate, behenate, arachidonate, palmitate, myristate, laurate, caprate, isostearyl, stearyl, linoleyl, oleyl, behenyl, myristyl, lauryl, or capryl chains, or mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Non-limiting examples of fatty acids include diacids, triacids, and other multiple acids, as well as salts of these fatty acids. For example, the fatty acid may optionally include or be chosen from lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, behenic acid, archidonic acid, oleic acid, isostearic acid, sebacic acid, ricinoleic acid, 12-hydroxy stearic acid, or mixtures thereof. The fatty acids may, in some embodiments, be selected from the group consisting of palmitic acid, myristic acid, stearic acid, or mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">If present, the at least one fatty acid may be present in the composition in an amount ranging from about 0.01% to about 5% by weight, such as about 0.05% to about 4%, about 0.1% to about 3%, or about 0.5% to about 2% by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition. By way of non-limiting example, the at least one fatty acid is present in the composition with a total amount ranging from about 0.01% to about 5%, about 0.01% to about 4%, about 0.01% to about 3%, about 0.01% to about 2%, about 0.01% to about 1%, about 0.05% to about 5%, about 0.05% to about 4%, about 0.05% to about 3%, about 0.05% to about 2%, about 0.05% to about 1%, about 0.1% to about 5%, about 0.1% to about 4%, about 0.1% to about 3%, about 0.1% to about 2%, about 0.1% to about 1%, about 0.5% to about 5%, about 0.5% to about 4%, about 0.5% to about 3%, about 0.5% to about 2%, or about 0.5% to about 1% by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition, including all ranges and subranges thereof.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Additional Components</heading><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Compositions according to the disclosure may optionally comprise any additional or auxiliary component suitable for use in such compositions. Such components may include, but are not limited to, conditioning agents, moisturizing agents, fillers, structuring agents, shine agents, antioxidants (e.g. tetradibutyl pentaerithrityl hydroxyhydrocinnamate, butylated hydroxyanisole, and/or butylated hydroxytoluene), penetrants, sequestrants, fragrances, buffers (e.g. citric acid and/or sodium citrate), dispersants, plant extracts, preserving agents (preservatives), opacifiers, sunscreen agents, pH adjusting agents, vitamins (e.g. tocopherol, ascorbic acid, and/or ascorbyl glucoside), and antistatic agents.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Optional additional or auxiliary components may be present in an amount ranging up to about 15%, such as from about 0.01% to about 15%, about 0.1% to about 10%, or about 0.1% to about 5% by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In various embodiments, the compositions may have a pH less than or equal to about 7, such as from about 3 to about 6.8, from about 3.5 to about 6.5, from about 4 to about 6.5, from about 4.5 to about 6.5, from about 5 to about 6.5 or from about 5.5 to about 6.5. In other embodiments, the compositions may have a pH less than or equal to about 6, such as from about 3 to about 6, from about 3 to about 5, or from about 3 to about 4.5. In some embodiments, the pH of the compositions may be substantially unchanged (e.g. may have a change in pH of less than 20%, less than 15%, or less than 10%) when stored under ambient conditions for 4 weeks or more, such as 8 weeks.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Compositions according to the disclosure are typically in the form of a liquid, for example a liquid that is suitable for application as a spray-on composition, or may be a sprayable gel. The composition may be an aerosol, in which case a propellant may be used, or may be in non-aerosol form, such as a pump-type spray.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">II. Methods</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The present disclosure also relates to methods for styling hair, for example by temporarily straightening curly or wavy hair by application of the compositions described herein to the hair. The methods generally comprise applying any of the compositions according to the disclosure to the hair.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The compositions may be useful in a variety of settings, either for chemically treated or untreated hair, and/or for natural or unnatural curls. The degree of curliness or curl type of the hair may vary and is not limited. For example, the curls of hair been treated by the compositions disclosed herein may range from slightly wavy to very kinky and coily hair, and may have different textures and colors.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition to temporarily straightening the hair, the compositions are surprisingly capable of providing a variety of desirable sensory benefits, for example, moisture, smoothness, softness, shine, and/or anti-frizz properties, to the hair. As such, the compositions are useful in styling (which includes straightening) hair while also caring for hair, conditioning hair, and/or imparting one or more above-described sensory benefits to the hair.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Typically, methods according to the disclosure may include applying an effective amount of a composition disclosed herein to hair having waves or curls, when the hair is dry, wet, damp, or moist. The hair may be either natural or synthetic hair. As used herein, the term &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount sufficient to provide a desired straightening effect to the hair, taking into account the degree of curliness, the length, the volume, and the texture of the hair, and/or an amount sufficient to provide a desired sensory benefit to the hair. In general, from about 0.5 grams to about 50 grams of product is applied to the hair, depending on the specific product formulation, hair length, hair volume, and hair style type. The composition applied to the hair may, for example, be distributed evenly by combing through with fingers or a means such as a comb or the like. The composition may then be dried, for example air-dried or dried with a hair dryer. Heat may optionally be used during drying, but is not required. The composition may be allowed to remain on the hair as a leave-in product for any period of time as needed, for example, a few hours or a few days, or until the next washing or rinsing of the hair. Alternatively, the compositions may be rinsed from the hair after a brief leave-in period, from about a few seconds (e.g. 5, 10, 20, 30, or 60 seconds) to about 10, 20, or 30 minutes, or longer.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, before applying the composition to the hair, the hair may be first cleansed with a commercially available shampoo, and/or rinsed with water, and/or dried, either partially or completely. The composition may then be applied to the washed and/or rinsed hair when the hair is wet, damp, moist, or dry. In some other embodiments, before applying the composition to dry hair, the hair can optionally be moistened, damped, or wetted by water spray or using a wet towel, or by applying other treatment compositions that make the hair moist, damp, or wet.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">It has surprisingly and unexpectedly been discovered that methods according to the disclosure generally do not require the use of a reducing agent, including a base, or heating the hair in order to achieve a temporary straightening effect. As such, in some embodiments, the method does not include using a reducing agent or a base, and/or does not including heating the hair.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In various embodiments, the methods of treating hair with the compositions according to the disclosure impart the benefits described above to the hair, without a greasy feel or flaking, relative to hair not having been treated with a composition according to the disclosure. The benefits imparted to the hair may remain a desired length of time, such as a few hours, a few days, or until the hair is rinsed or washed.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The compositions described herein are not mascara compositions, i.e. are not intended to be applied to eyelashes and/or eyebrows. The compositions are likewise not makeup compositions, i.e. are not intended to be applied to skin, in particular, to skin on the face, body, or lips. Thus, treatment of, or application to, the hair is intended to be limited to hair on the head, i.e. the scalp of the head, and not eyelashes, eyebrows, body or facial hair, or the like. In such embodiments, a skilled person understands that &#x201c;hair on the head&#x201d; means hair that grows from the scalp of the head, and excludes eyebrows, eyelashes, facial hair, etc.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Having described the many embodiments of the present invention in detail, it will be apparent that modifications and variations are possible without departing from the scope of the disclosure defined in the appended claims. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that all examples in the present disclosure, while illustrating many embodiments of the disclosure, are provided as non-limiting examples and are, therefore, not to be taken as limiting the various aspects so illustrated. It is to be understood that all definitions herein are provided for the present disclosure only.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;having,&#x201d; and &#x201c;including&#x201d; (or &#x201c;comprise,&#x201d; &#x201c;have,&#x201d; and &#x201c;include&#x201d;) are used in their open, non-limiting sense. The phrase &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; limits the scope of a claim to the specified materials or steps and those that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics of the compositions.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In this application, the use of the singular includes the plural unless specifically stated otherwise. The singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; &#x201c;the,&#x201d; and &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; are understood to encompass the plural as well as the singular unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, and these expressions, as well as the expression &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; which means &#x201c;at least one,&#x201d; are expressly intended to include the individual components as well as mixtures/combinations thereof. Likewise, the term &#x201c;a salt thereof&#x201d; also relates to &#x201c;salts thereof.&#x201d; Thus, where the disclosure refers to &#x201c;an element selected from the group consisting of A, B, C, D, E, F, a salt thereof, or mixtures thereof,&#x201d; it indicates that that one or more of A, B, C, D, or F may be included, one or more of a salt of A, a salt of B, a salt of C, a salt of D, a salt of E, or a salt of F may be included, or a mixture of any two of A, B, C, D, E, F, a salt of A, a salt of B, a salt of C, a salt of D, a salt of E, and a salt of F may be included. However, it is to be understood that such language also includes embodiments where G, H, I, etc., are present, as long as at least one of A, B, C, D, E, F, or a salt thereof, is also present.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; should be understood to include both the conjunctive and the disjunctive. For example, &#x201c;A and/or B&#x201d; means &#x201c;A and B&#x201d; as well as &#x201c;A or B,&#x201d; and expressly covers instances of either, without reference to the other. For example, a composition that comprises &#x201c;at least one humectant and/or at least one fatty acid&#x201d; means that the disclosure includes compositions comprising one or more humectants or one or more fatty acids, as well as compositions comprising one or more humectants and one or more fatty acids. As a further example, disclosure of &#x201c;methods of styling the hair, straightening the hair, and/or reducing frizz of the hair&#x201d; includes methods of styling the hair or methods of straightening the hair or methods of reducing frizz of the hair, as well as methods of styling the hair and straightening the hair, methods of styling the hair and reducing frizz of the hair, methods of styling the hair and straightening the hair and reducing frizz of the hair, etc.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">As used herein, the phrases &#x201c;and mixtures thereof,&#x201d; &#x201c;and a mixture thereof,&#x201d; &#x201c;and combinations thereof,&#x201d; &#x201c;and a combination thereof,&#x201d; &#x201c;or mixtures thereof,&#x201d; &#x201c;or a mixture thereof,&#x201d; &#x201c;or combinations thereof,&#x201d; &#x201c;or a combination thereof,&#x201d; and variations thereof are used interchangeably to denote that the listing of components immediately preceding the phrase, such as &#x201c;A, B, C, D, or mixtures thereof&#x201d; signify that the component(s) may be chosen from A, from B, from C, from D, from A+B, from A+B+C, from A+D, from A+C+D, etc., without limitation on the variations thereof. Thus, the components may be used individually or in any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">For purposes of the present disclosure, it should be noted that to provide a more concise description, some of the quantitative expressions given herein are not qualified with the term &#x201c;about.&#x201d; It is understood that whether the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; is used explicitly or not, every quantity given herein is meant to refer to the actual given value, and it is also meant to refer to the approximation to such given value that would reasonably be inferred based on the ordinary skill in the art, including approximations due to the experimental and/or measurement conditions for such given value. All ranges and amounts given herein are intended to include sub-ranges and amounts using any disclosed point as an end point. Thus, a range of &#x201c;1% to 10%, such as 2% to 8%, such as 3% to 5%,&#x201d; is intended to encompass ranges of &#x201c;1% to 8%,&#x201d; &#x201c;1% to 5%,&#x201d; &#x201c;2% to 10%,&#x201d; and so on. All numbers, amounts, ranges, etc., are intended to be modified by the term &#x201c;about,&#x201d; whether or not so expressly stated. Similarly, a range given of &#x201c;about 1% to 10%&#x201d; is intended to have the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; modifying both the 1% and the 10% endpoints. The term &#x201c;about&#x201d; is used herein to indicate a difference of up to +/&#x2212;10% from the stated number, such as +/&#x2212;9%, +/&#x2212;8%, +/&#x2212;7%, +/&#x2212;6%, +/&#x2212;5%, +/&#x2212;4%, +/&#x2212;3%, +/&#x2212;2%, or +/&#x2212;1%. Likewise, all endpoints of ranges are understood to be individually disclosed, such that, for example, a range of 1:2 to 2:1 is understood to disclose a ratio of both 1:2 and 2:1.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Further, unless expressly stated otherwise or when the context of the disclosure clearly dictates otherwise, the language &#x201c;the at least one X may be present in an amount ranging from Y % to Z %&#x201d; is to be understood to mean that the total amount of X's present in the composition ranges from Y % to Z %, inclusive of the endpoints. For example, &#x201c;the at least one polyphenol may be present in an amount ranging from about 0.01% to about 10%&#x201d; means that the total amount of polyphenols present ranges from about 0.01% to about 10%, inclusive of both 0.01% and 10%.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">&#x201c;Active material&#x201d; as used herein with respect to the percent amount of an ingredient or raw material, refers to 100% activity of the ingredient or raw material.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">All amounts given herein are relative to the amount of active material, unless otherwise indicated.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Unless otherwise indicated, all percentages herein are by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">All percentages, parts and ratios herein are based upon the total weight of the compositions of the present disclosure, unless otherwise indicated.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">As used herein, the term &#x201c;treat&#x201d; (and its grammatical variations, such as &#x201c;treating&#x201d;) refers to the application of the compositions of the present disclosure onto the surface of hair on the head.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;applying a composition onto hair,&#x201d; and variations thereof is intended to mean contacting the hair with at least one of the compositions of the disclosure, in any manner.
