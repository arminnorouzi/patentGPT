Therefore, the electric wheel <b>120</b> is accommodated in the accommodation groove portion <b>111</b> when the electric cart <b>100</b> is loaded into the cart storage apparatus <b>200</b>.

A large installation space needs to be ensured at the lower end portion <b>220</b> of the body portion when the electric wheel <b>120</b> is configured to perform the vertical motion. Furthermore, when the electric wheel <b>120</b> performs the vertical motion, the movement of the electric wheel <b>120</b> may be restricted as the electric wheel <b>120</b> is caught by the cart storage apparatus <b>200</b> when the electric cart <b>100</b> is moved and loaded into the cart storage apparatus <b>200</b>. Therefore, the electric wheel <b>120</b> is configured to perform the rotational motion, which allows the electric cart <b>100</b> to smoothly enter the cart storage apparatus <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Since the accommodation groove portion <b>111</b> is formed in the body portion <b>110</b> and the electric wheel <b>120</b> is rotatably provided in the accommodation groove portion <b>111</b>, the electric wheel <b>120</b> may be accommodated in or withdrawn from the accommodation groove portion <b>111</b>.

Therefore, the electric cart <b>100</b> may smoothly enter the storage space of the cart storage apparatus <b>200</b>. Furthermore, when the electric cart <b>100</b> is unloaded from the cart storage apparatus <b>200</b>, the electric wheel <b>120</b> is rotated to be withdrawn from the accommodation groove portion <b>111</b> and brought into contact with the ground surface. Therefore, the body portion <b>110</b> may be moved to the specific position by the operation of the electric wheel <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the instant case, a fixing means <b>112</b> for selectively fixing the rotation position of the electric wheel <b>120</b> may be provided in the body portion <b>110</b>. The fixing means <b>112</b> may be provided on the body portion <b>110</b> and connected to a rotation shaft of the electric wheel <b>120</b>, selectively fixing the position of the electric wheel <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, the electric wheel <b>120</b> may be configured as a drive wheel which is rotated by the motor and the rotation shaft rotatably provided at the lower end portion of the body portion <b>110</b>. In the instant case, the rotation shaft may be configured to receive an elastic force through a spring and rotate in a direction toward the ground surface. Furthermore, the fixing means <b>112</b> may include a fixing pin configured to extend or retracted in a solenoid manner and fix the rotation shaft at a specific position thereof. A structure for changing a rotation position of the electric wheel <b>120</b> and a structure for fixing a position of the electric wheel <b>120</b> using the fixing means <b>112</b> may be variously implemented as long as these structures achieve the same purpose.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Meanwhile, a sensor unit <b>113</b> may be disposed on the body portion <b>110</b> and detect whether the electric cart <b>100</b> is moved and loaded into the cart storage apparatus <b>200</b> or unloaded from the cart storage apparatus <b>200</b>. The sensor unit <b>113</b> is provided at the lower end portion of the body portion <b>110</b> and detects whether the body portion <b>110</b> is loaded into or unloaded from the cart storage apparatus <b>200</b>.

The fixing means <b>112</b> releases the electric wheel <b>120</b> so that the electric wheel <b>120</b> may be accommodated in the accommodation groove portion <b>111</b>. Furthermore, when the electric cart <b>100</b> is moved and unloaded from the cart storage apparatus <b>200</b>, the sensor unit <b>113</b> detects the unloading of the electric cart <b>100</b> and transmits a signal to the fixing means <b>112</b>. The fixing means <b>112</b> releases the electric wheel <b>120</b> so that the electric wheel <b>120</b> accommodated in the accommodation groove portion <b>111</b> is withdrawn from the accommodation groove portion <b>111</b> and supported on the ground surface. In the instant case, the signal detected by the sensor unit <b>113</b> may be transmitted to the controller <b>300</b>, and then the controller <b>300</b> may input an instruction to the fixing means <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Meanwhile, a roller unit <b>250</b> is provided on the cart storage apparatus <b>200</b>.
