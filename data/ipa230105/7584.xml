The latest standard IEEE (Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers) 802.11ax does attempt to address it with the Target Wake Time feature, but this still requires IEEE 802.11ax standards-based implementation on the IoT device.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, IoT devices are generally low power consuming and are generally very low cost and are based on early standards of the 802.11. In addition to this, we also need to effectively make use of the resources in access point such that critical devices in the network are given the highest priority.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Under Power Save mode, many mechanisms that are described in the IEEE 802.11 standard allow a wireless device to reduce its power consumption, to turn off its radios and to wake up at the correct time to retrieve its traffic. While access points are generally connected to an external power source, the wireless clients are often running on batteries. The purpose of power saving features is to increase the battery life and to allow longer performance. This battery life extension can be significant for low-powered devices such as smartphones, Voice over IP phones or handheld barcodes scanners.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Problematically, while power save mode is highly beneficial for wireless clients, this would impact the access points as it must retain frames long enough for mobile stations to pick them up, but buffer memory is a finite resource. Mobile stations depend on access points to buffer traffic for at least the listen interval specified with the association. Some clients, such as low power clients, can have a longer listen interval that may require more packet buffer space on the access point. Large numbers of clients with long listen intervals may overwhelm the limited buffer space in access point.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, non-low power clients may be unduly limited in data exchange opportunities with long listen intervals.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In deployments which have a mix of low bandwidth sensors or pocket devices with considerably lower battery life and laptops with a better battery life, there is a need to prioritize and extend the battery life of the former. There are two parameters that play a key role in extending the battery life of the devices that operate in power save mode, the listen interval and the DTIM period. The Listen Interval field is used to indicate to the access point how often a device in power save mode wakes to listen to Beacon management frames. It is expressed in units of beacon interval. Access point may use the Listen Interval information in determining the lifetime of frames that it buffers for a device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, what is needed is a robust technique for AI-based data delivery prioritization for mixed station types.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These shortcomings are addressed by the present disclosure of methods, computer program products, and systems for automatically configuring link aggregation of incompatible data ports.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, a device prioritization model is generated with machine learning to categorize stations by device-type for multicast grouping, including a category for a low power device multicast group. Each of the plurality of stations connected to the access point can be profiled to determine device type, and an associated listen interval for each of the plurality of stations based on the device prioritization model based on DTIM periods of the plurality of stations. One implementation further prioritizes packets for a specific station by application.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, delivery of multicast packets is prioritized from the enterprise network destined for a low power device multicast group on the Wi-Fi network and to prioritize delivery of unicast packets for low power device multicast group. A DTIM message is generated as a beacon indicating which of the plurality of stations have messages buffered at the access point awaiting delivery. One implementation uses group keys for each multicast group or station group.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In still another embodiment, the messages are transmitted to the stations over the Wi-Fi network according to the assigned listen interval.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Advantageously, battery life is conserved in IoT devices without data loss.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the following drawings, like reference numbers are used to refer to like elements.

One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize many additional variations made possible by the succinct description of techniques below.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">I. Systems for AI-Based Data Delivery Prioritization for Mixed Station Types (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>)</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a high-level illustration of a system <b>100</b> for AI-based data delivery prioritization for mixed station types, according to an embodiment. The system <b>100</b> includes an access point <b>110</b>, station groups <b>120</b>A-C and a Wi-Fi controller <b>130</b>. Station group <b>120</b>A contains low-power devices or critical devices, station group <b>120</b>C contains powered devices that or minor devices, and station group <b>120</b>B contains unknown or mid-power devices or major devices. IOT devices in station group <b>120</b>A, as critical devices, can be given more listen intervals to receive data. Many other embodiments are possible, for example, more or fewer access points, more or fewer stations, and additional components, such as firewalls, routers and switches. The system <b>100</b> components can be located locally on a LAN or include remote cloud-based devices, and can be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination similar to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The components of the system <b>100</b> are coupled in communication over a network <b>199</b>. Preferably, the access point <b>110</b> and the controller <b>130</b> are connected to the data communication system via hard wire. Other components, such as the station groups <b>120</b>A-C are connected indirectly via wireless connection. The network <b>199</b> can be a data communication network such as the Internet, a WAN, a LAN, WLAN, a cellular network (e.g., 3G, 4G, 5G or 6G), or a hybrid of different types of networks. Various data protocols can dictate format for the data packets.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The access point <b>110</b>, in an embodiment, stores incoming packets and prioritizes delivery based on the techniques described herein. Then at each listen interval, a DTIM (Delivery traffic indication map or message) is transmitted. A DTIM is a kind of TIM which informs the clients about the presence of buffered multicast/broadcast data on the access point. It is generated within the periodic beacon at a frequency specified by the DTIM interval which is configurable per SSID. This means all the devices connected to the given SSID operate with the same DTIM period. Lower DTIM period can impact the battery life of low-end devices (e.g., station group <b>120</b>A) as they need to wake up more often to receive the frames. On the other higher DTIM period can impact resources in the access point that may in turn impact new client associations (e.g., station group <b>120</b>C).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one example, station group <b>120</b>A maps to critical classified (IoT) devices from electrical/chemical/gas segment can have highest retention period of up to 3 listen intervals as these devices require to have low failure rate and critical in nature. Station group <b>120</b>B maps to major classified (IoT) devices from moisture/temperature segment can have retention period of up to 2 listen intervals as these devices are not so critical in operation. Finally, station group <b>120</b>C maps to minor classified devices like laptops/mobiles can have retention period of up to 1 listen interval as these devices can have application-level retransmissions.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another embodiment, applications of a specific device are prioritized or reordered. VoIP and network service can be critical applications in this context.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In other operations, the access point <b>130</b> provides for Wi-Fi stations access to the network <b>199</b>. The access point <b>130</b> is assigned an SSID broadcast in beacons for stations to potentially join. The station <b>140</b> may decide between several available SSIDS. To select a particular SSID, the station <b>140</b> sends a probe request packet using the SSID and a response is sent back from the access point <b>130</b> as part of the association process. A configuration of newly joined stations could include an onboarding process that implements the techniques discussed herein. Details of the access point <b>110</b> are discussed below in association with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a more detailed illustration of the gateway device <b>110</b> of the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The access point <b>110</b> includes a packet processing queue <b>210</b>, a data prioritization module <b>220</b>, a station management module <b>230</b>, and a network communication module <b>240</b>. The modules can be implemented in source code stored in non-transitory memory executed by a processor. Alternatively, the modules can be implemented in hardware with microcode. The modules can be singular or representative of functionality spread over multiple components.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The data prioritization module <b>220</b>, in an embodiment, further comprises a model generation module <b>310</b>, a device profiling module <b>320</b>, and a device prioritizing module <b>330</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The model generation module <b>310</b> generates a device prioritization model with machine learning to categorize stations by device-type for multicast grouping, including a category for a low power device multicast group. A database or batch of past historical data is provided for the statistical modeling of device type prioritization. The historical data can identify device types by profile according to the three stations groups of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, or by four or more stations groups in other examples.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The device profiling module <b>320</b> profiles each of the multiple stations connected to the access point to determine device type. The device profiling module <b>320</b> then determines a listen interval for each of the plurality of stations based on the device prioritization model based on DTIM periods of the plurality of stations. An operating system can include a database of hardware devices or a cloud-based database can be accessed.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The packet prioritizing module <b>330</b> to prioritize delivery of multicast packets from the enterprise network destined for a low power device multicast group on the Wi-Fi network and to prioritize delivery of unicast packets for low power device multicast group.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The beacon generation module <b>340</b> generates a DTIM message as a beacon indicating which of the plurality of stations have messages buffered at the access point awaiting delivery. Low-power devices wake up at synchronized listening intervals in order to receive the DTIM. If a message awaits, the station can wake up. If no message awaits, the station can remain sleep, saving power. In other cases, the station continues to sleep even though a message awaits. In one example, if at least one listening interval remains before the queued data expires, retrieval by the low-power device can be delayed by an additional listening interval.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The packet transmission module <b>350</b> transmits the messages to the stations over the Wi-Fi network according to the assigned listen interval.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">II. Methods for Data Delivery Prioritization for Mixed Station Types (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref>)</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a high-level flow diagram illustrating a method for AI-based data delivery prioritization for mixed station types, according to one embodiment. The method <b>400</b> can be implemented, for example, by the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The steps are merely representative groupings of functionality, as there can be more or fewer steps, and the steps can be performed in different orders. Many other variations of the method <b>400</b> are possible.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">At step <b>410</b>, a device prioritization model is generated with machine learning to categorize stations by device-type for multicast grouping, including a category for a low power device multicast group. Many different categories are possible depending on the specific implementation.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">At step <b>420</b>, the messages are prioritized by station type. At step <b>430</b>, the messages for a specific station are further prioritized by application.
