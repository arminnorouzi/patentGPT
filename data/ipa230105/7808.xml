The present invention also relates to a corresponding electronic device comprising such a heat management arrangement.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Even though applicable in general to any electronic device, the present invention and its underlying problem will be hereinafter described in connection with a handheld electronic device having a surface impinged with heat from a heat generating element, such as for example a processor.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In electronic devices and especially in handheld electronic devices having a surface impinged with heat from a heat generating element, cooling of said surface is usually realised by either a passive air cooling system without a fan, or an active air cooling system with a fan.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A passive air cooling system usually comprises a heat sink with high heat conductivity and a large surface, often a ribbed surface, for passive heat transfer by convection to an environmental atmosphere, such as ambient air.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An active air cooling system usually comprises a fan enforcing the convective heat transport via an air stream to an environmental atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other active cooling systems employ a liquid coolant and a floating heat sink with fluid channels. However, this requires a lot more components compared to air cooling systems, such as an additional heat exchanger in order to cool down the liquid coolant to an operation temperature. Thus, liquid cooling systems are usually too heavy and bulky for handheld electronic devices. Furthermore, liquid cooling implies the risk of leakage, which may destroy an electronic device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the above, an object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved heat management system for electronic devices.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with the present invention, a heat management arrangement for an electronic device as recited in claim <b>1</b> and a method of manufacturing a heat management arrangement on an electronic device as recited in claim <b>11</b> are provided. Furthermore, an electronic device as recited in claim <b>18</b> is provided. Advantageous or preferred features of the invention are recited in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one aspect, therefore, the present invention provides a heat management arrangement for an electronic device, in particular for a handheld electronic device. The heat management arrangement comprises an active cooling means comprising a heat sink and at least one airflow channel configured for convective heat transport to an environment by an airflow. Furthermore, the heat management arrangement comprises a passive cooling means configured to be arranged between the heatsink and a surface of the electronic device and comprising a highly heat conductive substance. The passive cooling means is configured to contact the surface of the electronic device and to enhance heat conduction between the surface of the electronic device and the heat sink. In addition, or alternatively, the passive cooling means is configured to enhance heat conduction between the surface of the electronic device and the airflow channel.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this way, the invention provides a heat management arrangement which is configured for attachment to a surface impinged with heat from a heat generating element of the electronic device and combines directly active and passive cooling measures which interact in a synergetic way. In particular, the passive cooling means enhances the effectiveness of the active cooling means, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Active cooling is thereby realized by active convection using an airflow through the airflow channel, in particular a forced airflow, e.g. accelerated by a fan. Since the at least one airflow channel and/or at least one corresponding chimney are created in or on the heatsink, the heatsink interacts with both, the airflow of the active cooling means and the highly heat conductive substance of the passive cooling means. The passive cooling is realized by passive convection and/or heat conduction through to a surface for example of an outer housing of the electronic device. Heat transfer to the heatsink and the airflow is enhanced by the highly heat conductive substance. In this way, a thermally highly conductive attachment of the actively cooled heatsink to the outer housing is provided.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">On the other hand, the airflow increases a temperature difference between an inner and an outer side of the passive cooling means, such that the heat flow through the highly heat conductive substance is increased.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, the airflow channel is formed as a groove in a surface of the heatsink. In this way, the airflow channel can be easily provided by attaching the heatsink to another surface, especially a surface of the passive cooling means.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment, the highly heat conductive substance is a thermal pad. In particular, the thermal pad may be configured soft and conformable. In this way, an effective thermal interface is provided between the heat sink and the surface of the electronic device and surface irregularities can be compensated without increasing thermal resistance. Alternatively or in addition, the highly heat conductive substance may comprise a thermal paste.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment, a metal sheet is arranged between the highly heat conductive substance and the surface of the electronic device. For example, the metal sheet can be a copper sheet. This embodiment is particularly advantageous if the highly heat conductive substance is configured as a thermal pad or paste. Accordingly, the metal sheet forms a thermally conductive but mechanically stable barrier, which keeps the thermal pad or paste in shape and/or in place and thus for example prevents the thermal pad or paste to be pressed inside the at least one airflow channel. In this way, a sectional area of the airflow channel is kept constant along the channel and flow resistance is minimized.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment, a plurality of airflow channels is provided in the surface of the heatsink. In this way, the convection-active surface of the heatsink is increased and a flow rate of air through the heatsink can be increased.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment, the airflow channels are arranged in parallel to each other, at least in a contact area of the passive cooling means. This leads to a more uniform temperature profile in direction transverse to the airflow channels parallel to the surface of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment, the active cooling means comprises a chimney fluidically coupled with the airflow channel. For example, the chimney can be configured as a vertical channel section inside the heat sink or as an external chimney coupled to the heat sink. By means of a chimney, the flow rate of an airflow through the airflow channel can be increased by natural convection, which in turn increases the cooling capability of the arrangement.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment, the active cooling means comprises a first end and a second end and is configured to establish a thermal gradient between the first end and the second end to create a natural airflow through the at least one airflow channel. The natural airflow is driven by natural convection and can be increased by means of a chimney. In this way, an active fan or pump of the active cooling means is supported by naturally generated airflow.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment, the active cooling means comprises an active air flow acceleration element configured to create a forced airflow through the at least one airflow channel. In this way, a predetermined cooling rate is ensured by convection with the forced airflow.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment, the at least one airflow channel is oriented in a direction perpendicular to a direction of heat conduction through the passive cooling means. In this way, heat is dissipated from the passive cooling means in the most direct way and effectiveness of the cooling arrangement is increased.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to another aspect, the invention provides a method of manufacturing a heat management arrangement on an electronic device, comprising the steps of: Arranging a passive cooling means comprising a highly heat conductive substance on a surface of the electronic device such that the passive cooling means is in contact with the surface of the electronic device;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Arranging an active cooling means comprising a heat sink on the surface of the electronic device such that the passive cooling means is arranged between the heatsink and the surface of the electronic device, wherein the active cooling means comprises at least one airflow channel configured for convective heat transport from the heatsink to an environment by an airflow; and</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thermally coupling the passive cooling means and the active cooling means to allow enhanced heat conduction between the surface of the electronic device and the heat sink and/or the airflow channel.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Accordingly, the invention also provides a method of manufacturing a heat management arrangement on a surface of the electronic device, which in use is impinged with heat from a heat generating element of the electronic device. The arrangement can be easily manufactured by attaching a passive cooling means on the surface and arranging an active cooling means thereon in a thermally coupled manner. In this way, active and passive cooling measures can be easily combined, which interact in a synergetic way. By means of the thermal coupling, the passive cooling means enhances the effectiveness of the active cooling means, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an embodiment, the active cooling means is arranged such that the at least one airflow channel is oriented in a direction substantially parallel to the surface of the electronic device. For example, the airflow channel is formed as a groove in a surface of the heatsink, which is parallel to the surface of the electronic device. This allows a heat transport through the passive cooling means in a direction substantially perpendicular to an airflow direction through the airflow channel, which provides for a most effective heat dissipation.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an embodiment, the airflow channel is formed as a groove in a surface of the heatsink, wherein the active cooling means is arranged such that the surface of the heatsink is oriented towards the surface of the electronic device. In this way, the groove is closed by a surface of the passive cooling means, particularly the highly conductive material, such that an airflow through the airflow channel can dissipate heat from the highly conductive material by convection.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an embodiment, the method further comprises a step of arranging a metal sheet between the highly heat conductive substance and the surface of the electronic device. For example, the metal sheet can be a copper sheet. Arranging the metal sheet in between is particularly advantageous if the highly heat conductive substance is configured deformable, for example as a thermal pad or paste. Accordingly, the metal sheet forms a thermally conductive barrier which keeps the thermal pad or paste in place and thus, for example, prevents the thermal pad or paste to be pressed inside the airflow channel. In this way, a sectional area of the airflow channel is kept constant along the channel and flow resistance is minimized.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an embodiment, the highly heat conductive substance is a thermal pad, which is arranged directly on the surface of the electronic device. In particular, the thermal pad may be configured soft and conformable. In this way, an effective thermal interface is created between the heat sink and the surface of the electronic device. Any surface irregularities can be compensated by the thermal pad without increasing thermal resistance. Alternatively or in addition, the highly heat conductive substance may comprise a thermal paste.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embodiment, the active cooling means comprises an active air flow acceleration element and the method comprises a step of arranging the active air flow acceleration element fluidically coupled to the at least one airflow channel, such that a forced airflow through the at least one airflow channel can be created. In this way, a predetermined cooling rate is ensured by convection with the forced airflow.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment, the active cooling means is arranged such that the at least one airflow channel is oriented in a direction substantially perpendicular to a direction of heat conduction through the passive cooling means. In this way, heat is dissipated from the passive cooling means in the most direct way and effectiveness of the cooling arrangement is increased.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to a further aspect, the present invention provides an electronic device. The electronic device comprises a surface impinged with heat from a heat generating element. The electronic device further comprises a heat management arrangement comprising an active cooling means with a heat sink and at least one airflow channel configured for convective heat transport from the heatsink to an environment by an airflow, and a passive cooling means arranged between the heatsink and a surface of the electronic device and comprising a highly heat conductive substance. The passive cooling means is in contact with the surface of the electronic device and configured for enhanced heat conduction between the surface and the heat sink and/or the airflow channel.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As discussed above, the invention is configured for improved heat dissipation, which is realized by combining directly active and passive cooling measures which interact in a synergetic way by thermal coupling. In particular, the passive cooling means enhances the effectiveness of the active cooling means, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Active cooling is thereby realized by active convection using an airflow through the airflow channel, in particular a forced airflow, e.g. accelerated by a fan. Since the at least one airflow channel is created on the heatsink, the heatsink interacts with both, the airflow of the active cooling means and the highly heat conductive substance of the passive cooling means. The passive cooling is realized by internal heat transport from the heat generating element to the surface, e. g. by passive convection and/or heat conduction through to an outer housing of the electronic device which may comprise the surface of the electronic device. The heat transfer from the surface to the heatsink and the airflow is enhanced by the passive heat transport through the highly heat conductive substance. In this way, a thermally highly conductive attachment of the actively cooled heatsink to the outer housing is provided.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The highly heat conductive substance may comprise a thermal pad or paste, as described with regard to the heat management arrangement.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The heat generating element is in particular part of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an embodiment, the at least one airflow channel is oriented in a direction substantially parallel to the surface of the electronic device.

Furthermore, the method comprises the step of thermally coupling the passive cooling means and the active cooling means to allow enhanced heat conduction between the surface of the electronic device and at least one of the heat sink and the airflow channel.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Accordingly, the passive cooling means <b>5</b> is in contact with the surface <b>6</b> of the electronic device <b>10</b> and configured for enhanced heat conduction between the surface <b>6</b> and the heat sink <b>3</b> and/or the airflow channel <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The heat generating element may be for example a CPU (central processing unit), GPU (graphics processing unit) or any other electronic component that in use generates considerable heat.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Heat generated by the heat generating element <b>11</b> is transported inside the electronic device to the surface <b>6</b> by at least one heat transport mechanism <b>15</b> symbolised by waved lines, which comprises at least one of conduction, convection and radiation.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The passive cooling means is in contact with the surface <b>6</b>, such that the heat is transported from the surface <b>6</b> through the passive cooling means by heat conduction <b>16</b>, symbolized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> by arrows.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The passive cooling means <b>5</b> conducts the heat to the heat sink <b>3</b> and the airflow channel <b>4</b>.

In this way, it is configured to establish a thermal gradient between the first end <b>12</b> and the second end <b>13</b>.
