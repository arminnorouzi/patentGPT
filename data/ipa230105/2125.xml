Some embodiments may provide a closure that is resistant to opening by including two or more separate motions or user inputs to open, for example.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, for instance, a package may be provided that includes a container defining a product storage region. The package may have a closure having a base and a lid. The base may be coupled to the container and the lid movable relative to the base between a closed position and an open position. There may be a locking protrusion on the base that extends in a radial direction from the base. There may be a collar coupled to the lid and having a side wall that is movable between a locked position, in which it prevents the lid from opening, and an unlocked position in which it allows the lid to open. A collar base bead may extend in a radial direction from the collar side wall. The locking protrusion on the base and the collar base bead may be in vertical alignment to prevent opening of the lid when the lid is in the closed position and the collar is in the locked position. The collar may be configured to be moved from the locked position to the unlocked position by a first user input, with the collar base bead out of vertical alignment with the locking protrusion to allow opening of the lid. The lid may be movable from the closed position to the open position by a second user input.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another aspect, for instance, a closure and collar for a container may be provided.

If included, container <b>10</b> may include a side wall <b>11</b>, a floor <b>12</b>, and/or a shoulder <b>13</b>, any or all of which may substantially define a product storage region in container <b>10</b>. Package <b>5</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in an exemplary locked position and an exemplary closed position with closure <b>20</b> attached, coupled, and/or fastened to container <b>10</b> to substantially block, prevent, and/or inhibit access of a user to the product storage region and/or contents of package <b>5</b>. For example, closure <b>20</b> may snap on or screw on to container <b>10</b>. Closure <b>20</b> may be configured so that a user may selectively open and/or remove closure <b>20</b> from container <b>10</b> to provide package <b>5</b> in an open position so that, for example, the user may access contents of container <b>10</b> and/or package <b>5</b>. Closure <b>20</b> may be provided such that a user may selectively reclose container <b>10</b> and/or package <b>5</b> by reclosing, reconnecting, or reattaching closure <b>20</b> to container <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Closure <b>20</b> may include a lid <b>110</b> that is selectively openable relative to a closure base <b>120</b> by one or more user inputs, and/or selectively closeable relative to closure base <b>120</b> to move lid <b>110</b> between the closed and/or locked position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and the open position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For example, lid <b>110</b> may include a lid lip <b>113</b>, which may provide a snap fit or friction fit, for example, with a base bead <b>126</b>, to facilitate a closed lid <b>110</b> that may be overcome and/or opened (e.g., &#x201c;popped&#x201d; open) by a user pushing up on lid <b>110</b> or some portion thereof to open lid <b>110</b> relative to base <b>120</b>. For example, lid <b>110</b> may move and/or rotate upwardly relative to base <b>120</b> about a hinge <b>130</b> between the closed position and the open position.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">To prevent or inhibit unwanted opening of lid <b>110</b>, for example, or for any other reason or for any combination thereof, package <b>5</b> and/or closure <b>20</b> may include a locking mechanism such as a collar or locking collar <b>30</b>. Collar <b>30</b> may be movable by a first user input between a locked position in which it blocks, prevents, and/or inhibits opening of lid <b>110</b> relative to base <b>120</b> and/or container <b>10</b>, and an unlocked position in which lid <b>110</b> is and openable by a second user input. For example, the first user input may be rotation of collar <b>30</b> relative to lid <b>110</b> and/or base <b>120</b> from a locked position to an unlocked position. In this example, one or more collar base beads <b>37</b> may be vertically aligned with and/or create a mechanical stop with one or more base locking protrusions <b>125</b> to prevent an opening motion or second user input such as flip F, which may move lid <b>110</b> from the closed position to the open position. Collar <b>30</b> may be moved by a first user input, such as rotation or twist T shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, from the locked position to an unlocked position in which collar base beads <b>37</b> are out of alignment with base locking protrusions <b>125</b> and/or the mechanical stop previously preventing opening is removed. In order to facilitate opening lid <b>110</b>, for example, by flip F, collar <b>30</b> and/or lid <b>110</b> may be provided with collar lip <b>34</b>, which may among other things provide a convenient surface for a user to engage when providing the second user input and/or opening flip F.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">From the unlocked position, for example, a user may provide the second input such as flip F to open lid <b>110</b> and/or collar <b>30</b> relative to base <b>120</b> and/or container <b>10</b>, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In some embodiments, closure <b>20</b> may include base <b>120</b>, lid <b>110</b>, and/or collar <b>30</b>. Closure base <b>120</b> may include a skirt <b>121</b> that may be configured for engagement, attachment, and/or coupling with container <b>10</b>. For example, skirt <b>121</b> may include a snap on type fit or engagement, such as a substantially permanent or semi-permanent snap feature (e.g., ridges or beads to snap on or over corresponding ridges or beads of container <b>10</b>) for any of a variety of reasons, including but not limited to providing a child-resistant attachment of closure <b>20</b> to container <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, an internal thread configured to cooperate with an external thread of container neck <b>14</b> to provide a threaded engagement and/or removal of closure <b>20</b> from to or from container <b>10</b>. Base <b>120</b> may include a shoulder <b>122</b>, which may be located above and/or radially inward of skirt <b>121</b>. Locking protrusions <b>125</b> may, for example, be located at or near shoulder <b>122</b> and may extend radially outwardly from shoulder <b>122</b> but may be terminate prior to reaching an outward radial distance of an outer surface of skirt <b>121</b>. In this way, for example, collar base beads <b>37</b> may lockingly engage locking protrusions <b>125</b> while collar <b>30</b> extends radially outwardly a distance equal to or less than skirt <b>121</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, collar base beads <b>37</b> may include an angled or cammed lower surface configured to engage with locking protrusions <b>125</b> to allow collar base beads <b>37</b> to slide or cam over locking protrusions <b>125</b> to allow lid <b>110</b> to move from the opened position to the close position even if collar <b>30</b> is in the locked position. In some embodiments, locking protrusions <b>125</b> may include an angled or cammed upper surface configured to engage with collar base beads <b>37</b> to allow collar base beads <b>37</b> to slide or cam over locking protrusions <b>125</b> to allow lid <b>110</b> to move from the opened position to the closed position even if collar <b>30</b> is in the locked position. In some embodiments, such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, collar base beads <b>37</b> may have angled or cammed lower surfaces and locking protrusions <b>125</b> may have angled or cammed upper surfaces, the combination of which may further facilitate closing lid <b>110</b> even if collar <b>30</b> is in the locked position.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As discussed more below, collar <b>30</b> may be biased toward the locked position so that, for example, it tends to stay in or move to the locked position in the absence of the first or unlocking user input. To facilitate locking and/or prevention or inhibition of opening from the locked position, either or both of an upper surface of collar base beads <b>37</b> and a lower surface of locking protrusions <b>125</b> may be substantially flat and/or horizontal when lid <b>110</b> is in the closed position to facilitate and/or provide a strong mechanical stop between them. While a snap fit or friction fit may be provided between lid bead <b>116</b> and/or base bead <b>126</b>, it is understood that either or both of these may be substantially smaller and/or extend radially a shorter distance than collar base beads <b>37</b> and/or base locking protrusions <b>125</b>, for any of a variety of reasons, including but not limited to providing a snap fit that may be readily overcome by a user when collar <b>30</b> is in the unlocked position, but that may be prevented from opening due to the locking engagement of collar base beads <b>37</b> and locking protrusions <b>125</b> when in the locked position.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the unlocked position, collar base beads <b>37</b> may move through unlocking slots <b>127</b> relatively easily to allow lid <b>110</b> to move from the closed position to the open position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In order to facilitate moving collar <b>30</b> between the locked and unlocked positions, collar <b>30</b> may be provided with a hinge recess <b>38</b>, which may be provided so that a portion of collar side wall <b>31</b> may extend downwardly farther than hinge <b>130</b>, while also allowing movement and/or rotation of collar <b>30</b> relative to hinge <b>130</b> with limited or no interference from hinge <b>130</b>. Cover <b>110</b> may include a plug <b>115</b> to facilitate and/or provide a better fit and/or seal in cooperation with a rim <b>123</b> of base <b>120</b>, or for any other reason or combination of reasons.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, lid <b>110</b> may include a cover <b>111</b> and/or a lid skirt <b>112</b> that prevent, inhibit, and/or block access to an opening <b>124</b> into the product storage region when in the closed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Package <b>5</b> may be configured so that a user can hold container <b>10</b> in one hand, provide a first input by twisting, rotating, and/or moving collar <b>30</b> circumferentially relative to lid <b>110</b> and/or base <b>120</b> to unlock or unblock lid <b>110</b> so that it may be made to have upward movement or rotation, and provide a second input by pushing, pulling, moving, or rotating lid <b>110</b> from the closed position to the open position, for example, by pushing or pulling upwardly on collar lip <b>34</b> to cause rotation of lid <b>110</b> about hinge <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Collar <b>30</b> may include a collar attachment mechanism, such as collar attachment portion <b>35</b>, for engagement with a corresponding attachment mechanism of lid <b>110</b>, such as lid attachment portion <b>117</b>, shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a top perspective view of lid <b>110</b> and base <b>120</b>, and a bottom perspective view of collar <b>30</b>. Attachment recess <b>35</b> may be located at or near a bottom surface of collar <b>35</b> and/or may extend at least partially through collar <b>30</b>, for example, in a vertical direction. Collar attachment portion <b>35</b> and lid attachment portion <b>117</b> may be configured so that rotation of a hub <b>40</b> of collar <b>30</b> relative to lid <b>110</b> is prevented or inhibited. For example, collar attachment portion <b>35</b> may include a non-circular recess and lid attachment portion <b>117</b> may include a similarly sized and shaped protrusion for mating with the recess <b>35</b>, such that rotation of one will induce rotation of the other. It is understood that the arrangement could be reversed, for example, with lid attachment portion <b>117</b> being a recess and collar attachment portion <b>35</b> being a protrusion. It is further understood that other attachment mechanisms suitable for preventing relative rotation of collar attachment portion <b>35</b> and lid attachment portion <b>117</b> may be included.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The relative motion of a portion of collar <b>30</b>, such as collar side wall <b>31</b>, relative to lid <b>110</b> and/or base <b>120</b> may be provided and/or facilitated by one or more flexible or deflectable members, such as spokes <b>50</b>. Spokes <b>50</b> may be configured to flex to allow rotation of collar side wall <b>31</b> and/or movement of collar <b>30</b> between the unlocked and locked position. Spokes <b>50</b> may be biased toward the locked position so that collar <b>30</b> and/or collar side wall <b>31</b> tends to return to the locked position in the absence of the first user input and/or twist T. Spokes <b>50</b> may be made to flex in a variety of ways, including but not limited to being formed in the shape and configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, being formed to include an elastomeric material such as thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) for example, other plastic material, rubber, or any other material or way of providing elasticity, or any combination thereof. Any or all of spokes <b>50</b> may be formed of one or more components, such as a center component <b>53</b> and an outer component <b>54</b>. For example, in some embodiments, center component <b>53</b> may be formed of a relatively rigid material such as polypropylene (PP) or other plastic material, which may be the same material as collar side wall <b>31</b>, for example, so that center components <b>53</b> and side wall <b>31</b> may be molded together. Outer components <b>54</b> may be formed of a softer and/or more elastic material, such as TPE, to provide additional flexibility to spokes <b>50</b>, for example. In some embodiments, TPE may be overmolded onto center components <b>53</b> in a secondary molding operation.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows package <b>5</b> without collar <b>30</b>, to further illustrate lid <b>110</b> and base <b>120</b> in a closed position on container <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a cross-section view taken through a portion of closure <b>20</b>, to show among other things, the relationship of certain features of package <b>5</b>, closure <b>20</b>, and collar <b>30</b>. For instance, in the locked position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, collar base beads <b>37</b> and base locking protrusions <b>125</b> are at least partially in vertical alignment to prevent or inhibit vertical motion of lid <b>110</b> relative to base <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates collar <b>30</b> in more detail from a top perspective view. In this embodiment, hub <b>40</b> of collar <b>30</b> may be centrally located and/or configured to attach to lid <b>110</b>, base <b>120</b>, and/or closure <b>20</b> in a way that substantially prevents or inhibits rotation of hub <b>40</b> relative to closure <b>20</b>, as discussed above, for example. Spokes <b>50</b> may attach to hub <b>40</b> at a first spoke end <b>51</b> and may extend radially outwardly toward second spoke end <b>52</b>, which may attach to, couple with, and/or be integrally formed with collar side wall <b>31</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates one example of a resting state of collar <b>30</b>, which would provide collar <b>30</b> in the locked position when coupled to closure <b>20</b>. Movement or rotation of collar <b>30</b> relative to closure <b>20</b> may cause flexure or deflection of spokes <b>50</b>, which may provide a spring-like element and/or biasing force back toward the resting state and/or locked position. An example of how collar <b>30</b> and/or spokes <b>50</b> may appear when in the flexed, deflected, and/or unlocked position, is shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. The attachment of collar <b>30</b> to lid <b>110</b> via engagement of recess <b>35</b> of hub <b>40</b> and attachment portion <b>117</b> of lid <b>110</b> is shown in more detail, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref> show an embodiment of package <b>5</b> in a locked position and an unlocked position, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref> illustrate a back perspective view of package <b>5</b>, showing hinge <b>130</b> connecting base <b>120</b> and lid <b>110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows package <b>5</b> in the locked position, in which a portion of hinge recess <b>38</b> of collar <b>30</b> is visible. Hinge recess <b>38</b> may be configured to allow collar <b>30</b> and/or collar side wall <b>31</b> to move or rotate relative to hinge <b>130</b> without hinge <b>130</b> interfering with that motion until recess <b>38</b> ends and hinge <b>130</b> contacts side wall <b>31</b>. Hinge recess <b>38</b> may be configured so that when it ends and side wall <b>31</b> contacts hinge <b>131</b>, collar base beads <b>37</b> are in alignment with unlocking slots <b>127</b>. In this way, for example, hinge <b>130</b> and/or hinge recess <b>38</b> may provide and/or facilitate an alignment mechanism to inform a user when the collar base beads <b>37</b> and unlocking slots <b>127</b> are in alignment and/or the collar is in the unlocked position. Such an arrangement could help a user locate the unlocked position by applying twist T without, for example, rotating collar <b>30</b> too far and/or past the unlocked position to another locked position.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates package <b>5</b> in the locked and closed positions. Collar base beads <b>37</b> are in alignment with base locking protrusions <b>125</b> and not in alignment with unlocking slots <b>127</b>. Locking protrusions <b>125</b> may prevent moving lid <b>110</b>, closure <b>20</b>, and/or package <b>5</b> from the closed position to the open position by blocking collar base beads <b>37</b> from moving vertically, for example. Spokes <b>50</b> are shown in a resting condition in the locked position.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates package <b>5</b> in the unlocked position when subject to first user input and/or twist T that overcomes the bias of spokes <b>50</b>. In the unlocked position, collar base beads <b>37</b> are in alignment with unlocking slots <b>127</b> so that collar base beads <b>37</b> may pass through unlocking slots during movement in a vertical direction moving lid <b>110</b> from the closed position to the open position. In the unlocked position, spokes <b>50</b> are deformed and provide a biasing force counter to twist T toward the locked position so that, for example, collar <b>30</b> may return to the locked position in the absence of first user input and/or twist T.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Closure <b>20</b> may couple, connect, and/or attach to container <b>10</b> by an attachment mechanism such as the threaded engagement between neck threads on container neck <b>14</b> and base threads on closure base <b>120</b>.
