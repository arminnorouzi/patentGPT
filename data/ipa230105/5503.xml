end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Various embodiments of the present disclosure are generally directed to systems and methods for active light transmission in a data storage environment.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Hard disc drives are a type of data storage device typically having a printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) affixed to a head-disc assembly (HDA). The PCBA has control electronics such as a system on chip (SOC) integrated circuit device to provide top level control of the storage device. The HDA may be in the form of a sealed enclosure housing a head-disc assembly (HSA) with arrays of data transducers (heads) and rotatable magnetic recording surfaces (discs) to store and retrieve user data. The transducers are located at the end of head-gimbal assemblies (HGAs) supported by a rotary actuator. Preamplifier/driver circuitry (preamps) are usually incorporated into the HSA in close proximity to the transducers to preserve signal integrity.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">There are a number of limitations associated with current generation electrical signal and power systems in HDDs and other related types of devices. First, in mass storage data archival systems where one controller PCBA interconnects and controls a large number of HDAs, there are limitations associated with electrical connectivity due to the limited reach of the high-bandwidth signals over copper wire. Second, with the increasing numbers of heads being operated in parallel on modern HSAs, the preamp electronics can generate substantial heat which can affect the integrity of the high-bandwidth signals being transmitted and processed during HDD operation. Third, there remains an industry-wide desire to reduce energy consumption in storage devices, including the power used by preamp electronics.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">One approach to address these and other limitations would be to use optical interconnects to address the limited reach of electrical connections. However, optical links operating in the digital domain require the use of expensive, high-speed, and high power consumption analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (ADCs and DACs) and other complex circuitry in the preamp.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Various embodiments of the present disclosure are accordingly directed to a method and apparatus for providing efficient transmission of energy using light emission and detection techniques in a data storage environment. As explained below, a specially configured, analog domain optical link is established between an initiator device and a target device, such as but not limited to a PCBA and an HSA in an HDD.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The optical link is used to transfer energy in the form of an analog signal to support data transfer operations with a non-volatile memory (NVM). The analog signal can include multiplexed data, sensor, control and/or power signals. Modulation circuitry is incorporated into the optical link to implement compact, high bandwidth wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical transceivers. The modulation circuitry can take a variety of forms, including but not limited to micro-ring resonators (MRRs) and Mach-Zehnder Interferometer Modulation (MZM) devices.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The disclosed solution provides a number of advantages over the existing art. Conveying signals in the analog domain eliminates the need for ADCs and DACs, as the signals can be conveyed over optical links in their native format. As such, the various embodiments can reduce preamp power consumption levels as compared to those experienced by existing copper (metal) wire connected preamps.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Optical links are capable of very high bandwidths that are not achievable with current generation metal connection paths. For example, current generation metal interconnects are generally limited to transmission rates in the 5-6 GHz (10<sup>12 </sup>Hz) range. This range is not scalable to higher levels owing to limitations associated with link mechanical cross section, flexibility requirements, drive height constraints and other areal considerations. It is also not feasible to simultaneously convey both read and write signals along the same metal conductors due to crosstalk.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">By contrast, analog optical links can accommodate bandwidths that are orders of magnitude greater than the fastest metal interconnections. Using frequency multiplexing techniques allow coincident read and write data streams without SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) degradation, as well as the bundling of SIF (special interface format) control data in the same links.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The SOC to preamp links will be scalable from current to future bandwidth requirements without occupying more space, unlike conventional configurations. Existing bulkhead connectors used to accommodate conventional metal interconnections are limited in the total number of wires/pins that can extend through the HDA base deck to maintain access and signal isolation levels; using larger bulkhead connectors to increase pin count also increases sealing concerns and costs. By contrast, the narrow cross section, elasticity, and near-zero losses within optical fiber links also offer more flexibility in the routing of the high bandwidth link. Pin counts and sizes of optical link bulkhead connectors are reduced, simplifying interconnects and housing seal considerations.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In accordance with various embodiments presented below, an optical waveguide transmits electromagnetic radiation in the form of light between PIC (photonic IC, transceivers) on the main PCBA and the HDA. A laser source on the PCBA presents the light into the waveguide which is designed to transmit CW (continuous wave) light at the laser wavelength. Tuning of the corresponding resonator will determine which reader or writer in the stack is active. In one embodiment, a single reader or writer is accessed at any instance in time. As such, a single wavelength is sufficient to carry the single data stream. In other embodiments, multiple readers and/or writers can be simultaneously accessed, as well as other active elements (e.g., sensors, heaters, laser diodes, etc.).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">During writing operations, the SOC presents an electrical signal to the MRR or MZM modulator in the PIC. The amplitude modulation of the electrical voltage is the data to be stored. The voltage modulation at the MRR or the MZM alters the optical power output of the modulator; in this manner, the optical output power of the modulator carries the data to be stored. A photodetector integrated with the writer portion of the pre-amp provides a measure of the modulating optical power signal.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The same waveguide and laser can be used for reading. The read signal from the preamp is a voltage acting upon the optical modulator (MRR or MZM), which in turn modulates the optical power output of the modulator. This modulated light power is sensed by the photodetector (PD) at the PIC on the PCBA. The PD output is in the electrical domain; its amplitude corresponds to the reader signal.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the case of simultaneous read and/or write (multiple heads reading data simultaneously, or simultaneous writing/reading by the same head), multiple wavelengths may be used on the same fiber, each carrying data for a different transducer element. A light source capable of producing all of these wavelengths will be required (e.g., tunable laser, multiwavelength laser). Micro rings can be tuned to a particular wavelength and the filtering and modulation can be achieved via the same device; no additional structures are required in that there can be a wavelength associated with each read/write channel, and the associated micro ring correspondingly tuned to that wavelength.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For MZM-based implementations, modulation and detection can be separated. For signal modulation (writing) an Arrayed Waveguide Grating (AWG) can be used at the input of the multiwavelength laser. AWGs enable low-loss coupling of multiple wavelengths into a single waveguide. A 1&#xd7;N AWG separates multiplexed wavelengths into N different channels. Each separated wavelength is modulated via an MZM, which is connected to each output of the AWG. For detection (reading), a similar approach is used, only in reverse: an AWG multiplexes the optical data exiting the reader-induced excitation of the MZM modulator, and the resulting signal is injected into the single waveguide.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Additional aspects of various embodiments can include temperature control compensation. Generally, MRRs are more sensitive to temperature as compared to MZMs, but closed-loop detection and compensation techniques can be utilized in both cases to maintain appropriate transfer performance.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">To boost the gain of the RF analog link, a DFB (distributed feedback) laser with high power output levels such as on the order of around 60 mW to 100 mW may be implemented. The optical link material (waveguide) should have a high bandgap to prevent two photon absorption at high power. A suitable waveguide material is silicon nitride (SiN). Since the small signal modulation will likely be implemented in silicon, light will be split into multiple rings and the final modulated output combined and sent to the output waveguide. Noise in the system can be reduced by either using a high laser input or a pre-amplifier at the input of the respective modulation circuits.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">When MZMs are used, their nonlinear response can be modeled as a sum of Bessel functions. Linearization can be achieved by some combination of modulator geometry optimization, material doping optimization, and via pre-distortion of the signal input to dynamically compensate for MZM nonlinearity. Geometrical and doping optimization is less power hungry but may require prior knowledge of the device nonlinearity, and is difficult to tune dynamically once the device has been fabricated. Electronic pre-distortion can require significant power levels (e.g., greater than 100 mW/element), but can be tuned to linearize the response substantially (e.g., levels greater than 10 dB cancellation in inter modulation distortion).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The optical links can be used for a number of different types of signals between an HSA and an SOC, including but not limited to data write, data read, laser control, heater control, sensor outputs, power, etc. Stand-alone storage device and multi-device array configurations are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">These and other features and advantages of various embodiments can be understood beginning with a review of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> which provides a simplified functional representation of a data handling system <b>100</b>.

The electrical data from individual transducer elements drives the voltage in branches of individual MZMs <b>400</b>A, <b>400</b>B, <b>400</b>C, etc. associated with that transducer element. Different wavelength light passes through each of the MZMs. The resulting modulated optical signal passes through the AWG <b>430</b> in order to couple all of the multi-wavelength light into a single output waveguide with low loss. In this implementation, the C-band (centered at 1550 nm) may be used to carry the optical signals. AWGs such as <b>430</b> can be used as either multiplexers or demultiplexers depending on location in the system.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a generalized functional block representation of an optical data transport system <b>440</b> in further embodiments.

The system incorporates an optical splitter <b>452</b> to enable separate decoding of read/write (R/W) data and associated control data signals from the same transmission. Without limitation, the control data can be preamp configuration settings (gain, encoding, etc.) used during the generation and processing of the R/W signals (or other sensor signals) which pertain to the actual data being transferred to or from the NVM.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">While single device embodiments have been illustrated thus far, the optical links disclosed and embodied herein can be extended to a multi-device array <b>470</b>, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. The array <b>470</b> includes an array controller <b>472</b> with an SOC <b>474</b> similar to those discussed above. The SOC <b>474</b> includes a DBE <b>476</b> and an AFE <b>478</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">A set of waveguide/fiber optical links <b>480</b> configured and operated as described above are used to optically couple the AFE <b>478</b> to a number of HDAs <b>482</b> (denoted as HDA <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>). Any number of HDAs can be incorporated into the array <b>470</b> under the central control of the SOC <b>474</b>.

Hence, each HDA <b>482</b> may incorporate one or more local preamps mounted to the sides of the respective actuators. Alternatively, some or all of the preamp operations can be consolidated into the AFE <b>478</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> provides a flow diagram for an optical link data transfer sequence <b>500</b> carried out in accordance with the foregoing discussion. It will be understood that the sequence <b>500</b> generally describes various operations performed by the various storage devices to process and execute a data transfer command from a host device (e.g., <b>104</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). It will be appreciated that additional or alternative steps may be carried out depending on the requirements of a given application.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The device is initialized at block <b>502</b> to place the device in an operationally ready state. At block <b>504</b>, a host data transfer command is received and processed (such as via interface <b>106</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The data transfer command generally requests a transfer of user data between the requesting host and the main memory store of the storage device, such as in the case of a write or read command. Other types of commands are contemplated, however (e.g., erase, trim, status, allocation, etc.).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">A target memory location in the main memory store is identified at block <b>506</b>. In a rotatable media environment, this may include identification of a particular head/disc combination, as well as other address information (e.g., cylinder, volume, zone, track, sector, etc.). The command is placed in an appropriate command queue pending execution.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">At block <b>508</b>, appropriate data, control and/or power signals are generated to execute the command. For example, to service a write command, the input write data received from the host may be subjected to various forms of processing including encoding, encryption, generation of associated metadata, etc. Parameters for heater/laser power and other related system elements maybe used to generate various power and control profiles. To service a read command, various parameters may be similarly required to prepare the system to execute the same.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">When the system is ready to execute the data transfer, the generated signals from block <b>508</b> are injected into one or more of the optical links at block <b>510</b> and extracted from the optical links at block <b>512</b>, as described above. The extracted signals are used at block <b>514</b> to complete the remaining processing associated with the command. For example, a write command may involve a follow up read verify operation, the updating of map metadata, etc. A read command may involve decoding of the extracted data and transfer to the requesting host. Other post optical transfer operations can be carried out as required.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Finally, block <b>516</b> shows operation to monitor the system operation to ensure the optical link transfers are occurring at acceptable levels. Various parameters can be utilized such as BER, syndrome counts, throughput, and so on. Calibration routines and adaptive adjustments can be made as required.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> graphically represents a set of wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) data signals <b>530</b> that can be processed using the optical links disclosed herein. The signals are represented as simple sinusoids for ease of illustration and include different combined waveforms <b>532</b>, <b>534</b> and <b>536</b>. Each of the waveforms can be provided with different characteristics, such as frequency/wavelength, amplitude, etc. to facilitate concurrent transfer and multiplexed extraction at the appropriate site. As noted above, the respective waveforms are separate components of the composite analog signal and can take any of the various forms described above including but not limited to data write signals, data read signals, sensor signals, control signals, power signals, etc.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">It will now be understood that the various embodiments presented herein can present a number of benefits over the existing art. The optical transmission of analog signals can efficiently and effectively provide high bandwidth, low power and high frequency data transfers in a multiplexed data processing environment. Efficient power and control signal transfers can also be carried out.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">While the various embodiments illustrated herein have been directed to systems having magnetic recording media (e.g., HDDs, hybrid devices, etc.), it will be appreciated that this is not necessarily limiting. Rather, the various optical links can be used for other storage device applications, including solid-state drives (SSDs) and other memory configurations, as well as non-data storage device based applications.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Moreover, the flexible nature of the flex circuit waveguides advantageously facilitates high speed data, signal and power transfers to a moveable target/source (e.g., actuator), it will be appreciated that both ends of the optical link can instead be stationary relative one to the other.
