By mounting a temporary holding mechanism by the holding portion <b>108</b> and holding units of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> one by one in the feeding and fastening device <b>100</b>, units of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> can be sent out to the fastening portion <b>118</b> one by one.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in this embodiment, the holding portion <b>108</b> is provided with two mechanisms: a first mechanism for holding steel balls <b>140</b> provided at two radial locations by applying pressure with an O-ring <b>110</b>, and a second or alternative mechanism for holding the metal for piercing <b>200</b> with a ball plunger <b>150</b> (detent device). Alternatively, the holding portion <b>108</b> may be designed by attaching a mechanism having a stopper function such as a spring or a locking cam as a temporary holding mechanism. Also, the mounting position and height can be appropriately determined by setting the mounting position of the holding portion <b>108</b> to a position that does not interfere with the operation.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The part passage route portion <b>120</b> extends downward from the holding portion <b>108</b>; to allow the metal for piercing <b>200</b> to pass while maintaining a state in which the front surface and the back surface of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> are substantially parallel to each other in the vertical direction; the metal for piercing <b>200</b> has a cross section with a width in which the front and back sides are not inverted. For example, in order to maintain the determined posture directions of the front surface and the back surface of the metal for piercing <b>200</b>, the cross-sectional shape of the part passage route portion <b>120</b> together with the part insertion port is rectangular. The part passage route portion <b>120</b> has a structure wherein when the metal for piercing <b>200</b> temporarily held by the ball plunger <b>150</b> is released, it naturally falls vertically in a thin, rectangular parallelepiped passage route. The part passage route portion <b>120</b> keeps the directions of the front surface and the back surface of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> constant by forming it into a rectangular parallelepiped shape; by designing so as not to create a space for inversion, the structure is such that the metal for piercing <b>200</b> introduced from the feeder device <b>106</b> through the feed tube can be fed to the guide portion <b>112</b> of the feeding and fastening device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The guide portion <b>112</b> is connected to the lower side of the part passage route portion <b>120</b> and is configured such that the metal for piercing <b>200</b> that has passed through the part passage route portion <b>120</b> is guided from a state in which the front surface and the back surface of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> are vertically parallel to a state in which the front surface and the back surface of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> are oriented in the horizontal direction. As a specific structure, the guide portion <b>112</b> is provided with an inclination angle between the part passage route portion <b>120</b> and the fastening portion <b>118</b>, and a guide groove (reference numeral <b>122</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A</figref>, B and C) is machined to guide the surface of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> to gradually face upward on the inclined surface.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, the guide portion <b>112</b> is configured so that, by having a width <b>107</b> wider than the width <b>105</b> of the part passage route portion <b>120</b>, the metal for piercing <b>200</b> can be smoothly guided from the vertical state where the front and back surfaces of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> are vertically parallel to the horizontal state where the front surface and the back surface of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> are oriented horizontally, through the intermediate state where the front surface and the back surface of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> are oriented diagonally. If the width <b>107</b> of the guide portion <b>112</b> is too narrow, the metal for piercing that has naturally fallen cannot be converted in the horizontal direction and is caught, so the width <b>107</b> is wider than the width <b>105</b>; on the other hand, the width <b>107</b> is set to a width smaller than the diameter of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> inasmuch as if it is too wide, a space for inversion is created.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Moreover, the portion where the inclination angle is provided is largely R-processed (smoothly radially curved) so that the front surface and the back surface of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> are reoriented in the horizontal direction from the vertical state where the front surface and the back surface of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> are parallel to the vertical direction. As a result, the structural design is such that the flange <b>220</b> of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> can pass through without being caught.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition, at the time of entry of the tip of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> that has fallen in the vertical direction, by inserting the back surface portion <b>230</b> of the metal for piercing <b>200</b>, the guide groove (reference numeral <b>122</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) plays a role as a guide rail for smoothly loading the back surface portion <b>230</b> of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> into the fastening portion <b>118</b> while smoothly changing the orientation of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> from the vertical direction to the horizontal direction.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">By the above radius of curvature and guide groove, the metal for piercing <b>200</b> that has naturally fallen in the feeding and fastening device <b>100</b> in the vertical direction smoothly changes to the horizontal direction and can be loaded into the fastening portion <b>118</b> of the feeding and fastening device <b>100</b> without clogging.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the fastening portion <b>118</b> is located at the bottom of the pillar-shaped portion <b>104</b>; the back surface portion <b>230</b> of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> does not have a bottom surface so as to come into contact with the member to be attached <b>300</b> in a horizontal state where the front surface and the back surface of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> are oriented horizontally by the guiding portion <b>112</b>. In addition, the fastening portion <b>118</b> is configured of a diameter substantially the same as the diameter of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> so that the position of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> does not vary. The fastening portion <b>118</b> is configured to fasten the metal for piercing <b>200</b> to the member to be attached <b>300</b> by pressing from above with a punch tool <b>102</b> in a horizontal state where the front surface and the back surface of the metal for piercing <b>200</b> face in the horizontal direction.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As a first embodiment of the metal for piercing loading method using the feeding and fastening device <b>100</b> according to the present invention, an explanation is hereinbelow provided of the flow of the process for receiving the metal for piercing <b>200</b>, feeding the metal for piercing <b>200</b> to the fastening position, and fastening the metal for piercing <b>200</b> to the member to be attached.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a first embodiment of metal for piercing loading. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an enlarged view showing the internal structure around the guide portion <b>112</b> for the first embodiment of metal for piercing loading.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this first method embodiment, first, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the metal for piercing <b>200</b> is temporarily held by the holding portion <b>108</b> when it is introduced by air pressure feeding from the square tube of the feeder device <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, with the metal for piercing <b>200</b> held by the holding portion <b>108</b>, when the punch tool <b>102</b> is lowered to push down the side surface of the metal for piercing <b>200</b>, the metal for piercing <b>200</b> is released from the holding portion <b>108</b> and naturally falls in the part passage route portion <b>120</b>. In this case, the width of the part passage route portion <b>120</b> is designed to be about the same as the thickness of the metal for piercing <b>200</b>, and the metal for piercing <b>200</b> is not inverted.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>, when the metal for piercing <b>200</b> naturally falls in the part passage route portion <b>120</b>, it reaches the guide portion <b>112</b>.

In this case, the timing at which the next metal for piercing <b>200</b> is inserted may be, for example, the timing at which the punch tool <b>102</b> detects that it has passed the holding portion <b>108</b> in the upward direction. Further, a predetermined interval may be set so that the feeder device automatically sends the feed.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to the metal for piercing loading method of the present embodiment, coin-shaped parts such as metal for piercing <b>200</b> can be guided one by one in order without variation into the fastening portion <b>118</b> and fastened to the member to be attached <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a second embodiment of the method for loading the metal for piercing.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this embodiment, as in the first embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, the metal for piercing <b>200</b> is first temporarily held by the holding portion <b>108</b> when it is charged by air pressure feeding from the square tube of the feeder device <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, with the metal for piercing <b>200</b> held by the holding portion <b>108</b>, when the punch tool <b>102</b> is lowered to push down the side surface of the metal for piercing <b>200</b>, the metal for piercing <b>200</b> is released from the holding portion <b>108</b> and naturally falls in the part passage route portion <b>120</b>. Further, this embodiment is configured so that when the punch tool <b>102</b> descends to a position where it abuts on the side surface of the metal for piercing <b>200</b>, the next unit of metal for piercing <b>200</b> is inserted from the feed device <b>106</b>.
