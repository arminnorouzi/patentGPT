The solution may also contain a chelating or complex forming agent. pH, temperature, and deposition time (e.g., about 5 minutes to about 300 minutes) are suitable for the desired thickness, morphology, and surface porosity of the surface modification material to be produced. The pH of the solution may be adjusted across the range of 1 to 12 in order to adjust the characteristics (for example, desired crystal structure and/or surface porosity) of the surface modification by the addition of acidic or basic materials. The metal salt(s) may include, for example, salts of magnesium, aluminum, cerium, iron, cobalt, gadolinium, manganese, tungsten, zinc, vanadium, titanium, and/or tin. The salts may be metal cation salts with anions of, for example, sulfates, nitrates, chlorides, or acetates. In other embodiments, sodium cation salts are used with metal anions such as, for example, sodium stannate. In some embodiments, the metal salt concentration is about 1 mM to about 5M in the aqueous solution. In some embodiments, chelating or complex forming agent such as, for example, citric acid, urea, diamines, triamines, or tetramines, thioglycerol, oleic acid or other fatty acids, polyols, Tween 80 or other surfactants, is included at a concentration of about 1 mM to about 5M. pH control chemicals and buffering agents may be optionally included.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some embodiments, the substrate is cleaned to remove loose and lightly adhered debris by washing and rinsing and a variety of metal cleaning solutions or cleaning solutions outlined for particular substrates.

One example is the use of caustic soda in an aqueous solution with a pH of approximately 11 or greater.

Desmutting or deoxidizing solutions typically include acid solutions such as chromic, sulphuric, nitric or phosphoric acids or combinations therein. Ferric sulfate solutions may be employed.

Each layer was cut to the same size and massed. A container filled with a known mass of dry desiccant was sealed to bottom side of the bottom layer of the stack. For a stack consisting of multiple layers, the layers were sealed together along their edges such the only way for vapor to enter the stack was to pass through the top layer of the stack. The stack and desiccant were placed in a chamber with controlled temperature and humidity. Every 30 minutes the samples were massed to determine the amount of water vapor from the chamber that had passed through the layers and adsorbed onto the desiccant. Once the mass of the desiccant increased by 10% the test was stopped and the rate of vapor transmission through each stack per unit area per unit time was determined.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0126">The water column breakthrough pressure was determined as follows. A vertical tube with an inner diameter of 12.7 mm was sealed to the top layer of the stack. For a stack consisting of multiple layers, the layers were sealed together along their edges such that water could only enter or exit the stack by flowing through the top layer and bottom layer, respectively. The tube was filled by dispensing water down the side of the tube so as not to impinge water directly on the top layer of the stack. Water was dispensed incrementality such that the height of the water column was increased by 1 cm at a time followed by a <b>5</b> second period during which no water was dispensed. The column was filled in this manner until the height of the water column began to decrease, indicating breakthrough of the water in the column through the material stack. The maximum fill height of each sample was recorded.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0121" num="0127">Functionalized mesh materials as described in the example below were prepared as follows.
