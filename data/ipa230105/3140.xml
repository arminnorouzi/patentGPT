However, outside-fit flanges, whereby the interference fit is formed at a radially-outer portion of the flange, may not benefit from such weight-loss techniques. As the interference or friction fit occurs at the radially-outer end of the flange, a constant circumference may be required to withstand the various stresses endured, preserve the flange's structural integrity and prevent the radially outer end or rim of the flange from bending, collapsing, or otherwise being damaged.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one aspect, there is provided a component of an aircraft engine having an annular flange disposed about a radially outer surface of the component, the annular flange comprising: an annular wall extending radially outwardly from the radially outer surface of the component, the annular wall including radially-extending supports circumferentially spaced apart and extending radially between the radially outer surface of the component and a circumferentially uninterrupted radially outer rim of the annular wall, the annular wall including one or more arcuate cutouts defined circumferentially between adjacent radially-extending supports and radially inwards of the radially outer rim of the annular wall, the radially-extending supports including fastener openings defined axially therethrough;

Mounting assembly <b>20</b>, also referred to as a mating assembly <b>20</b>, includes a first component <b>30</b> which is mated or joined to a second component <b>40</b>, illustratively via threaded fasteners <b>50</b>. As will be discussed in further detail below, in various embodiments the first component <b>30</b> and second component <b>40</b> are additionally retained together via one or more annular flanges creating an interference or spigot-fit between radially outer circumferences of the one or more mating flanges. The mounting assembly <b>20</b> may be located at various locations within the engine <b>10</b>, for instance at an inlet to the compressor section <b>14</b>.

The annular body <b>31</b> includes a radially-inner circumferential surface <b>31</b><i>a </i>and a radially-outer circumferential surface <b>31</b><i>b</i>. The first component <b>30</b> includes an annular flange <b>32</b> protruding axially from the radially-outer circumferential surface <b>31</b><i>b </i>of the annular body <b>31</b> and is circumferentially disposed about the annular body <b>31</b>. The annular flange <b>32</b> is operable to receive and abut against a corresponding surface of the second component <b>40</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> and as will be discussed in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The annular flange <b>32</b>, also referred to as an annular wall, divides the radially-outer circumferential surface <b>31</b><i>b </i>into a first side <b>31</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and a second side <b>31</b><i>b</i><b>2</b>.

The friction created by this interference fit may prevent the separation of the first component <b>30</b> and the second component <b>40</b>. This interference fit may centralize the first component <b>30</b> and the second component <b>40</b> relative to each other relative to the central axis <b>11</b>, while the contact between the axial end face <b>41</b><i>a </i>and the axial face <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the annular flange <b>32</b> may axially locate the first component <b>30</b> and the second component <b>40</b> relative to each other.

The number, diameter and arrangement of the second set of holes <b>42</b> may correspond to the number, diameter and arrangement of the first set of holes <b>36</b> in the annular flange <b>32</b> of the first component <b>30</b>. As such, the fasteners <b>50</b> are operable to pass through corresponding first set of holes <b>36</b> and second set of holes <b>42</b>, thus retaining the first component <b>30</b> to the second component <b>40</b> and holding or maintaining the interface between the flange <b>32</b> and the annular body <b>41</b>. In some cases, the second set of holes <b>42</b> may extend only partially through the second component <b>40</b>. In such cases, the second set of holes <b>42</b> may be threaded and the fasteners <b>50</b> may be screws. In other cases, the second set of holes <b>42</b> may be located on an annular flange (not shown) on the second component, the second set of holes <b>42</b> being through-holes. In such cases, the fasteners <b>50</b> may be bolts that are retained with nuts on an opposite side of the flange of the second component <b>40</b>. Other arrangements may be contemplated as well.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>5</b>B</figref>, the first component <b>30</b> includes one or more arcuate cutouts <b>37</b> about the circumference of the annular flange <b>32</b>. The cutouts <b>37</b> may also be referred to as windows, as they pass through the annular flange <b>32</b> from the first side <b>31</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> to the second side <b>31</b><i>b</i><b>2</b>. The cutouts <b>37</b> are each defined by a radial height H<b>1</b> and an arc length L<b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). In some embodiments, the cutouts <b>37</b> may all be equal, i.e. having the same radial height H<b>1</b> and arc length L<b>1</b>. In other embodiments, for instance in the first component <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the cutouts <b>37</b> may have different dimensions from one another. In some cases, the cutouts <b>37</b> may have fully rounded corners <b>37</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In other cases, some or all of the corners <b>37</b><i>a </i>may be squared or angled. The cutouts <b>37</b> may be formed via material removal from the annular flange <b>32</b> to reduce the overall weight of the first component <b>30</b>, as will be discussed in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Radially-extending supports <b>38</b> are circumferentially spaced apart between adjacent cutouts <b>37</b>. These supports <b>38</b> extend radially between the annular body <b>31</b> and the radially outer rim <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the annular flange <b>32</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the first set of holes <b>36</b> are located on the supports <b>38</b>. The number of supports <b>38</b> may vary, and the supports <b>38</b> are each defined by a radial height H<b>2</b> and a width or arc length L<b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). In some cases, the supports <b>38</b> may all be equivalently sized, while in other cases the supports <b>38</b> may be dimensioned differently from one another. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in the radial heights H<b>2</b> of the depicted supports <b>38</b> are all equal, as they each extend from the annular body <b>31</b> to the radially outer rim <b>32</b><i>a</i>. In other cases, for instance where the annular body <b>31</b> included a raised shoulder portion (not shown), some supports <b>38</b> may include lesser radial heights H<b>2</b> than others. The arc lengths L<b>2</b> may vary from one support <b>38</b> to the other. For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the number of holes <b>36</b> on a given support <b>38</b> may require a greater arc length L<b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, some supports <b>38</b> (i.e. a first group of supports <b>38</b>) may include a single hole <b>36</b> while other supports (i.e. a second group of supports <b>38</b>) may include two adjacent or side-by-side holes <b>36</b>. Radially-aligned holes <b>36</b> on a given support <b>38</b> may be contemplated as well. Additionally or alternatively, the number and sizing of cutouts <b>37</b> may affect the number and arc lengths L<b>2</b> of supports <b>38</b>, as the supports <b>38</b> are formed by the leftover material that is not removed when the cutouts <b>37</b> are formed. Other factors affecting the number and sizing of the supports <b>38</b> may be contemplated as well.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an assembled configuration and while the engine <b>10</b> is powered on, the mounting assembly <b>20</b>, and in particular the annular flange <b>32</b>, is subject to various stresses. As such, by maintaining a constant outer periphery at the interference fit at the radially outer rim <b>32</b><i>a</i>, the annular flange <b>32</b> may be able to withstand such stresses. For instance, despite the removal of material for the cutouts <b>37</b>, the supports <b>38</b> and the consistent radially outer rim <b>32</b><i>a </i>may provide sufficient hoop strength to the annular flange <b>32</b> so that the radially outer rim <b>32</b><i>a </i>does not bend inward under stress. The consistent radially outer rim <b>32</b><i>a </i>additionally may provide a constant interference fit between the radially-outer surface <b>41</b><i>b </i>of the second component and the spigot <b>35</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Various methods for removing material to create the cutouts <b>37</b> in the annular flange <b>32</b> may be contemplated. For instance, traditional machining techniques such as milling may be used. Alternatively, the cutouts <b>37</b> may be formed in the annular flange <b>32</b> via laser-cutting. Other techniques may be contemplated as well. As material is removed to form the cutouts <b>37</b> between the annular body <b>31</b> and the radially outer rim <b>32</b><i>a</i>, enough material is left at the radially outer rim <b>32</b><i>a </i>to provide sufficient strength to the radially outer rim <b>32</b><i>a </i>and to ensure that the radially outer rim <b>32</b><i>a </i>is circumferentially continuous or uninterrupted (i.e. the radial height H<b>1</b> of each cutout <b>37</b> is defined). In an embodiment, a bolt pattern is predetermined for the annular flange <b>32</b> and the first set of holes <b>36</b> are drilled. Then, material is removed from the annular flange <b>32</b> between adjacent holes <b>36</b> to create the cutouts <b>37</b>. The arc lengths L<b>1</b> of the various cutouts <b>37</b> may be selected based on required arc lengths L<b>2</b> of supports <b>38</b>, for instance based on the structural requirements of the annular flange <b>32</b>. Other methods for forming the cutouts <b>37</b> may be contemplated as well. For instance, the bolt pattern and arrangement of cutouts <b>37</b> may be optimized for sufficient retention between the first component <b>30</b> and second component <b>40</b> and for adequate weight reduction of the annular flange <b>32</b>. Various materials such as steel, nickel and titanium may be contemplated for the first and second components <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, for instance based on their respective locations in the engine <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in some embodiments the cutouts <b>37</b> include local webbings <b>39</b>. These webbings <b>39</b>, also referred to as webs, may provide additional stiffness to the annular flange <b>32</b>, for instance in cases where respective cutouts <b>37</b> are relatively wide (i.e. with large arc lengths L<b>1</b>). In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the webbing <b>39</b> is an additional radial support subdividing a cutout <b>37</b> and extending between a radially-inner edge <b>37</b><i>b </i>of the cutout <b>37</b> to a radially-outer edge <b>37</b><i>c </i>of the cutout <b>37</b>, although other types of local webbing <b>39</b> may be contemplated as well. For instance, in some embodiments a given cutout <b>37</b> may include more than one webbing <b>39</b>. The number of support webbings <b>39</b> in a given cutout <b>37</b> may vary based on the arc length L<b>1</b> of that cutout <b>37</b>, wherein a wider cutout <b>37</b> may require a greater number of webbings <b>39</b> for sufficient support. In other embodiments, the webbings <b>39</b> may be angled rather than extending in a radial direction. In some embodiments, webbings <b>39</b> in a given cutout <b>37</b> may intersect as well. Other webbing <b>39</b> patterns may be contemplated as well. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, each intersected cutout <b>37</b> includes radially inner corners (i.e. along radially inner edges <b>37</b><i>c</i>) and two radially outer corners (i.e. along radially outer edges <b>37</b><i>c</i>), the two radially outer corners having tighter radii than the two radially inner corners.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the webbings <b>39</b> may be narrower (i.e. in a circumferential direction) than the supports <b>38</b>. In addition, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the webbings <b>39</b> do not include holes <b>36</b> for fasteners <b>50</b>. In some embodiments, each of the cutouts <b>37</b> include webbings <b>39</b>. In other embodiments, some of the cutouts <b>37</b> may include webbings <b>39</b>, for instance those that meet a minimum arc length L<b>1</b> threshold, while other narrower cutouts <b>37</b> may not include webbings <b>39</b>. The webbings <b>39</b> may be fashioned during the material removal process during which the cutouts <b>37</b> are formed. For instance, rather than machining a single cutout <b>37</b> between adjacent holes <b>36</b>, adjacent cutouts <b>37</b> with webbing <b>39</b> therebetween may be formed. Other methods for forming the webbings <b>39</b> may be contemplated as well.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, an exemplary method <b>100</b> for forming one or more arcuate cutouts <b>37</b> in an annular flange <b>32</b> disposed about a radially outer surface <b>31</b><i>b </i>of a component <b>30</b> of an aircraft engine <b>10</b> is shown.
