Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a low-temperature storage container that stores storage objects at low temperatures, and more particularly to a low-temperature storage container that stores samples for drug development used in the processes of discovering or designing drugs in medical science, bioengineering, and pharmaceutical sciences, at extremely low temperatures such as &#x2212;190&#xb0; C. obtained by use of liquid nitrogen or other cryogens.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Low-temperature storage containers that store storage objects containing samples at low temperatures are commonly known (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Publications Nos. 2015-205749 and 2016-88659). The container includes a cylindrical container body, with a storage compartment inside. A plurality of holding shelves, on which storage trays for holding storage objects are placed, are provided in the storage compartment of the container body.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the low-temperature storage container described in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2015-205749 or No. 2016-88659, the plurality of holding shelves are configured as parts of rack members, each of which has a flat cylindrical wall part and a plurality of circumferentially equally spaced beam members extending radially inward from the inner circumferential surface of the wall. A plurality of such rack members are stacked up vertically so that the plurality of holding shelves are arrayed both circumferentially and vertically. The container body has a circular opening in a top wall part for allowing holding shelves to be carried into the storage compartment. This opening is of a size that allows the rack members to be carried into the storage compartment, i.e., has a diameter larger than the outside diameter of the wall parts of the rack members. The opening is closed by a lid that has a passage hole for storage trays to pass through. When assembling this low-temperature storage container, the plurality of rack members are brought into the storage compartment through the opening of the container body one after another and stacked up, after which the opening is closed by the lid.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One problem with the low-temperature storage container described in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2015-205749 was that, because of the need for the significantly large opening in the top wall part of the container body to allow rack members to be brought into the storage compartment of the container body, the heat insulation of the entire low-temperature storage container was compromised even though the opening was closed with a highly insulating lid, leading to an increase in the amount of consumption of cooling medium such as liquid nitrogen used for the cooling.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention was made on the basis of the circumstances described above, and it is an object of the invention is to provide a low-temperature storage container that is highly insulated and can therefore reduce the amount of cooling medium consumption.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention solves the above problem by providing a low-temperature storage container including: a cylindrical container body having an opening and a storage compartment; and a plurality of holding shelves provided in the storage compartment, on which storage trays for holding storage objects are placed,</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">the storage compartment including a plurality of holding zones arranged in a circumferential direction of the container body, where the storage trays are held, and at least one passage zone where the storage trays pass,</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">the holding shelves being configured as parts of a plurality of rack units that are sections arranged in a circumferential direction of the container body.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the invention set forth in claim <b>1</b>, the holding shelves are configured as parts of a plurality of rack units that are sections arranged in a circumferential direction of the container body. Therefore, the opening of the container body need only be large enough to allow each of the rack units to be brought into the storage compartment and can be made smaller. The low-temperature storage container as a whole can be highly insulated this way so that the amount of cooling medium consumption can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the invention set forth in claim <b>2</b>, the rack units include a plurality of beam members extending along side faces of storage trays. This further simplifies the structure of the holding shelves, and enables an operation of lifting up a storage tray placed on a holding shelf from below.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the invention set forth in claim <b>3</b>, the rack units include a wall member disposed to face an inner circumferential surface of the container body, and the beam members extend inwards from the wall member. This allows the holding shelves to be configured simply in conformity with the internal cylindrical shape of the container body.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the invention set forth in claim <b>4</b>, the rack units are configured as sections each corresponding to each of the holding zones, which enables a further reduction of the size of the opening of the container body. The beam members configured to be able to support a side portion along a radial direction of a storage tray in an adjacent holding zone can further simplify the configuration of the holding shelves.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the invention set forth in claim <b>5</b>, the storage compartment is provided with a rotary table capable of holding the rack units placed thereon. When assembling the low-temperature storage container, after a rack unit is brought into the storage compartment through the opening of the container body and placed on the rotary table, the rotary table is rotated. This makes space for setting another rack unit directly below the opening. This way, the assembling of the low-temperature storage container is made easy.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the invention set forth in claim <b>6</b>, the rotary table is rotatably supported on a rotation mechanism that is secured to a bottom part of the storage compartment, and the rotation mechanism is provided with a fixing mechanism that fixedly positions the rotation mechanism on the rotary table. Therefore the rotary table can be fixed in a predetermined position after all the rack units have been set on the rotary table.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the invention set forth in claim <b>7</b>, the rack units include a base plate placed on the rotary table, and the base plate is provided with a fixing mechanism that fixedly positions the rack unit on the rotary table. Therefore the rack units can be stably set in predetermined positions on the rotary table.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the invention set forth in claim <b>8</b>, a coupling member that couples the rack units adjoining each other is provided. Therefore the rack units can each be fixed to predetermined positions relative to each other, which facilitates the assembling of the low-temperature storage container.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating an outer appearance of a low-temperature storage container according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view cut along an axial direction of the container body of the low-temperature storage container shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view cut along a plane perpendicular to the axial direction of the container body of the low-temperature storage container shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating the configuration of an internal part of the container body of the low-temperature storage container shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a plan view illustrating a support substrate in a rack unit to a larger scale;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an illustrative view showing a fixing mechanism that fixedly positions a rack unit on a rotary table;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a plan view illustrating a beam member, a support part, and an auxiliary support part in a rack unit to a larger scale;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a plan view illustrating a beam member, a support part, and an auxiliary support part in a rack unit adjacent to a passage zone to a larger scale;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a perspective view showing a fixing mechanism that fixedly positions the rotary table on a rotation mechanism;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an illustrative view showing guide rollers provided to the rotary table;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating the structure of the rotation mechanism; and</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>E</figref> are illustrative views illustrating steps of assembling the low-temperature storage container according to the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A low-temperature storage container according to one embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating an outer appearance of a low-temperature storage container according to the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view cut along an axial direction of the container body of the low-temperature storage container shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view cut along a plane perpendicular to the axial direction of the container body of the low-temperature storage container shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating the configuration of an internal part of the container body of the low-temperature storage container shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.
