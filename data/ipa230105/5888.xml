For example, a painting or a pot itself does not emit light. Thus, in an art museum or the like, the illumination at a time of appreciating an article on exhibition is as important in meaning as the article itself. The reason for this is that a person who appreciates the article on exhibition observes that portion of the visible light radiated from an illumination light source that is reflected by the surface of the article. Even if an artist expresses very beautiful colors, unless the light from the light source that is irradiated on the article on exhibition includes emission light components corresponding to specific colors, the person appreciating the article can only observe the article with tonality which is dark and poor in color sensation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The most desirable light source for this purpose of illumination is sunlight. As sunlight is composed of consecutive wavelength components of light, the sunlight includes, substantially equally, all light components of visible light wavelengths from 400 nm to 780 nm, and can reproduce all colors existing in nature as original colors inherent to substances in nature. However, no matter how excellent the sunlight is as the light source, precious works of art, such as paintings, are not appreciated in an outdoor bright space, while such works of art are directly exposed to sunlight. The reason why the works of art are stored in a specific place such as an art museum and are appreciated is, in part, because it is necessary to protect them from accidents such as by the weather and sealing. However, a more important reason is that it is necessary to protect the works of art from a great quantity of irradiation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This is because sunlight includes the visible light of all wavelengths, and also includes emission light components other than visible light, such as ultraviolet and infrared. In particular, since ultraviolet is stronger in energy than visible light, direct exposure to sunlight promotes fading and embrittlement of historic paintings, etc. Thus, an artificial light source is needed. However, the artificial light source is required to be able to reproduce sunlight as correctly as possible, in addition to having such convenient features of artificial light that the amount of light is adjustable and the amount of ultraviolet is reduced as much as possible.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, in recent years, as an artificial light source, attention has been paid to a light source using an LED (light-emitting diode) from the standpoint of energy saving and reduction in emission of carbon dioxide. Compared to a conventional incandescent bulb using a tungsten filament, the LED has a long lifetime and can achieve energy saving. Because of the convenience of the LED, LED illumination is rapidly gaining in popularity in the market. In many types of LED illumination in the early stage, white light was obtained by combining a blue light emitting LED and a yellow light emitting phosphor, and only unnatural white which lacks in warmth could be reproduced. However, with remarkable enhancement in performance in step with the increasing popularity of LED products in the market, various improvements have been made to combinations of LEDs and phosphors. As a result, some white light sources that can reproduce sunlight have been developed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent document 1 discloses an invention relating to a white light source having the same light emission spectrum as sunlight. Sunlights with different color temperatures are reproduced with blackbody radiation spectra of the same color temperatures. In this invention, a white light source can be obtained which reproduces light close to sunlight of various color temperatures which vary with time, not only with respect to apparent white light but also with respect to the spectrum shape. Patent document 2 discloses an invention relating to an illumination system using a white light source, and relates to office illumination or the like, with the object of illumination being mainly a human or the like. This system can adjust color temperature or illuminance of indoor light, while detecting a variation of outdoor light. White light illumination corresponding to variations due to physiological phenomena of humans and seasons can be obtained. In addition, patent document 3 discloses an invention relating to an artificial sunlight system in which a plural of light-emitting diode modules with different color temperatures are combined. This system can reproduce variations of color temperatures of sunlight which is radiated on places of different latitudes and longitudes on the earth.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">Patent document 1: PCT International Publication No. 2012/144087</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0009">Patent document 2: Jpn.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0055">The object of the present invention is to provide an artificial light source system which is usable for an object that requires the same natural illumination as sunlight, such as an article on exhibition in an art museum or the like, or an inpatient staying for a long time, the system being an illumination system which can reproduce light as close as possible to sunlight, and can successively reproduce even fine differences of sunlight varying from time to time and from place to place.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0056">In recent years, as shown in patent documents 1 to 3, some patent documents have proposed artificial light sources which can reproduce sunlight. Aside from these, many products, whose main attraction is reproduction of sunlight, are on the market. Most of these illumination products aim at providing light sources which emit light close to sunlight of a certain time instant, or aim at providing, even when a variation in sunlight is captured, light close to sunlight by paying attention to an apparent color temperature variation of sunlight. Like patent document 3 among others, there is a concept of controlling the color temperatures and optical characteristic variation data of sunlight due to differences in time and place. In the case of patent document 3, however, as regards optical characteristic variations other than color temperatures, no concrete description is given, nor is any improvement made.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057">However, the variation of sunlight is not limited to the variation due to the color temperature. For example, sunlight also varies due to a radiation rate, purity and turbidity. Subtle variations including these elements in addition to the color temperature are major factors which affect different climates in different regions. For example, assuming that Japan is divided into a Japan Sea side and a Pacific side, there are many cloudy, rainy and snowy days in the Japan Sea-side region. Since the atmosphere contains much floating matter such as moisture vapor and dust, the sunlight becomes gloomy, and the colors of things look turbid. On the other hand, in the Pacific-side region, since there is less moisture vapor, the purity of the atmosphere is high, and things appear in clear colors. Hence, there occur differences in taste of colors among regions, and there is a tendency that the people living on the Japan Sea side favor turbid colors while the people living on the Pacific side favor clear colors.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0058">Works of art, such as paintings, are creations by humans. Accordingly, although the works of art are original works by individuals, it is inevitable that the color expressions, which the works have, are influenced by environments. In the case of a realistic painting, this is a matter of course. Even in the case of an abstract painting, it is possible that the selection itself, such as emphasis on red, emphasis on blue, a liking for clear colors, or a liking for turbid colors, is already influenced by climates, etc. Even if such selection is purely based on personal sensitivity, the influence is inevitable as long as the color expression of the created work is discerned by reflected light from a light source. Specifically, even if the creator deliberately emphasized red, it is natural that the degree of emphasis is influenced by the amount of the red component of the same wavelength included in the light of the light source.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0059">Accordingly, in art appreciation or the like, in order to understand the real value of the work of art, it is very important to reproduce not only the natural light of the sun, but also the same photoenvironment as when the work was created. In other words, when a work of art is appreciated under the same light as the creator experienced, for example, in the country or region where the work was created, or the season, time, age, weather, etc., in which the work was created, it should first become possible that the work is understandable in the same position as the creator.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0060">The white light source of the present invention basically reproduces sunlight of various color temperatures. Specifically, when sunlight of a specific color temperature is reproduced, a blackbody radiation spectrum having the same color temperature as sunlight is regarded as a spectrum by rays of sunlight. In addition, the shape of the spectrum, too, is approximated. The sun can be thought to be a kind of blackbody. There is a good agreement between a radiation spectral curve of a blackbody and a light emission spectrum curve of sunlight, and it is considered that the spectral distribution of the actual rays of the sun is close to a blackbody radiation spectrum of 5800 K.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0061">However, the actual light emission spectrum of sunlight reaching the earth deviates slightly from the blackbody radiation spectrum. The reason for this is that even if white light radiated from the sun is close to the spectrum of blackbody radiation, the white light passes through a layer of air, moisture vapor and dust before reaching the earth, and light of a specific wavelength is scattered. A macroscopic variation due to scattering of blue light, etc. can be coped with as a variation in color temperature, but it is difficult to artificially reproduce fine irregular waveforms occurring in a specific wavelength region of the light emission spectrum.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0062">However, such fine differences are factors which make differences in climate between regions. The present invention is devised so as to cope with even such fine differences. Specifically, as regards a difference between the spectrum of sunlight reaching the earth and the blackbody radiation spectrum of the same color temperature as the sunlight, the degree of this difference is converted to a deviation from a blackbody locus, and white light of a correlated color temperature having a predetermined deviation is reproduced.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0063">The white light source of the present invention reproduces fine color variations due to differences between regions as described above, and also successively reproduces even the color temperature variations of sunlight which varies from time to time, thus providing very natural sunlight by an artificial light source. In addition, the white light source of this invention greatly reduces, compared to conventional artificial light sources, light emission components of ultraviolet and blue light, which are regarded as being harmful to paintings and human bodies. The merits of sunlight are adopted in all senses, and natural white light is provided.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0064">According to the embodiments, the following inventions can be provided.</p><p

Besides, when the white light source is used as illumination in a hospital or the like, it is possible to sense, while staying in the hospital, sunlight all day, even including color temperature variations. In particular, since the state of changing is reproduced as a minute difference which is imperceptible to humans, an inpatient, for example, is unable to perceive a moment when the color temperature varies, and thus the illumination is very natural and acceptable to the inpatient. In addition, in this white light source, compared to conventional artificial white light sources, the intensity of a blue emission light component, etc. is greatly reduced, and, needless to say, the illumination is kind to human bodies, etc.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0120">(Light Emission Characteristics of White Light Source)</p><p id="p-0129" num="0121">A white light source of the present invention aims at more accurately reproducing light of the sun. In order to achieve accurate reproduction, it is necessary to exactly grasp light emission spectra of sunlight which varies from time to time, and varies from place to place. Of such variations, a variation due to a difference in latitude or longitude of the earth occurs because the distance of passage of sunlight traveling through the atmosphere on the surface of the earth varies depending on the difference of the incidence angle of the sunlight. Specifically, when sunlight passes through the atmospheric air, the sunlight is scattered by gas molecules, etc. floating in the air, and a difference occurs in the degree of scattering of blue light or the like due to the distance of passage. Such a variation of sunlight can be macroscopically grasped as a difference in color temperature. In this case, light emission spectra of sunlights with different color temperatures can be approximated by blackbody radiation spectra of the corresponding color temperatures. By the equation described below, various light emission spectra with different color temperatures can relatively easily be reproduced. In the equation, h denotes a Planck's constant, k denotes a Boltzmann's constant, c denotes the speed of light, and e denotes a base of natural logarithm, and these values are fixed at constant numerical values.

In this case, various factors of variations are thinkable. To begin with, as regards the influence of light scattering, the scattering relates to not only molecules of air and gas, but also fine particles such as moisture vapor, dust, etc. However, for example, the density of moisture vapor, dust, etc. varies from region to region. As a matter of course, there are large differences between a region near the sea and a region near the desert. Furthermore, the influence of reflection, as well as scattering, is not negligible. Specifically, the light, which humans perceive as sunlight, includes not only direct light falling from the sun, but also light which is reflected after reaching the earth. It is natural that there are differences of light components included in the reflected light between a region near the sea, a region near a forest, and a densely built-up urban area. In this manner, the variations of sunlight due to regional differences are a complex mixture of many factors, and there is no general regularity. It is necessary to understand that the variations of sunlight due to regional differences are based on factors inherent to regions.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0123">In the present invention, in order to reproduce such variations of sunlight, the light emission spectra of sunlight, which vary from region to region and from time to time, are actually measured, and as much as possible data is collected, stored and utilized. Thereby, the variations of sunlight are reproduced. Concretely, the light emission spectra of sunlight are measured in major regions around the world, and one-day variations from hour to hour, and yearly variations from season to season are accumulated as data. In the present invention, the accumulated data, in principle, relates to clear days, and no consideration is given to the influences of clouds, rain, snow, etc.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of a light emission spectrum of sunlight in the daytime (12:00 p.m.) in winter (December 16) in Milan, Italy. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example of a light emission spectrum of sunlight in the evening (17:00 p.m.) in spring (May 27) in Tokyo.

Sunlight was directly taken in the spectral distribution measuring device, and light emission spectra were measured. The wavelength range for measurement was set to 360 nm to 780 nm, which covers the visible light range. As regards the adjustment of light intensity that is taken in the spectral distribution measuring device, by an exposure time adjustment function which is incorporated in the measuring device, it was confirmed that no saturation phenomenon occurred even in a wavelength region with high light emission intensity. As regards the measurement result, light intensity for each wavelength was calculated from electronic data. Based on this result, CIE chromaticity coordinate values, correlated color temperatures and deviations were calculated. CIE is the acronym of the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0126">Each of the light emission spectra is formed of an irregular curve. If the curves are smoothed, the curves can be approximated to the shape of a blackbody radiation spectrum of an arbitrary color temperature. If the two Figures are compared, since the positions of irregularities in the spectrum curves overlap, it is understood that the irregularities are based not on noise or the like, but on factors inherent to specific floating matter, etc. In particular, portions indicative of characteristic irregularities are present in long wavelength regions, and the degree of irregularities is large. It is thus presumed that the spectrum shape of these wavelength regions is one of factors which cause regional differences or the like.

However, when the spectral data of sunlight in respective regions and at respective times were compared and evaluated, and the tendency as a whole was confirmed, it turned out that, as a matter of course, the light emission color indicates a point close to a blackbody locus on the (x, y) chromaticity diagram. Moreover, it turned out that the light emission color does not always completely agree with the point on the blackbody locus, and that almost all data fall within the range of correlated color temperatures with a deviation of &#xb1;0.005 duv on a blackbody locus having color temperatures of from 2000 K to 6500 K.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0128">In the white light source of the present invention, all light emission colors in the above range can be reproduced.

Specifically, by mixing at least two or more of the six kinds of white light sources with any intensities, all light emission colors in the polygonal range can be reproduced. From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, it is understood that the range of this shape covers all the light emission colors on the blackbody locus from 2000 K to 6500 K of color temperatures and the white light region with the deviation from the blackbody locus in the range of &#xb1;0.005 duv. Accordingly, in the white light source of the present invention, it is possible to reproduce not merely white light on the blackbody locus, but also subtle deviations of color temperatures which is vary due to various environmental factors on the earth.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0129">The color reproduction in the range of the specific polygon or the like was described above. However, needless to say, various white lights can be reproduced by setting light emission colors corresponding to the respective vertices of the polygon as white lights of various correlated color temperatures. In addition, in the above-described white light source, six kinds of white light sources were arbitrarily mixed, and the white light emission of the invention was obtained. However, needless to say, sunlights of various color temperatures can be reproduced more finely, by utilizing a greater number of kinds of basic white light sources, for example, eight kinds or ten kinds of white light sources. In particular, this is advantageous when white lights of a wider range of color temperatures are reproduced by a single white light source system. However, if the number of kinds of basic light sources is excessively large, the design of the system becomes complex. If at least four kinds of light sources are used, the advantageous effects of the present invention can, at least, be exhibited. Besides, the range of color temperatures of white light to be reproduced is 2000 K to 6500 K.

Accordingly, when at least two or more kinds of white light sources of the above-described four or more kinds of white light sources are combined, and white light of any color temperature on the blackbody locus or white light of any correlated color temperature close to the blackbody locus is reproduced, the light emission spectral shape of the mixed white light will be similar to the light emission spectral shape of the blackbody radiation of the corresponding color temperatures.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0131">Concretely, a light emission spectrum of a white light source of the present invention is characterized by satisfying the following expression (3):</p><p id="p-0141" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x2212;0.2&#x2264;[(<i>P</i>(&#x3bb;)&#xd7;<i>V</i>(&#x3bb;))/(<i>P</i>(&#x3bb;max1)&#xd7;<i>V</i>(&#x3bb;max1))&#x2014;(<i>B</i>(&#x3bb;)&#xd7;<i>V</i>(&#x3bb;))/(<i>B</i>(&#x3bb;max2)&#xd7;<i>V</i>(&#x3bb;max2))]&#x2264;+0.2&#x2003;&#x2003;(3)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0142" num="0132">where P(&#x3bb;) is the light emission spectrum of mixed white light emitted from the white light source system; B(&#x3bb;) is the light emission spectrum of blackbody radiation having the same color temperature as that of the white light source; V(&#x3bb;) is the spectrum of a spectral luminous efficiency; &#x3bb;max1 is the wavelength at which P(&#x3bb;)&#xd7;V(&#x3bb;) is largest; and &#x3bb;max2 is the wavelength at which B(&#x3bb;)&#xd7;V(&#x3bb;) is largest.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0133">The (P(&#x3bb;)&#xd7;V(&#x3bb;)) indicates the intensity of the light emission spectrum of the white light source in a spectral luminous efficiency V(&#x3bb;) region.

According to the result which David Lewis MacAdam derived from isochromatic experiments of the sense of sight (&#x201c;Shikisai Kougaku&#x201d; [Color Engineering], 2nd ed., Tokyo Denki University Press), it was found that if the standard deviation of discernment variations for a central color is expressed on the xy chromaticity diagram, this standard deviation is expressed in a range of a shape called &#x201c;MacAdam ellipse&#x201d;, and the range of color temperatures which humans can discern is three times the standard deviation. According to this finding, if calculation is made with respect to white light of 5000 K, the value of 330 K (from 4850 K to 5180 K) was obtained as the threshold of discernment. Thus, for example, in the case of white light of 5000 K, a difference between color temperatures of about 330 K or less cannot be discerned by human eyes.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a graph showing a color temperature variation and an illuminance variation of sunlight from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. in a day in spring in Tokyo at latitude 35&#xb0; N. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a graph denoted by reference sign <b>1</b> indicates the color temperature variation, and a graph denoted by reference sign <b>2</b> indicates the illuminance variation. The graphs were created based on the result of actual measurement for every three minutes of the variation with time of sunlight. In the Figure, the illuminance is expressed as an illuminance ratio (%) by relative comparison to a certain value as a reference. In addition, since the one-day color temperature variation of sunlight is a rate of approximately a little less than 200 K per three minutes, the difference in color temperature in every measurement unit in the invention is not perceivable to human eyes. Accordingly, even when the color temperature variation is reproduced by using the measurement data, the moment at which the color temperature of the light source changes cannot be recognized, and the variation can be accepted in a natural manner, as if the color temperature varied continuously.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0139">(LED Module)</p><p id="p-0151" num="0140">The feature of the white light source of the present invention is in the light emission characteristics. The white light source may employ any structural member as long as the white light source can reproduce sunlight. Thus, various light sources are applicable. In order to obtain white lights of various color temperatures, the simplest method is a method of adjusting light emission colors by using phosphors, thus a phosphor-applied product is desirable. In particular, a light source created by combining an LED (light-emitting diode) with phosphor has excellent features, not only in characteristics but also in manufacture and application, and is optimal. In this case, in order to obtain white light, any combinations of various light emission colors of LEDs and various light emission colors of phosphors can be selected.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0141">On the other hand, in order to obtain further preferable white light, it is preferable to use a peak wavelength in a range of an ultraviolet to violet region, to be more specific, a range of 360 to 420 nm. When an LED having a light emission peak wavelength in a range exceeding 420 nm is produced, the LED exhibits a sharp light emission at a specific wavelength. Consequently, the balance between this light emission and the light emission of a phosphor having a generally broad spectral shape becomes poorer, and it may be difficult to satisfy the relations of the above expressions (3) and (4). However, if the light emission color of the LED is in a range of ultraviolet to violet, since the luminosity function is low, the influence on white light is small. In addition, the primary light is not emitted from the light emission device by cutting out the primary light from the LED. Therefore, it becomes easy to satisfy the relations of the above expressions.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0142">In order for the light emission spectrum of the white light source to satisfy the relations of the above expressions (3) and (4), it is preferable to use three or more, or, more preferably, five or more, from among a blue phosphor, a blue-green phosphor, a green phosphor, a yellow phosphor, and a red phosphor, as phosphors to be combined in the LED. By arbitrarily mixing these phosphors in accordance with a corresponding blackbody radiation spectrum, white light emission having an arbitrary color temperature or an arbitrary deviation can be obtained. It is preferable to use a phosphor which is excited by an LED having a light emission peak wavelength of 350 to 420 nm, and exhibits a light emission peak in a range of 420 to 700 nm. In addition, it is preferable that the peak wavelengths of the respective phosphors deviate by 150 nm or less, or more preferably, by 10 to 100 nm, or still more preferably, by 10 to 50 nm. In other words, it is preferable that the distance between a certain peak wavelength and a neighboring peak wavelength is 150 nm or less, or more preferably 10 to 100 nm, or still more preferably 10 to 50 nm. It is preferable that the light emission spectra of at least two kinds of phosphors constituting the mixture of phosphors satisfy this relationship. In addition, the half-value width of the light emission spectrum of at least one kind of phosphor constituting the mixture of phosphors is as wide as 50 nm or more, and more preferably 50 to 100 nm. By using the phosphors which satisfy these conditions, the light emission spectrum of each phosphor tends to more easily overlap the light emission spectra of other phosphors. The larger the overlapping area between the light emission spectra, the easier it is to obtain the characteristics of a spectral curve of the obtained mixed white light, and the spectral curve will show less irregularity, be smoother, and be closer to the spectrum of blackbody radiation.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0143">Besides, by using plural phosphors with overlapping light emission spectra, it is possible to suppress a variation in light emission color upon long-time continuous lighting. Among the phosphors used in the present invention, there exists a phosphor having a wide absorption band. Such a phosphor can be not only excited by ultraviolet or violet light, but can also be simultaneously excited by blue light or green light and can emit green light or red light. If a plural of such phosphors with overlapping light emission spectra are used, re-absorption or to double excitation tends to more easily occur, which means that it is easier to suppress any variation in light emission color. For example, a green phosphor is not only excited by ultraviolet or violet light emitted from the LED and emits green light, but also the green phosphor absorbs light of a blue phosphor which is excited by the LED and emits blue light, and can emit green light. Specifically, the green phosphor can emit light by double excitation by the LED and blue phosphor. In general, in an artificial white light source, white light is obtained by mixing, within the device, emission lights of a plural of phosphors such as red, green and blue phosphors. When this white light source is continuously turned on, the brightness of phosphors, in usual cases, gradually decreases with time. Therefore, if the brightnesses of the respective phosphors equally vary with time, the chromaticity of the obtained white light is unchanged. However, of a plural of kinds of phosphors, if the luminance degradation rate of a certain kind of phosphor is different from the luminance degradation rates of some other phosphors, excess or deficiency of light emission of a certain component occurs in the obtained white light, and a change occurs in the obtained light emission color. However, if mutual absorption or double excitation occurs as in the present invention, the degradation rates are averaged between the phosphors, and it is possible to suppress degradation of only a certain phosphor. As a result, the chromaticity variation of the obtained white light decreases.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0144">In the meantime, as regards a phosphor, what wavelength causes excitation of the phosphor and what wavelength causes light emission of the phosphor can easily be confirmed by measuring the excitation spectrum or light emission spectrum of the phosphor. Accordingly, if light emission spectrum characteristics are measured in advance and then a combination of phosphors to be used is selected, the chromaticity variation during continuous lighting can be reduced as much as possible. By utilizing the above advantageous effects, the white light source system of the present invention can reduce the magnitude of the chromaticity variation between the initial time of lighting of the white light source and the time after continuous lighting of 6000 hours to 0.010 or less with use of the CIE chromaticity diagram. In the method of measuring the magnitude of the chromaticity variation, chromaticity coordinates u&#x2032; and v&#x2032; at the initial time of lighting of the white light source and at the time after continuous lighting of 6000 hours are measured, respectively, according to JIS-Z-8518. Differences &#x394;u&#x2032; and &#x394;v&#x2032; between the chromaticity coordinates at this time are calculated, and the magnitude of the chromaticity variation=[(&#x394;u&#x2032;)2+(&#x394;v&#x2032;)2]&#xbd; is calculated. In the white light source system of the present invention, the magnitude of this chromaticity variation can be decreased to as small as less than 0.010, and, furthermore, to less than 0.009. That the magnitude of chromaticity variation is less than 0.010 refers to the state in which there is no substantial change of color from the initial time of lighting even in the case of long-time use. Thus, sunlight can be reproduced for a long time.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0145">Concrete phosphors, which are usable in the white light source system of the present invention, are as follows.

When a light source of white light emission is constituted by combining the above two kinds of phosphors with a violet LED and a blue phosphor, the blue phosphor is excited by the LED, the green phosphor is excited by the LED and blue phosphor, the red phosphor is excited by the LED, blue phosphor and green phosphor, and re-absorption and multiple excitation occur between the phosphors. In this light source, even if a large luminance degradation occurs in the blue phosphor due to a variation with time, the luminance variation of blue light also affects the luminance of the green phosphor and red phosphor, and the luminance variation as a whole is averaged.

The periphery of the LED chip is directly or indirectly covered with the phosphor layer. Thereby, primary light, which is emitted from the LED, is converted to secondary light (white light) by the phosphor layer, and the secondary light is radiated to the outside.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0149">(Light Emission Characteristics of LED Module)</p><p id="p-0162" num="0150">By using the above-described combination of the LED and phosphors, the white light source of the present invention can exhibit a light emission spectral distribution which is substantially equal to the light emission spectral distribution of sunlight. Accordingly, when the white light source of the present invention is used for illumination, high color rendering properties, which are equal to those of sunlight, can be exhibited, and an average color rendering index Ra can be set to 95 or more. Moreover, not only the mean value, but also all of the color rendering indexes R1 to R8 and special color rendering indexes R9 to R15 can be set to 85 or more.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0151">Furthermore, according to a more preferable white light source of the present invention, it is possible to set the average color rendering index Ra to 97 or more, and set all of the color rendering indexes R1 to R8 and special color rendering indexes R9 to R15 to 90 or more.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0152">Besides, when the white light source of the present invention is utilized not as illumination for inorganic objects such as works of art, but as illumination for human bodies, it is possible to realize illumination which is kind to human bodies as if it were sunlight. Along with the recent popularity of LED illumination, attention has been paid to the problems of blue light hazards. In regard to such problems, there is a concern over the various hazards to human bodies. For example, since the intensity of a blue light component included in the white emission light is excessively high, use over a long time leads to eye fatigue. Moreover, excessive exposure to LED white light at night leads to a disturbance of the human circadian rhythm. As regards conventional LED white light, white light is obtained by combining a blue LED with a yellow phosphor or the like, and this is considered to be a factor related to the above hazards. A phosphor generally exhibits a broad light emission spectrum, while a blue LED has an excessively sharp spectrum shape having a peak at a specific blue wavelength. Thus, if both are combined, only an unnatural white light emission spectral distribution with a spike of a blue wavelength region can be obtained. On the other hand, as described above, the light emission spectral distribution of the white light source of the present invention does not have an unnatural spike portion in the blue wavelength region, and the light emission spectrum of sunlight, including the blue wavelength region, can be reproduced. Therefore, the white light source of the present invention can be utilized as an illumination light source kind to human bodies, which does not cause blue light hazards, etc.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0153">Even if blue light has a possibility of being harmful to human bodies, a blue component of a fixed intensity needs to be included in white light, in order to obtain white illumination of high color rendering. If the object is to merely obtain white light with a small blue component, it should suffice to select a white light source with a low color temperature. The reason for this is that as the color temperature becomes lower, a relative content of a red component or the like included in the white light increases and a relative content of blue light or the like decreases. However, the object of the white light source of the present invention is to reproduce sunlight of all color temperatures. Accordingly, such reproduction cannot be restricted to only reproduction of a specific color temperature in consideration of the hazardous property to human bodies. Thus, in the present invention, a P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value, which will be described below, is adopted as an index which characterizes the properties of the white light source of the present invention, the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value serving as the criterion for satisfying, at the same time, both the color rendering property for the purpose of use as illumination and the safety to human bodies.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0154">Assuming that the light emission spectrum of the white light source of the present invention is P(&#x3bb;), the light emission spectrum of blackbody radiation of the corresponding correlated color temperature is B(&#x3bb;), and the spectrum of the spectral luminous efficiency is V(&#x3bb;), when these satisfy the following equation (1),</p><p id="p-0167" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00006" num="00006"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <msubsup>       <mo>&#x222b;</mo>       <mn>380</mn>       <mn>780</mn>      </msubsup>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <mi>P</mi>        <mo>&#x2061;</mo>        <mo>(</mo>        <mi>&#x3bb;</mi>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mrow>        <mi>V</mi>        <mo>&#x2061;</mo>        <mo>(</mo>        <mi>&#x3bb;</mi>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>d</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>&#x3bb;</mi>      </mrow>     </mrow>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <msubsup>       <mo>&#x222b;</mo>       <mn>380</mn>       <mn>780</mn>      </msubsup>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <mi>B</mi>        <mo>&#x2061;</mo>        <mo>(</mo>        <mi>&#x3bb;</mi>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mrow>        <mi>V</mi>        <mo>&#x2061;</mo>        <mo>(</mo>        <mi>&#x3bb;</mi>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>d</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>&#x3bb;</mi>      </mrow>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mn>1</mn>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0168" num="0155">the light emission spectrum of the white light source of the invention can satisfy, in a wavelength range of 400 nm to 495 nm, a relational expression:</p><p id="p-0169" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P</i>(&#x3bb;)/<i>B</i>(&#x3bb;)&#x2264;1.8&#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0170" num="0156">Accordingly, in the wavelength range of 400 nm to 495 nm, even if there is a wavelength region in which the intensity of P(&#x3bb;) exceeds the intensity of B(&#x3bb;), the intensity ratio ((P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;)) between both in this wavelength region never exceeds 1.8 at maximum.

When sunlight is reproduced, it is preferable that the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value indicates a value close to 1. The reason for this is that if light of wavelengths of 495 nm or less is deficient, the color of an illumination target cannot be reproduced as a natural color. However, as described above, the white light source of this invention is a light source which can exhibit fixed values or more of the average color rendering index and special color rendering indexes. In addition, as indicated by the above expressions (3) and (4), the white light source of this invention has the feature that approximation is made to the light emission spectrum of blackbody radiation over the entire visible light wavelength range. Accordingly, even if the lower limit value of the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value is not particularly set, the substantial characteristics required for the white light source of the present invention are satisfied. The P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value of the white light source indicates the ratio of a blue light component which is excessively included, compared to the light emission spectrum of blackbody radiation of the same color temperature. From the standpoint of the degree of influence on human bodies, the upper limit value of the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value is particularly important.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0159">In the white light source of this invention, white light emission is obtained by the combination of phosphor light emissions. It is preferable that as much energy of primary light as possible from the LED is absorbed in the phosphor. At the same time, it is necessary to prevent LED light from leaking to the outside of the light source. In particular, when ultraviolet is included in the LED light, it is possible that the body color of a work of art or the like is damaged, or a harmful effect is exerted on the skin or the like of the human body. Thus, the prevention of leakage is strongly required.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0160">In the LED module of this invention, in order to prevent leakage of ultraviolet, a phosphor layer is formed to have a sufficient film thickness. The phosphor layer is formed as a thick film, in order to prevent LED light, which is reflected by the surface of each phosphor particle, from leaking to the outside of the light source through the phosphor layer. At this time, if the thickness of the phosphor layer is too large, the emission light itself of the phosphor cannot exit from the phosphor layer, and the light emission intensity of the phosphor layer lowers. It is generally known that the particle size of a phosphor and the optimal film thickness have a proportional relationship. In the phosphor layer of this invention, a phosphor, whose particles are as large as possible in practical use, is used, and the phosphor layer is formed as thick as possible. For this purpose, it is preferable that the phosphor used in the LED module of this invention has an average particle size in a range of 5 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m. A more preferable range of the average particle size is 10 &#x3bc;m to 40 &#x3bc;m. It is preferable that the thickness of the phosphor layer corresponding to this average particle size is in a range of 0.07 mm to 1.5 mm. A more preferable range is 100 &#x3bc;m to 1000 &#x3bc;m. In addition, it is preferable that the content of the phosphor in the phosphor layer is set such that the mass ratio of the phosphor in the phosphor layer is in a range of 60 mass % to 90 mass %. When the phosphor content is less than 60 mass %, there is concern that even if the phosphor layer is made thick, the phosphor content in the phosphor layer becomes deficient. If the phosphor content is deficient, part of LED light passes through a gap between phosphor particles and leaks out of the white light source. On the other hand, if the phosphor content is too large, no problem arises with respect to the leakage of LED light, but the amount of the binder, which binds phosphor particles, is too small, and a problem arises with respect to the physical strength of the phosphor layer. In the above manner, an LED module can be obtained which suppresses leakage of ultraviolet to 0.4 mW/lm or less, and which avoids a reduction in light emission of the phosphor layer to the extent possible.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0161">In order to make it doubly sure to prevent ultraviolet leakage, an ultraviolet absorption film may be formed on the outside of the phosphor layer. In this case, as an ultraviolet absorption/reflection material, use can be made of fine particle white pigments such as zinc oxide, titanium oxide, aluminum oxide, etc. Like the phosphor layer, these fine particle pigments are dispersed in a resin, and an ultraviolet absorption film is formed directly or indirectly on the outside of the phosphor layer.

In this case, as absorption materials of violet light or blue light, fine particle pigments of zirconium oxide or silicon oxide can be used. Like the phosphor layer, these fine particle pigments are dispersed in a resin, and an absorption film is formed directly or indirectly on the outside of the phosphor layer. Thereby, the LED module of the objective can be obtained.

The LED module includes a substrate, an LED chip disposed on the substrate, and a phosphor layer formed in a manner to cover the periphery of the LED chip.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0171">It is preferable that a material, such as alumina, aluminum nitride, silicon nitride or glass epoxy, is used for the substrate. In particular, it is more preferable to select an alumina substrate or a glass epoxy substrate, judging comprehensively from the standpoints of heat conductivity, resistance to ultraviolet to violet light, insulation, reflectance, cost, etc. It is possible to use one kind or two or more kinds of materials which constitute the substrate.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0172">As the material of the LED, any material may be used provided the material emits ultraviolet to violet light.

It is preferable that the LED chips <b>52</b> are arranged with a highest possible density. However, if the distances between the LED chips <b>52</b> are too short, mutual absorption of LED emission light occurs between the LED chips <b>52</b>, and this is undesirable. In addition, in order to promote the radiation of heat generated by the LED chips <b>52</b> at a time of continuous lighting, it is preferable to arrange the LED chips <b>52</b> at proper intervals. In the meantime, the arrangement of the chips is not limited to the linear arrangement.

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>, a phosphor layer <b>55</b> may be directly formed on the surface of the LED chip <b>52</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, after the periphery of the LED chip <b>52</b> is covered with the phosphor layer <b>55</b>, the periphery of the phosphor layer may be covered with a transparent resin layer <b>56</b>. In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, after the surface of the LED chip <b>52</b> is covered with the transparent resin layer <b>56</b>, a substantially entire surface of the transparent resin layer <b>56</b> may be covered with the phosphor layer <b>55</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, a plural of LED chips <b>52</b> are covered with a single phosphor layer <b>55</b> or transparent resin layer <b>56</b>. Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>, a single LED chip <b>52</b> may be coated with a single phosphor layer <b>55</b> or single transparent resin layer <b>56</b>. Besides, as one of applied examples, such a multilayer structure may be adopted that the periphery of a single or plural LED chips are covered with a transparent resin layer, a phosphor layer is formed on the outside of the transparent resin layer, and an additional transparent resin layer is formed on the outside of the phosphor layer.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0177">In the above-described various film structures, the</p><p id="p-0195" num="0178">purpose of forming the transparent resin layer is to average light emission intensities. When a plural of LED chips are arranged in a certain pattern, both a location where LED chips exist and a location where no LED chip exists are present on the substrate. If the peripheries of the LED chips of such a pattern are covered with a phosphor layer, the light emission intensity is high in the part where the LED chips exist, and the light emission intensity is low in the part where no LED chip exists. Thus, a uniform light emission over the entire surface of the phosphor layer cannot be obtained. At this time, if a transparent resin layer is formed on the inner surface or outer surface of the phosphor layer, it becomes easier to obtain uniform light over the entire layer. The reason for this is that if the transparent resin layer is formed on the inner surface of the phosphor layer, primary light from the LEDs is scattered in the transparent resin layer. On the other hand, if the transparent resin layer is formed on the outer surface of the phosphor layer, secondary light from the phosphor is scattered in the transparent resin layer. Aside from the case in which the number of LED chips is plural, even in the case in which the number of LED chips is one, the same advantageous effects can be obtained. Although a general shape of the LED chip is rectangular parallelepipedic, the light emission intensities of light emitted from the respective planes of the rectangular parallelepiped are not equal, and a light intensity distribution occurs depending on directions of emission. Accordingly, if the transparent resin layer is formed on the inner surface or outer surface of the phosphor layer which covers the periphery of the LED chip, the light emission intensity can be averaged, like the case in which the number of LED chips is plural.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0179">As described above, the averaging of light emission intensity is obtained by the light scattering effect in the transparent resin layer. A greater scattering effect is exhibited by using, instead of a simple transparent resin layer, a resin layer in which particulate inorganic compound powder is contained. Examples of the inorganic material powder, which is contained in the resin layer, include silica powder such as fumed silica (dry silica) or precipitated silica (wet silica), alumina powder such as fumed alumina or pulverized alumina, and metal oxide powder such as cerium oxide powder, zirconium oxide powder, titanium oxide powder or barium titanate powder. One kind or two or more kinds of inorganic materials can be used. Of these inorganic materials, the silica powder and alumina powder are preferable as an inorganic compound powder to be contained in the transparent resin layer, since the silica powder and alumina powder are inexpensive and can easily be made into fine particles. In particular, fumed silica and fumed alumina are suitable since spherical ultra-fine particles can easily be obtained.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0180">In addition, it is preferable that the maximum particle size of the inorganic material powder is &#xbc; or less of the wavelength of light passing through the transparent resin layer. If the inorganic compound powder having the maximum particle size of &#xbc; or less of the wavelength of light is used, the passing light is properly scattered, the intensity of light emitted from the light source is averaged, and the light distribution can be improved. When the maximum particle size exceeds &#xbc; of the wavelength of light, it is highly probable that the light emitted from the LED or phosphor is reflected by fine particles of the inorganic material, and is returned to the inside of the light source (the LED chip side). The lower limit value of the maximum particle size of the inorganic material powder is not particularly limited from the aspect of the scattering effect. However, it is difficult to obtain extremely fine particles from the industrial aspect. Besides, from the aspect of handling of powder, the lower limit value of the maximum particle size should preferably be greater than several nm, and more preferably be several-ten nm or more.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0181">A concrete maximum particle size of the inorganic material powder is 140 nm or less for yellow light of 560 nm, and is 105 nm or less for violet light of 420 nm. The minimum wavelength of passing light is ultraviolet in a case of using an LED having a light emission peak at 360 nm. If inorganic material powder having the maximum particle size of 90 nm is used, this inorganic material powder is adaptive to transparent resin layers in all cases.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0182">It is preferable that the above-described inorganic compound powder is contained in the transparent resin layer in a range of 0.1 to 5 mass %. If the content of inorganic compound powder in the transparent resin layer is less than 0.1 mass %, there is concern that the light scattering effect by the inorganic compound powder cannot fully be obtained. On the other hand, if the content of inorganic compound powder in the transparent resin layer exceeds 5 mass %, multiple scattering of light, or the like tends to easily occur, and there is concern that the amount of light extracted to the outside of the light source decreases. It is more preferable that the content of inorganic compound powder in the transparent resin layer is 1 mass % or more.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0183">The phosphor layer may contain a transparent resin material. On the other hand, the transparent resin layer may mainly consist of a transparent resin material, but may contain some other component such as a phosphor or inorganic material powder. Any kind of such transparent resin material may be used if the material has sufficient strength, heat resistance and transparency. Concretely, it is preferable to use silicone resin, epoxy resin, etc. In particular, like the present invention, when the transparent resin layer is used in combination with the LED of ultraviolet emission, it is more preferable to use silicone resin which is excellent in characteristic of resistance to degradation due to ultraviolet.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0184">When the silicone resin is used as the transparent resin material, it is preferable to use, for the substrate material, an alumina substrate having a water absorption coefficient in a range of 5 to 60%. By using the alumina substrate having a proper water absorption coefficient, the strength of adhesion to the silicone resin-containing layer (e.g., silicone resin-containing transparent resin layer and silicone resin-containing phosphor layer) is improved. Specifically, the adhesion strength between the alumina substrate and silicone resin-containing layer can be set at 1 N (100 gf) or more. It is assumed that the water absorption coefficient of the alumina substrate indicates a value measured by a water absorption coefficient evaluation method disclosed in EMAS-9101. It is assumed that the adhesion strength between the alumina substrate and the silicone resin-containing layer indicates a pushing force at a time when the silicone resin-containing layer (phosphor layer) was pushed from the side surface thereof by a tension gauge, and the silicone resin-containing layer (phosphor layer) was peeled.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0185">According to the alumina substrate having the water absorption coefficient of 5% or more, since silicone resin is properly permeated therein, the strength of adhesion to the silicone resin-containing layer can be enhanced. When the water absorption coefficient of the alumina substrate is less than 5%, the permeation of silicone resin is weak, and a sufficient adhesion strength cannot be obtained. However, if the water absorption coefficient of the alumina substrate exceeds 60%, the silicone resin is excessively permeated, and it becomes difficult to form the silicone resin-containing layer (phosphor layer) in a predetermined shape. It is more preferable that the water absorption coefficient of the alumina substrate is in a range of 20 to 50%.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0186">The water absorption coefficient of the alumina substrate can be adjusted, for example, by varying the firing temperature at a time of baking the substrate. Concretely, in accordance with the material for forming the alumina substrate, etc., the temperature at a time of baking the substrate is properly adjusted in a range of 1100 to 1500&#xb0; C. Thereby, the alumina substrate having a proper water absorption coefficient (in a range of 5 to 60%) can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0187">By using the above-described alumina substrate, the adhesion strength between the alumina substrate and the silicone resin-containing layer can be set at 1 N or more. The same applies to the case in which a transparent silicone resin-containing layer is interposed between the LED chip and phosphor layer, and the adhesion strength between the alumina substrate and the transparent silicone resin-containing layer can be set at 1 N or more. In this manner, by setting the adhesion strength between the alumina substrate and the silicone resin-containing layer or transparent silicone resin-containing layer at 1 N or more, the handling efficiency of the LED module is enhanced. Specifically, the peeling of the silicone resin-containing layer at a time of handling is suppressed. Therefore, a failure in lighting or damage due to the peeling of the silicone resin-containing layer can be suppressed, while good reproducibility is obtained.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0205" num="0188">Hereinafter, methods of successively reproducing the variations of sunlight and methods of reducing ultraviolet and blue light components, which are included in white light to be reproduced, will be concretely described.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 1</heading><p id="p-0206" num="0189">To begin with, six kinds of white light sources were formed by combining four kinds of phosphors, namely a blue phosphor, a green phosphor, a yellow phosphor and a red phosphor, and an LED.

Powder with an average particle size of 25 to 35 &#x3bc;m was used for each phosphor, and a slurry in which the powder was dispersed in a silicone resin was applied to the periphery of an LED chip. Thereby, an LED module was formed. The thickness of the phosphor layer was adjusted in a range of 500 to 700 &#x3bc;m, and the density of the phosphor powder in the phosphor layer was adjusted in a range of 70 to 80 mass %. In addition, a GaN-based LED having a light emission peak at 410 nm was used as the LED. A reflector, a lens and a cover were attached to this LED module, and electronic circuit was connected to the LED module.

In general, the LED has a light emission spectrum having a sharp shape at a light emission peak wavelength, and the phosphor has a broad light emission spectrum. Thus, the whole spectrum shape tends to become unnatural, with a spike of light emission of the LED. However, the light emission peak of the LED used in Example 1 exists not in the blue region but in the violet region. Blue light is not conspicuous, and most of violet light emitted from the LED is absorbed by the phosphor. Thus, the amount of LED light leaking to the outside of the module is small. Therefore, the white light source of the present invention can be configured as a white light source which is kind to human bodies, with no fear of blue light hazards, etc.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0196">As regards the white light sources of the present invention, in order to quantitatively evaluate the above advantageous effects, the value of P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) of each white light source was obtained by calculation. If the light source C is taken as an example, the calculation method of the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value is as follows. To begin with, the light emission spectral distribution of the light source C is measured by using a spectral distribution measuring device. Various kinds of devices have recently been commercially available as the spectral distribution measuring device. If there is no problem with precision, the type of device does not need to be particularly restricted. A concrete shape of the light emission spectrum is as shown by the curve 8 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, as already described, and this emission spectrum is set as P(&#x3bb;). If a light emission color temperature point on the xy chromaticity diagram is calculated by using the light emission spectral distribution data of this P(&#x3bb;), it is understood that the light source C is a white light source of a correlated color temperature of 2990 K&#x2212;0.004 duv. Accordingly, the light emission spectrum B(&#x3bb;) of the corresponding blackbody has the color temperature of 2990 K. Hence, by substituting 2990 K for the color temperature (T) in the above equation (6), the concrete spectrum shape can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0197">By comparing the light emission intensities of the obtained P(&#x3bb;) and B(&#x3bb;), the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value can be calculated. However, if the obtained light emission spectral distributions are compared as such, the result will vary in any way, depending on the method of calculation. Thus, by setting a condition under which the total energy of both becomes an identical value, the P(&#x3bb;) and B(&#x3bb;) which satisfy this condition were calculated, and then both were compared. The concrete condition is that the following equation (1) is satisfied:</p><p id="p-0219" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00007" num="00007"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <msubsup>       <mo>&#x222b;</mo>       <mn>380</mn>       <mn>780</mn>      </msubsup>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <mi>P</mi>        <mo>&#x2061;</mo>        <mo>(</mo>        <mi>&#x3bb;</mi>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mrow>        <mi>V</mi>        <mo>&#x2061;</mo>        <mo>(</mo>        <mi>&#x3bb;</mi>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>d</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>&#x3bb;</mi>      </mrow>     </mrow>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <msubsup>       <mo>&#x222b;</mo>       <mn>380</mn>       <mn>780</mn>      </msubsup>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <mi>B</mi>        <mo>&#x2061;</mo>        <mo>(</mo>        <mi>&#x3bb;</mi>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mrow>        <mi>V</mi>        <mo>&#x2061;</mo>        <mo>(</mo>        <mi>&#x3bb;</mi>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>d</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>&#x3bb;</mi>      </mrow>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mn>1</mn>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0220" num="0198">In the equation, V(&#x3bb;) is the spectral distribution of the spectral luminous efficiency, and each spectral distribution of the P(&#x3bb;) and B(&#x3bb;) which satisfy the above equation (1) was obtained by calculation.

When the LED primary lights leaking from the light sources of the Example were calculated by using the above equations (7) and (8), the LED primary lights were all 0.1 mW/lm, and were very weak. Accordingly, when the white light sources of Example 1 were used as illumination for works of art or the like, the pigments or the like used in the works of art were not deteriorated. When the white light sources of Example 1 were used as illumination for human bodies, the skin or eyes of human bodies were not damaged, and suitable illumination for these purposes was successfully obtained.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0205">In the above, the various characteristics of the white light sources of Example 1 were described.

Using the light emission spectrum data of sunlight measured every three minutes, the values of respective correlated color temperatures were calculated, and sunlight was reproduced by determining the mixture ratio of the light source 1 to light source 6 such that predetermined correlated color temperatures can be obtained. In addition, based on the actual measurement data, the variation of illuminance was plotted as an illuminance ratio (%), by calculating relative values with reference to a certain value.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0206">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, a curve 15 indicates the variation of the correlated color temperature, and a curve 16 indicates an illuminance variation.

On the other hand, as regards the color temperature, the sun in crimson of about 2200 K appeared at sunrise, the color temperature increased in accordance with the increase of illuminance, warm white changed to white and to daylight white, and the color temperature reached about 6000 K at maximum at around 12:00 p.m. Thereafter, with the progress reverse to the morning, the color temperature decreases back to 2300 K at around 7:00 p.m., and then the sun set.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0207">In the white light source system of the present invention, the variations with time of the color temperature and illuminance shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> were reproduced by controlling the values of electric currents applied to the white light sources.

Moreover, in the characteristic variation of white illumination, gentle variations, which are not perceptible to human eyes, are reproduced.

A europium activated orthosilicate phosphor having a peak wavelength at 560 nm was used for the phosphor. The average particle size of the phosphor was 7 &#x3bc;m. A phosphor slurry was created by dispersing the phosphor particles in a silicone resin. The slurry was uniformly applied in a manner to cover the LED chip disposed on the substrate. Thereby, the LED module was formed.

As is understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the white light source of Comparative Example 1 has a sharp light emission spectrum shape having a peak in the neighborhood of 450 nm. Compared to the light emission spectrum shape of blackbody radiation, this spectrum shape has an excessive projection portion near 450 nm and has an excessive recess portion before 500 nm, and this light emission spectrum had clearly different characteristics from the blackbody radiation (sunlight). In the meantime, the white light source using the blue LED is characterized by such a conspicuous projection portion. As the color temperature of the white light source becomes lower, this projection portion becomes more conspicuous. Accordingly, although the white light source of Comparative Example 1 was the white light source of the color temperature which is as high as 6338 K, there is a tendency that if the color temperature becomes lower, the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value becomes greater than 1.87.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0215">In this manner, the white color source of Comparative Example 1 apparently exhibited the same white light emission as the present invention, but exhibited characteristics which are poor in redness and have a low color rendering property. When such a white light source is used as illumination for a hospital, since a strong light emission wavelength component is included in the blue region, there is concern about the problem of blue light hazards, etc., and the harmful effect on circadian rhythms of human bodies. Besides, in the white light source of Comparative Example 1, since the blue light emission LED was used as the LED module, little ultraviolet is included in the white light source of Comparative Example 1. However, if an ultraviolet light emission LED is used, it is clear that a great amount of ultraviolet leaks. If the ultraviolet light emission LED is used as illumination for an art museum, there is concern about harmful effects as a matter of course, such as increased fading of paintings. Incidentally, since the light emission characteristics of the white light source of Comparative Example 1 are too greatly different from those of sunlight in every aspect, it is meaningless to reproduce one-day sunlight variations by using the white light source of Comparative Example 1. Thus, a white light source system, which uses such a white light source, was not created.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0244" num="0216">Evaluation experiments were conducted as to how the blue light emission component included in the white light source of the present invention is perceived by human bodies. In the present invention, as regards the intensity of blue light included in the white light source, the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value shown in the above equation (1) is used as a criterion of evaluation. If this numerical value is as close as possible to 1, this value is a most desirable value, judging comprehensively from the aspects of the color rendering property of the illumination light source and the safety to human bodies. On the other hand, from the aspect of safety, it is preferable that this numerical value is as small as possible. Confirmation experiments were conducted as to what values are tolerable as the upper limit value.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0217">In the experiments, white light sources of various P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) values were prepared. The degree of influence on human bodies was examined by determining how much dazzle a person, who views light emitted from the white light source, perceives. Specifically, if the fact that a difference occurs in the degree of perception of dazzle in a human body due to a difference in intensity of blue light can be confirmed, this becomes evidence that the blue light has such influence on human bodies. The problem here is the method used in the experiment. The perception of dazzle by a human, who views the light source, is influenced by the intensity of light from the light source. The light source, which is the object of experiments, is the white light source. Even if dazzle of a certain white light source was specified, it is necessary to make it possible to first confirm that the cause of dazzle is not the overall intensity of the white light or the intensity of a red light emission component or the like, but the cause of dazzle is the intensity of a blue light emission component. Then, it is necessary that a correlation be recognized between the degree of perceived dazzle and the variation in intensity of the blue light component.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0218">In the present invention, the physical characteristics of blue light are utilized as a method for evaluating the degree of influence of blue light upon eyes, by distinguishing this degree of influence from the degree of influence of other visible light. The light emission component of the wavelength range of 400 to 495 nm including blue light has higher energy than the visible light components of other wavelengths. In general, electromagnetic waves having high energy tend to collide with various obstacles while traveling through space and tend to be easily scattered. In short, it is known that blue light is scattered more easily than other visible light components. Thus, of the emission light emitted from the white light source, a blue light emission component is scattered by the influence of floating matter such as gas molecules and dust in the air, and, at the same time, the blue light reaching the inside of the eye strongly undergoes the influence of scattering while traveling through the crystal lens. On the other hand, vision cells of the retina, which the blue light reaches after passing through the crystal lens, are composed of cones, which are mainly located in a central part of the retina and which normally perceive a bright image, and rods, which are mainly located in a peripheral part of the retina and which perceive a dark image. Thus, scattered blue light reaches rods which normally sense a dark image. If bright scattered light that is not normally sensed by the rods reach the rods, the sphincter muscle of the pupil excessively contracts, and a human strongly senses dazzle.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0219">Due to the above phenomenon, when a human senses dazzle, the sense of dazzle occurs mainly because excessive light reaches the rods in the case of blue light, while the sense of dazzle occurs mainly because excessive light reaches the cones in the case of visible light other than blue light. Thus, the mechanism of sensing dazzle differs between both cases. Accordingly, by utilizing this phenomenon, for example, the overall intensity of the white light source is kept constant, and then the content ratio of the blue light component that is a constituent of the white light is varied. Thereby, the degree of dazzle perceived by humans can correctly be evaluated. Specifically, even when the amount of light reaching the cones is constant or slightly decreases, if the amount of light reaching the rods increases, humans sense dazzle more strongly. To measure this variation is the most effective means for evaluating the influence of blue light upon the human body.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0220">Hereinafter, the contents of concrete experiments and the results thereof are summarized.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0221">For the purpose of examination, in order to obtain light sources of various P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) values, the following five kinds of light sources were additionally experimentally fabricated, and were used as light sources of the Example and Comparative Example.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0222">To begin with, a white light source was fabricated in which the light emission intensity of the blue wavelength region in the light emission spectrum of white light was reduced as much as possible. Concretely, to cope with this, an ultraviolet to blue light absorption film was formed on the LED module of the light source B of Example 1. A three-layer film was formed on the periphery of the phosphor layer which covers the periphery of the LED chip of the light source B of Example 1. A thin film (first layer) of about 3 &#x3bc;m, which is formed by using a zinc oxide pigment with an average particle size of 0.3 &#x3bc;m, was formed on the innermost side. A film (second layer) of about 0.9 &#x3bc;m, which is formed by using zirconium oxide with an average particle size of 0.08 &#x3bc;m, was formed in the middle. A thin film (third layer) of about 6 &#x3bc;m, which is formed by using silicon oxide with an average particle size of 0.5 &#x3bc;m, was formed on the outermost side. Each of the thin films was formed such that fine particle powder was dispersed in a silicone resin, the specific gravity and viscosity were adjusted, and then a predetermined amount of a slurry of the result was applied.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0223">A predetermined electric current was applied to the obtained LED module, and it was confirmed that the LED module emits white light. The light emission spectral distribution of white light emitted from the LED module was measured by using the spectral distribution measuring device. Based on the obtained light emission spectrum data, a chromaticity point on the (x, y) chromaticity diagram was calculated. The calculated chromaticity point was 5110 K &#x2212;0.002 duv.

In experiments, the ten kinds of light sources of the above Table 5-1 were prepared. The ten kinds of light sources were successively lighted under the operational condition under which the luminances of the light sources become equal. During the lighting tests of the light sources, the curtains of windows were closed, and the brightness of ceiling illumination was constantly kept at a fixed value so that the indoor illuminance may not change. In addition, a human stands at a position at a distance of 3 m from the light sources. The human directly viewed each light source, and the strength of a stimulus received from the light source was comparatively evaluated. In order to simplify the criterion of evaluation, a method was adopted in which one of two kinds of answers, &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; and &#x201c;No&#x201d;, is obtained as to whether dazzle of each light source is sensed or not. The test subjects were 50 male and female adults in total, who have normal color sensation.

Thus, it should be natural that the persons perceive the same degree of dazzle with respect to all light sources. However, as shown in Table 7, the result indicates that the degree of dazzle sensed by persons greatly differs depending on the kinds of white light sources. This result was obtained due to the peculiarity of blue light, and this data supports the correctness of the method of experiments. For example, as is understood from Table 7, there is a tendency that as the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value becomes greater, the ratio of persons who sense dazzle generally becomes larger. This means that even if the intensity of light, which is incident on the eyes and is sensed by the eyes, is unchanged, the persons sensed dazzle more strongly as the amount of the blue light component becomes larger, because the amount of scattering light increases in proportion to the amount of the blue light component.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0235">The above phenomenon is more clearly indicated by the result of comparison of the combination of the two kinds of light source (1) and light source (6) in Table 7, or the combination of the two kinds of light source (4) and light (5) in Table 7. In these white light sources, the color temperatures of the paired light sources are substantially identical. Moreover, the luminance is identical in all light sources. Thus, when humans observe these light sources, it should be natural that both of the paired light sources are viewed with the same brightness and color. Despite this, a large difference occurs in the degree of perception of dazzle. Concretely, for example, when the light source (4) and light source (5) in Table 7 are compared, the color temperatures of both are about 5100 K. However, the ratio of persons who sensed dazzle of the light source (4) is 14%, while this ratio is 28% with respect to the light source (5), and a large difference was recognized. If the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) values of both are confirmed, this value is 0.98 in the light source (4), while the value is 1.47 in the light source (5). In accordance with the magnitude of the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value, the ratio of scattering light incident on the eyes increased, thus influencing the degree of perception of dazzle.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0236">On the other hand, as an exception to the above, in the relationship between the light source (2) and light source (3) in Table 7, a phenomenon occurs in which the relationship between the degree of perception of dazzle by persons and the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value is reversed. The P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value of the light source (2) is 1.26 and is smaller than 1.37 of the light source (3). Despite this, the ratio of persons who sensed dazzle of the light source (2) is 22% which is greater than 18% of the light source (3), and the mutual relationship was reversed. At a glance, this data is contradictory. However, such a result occurred due to the difference between the color temperatures of white light sources. The P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value defines the amount of blue light which is excessively included, compared to the corresponding blackbody radiation. However, the color temperature of blackbody radiation, which is a reference for comparison, is 2990 K in the light source (3), while this color temperature is 5704 K in the light source (2). In general, as the value of the color temperature of white light becomes higher, the relative ratio of the blue light component increases. Accordingly, in the spectrum of blackbody radiation which was a reference for comparison when the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value was calculated, the blue light component of the light source (2) was greater than the blue light component of the light source (3). Thus, although the excess blue light relative to the blackbody radiation was greater in the light source (3), the entire amount of blue light was greater in the light source (2). There is no difference in the fact that the degree of perception of dazzle varies in accordance with the content of blue light.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0237">From the above result, it was confirmed that the content of the blue light component in the white light source influences the degree of perception of dazzle by humans, and that as the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value becomes greater, more dazzle is perceived by humans. This result is the content that supports the initial assumption, and the influence by the excess blue light emission component is considered to be particularly important as the factor by which the white light source was perceived as dazzling. In addition, in the white light sources (8) to (10) of the Comparative Example, the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) values are 1.87, 2.11 and 3.28, which exceed 1.8 and are large values. The level of these values is such that more than half the test subjects sensed dazzle of blue light. The light source, with which dazzle is so strongly sensed, is an illumination for which there is concern about problems of blue light hazards or the like, which have attracted attention in recent years. In connection with this light source, the investigation of the truth and the study for improvements are to be expected in the future. On the other hand, in the white light sources of the Example, the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) values are in the range of 0.98 to 1.76, and an improvement has been made so as to make the blue component smaller than in the conventional light sources of the Comparative Example. Moreover, the ratio of persons sensing dazzle is less than 50%, and it is judged that the light of the white light sources of the Example has been improved with respect to the problems of blue light hazards or the like.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0238">In the meantime, in Table 5-1 and Table 5-2, in the white light sources of the Examples which were shown by way of example, the color temperatures are 2990 K to 5704 K and the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) values are in the range of 0.98 to 1.76. However, the white light sources of the present invention are characterized in that the color temperatures are in the range of 2000 K to 6500 K, and the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) values are in the range of 1.8 or less. Accordingly, the content of the blue light component in the white light source of the present invention is less than that in the white light source of Comparative Example 1 which is the conventional light source. This is because the color temperature of the white light source of Comparative Example 1 is 6338 K and is substantially close to the upper limit value. On the other hand, since the color temperature of the white light source of the present invention is substantially equal to or less than the color temperature in Comparative Example 1, the content of the blue light component is equal to or less than that in Comparative Example 1. Besides, since the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value is less than in Comparative Example 1, the content of the blue light component in the white light source of the present invention is surely less than that in the white light source of Comparative Example 1. In addition, in the white light source (e.g., white light source V) of this invention in which the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value is 1.5 or less, the ratio of persons sensing dazzle is substantially halved, compared to the ratio with respect to the light source of Comparative Example 1, and the influence of the blue light component can be reduced more conspicuously. In this manner, the white light source of the present invention has obvious effects of improvement, compared to the conventional light source that is the Comparative Example.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example A</heading><p id="p-0273" num="0239">A white light source system, which is composed of four kinds of white light sources, was fabricated. In this system, the number of white light sources, which constitute the system, is limited to a minimum necessary number.

In addition, in the LED module <b>70</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref> in which the alumina substrate having a water absorption coefficient of 20 to 30% was used, each of chip columns, in which the LED chips <b>72</b> are connected in series, is independently covered with a transparent resin layer (not shown), and the entire surface of each of the transparent resin layers of the plural columns is covered with a phosphor layer <b>73</b>. In the meantime, in the transparent resin layer, fumed silica with an average primary particle size of 7 nm and a maximum particle size of 25 nm was added as fine particle silica powder in an amount of 3 mass % relative to the transparent resin. In addition, as each phosphor powder which is contained in the phosphor layer, phosphor powder with an average particle size of 30 to 40 &#x3bc;m was used.

As is understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref>, the P(&#x3bb;)/B(&#x3bb;) value is 1.17, and it was confirmed that the light source satisfies each of the relational expression (2) and relational expression (5).</p><p id="p-0279" num="0244">In the meantime, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b></figref>, the light emission spectra of the white light sources of the present invention can exhibit continuous spectra without a break over the wavelength range of 380 nm to 780 nm. Here, the continuous spectrum means a spectrum which does not include, in this wavelength range, a planar wavelength region where the light emission intensity is substantially zero.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0245">In order to confirm the feature of the light emission spectra of the white light sources of the present invention, for example, the light emission spectrum of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref> of the light source of the present invention is compared with the light emission spectrum shape of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> of the light source of Comparative Example 1, which was fabricated in Example 1. One to three recess portions are observed in the curves of both spectra. Such a recess portion occurred due to a gap between neighboring two kinds of light emission spectra. The reason why the light emission intensity at the bottom of the recess portion does not become zero is that a long wavelength end of a short wavelength-side light emission spectrum and a short wavelength end of a long wavelength-side light emission spectrum overlap. The reason why the degree of irregularity of the spectrum curve is less in the light source of the present invention than in the light source of the Comparative Example is that the area of overlap between light emission spectra is large. This effect occurs by making as close as possible the light emission spectra with large half-value widths. By further selecting the kinds of phosphors in such a combination, re-absorption between phosphors becomes easier to occur, and also double excitation or the like becomes easier to occur. The light emission color variation during continuous lighting of the light source can be suppressed as low as possible. Besides, since the smooth curve with less irregularity can be obtained, it is natural that the light emission spectrum of blackbody radiation can easily be reproduced and the color rendering property or the like can be improved. In particular, the light sources of the present invention are characterized in that the light emission intensity does not become zero even in a near-ultraviolet region of 380 nm or a deep red region of 780 nm. On the other hand, in the light source of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> of the Comparative Example, planar curves appear in a region of 400 nm or less and in a region of 750 nm or more, and the level of the intensity thereof can be regarded as substantially zero. Thus, in the white light source of the present invention, over the entire wavelength region of 380 nm to 780 nm which is the object of evaluation of the color rendering evaluation index, there is no planar wavelength region in which the light emission intensity is substantially zero. Accordingly, the white light source of the present invention can exhibit high numerical values, not only with respect to the average index Ra, but also with respect to R1 to R15. Concrete values are as shown in Table 9. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> show other examples of continuous spectra with no break over the entire wavelength range of 380 nm to 780 nm, that is, light emission spectra including no planar wavelength region in which the emission intensity is substantially zero.</p><p id="p-0281"

The basic configuration of the LED module is the same as that of the light sources 7 to 10 of Example A. However, InGaN having a light emission peak at 455 nm was used for the LED, and a cerium activated yttrium aluminum garnet phosphor was used as a phosphor to be combined. Besides, the thickness of the phosphor layer and the amount of phosphor were adjusted such that white light of a color temperature of 5300 K is emitted from the light source 12 of the Comparative Example. Concretely, the film thickness was set at 0.15 mm, and the content of phosphor powder in the phosphor layer was set at 10 mass %.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0248">In the light source 12 of the Comparative Example, the chromaticity variation after continuous lighting exceeded 0.01 and was large. Although the white light of the light source 12 is obtained by the mixing the blue light of the LED and the yellow light of the phosphor, the speed of the decrease in luminance of the LED and the speed of the decrease in luminance of the phosphor during continuous lighting are different, and thus such a large variation was exhibited. On the other hand, in the white light sources 7 to 11 of the present invention, all the constituent components of the white light utilize the emission lights of phosphors, and the phosphors used are doubly excited by the LED and phosphors. Moreover, the combination in which re-absorption between the phosphors occurs is adopted. Thus, the speeds of the decrease of luminance in the respective phosphors are averaged. As a result, the effect of reduction of the color variation was brought about. In the white light sources of the present invention, the magnitude of the chromaticity variation in each light source was 0.01 or less, and was small.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example B</heading><p id="p-0286" num="0249">White light sources were fabricated in order to examine the relationship between the water absorption coefficient of the alumina substrate and the adhesion strength of the silicone resin. Except for the material of the substrate, use was made of the same members for fabricating the light sources as those of the light source 7 of Example A. The basic configuration of the LED module was also the same as that of the light source 7. However, in order to evaluate the strength of the resin film, the configuration was simplified, and a linear arrangement of only one column was adopted as the chip arrangement of LEDs, instead of the matrix-type arrangement.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0250">As a substrate of a light source 13, an alumina substrate (shape: 8&#xd7;3&#xd7;0.38 mm) with a water absorption coefficient of 5.8% was prepared. The temperature at a time of baking this alumina substrate was set at 1480&#xb0; C., and thereby the water absorption coefficient was adjusted to 5.8%. Three LED chips were linearly arranged on this substrate, and were connected in series. A slurry including four kinds of phosphors and silicone resin was applied onto these LED chips such that the three LED chips were covered at the same time, and the silicone resin was cured by a heat treatment at a temperature of 140&#xb0; C. In this manner, a columnar phosphor layer was formed with a size of 6.5 mm in longitudinal dimension, 2.5 mm in transverse dimension, and 1.9 mm in thickness.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0251">As substrates of light sources 14 and 15, alumina substrates having water absorption coefficients of 38% and 59%, respectively, were prepared, and the same LED modules as in the light source 13 were fabricated.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0252">In addition, as a light source 16, an LED module having a double-layer structure of a transparent silicone resin layer and a phosphor layer was fabricated. Three LED chips were mounted on an alumina substrate having a water absorption coefficient of 11%. Thereafter, a silicone resin including no phosphor was applied. Next, a phosphor slurry prepared for the light source 13 was applied. The resultant was subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of 140&#xb0; C., and the silicone resin was cured. Thereby, a double-layer film was formed in which the thickness of the transparent silicone resin layer is 3 mm and the thickness of the phosphor layer is 0.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0253">As a light source 17, a module to be described below was fabricated.

An electric current of 20 mA was passed through the above five kinds of white light sources 13 to 17 and the light source 10 of Example A, and the light emission efficiency of each light source was measured. Thereafter, the adhesion strength between the silicone resin and substrate was measured by a predetermined method. The result is shown in Table 11. In the light source 10 of Example A and the light sources 13 to 16 of Example B in which the alumina substrates having the water absorption coefficients in the range of 5% to 60% were used, the adhesion strength between the silicone resin layer and substrate indicated a characteristic of more than 1 N, and light sources with no peeling of the resin layer and with good handling efficiency were successfully obtained.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00013" num="00013"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 11</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Table 11</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Light</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Water absorption</entry><entry/><entry>Adhesion</entry><entry>emission</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>coefficient</entry><entry>Structure of</entry><entry>strength</entry><entry>efficiency</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>of substrate</entry><entry>Resin layer</entry><entry>(N)</entry><entry>(lm/W)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Light source 10</entry><entry>21</entry><entry>Double-layer</entry><entry>5.9</entry><entry>65</entry></row><row><entry>(Example A)</entry><entry/><entry>film</entry></row><row><entry>Light source 13</entry><entry>5.8</entry><entry>Single-layer</entry><entry>4.1</entry><entry>60</entry></row><row><entry>(Example B)</entry><entry/><entry>film</entry></row><row><entry>Light source 14</entry><entry>38</entry><entry>Single-layer</entry><entry>7.2</entry><entry>59</entry></row><row><entry>(Example B)</entry><entry/><entry>film</entry></row><row><entry>Light source 15</entry><entry>59</entry><entry>Single-layer</entry><entry>8.8</entry><entry>61</entry></row><row><entry>(Example B)</entry><entry/><entry>film</entry></row><row><entry>Light source 16</entry><entry>11</entry><entry>Single-layer</entry><entry>5.1</entry><entry>64</entry></row><row><entry>(Example B)</entry><entry/><entry>film</entry></row><row><entry>Light source 17</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>Single-layer</entry><entry>0.5</entry><entry>59</entry></row><row><entry>(Example B)</entry><entry/><entry>film</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Example C</heading><p id="p-0292" num="0254">White light sources were fabricated for confirming the characteristic effect of the transparent resin layer that is a constituent member of an LED module, and characteristic effect of inorganic fine particle powder included in the transparent resin layer.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0255">To begin with, the effects of the transparent resin layers were evaluated.

The bonded LED chips were wire-bonded to the wiring pattern by using gold wires. After confirming the lighting of the LEDs, the LEDs and gold wires were coated with a thermosetting transparent silicone resin. In the method of coating, a necessary amount of the resin was applied by using a dispenser, a mask or the like, such that the center LED chip is set at the center, and the three LEDs are coated with a common continuous transparent resin layer. The resin was heated and cured at temperatures of 100 to 150&#xb0; C., and thus the transparent resin layer was formed. The size of the transparent resin layer was 5.5 mm in longitudinal dimension&#xd7;2.5 mm in transverse dimension, and the thickness thereof was 1.2 mm. Next, a silicone resin including a phosphor was applied to the surface of the transparent resin layer, and heated and cured.

This system can reproduce all chromaticity points in a hexagonal inside area formed by six light emission chromaticity points indicated by the respective light sources. Thus, over all color temperatures of 2000 K to 6500 K, the system can reproduce all correlated chromaticity points in the range of &#xb1;0.005 duv or less. In addition, the same light source as in Example 1 is used for each light source, and it is natural that the white light reproduced by this white light source system can exhibit the same characteristics as the other Examples, that is, the characteristics such as the color rendering property and light emission spectrum shape.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0264">In Examples 3 to 7, one-day variations of sunlight in various places were reproduced by using this white light source system.

However, from the data stored in the system, the user may designate data of sunlight of an arbitrary season at an arbitrary place. Thereby, the variations of sunlight in such places can be well reproduced. Specifically, the light emission spectrum of the white light source of the present invention can exhibit good coincidence in the visible light region with the light emission spectrum of blackbody radiation of the same color temperature as sunlight. Moreover, the spectrum shape of the blackbody radiation is not merely reproduced, but the degree of influence, which light emission by blackbody radiation (sun) receives while reaching each place on the earth, is quantized as a deviation from the color temperature of blackbody radiation. Thus, the white light of the color temperature, with this deviation being included, was successfully reproduced. Thereby, the sunlight in an arbitrary place can be reproduced, and the reproduced light contains only ultraviolet which is much weaker than sunlight. Hence, for example, when the reproduced light is used as illumination for articles on exhibition in an art museum or the like, paintings or the like are not damaged, and the real body colors of the articles on exhibition can be reproduced with very high precision, compared to conventional light sources. Furthermore, the white light source of the present invention can serve as a light source that is kind to human bodies. This light source can radiate white light in which the intensity of the blue light emission component that is a concern due to its harmful effect on paintings and human bodies is sufficiently reduced, compared to conventional artificial light sources, and this light source can well maintain the circadian rhythms of human bodies and be good for human bodies, while being able to obtain a high color rendering effect, like sunlight.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0271">While certain embodiments have been described, these embodiments have been presented by way of example only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventions.
