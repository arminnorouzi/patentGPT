Information from user interactions with or events occurring in these applications are logged for various reasons, such as troubleshooting, archiving, research, or analysis. Due to the distributed nature of the systems, the logged information is stored in remote data storage provided by the application provider or a third party. When the logged information is transmitted to the remote data storage, sensitive information is exposed both by the transmission of the logged information and by the storage on the server. The exposure can represent unacceptable security and privacy risks to users.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Disclosed herein are systems, methods and computer program products for dynamically sanitizing logged information from application interactions and events.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an embodiment, methods or systems monitor interactions or events occurring in an application. A data packet containing labeled values is extracted from the interaction or event. A sanitization system classifies each value with a sensitivity based on the label and a classification configuration and then sanitizes the values in the data packet based on their classified sensitivity. The classification configuration is available at initialization of the application. The sanitized data packet is then logged into a data repository, such as a data server.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an embodiment, the interaction can be monitored for errors that occur. A help service can attempt to determine a cause of the error based on the sanitized data packet stored in the data repository. If the help service fails to determine the cause, the help service can modify the classification configuration. The help service then instructs the user to operate the application to cause the interaction or the event to occur again in the application. The interaction is monitored and a data packet is extracted. The sanitization system classifies at least one value to a different sensitivity, sanitizes the values, and logs them into the data repository. The help service iteratively updates the classification configuration until a cause is identified. Once a cause is identified, the help service aids a user in resolving the error. The classification configuration can then be reset and logged data packets created due to the help service can be deleted.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated herein and form a part of the specification, illustrate embodiments of the present disclosure and, together with the description, further serve to explain the principles of the disclosure and to enable a person skilled in the art(s) to make and use the embodiments.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a sanitization system for logged information from application interactions, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method for providing dynamic sanitization of logged information from application interactions, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an example computer system useful for implementing various embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the drawings, like reference numbers generally indicate identical or similar elements.

User interactions include users logging in to the application, inputting or accessing information, and making use of tools or utilities provided by the application, such as making a purchase or transferring money. Events occurring in the application include displaying features or running other application programming interfaces (APIs) in the application. Logging systems log data from the user interactions and events for various uses, such as trouble-shooting, research, or analysis of application performance.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As part of running an application on a distributed system, the logged data is often stored in a data server or data storage that is remote to the device running the application. The proliferation of cloud networking and storage solutions sometimes means that the logged data is stored on a third-party server. Both the transmission of the logged data through the distributed system and the storage of the data on the third-party server can expose sensitive information in the logged data, such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, or device identifiers.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to protect the sensitive information, a sanitization system is used to remove, obfuscate, or encrypt the logged data. In some embodiments, this requires a policy or configuration that describes what to sanitize and how to do so. Due to differences between applications, formatting of the logged information can vary. What constitutes sensitive data and how it is retained or described can change as well. As a result, the logging system downloads a specific configuration in order to log information from a given application.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">When initializing an application, the specific configuration may not be available for sanitizing logged information. The configuration can be unavailable due to connection issues or an application not having a specified configuration. As a result, the logging system may not be able to sanitize the logged data. What is needed is a default configuration that can be used for sanitization for a variety of applications. The default configuration can be supplemented with a dynamic system for updating the default configuration to address new applications, changes in what data to sanitize, and updates to how to sanitize the logged data. In some embodiments, the dynamic updating of the configuration allows a troubleshooter to duplicate interactions or events under different sanitization protocols, allowing the troubleshooter access to sensitive information that can be used in resolving an issue or error.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a sanitization system <b>100</b> for logged information from application interactions, according to some embodiments. A mobile client <b>110</b> has monitoring system <b>118</b> for monitoring interactions between a user and application <b>112</b> and events occurring in application <b>112</b>. Logger <b>116</b> logs information from the user interactions and events. The logged information is transmitted via cloud <b>160</b> to a data server <b>140</b> or third-party data server <b>145</b> for storage. Mobile client <b>110</b> has a sanitizer <b>114</b> for sanitizing the logged information prior to transmission. Sanitizer <b>114</b> sanitizes the data based on classification configuration <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, classification configuration <b>120</b> is a default configuration that ships with or is otherwise part of sanitizer <b>114</b> or mobile client <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the default configuration is available to mobile client <b>110</b> or sanitizer <b>114</b> when application <b>112</b> is initialized. In some embodiments, classification configuration <b>120</b> is an updated or modified version of the default configuration. For example, configuration updater <b>130</b> updates classification configuration <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, a user of mobile client <b>110</b> interacts with help service <b>150</b> to resolve issues in using application <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Mobile client <b>110</b> is a device or system configured to run application <b>112</b>. As non-limiting examples, mobile client <b>110</b> is a laptop, a smart phone, a tablet, a thin client, or a distributed computer interface system. In some embodiments, mobile client <b>110</b> is a computer system, such as computer system <b>300</b> described below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. A user accesses application <b>112</b> via mobile client <b>110</b>. Application <b>112</b> allows a user to access information or services through the internet. As non-limiting examples, application <b>112</b> is an online shopping application, a mobile banking application, or other applications that handle sensitive user or mobile client <b>110</b> information.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Mobile client <b>110</b> is configured to run monitoring system <b>118</b>, which monitors interactions between the user and application <b>112</b> and events occurring in application <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, monitoring system <b>118</b> monitors more than one application <b>112</b> on mobile client <b>110</b>. Monitoring system <b>118</b> extracts information about the interaction(s) and event(s). In some embodiments, monitoring system <b>118</b> extracts the information as one or more values and forms it into a data packet. In some embodiments, monitoring system <b>118</b> extracts the information as a data packet from the interaction or event.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As a non-limiting example, an interaction is a user logging in to an online banking system. The user forgets the password and recovers the password using a social security number. The application receives inputs of the social security number, a new password, and a username. As part of the interaction, application <b>112</b> uses an identifier and an internet protocol (IP) address of mobile client <b>110</b>. Monitoring system <b>118</b> extracts the values for the social security number, the identifier of the mobile client <b>110</b>, and the IP address. In some embodiments, monitoring system <b>118</b> labels the extracted information. In some embodiments, monitoring system <b>118</b> the extracted information is extracted with labels.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As another non-limiting example, the user instructs application <b>112</b> to display user account information and provides credentials or login information, and an API accesses the user account information and generates the display. The event is the API accessing and generating the display. The user account information includes sensitive information about the user's account, and the information that is accessed and displayed is extracted by monitoring system <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Mobile client <b>110</b> runs sanitizer <b>114</b>, which sanitizes the extracted information based on classification configuration <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, classification configuration <b>120</b> is a default configuration that is shipped with mobile client <b>110</b> or sanitizer <b>114</b>. Sanitizer <b>114</b> classifies each value in the extracted information to a sensitivity level and then sanitizes the extracted information based on the sensitivity level.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Classification configuration <b>120</b> has rules for identifying or classifying sensitive information. The labels of the extracted information are checked against the rules. When the label satisfies the rule, the label and corresponding value in the extracted information are assigned a sensitivity level that corresponds to the rule. In some embodiments, extracted information can be high sensitivity, medium sensitivity, low sensitivity, or not sensitive.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As an example, the rule is that social security numbers are classified as high sensitivity. When a social security number is found in the extracted information, that value is assigned high sensitivity. In some embodiments, the rule is a regular expression configured to match a label for sensitive information. In some embodiments, classification configuration includes more than one rule for classifying the sensitivity level of values. For example, the label for a social security number can be the words &#x201c;social security number&#x201d; or the letters &#x201c;SSN,&#x201d; and rules have regular expressions for matching those different words.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Sanitizer <b>114</b> sanitizes the extracted information based on the sensitivity levels and according to the classification configuration <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, sanitization includes performing one or more of pruning values, redacting values, or encrypting values. In some embodiments, pruning involves removing or deleting a value from the extracted information. In some embodiments, redacting values involves replacing the value with different information that is not based on the original value. In some embodiments, redacting a value replaces the value with a coded number that is based on the label for the value, but not on the value itself. In some embodiments, encrypting values involves encoding the values based on an encryption scheme. For example, public/private key encryption or other asymmetric encryption approaches are used to encode values. In some embodiments, the label for a value is not sanitized and left in the extracted information to identify that such a value was present. In some embodiments, the label for a value is sanitized in addition to the value.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, different types of sanitization are assigned to different sensitivity levels based on classification configuration <b>120</b>. For example, high sensitivity is assigned to pruning, medium sensitivity is assigned to redacting, and low sensitivity is assigned to encrypting. In some embodiments, sanitizer <b>114</b> is configured to first prune the extracted information, then redact the extracted information, then encrypt the extracted information.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, different encryption techniques are applied to sanitize logged data in the same sensitivity level. The different encryption techniques can vary to provide different levels of security and encryption processing time. For example, the encryption techniques can vary by encryption key length, algorithm, or use of symmetric or asymmetric keys. In some embodiments, where there is more low sensitivity logged data than medium or high sensitivity logged data, the low sensitivity logged data can be sanitized to balance time taken for encryption with degree of security.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the low sensitivity logged data can be assigned an encryption technique based on the size or length of the value. In some embodiments, classification configuration <b>120</b> assigns a specific encryption technique based on an amount of low sensitivity logged data that is to be encrypted. For example, the specific encryption technique is selected to ensure that the low sensitivity logged data can be sanitized within a certain time period. As another example, the specific encryption technique is selected based on a combination of time to sanitize the logged data and a minimum level of security. When there is less logged data to sanitize, an encryption technique with a higher level of security is used to better protect the data. When there is more logged data to sanitize, an encryption technique with a lower level of security, but not less than a minimum level, is selected to safely encrypt the data without slowing down processing or performance of application <b>112</b> and mobile client <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Mobile client <b>110</b> runs logger <b>116</b>, which logs the sanitized information to remote data storage, such as data server <b>140</b> or third-party data server <b>145</b>. Data server <b>140</b> is a server or data storage, such as cloud-based storage, that is maintained by a business or entity that controls or owns monitoring system <b>118</b>. Third-party data server <b>145</b> is a server or data storage, such as cloud-based storage, that is maintained or controlled by a third party. In some embodiments, sanitizing the extracted information prior to logging it increases security and privacy for transmission of the extracted information to the remote data storage. In some embodiments, sanitizing the extracted information prior to logging it increases security and privacy for the storage of the extracted information.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Classification configuration <b>120</b> contains rules and policies for classifying and sanitizing extracted information. In some embodiments, mobile client <b>110</b> or a system for sanitizing information prior to logging it on mobile client <b>110</b> has a default classification configuration. For example, mobile client <b>110</b> or sanitizer <b>114</b> ships with a default classification configuration, such as classification configuration <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, sanitizer <b>114</b> attempts to update classification configuration <b>120</b> prior to using it or at regular intervals. For example, upon initialization of mobile client <b>110</b>, sanitizer <b>114</b> attempts to update classification configuration <b>120</b> from the default configuration to ensure that the most up-to-date sensitivity settings are available. Sanitizer <b>114</b> accesses configuration updater <b>130</b> through cloud <b>160</b>. In the event that sanitizer <b>114</b> is unable to access configuration updater <b>130</b>, the default classification configuration or a current classification configuration is used. In some embodiments, this allows sanitizer <b>114</b> to sanitize data without first downloading or accessing a remote classification configuration.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, sanitizer <b>114</b> is able to contact classification updater <b>130</b> and determine whether an update to classification configuration <b>120</b> is available or necessary. If an update is available or necessary, configuration updater <b>130</b> sends the update to classification configuration <b>120</b>. Updates to classification configuration <b>120</b> can include adding new rules, changing assigned sensitivity levels for rules, and/or changing which sanitization type is assigned to a sensitivity level (such as changing pruning to redacting).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Errors can occur during interactions, such as a failure of application <b>112</b> or the interaction itself, a network disconnection or error, or other types of issues that prevent a user from correctly completing the interaction. In some embodiments, these errors are logged as events. In some embodiments, events or interactions occur in application <b>112</b> that are related to or the cause of these errors. In some embodiments, monitoring system <b>118</b> or help service <b>150</b> monitor the interactions and events and detect when errors occur. In some embodiments, the user contacts help service <b>150</b> after experiencing an event for assistance.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Help service <b>150</b> is a user-based or computer-based (for example, computer system <b>300</b>, described below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) help system that is available to assist users of application <b>112</b> when errors occur. For example, if the user attempts to transfer money from their bank account, an error can occur and cause the transfer to fail. The user can contact help service <b>150</b> to attempt to resolve the error. Help service <b>150</b> accesses the logged information for the interaction and attempts to determine what caused the error. In some embodiments, help service <b>150</b> then resolves the error or otherwise assists the user in resolving the error.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the logged data is insufficient to help resolve the error. As an example, if a device identifier and an IP address for mobile client <b>110</b> are necessary to resolve the issue, but those values are considered secure or private, they are sanitized and purged or redacted from the logged data and help service <b>150</b> cannot access them from the logged data. Help service <b>150</b> instructs configuration updater <b>130</b> to update the classification configuration <b>120</b> to classify the data to a lower sensitivity level and correspondingly only encrypt the device identifier and IP address. Help service <b>150</b> then requests the user to operate the application to cause the interaction or event, such as the attempt to transfer money, to occur in the application again, but with an updated classification configuration. The logged information from the new attempt will contain the values in an encrypted form, allowing help service <b>150</b> to access and decrypt the values and better resolve the error.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, help service <b>150</b> deletes the logged information from the updated interaction attempt after resolving the error. In some embodiments, help service <b>150</b> updates classification configuration back to its previous configuration after resolving the issue. In some embodiments, help service <b>150</b> repeats the updating of classification configuration <b>120</b> and having the user repeat the interaction iteratively to slowly reduce the sensitivity of additional information to help resolve the error. In some embodiments, help service <b>150</b> is able to reduce exposure of sensitive and private information by only temporarily exposing the data and while keeping the data encrypted.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the logged data is accessed for research or analysis purposes. For example, the logged data can indicate trends for use of application <b>112</b> or common events. As another example, the logged data can be used to identify improvements to make to application <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Cloud <b>160</b> is a network, a cloud system, or other distributed computing system that allows devices and systems to communicate, such as via a wireless network or the internet.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method <b>200</b> for providing dynamic sanitization of logged information from application interactions, according to some embodiments.

In some embodiments, initializing includes opening or launching application <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In <b>210</b>, mobile client <b>110</b> updates classification configuration <b>120</b>. Mobile client <b>110</b> or sanitizer <b>114</b> has a default classification configuration <b>120</b> that is available upon initialization for logging. In some embodiments, sanitizer <b>114</b> updates classification configuration <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, sanitizer <b>114</b> or monitoring system <b>118</b> include a default version of classification configuration <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, classification configuration <b>120</b> is updated by checking if an update to classification configuration <b>120</b> is available in configuration updater <b>130</b>. When an update is available and configuration updater <b>130</b> can be contacted through cloud <b>160</b>, the update is applied to classification configuration <b>120</b>. If no update is available, or if configuration updater <b>130</b> is unable to be contacted, the default version or current version (if classification configuration has been previously updated) of classification configuration <b>120</b> is selected for use.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, operation <b>210</b> is performed at regular intervals to identify and download updates to classification configuration <b>120</b> as they become available. For example, an update to classification configuration <b>120</b> may include sanitization rules or settings for a new application, changes for existing applications, or definitions for new types of sensitive data or sanitization techniques, such as different encryption techniques.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In <b>215</b>, monitoring system <b>118</b> monitors interactions between the user and application <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, interactions include when a user attempts to take an action, such as logging in, accessing data, sending data, entering an input into application <b>112</b>, or otherwise using application <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, monitoring system <b>118</b> monitors events occurring in application <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <b>220</b>, monitoring system <b>118</b> extracts a data packet from the interaction. In some embodiments, the data packet has values with labels that describe the values. In some embodiments, monitoring system <b>118</b> extracts a data packet from events.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, application <b>112</b> creates the data packet as part of the interaction or event and monitoring system <b>118</b> extracts the data packet. For example, application <b>112</b> is configured to packetize values that are part of the information into the data packet. In some embodiments, monitoring system <b>118</b> extracts values from the interaction or event. For example, the interaction or event involves data values, such as a social security number, device identifier, or IP address, and monitoring system <b>118</b> extracts desired values from the interaction or event, or from application <b>112</b> or mobile client <b>110</b> during the interaction or event. Once monitoring system <b>118</b> has extracted the values, monitoring system <b>118</b> combines the extracted values into a data packet.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the values in the extracted data packet or the extracted values have corresponding labels. In some embodiments, monitoring system <b>118</b> identifies and labels the values.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In <b>225</b>, sanitizer <b>114</b> classifies the values in the data packet using classification configuration <b>120</b>. Each value in the data packet is assigned a respective sensitivity based on the label for that value and classification configuration <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the respective sensitivities are high sensitivity, medium sensitivity, low sensitivity, and not sensitive. In some embodiments, classification configuration <b>120</b> has one or more rules with corresponding sensitivities and sanitizer <b>114</b> assigns the corresponding sensitivity to a value with a label that satisfies the rule. In some embodiments, if a label satisfies none of the rules, the value is classified as not sensitive.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, classification configuration <b>120</b> has rules that are regular expressions with respective sensitivity levels. Sanitizer <b>114</b> classifies the values by comparing the labels to the regular expressions and assigns the sensitivity to a value with a label that satisfies the regular expression.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <b>230</b>, sanitizer <b>114</b> sanitizes the data packet based on the classification. Sanitizer <b>114</b> applies a sanitization process for each value based on the classified sensitivity of the value. In some embodiments, the sanitization processes include pruning, redacting, and encrypting.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, sanitizer <b>114</b> prunes by removing or deleting a value from the data packet. In some embodiments, sanitizer <b>114</b> redacts values by replacing the value with different information that is not based on the original value. In some embodiments, sanitizer <b>114</b> redacts a value and replaces the value with a coded number that is based on the label for the value, but not on the value itself. In some embodiments, sanitizer <b>114</b> encrypts values by encoding the values based on an encryption scheme. For example, public/private key encryption or asymmetric encryption are used to encode values. In some embodiments, sanitizer <b>114</b> sanitizes the value, but not the label for the value. In some embodiments, sanitizer <b>114</b> sanitizes the value and its corresponding label.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Classification configuration <b>120</b> identifies which sanitization process to apply based on the classified sensitivity. For example, high sensitivity is assigned to pruning, medium sensitivity is assigned to redacting, and low sensitivity is assigned to encrypting. In some embodiments, sanitizer <b>114</b> is configured to first prune the extracted information, then redact the extracted information, then encrypt the extracted information. Sanitizer <b>114</b> sanitizes the values based on the classified sensitivities.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, more than one encryption technique is defined or available in classification configuration <b>120</b>. Sanitizer <b>114</b> selects an encryption technique based on a required level of security and an encryption processing time based on rules or requirements in classification configuration <b>120</b>. For example, the encryption technique is selected to ensure that the low sensitivity logged data can be sanitized within a certain time period. As another example, the specific encryption technique is selected based on a combination of time to sanitize the logged data and a minimum level of security. When there is less logged data to sanitize, an encryption technique with a higher level of security is used to better protect the data. When there is more logged data to sanitize, an encryption technique with a lower level of security, but not less than a minimum level, is selected to safely encrypt the data without slowing down processing or performance of application <b>112</b> and mobile client <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In <b>235</b>, logger <b>116</b> logs the sanitized data packet. Logger <b>116</b> sends the sanitized data packet through cloud <b>160</b> to a data repository, such as data server <b>140</b> or third-party data server <b>145</b>. Data server <b>140</b> or third-party data server <b>145</b> receive and store the sanitized data packet.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In <b>240</b>, help service <b>150</b> or monitoring system <b>118</b> detect an error from the interaction. In some embodiments, help service <b>150</b> or monitoring system <b>118</b> monitor the interactions and errors occurring during the interaction. In some embodiments, monitoring system <b>118</b> monitors events occurring in application <b>112</b> and errors occurring during the events. When an error occurs and is detected, monitoring system <b>118</b> contacts help service <b>150</b>. Help service <b>150</b> can contact the user or be contacted by the user to assist with resolving an issue resulting from the event, such as a failure to complete the interaction.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In <b>245</b>, help service <b>150</b> attempts to determine a cause of the error based on the logged data packet for the interaction. In some embodiments, help service <b>150</b> attempts to determine a cause of the error based on the logged data packet for the event. Help service <b>150</b> accesses the logged data packet from data server <b>140</b> or third-party data server <b>145</b> and analyzes the values. Help service <b>150</b> decrypts encrypted values. In some embodiments, help service <b>150</b> is able to identify a cause for the error based on the values in the data packet. In some embodiments, the user provides help service <b>150</b> with additional information that allows help service <b>150</b> to identify the cause and resolve the error. In some embodiments, help service <b>150</b> is unable to identify the cause based on the available values in the logged data packet.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">When help service <b>150</b> is able to identify the cause, method <b>200</b> proceeds to operation <b>260</b>. When help service <b>150</b> is unable to identify the cause, method <b>200</b> proceeds to operation <b>250</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In <b>250</b>, help service <b>150</b> modifies classification configuration <b>120</b>. Help service <b>150</b> can add rules, modify rules, or remove rules. In some embodiments, help service <b>150</b> modifies a rule to change the respective sensitivity level for that rule, such as by lowering the sensitivity level for the rule. For example, the sensitivity level for sensitive information can be lowered to a level that only encrypts the values for logging, rather than pruning or redacting the value.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, help service <b>150</b> modifies classification configuration <b>120</b> using configuration updater <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, help service <b>150</b> modifies classification configuration <b>120</b> directly.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In <b>255</b>, help service <b>150</b> instructs the user to repeat the interaction. In some embodiments, help service <b>150</b> instructs the user to repeat steps that cause an event or interaction. In some embodiments, help service <b>150</b> causes application <b>112</b> to perform the event. In some embodiments, help service <b>150</b> instructs the user to operate the application to cause the interaction or event to occur again in the application. For example, if the user was attempting to transfer money, help service <b>150</b> instructs the user to repeat the attempt to transfer money. In some embodiments, help service <b>150</b> instructs the user to repeat only some of the steps of the interaction.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Method <b>200</b> then proceeds to operation <b>215</b>. The interaction or event is repeated with the updated classification of operation <b>250</b>, which increases the amount of information available to help service <b>150</b> for identifying the cause of the error.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, help service <b>150</b> modifies classification configuration <b>120</b> in operation <b>250</b> and instructs the user to repeat steps of the interaction or to cause an event in operation <b>255</b> to log values that will aid in resolving the error. For example, help service <b>150</b> can lower the sensitivity of IP address information to aid in identifying causes of a connectivity issue. In some embodiments, this allows help service <b>150</b> to avoid exposing other sensitive information that is not helpful in identifying the cause of the error.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, method <b>200</b> proceeds iteratively through operations <b>215</b> to <b>245</b> and returns to operations <b>250</b> and <b>255</b> to expose additional sensitive information in a systematic manner while attempting to identify the cause of the error. In this way, method <b>200</b> minimizes the amount of sensitive information that is exposed to the logging process.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In <b>260</b>, help service <b>150</b> resolves the error based on the cause. For example, if mobile client <b>110</b> has a device identifier that is not authorized to perform the attempted interaction, help service <b>150</b> can instruct the user to repeat the interaction on a different, authorized device. In some embodiments, help service <b>150</b> deletes from data server <b>240</b> and third-party data server <b>245</b> any additional logged data packets created by proceeding through operations <b>250</b> and <b>255</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In <b>265</b>, help service <b>150</b> restores classification configuration <b>120</b>.
