Tool <b>100</b> is configured to be adhered, attached or simply situated onto an upper surface of a conventional and commercially available electronics prototyping breadboard <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0041">Tool <b>100</b> includes a substantially planar non-conductive substrate <b>102</b> having outer dimensions that closely match breadboard <b>200</b>. Substrate may be formed of a polymer material such as polyester or plastics material, or a paper-based material suitable for printing thereon. In some embodiments, substrate <b>102</b> is formed of a polyester based medium such as called NeverTear, which is manufactured by Fuji Xerox Co. Ltd. In other embodiments, substrate <b>102</b> is formed of a polyethylene fibre-based medium such as the Tyvek&#xae; product manufactured by DuPont de Nemours, Inc. In further embodiments, substrate <b>102</b> is formed of a synthetic waterproof paper medium such as Teslin&#xae; waterproof paper, manufactured by PP Industries, Inc. In still further embodiments, substrate <b>102</b> is formed of other commercially available paper-based materials such as 210 GSM gloss paper. In another embodiment, substrate <b>102</b> is formed of a transparent plastic material similar in properties to overhead-projector transparency. In general, the material selected for substrate <b>102</b> should be non-conductive, moisture-resistant and be able to be printed on. It is also preferable for substrate <b>102</b> to be tear-resistant and able to be laser-cut.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0042">To match the dimensions of a traditional breadboard, substrate <b>102</b> is cut to have dimensions of about 16.3 cm long by 5.3 cm wide. However, it will be appreciated that breadboards come in different sizes and the specific dimensions of substrate <b>102</b> may vary depending on the design requirements. Preferably, substrate <b>102</b> has a thickness of between 0.095 mm and 3 mm, inclusive. This thickness provides substrate <b>102</b> with sufficient strength or stiffness to maintain structural integrity while maintaining a small degree of flexibility. A thin profile also provides for easily inserting conductive electrical pins of electronic components through substrate <b>102</b>. However, it will be appreciated that, in other embodiments, substrate <b>102</b> may have a thickness greater or less than the above range.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0043">Substrate <b>102</b> includes a plurality of guide apertures, e.g. <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, disposed therein at locations corresponding to predefined electrical through-hole inputs, e.g. <b>202</b> and <b>203</b>, of breadboard <b>200</b>. The alignment of guide apertures with electrical inputs provides for electronic components, e.g. <b>204</b>-<b>206</b>, to be able to be connected to electronics breadboard <b>200</b> by inserting their electrical pins through respective ones of the guide apertures. As mentioned below, guide apertures <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> may be positioned on substrate <b>102</b> at locations based on a dimensionally-accurate digital representation of a breadboard design reference to align the components over corresponding through-holes of the breadboard. Guide apertures have diameters sufficiently large so as to receive standard electrical pins of electronic components. This is typically in the range of 0.5 mm to 2 mm but, in some embodiments, may be within 1.5 mm. Guide apertures may have varying sized diameters to account for electronic components having different gauge electrical pins.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0044">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, tool <b>100</b> also includes indicia <b>108</b> printed on an upper surface <b>110</b> of the substrate.

Indicia <b>108</b> may also include information indicative of an electrical characteristic of an electronic component to be inserted into breadboard <b>200</b> at a specific location, such as a resistance value of a resistor or voltage value of a voltage source. Indicia <b>108</b> may also include colour coding indicative of electronic components such as resistors, or colour ranges of variable parameter devices such as a dial. In some embodiments, indicia <b>108</b> includes information indicative of a polarity of electronic components to be connected to the breadboard, such as a voltage polarity. The indicia <b>108</b> may also include instructions to a user such as numerals to indicate an order of components to be connected to breadboard <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0046">To use electronics design tool <b>100</b>, breadboard <b>200</b> is first situated on a surface in an operable position. Tool <b>100</b> is then manually positioned on top of breadboard <b>200</b> by a user with outer dimensions of tool <b>100</b> aligned with those of breadboard <b>200</b>. Aligning the tool edges to the breadboard edges aligns the guide apertures over the corresponding breadboard electrical through-hole inputs, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0047">With tool <b>100</b> positioned in an operative position on breadboard <b>200</b>, the user then inserts the first electronics component through the corresponding guide apertures indicated by indicia <b>108</b> and engages the electrical pins with the associated through-hole inputs <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> of breadboard <b>200</b>. Typically, connection of a single electronics component having at least two electrical pins is sufficient to securely engage tool <b>100</b> onto breadboard <b>200</b>, locking it against translation and rotation. Engagement of the electrical pins with through-hole inputs <b>202</b> connects those pins with underlying electrical connections of an interconnect layer <b>208</b> of breadboard <b>200</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. This interconnect layer <b>208</b> facilitates the electrical connections between electronics components connected with breadboard <b>200</b>. The size of the electrical pins and through-hole inputs <b>202</b> are such that the electrical pins have a snug fit arrangement to securely engage the electronics components and tool <b>100</b> onto breadboard <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0048">Preferably, the user will insert larger electronics components first, such as an integrated circuit, which have a greater number of electrical pins. The greater number of pins provides for enhanced engagement of tool <b>100</b> with breadboard <b>200</b>. If no large multi-pinned electronics components are required for a circuit, tool <b>100</b> may be engaged with breadboard <b>200</b> using the electrical fly-leads (such as DuPont style fly-leads manufactured by DuPont de Nemours, Inc.), which are present in every circuit to provide power to the electronics components.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0049">In addition to the natural engagement via electrical pins described above, it may be advantageous to provide additional engagement means to engage tool <b>100</b> with breadboard <b>200</b>. These additional engagement means may include an adhesive material or tape, rubber bands, clips, cable ties or other conventional fastening devices that are non-conducting.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0050">With the first electronics component in place, tool <b>100</b> is secured to breadboard <b>200</b> and the user may connect additional electronics components to breadboard <b>200</b>. The additional components are connected by inserting their respective electrical pins through the corresponding guide apertures of tool <b>100</b> in accordance with the indicia <b>108</b>. The process is continued until the electronic circuit is complete.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0051">Tool <b>100</b> may be reusable as connecting electronics components with assistance of the indicia <b>108</b> does not damage the card or components.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0052">A partially completed electronics circuit created using tool <b>100</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The circuit includes an LED <b>112</b>, voltage dial <b>114</b> and electrical fly-leads <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>. As illustrated, tool <b>100</b> includes a colour scale indicia <b>120</b> for indicating a range of voltage positions of dial <b>114</b>. The indicia on tool <b>100</b> also include resistor values and other helpful instructions and comments such as which side a &#x201c;flat edge&#x201d; of LED <b>112</b> should be oriented.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0053">Manufacturing Process</p><p id="p-0048" num="0054">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, a method <b>500</b> of fabricating electronics circuit board design tool <b>100</b> will be described.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0055">At step <b>501</b>, method <b>500</b> includes generating a digital design template in a digital illustration program such as Adobe Illustrator, GIMP or a CAD program on a computer. An example digital design template being created in a digital illustration program is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The digital design template includes one or more electronics templates corresponding to electronic circuits to be built and a plurality of alignment indicia for aligning a laser cutting device (described below). Each electronics template includes the electronics component indicia <b>108</b> indicative of a type or position of electrical connections or components to be connected with electronics breadboard <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0056">The indicia components are preferably drawn to actual-size in digital format, together with the tool outline and any title text required. Within the digital illustration program, a dimensionally-accurate digital representation of a breadboard is used as a design reference to align the components over corresponding through-holes of the breadboard. An example vector-art digital representation of a breadboard is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the digital breadboard representation is sourced from an open-source design software such as Fritzing, developed by Interaction Design Lab Potsdam.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0057">Any connecting wires are also illustrated, and supporting indicia like helpful hints or graphics are included. The artwork is duplicated into a &#x2018;panel,&#x2019; filling the space available on the print material. This final digital design template is appropriate for both CMYK printing the artwork onto a substrate, and for generating a cutting-program for the laser cutter. As such, the digital design template includes both image data and machine control instructions for a laser cutting device.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0058">At step <b>502</b>, the digital design template is printed at actual size onto a substrate material through a printing process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary printed substrate material showing a design template with two different circuit designs <b>601</b> and <b>602</b>, and local alignment (or &#x201c;registration&#x201d;) marks, e.g. <b>604</b> and <b>605</b> in the corners. However, it will be appreciated that the digital design template may include any number of different electronics templates indicative of different circuit designs.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0059">The printing process of step <b>502</b> may include laser printing or flexible UV-curable printing to a substrate material such as NeverTear, Tyvek&#xae;, Teslin&#xae; or gloss paper material described above. Where the substrate material is a transparent plastic, a flexible UV-curable ink printing process may be preferable. Typically, a preferred ink technology may depend on what is recommended by the substrate material manufacturer to achieve a scratch-resistant and clean print. However, any recommended printing method should be sufficiently non-conductive to avoid short circuits between electronics components.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0060">At step <b>503</b>, a laser cutting device <b>700</b> is controlled to cut holes in the substrate material at predetermined locations on the one or more electronics templates to generate guide apertures. This process includes using alignment marks <b>604</b> and <b>605</b> to perform an optical alignment process in order to perform the laser cutting.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, laser cutting device <b>700</b> includes a laser head <b>702</b>, alignment camera <b>704</b> and associated vision control system <b>706</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, laser cutting device <b>700</b> is a Speedy <b>400</b> manufactured by Trotec Laser GmbH with a JobControl&#xae; vision control system add-on to perform the optical alignment. The vision control system <b>706</b> processes images from camera <b>704</b> to control a position of laser head <b>702</b> during the cutting process.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0062">The vision control system <b>706</b> images alignment marks <b>604</b> and <b>605</b> and uses the relative position and orientation of these alignment marks <b>604</b> and <b>605</b> as reference points to perform optical alignment by determining the position and rotation of printed sheet material on the working area of the laser. However, it will be appreciated that other laser cutting systems may be implemented. In further embodiments, a non-laser based cutting system may be used to perform step <b>503</b> and step <b>504</b> described below.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0063">The diameter of the holes cut in the substrate material may be fixed to a common diameter such as 0.76 mm. However, in some embodiments, the diameters vary to accommodate different electronics components. By way of example, holes corresponding to connections for electrical flyleads may be formed with a diameter of around 1 mm. The wider diameter also allows the wire to pull slightly to the side without upsetting the alignment of the substrate to the breadboard.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0064">The holes are cut at locations corresponding to connection points of electronics components where electronic pins are to be inserted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates laser cutting device <b>700</b> performing a cutting process on the substrate material. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates the reverse side of an electronics circuit design tool to show hole-placement clearly.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0065">The holes are preferably precision cut using a laser as the position accuracy of the holes must closely match that of the corresponding breadboard through-holes. Preferably the cutting accuracy is equal to or better than 0.2 mm. However, in some embodiments, the cutting accuracy may be within about 0.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0066">At step <b>504</b>, the laser cutting device <b>700</b> is controlled to cut the one or more electronics templates from the substrate material to produce one or more electronics circuit board design tools. This process involves controlling device <b>700</b> to cut around the outer edges of each electronics template by following a predefined tool path. During this process, camera <b>704</b> is again configured to image one or more alignment marks <b>604</b> and <b>605</b> and, in response, vision control system <b>706</b> configured to make controlled movements of laser head <b>702</b> relative to the position of the alignment mark. The tool path may start at a first alignment mark and end at a second alignment mark. As mentioned above, the control instructions for device <b>700</b> may be stored in the digital design template.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0067">Thus, both the cutting of holes at step <b>503</b> and the cutting of the templates from the substrate at step <b>504</b> are guided by an alignment process of laser head <b>702</b> by imaging alignment marks <b>604</b> and <b>605</b> by camera <b>704</b> and controlling the position of laser head <b>702</b> using vision control system <b>706</b>. In some embodiments, the cutting process of steps <b>503</b> and <b>504</b> can produce 5 to 10 electronics design tools per minute.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">CONCLUSIONS</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0068">It will be appreciated that the electronics design tool described above assists users in constructing electronic circuits by indicating where electronics components shall be placed on an electronics &#x201c;breadboard.&#x201d; The card is printed with colour graphics that represent electronics components, and cut with the appropriate pattern to match the connection pattern of these electronics components. Useful information is printed directly onto the card to ease points of confusion during the assembly process.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0069">The combination of the precision cut substrate to match the breadboard, combined with the printed indicia allow the location of electronics components to be easily identified and connected together. Guidance for specific points of confusion are also printed on the substrate, contributing to a user's comprehension of electronics components. In using the electronics design tool described above, there is no need for a user to reference back and forth between a manual or tutorial.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0070">Overlaying the tool on a breadboard reduces &#x2018;visual noise&#x2019; by eliminating the regular pattern of breadboard connection points. Further, this overlaying gives a clear visual indication that a component is missing, since a component covers a corresponding illustration. This is particularly useful for users with limited vision. The design printed on each tool also shows relevant &#x2018;hidden&#x2019; connections that exist within the breadboard, invisible to the user. These connections are often a point of confusion for beginners.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">INTERPRETATION</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0071">Reference throughout this specification to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;some embodiments&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; means that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present disclosure.
