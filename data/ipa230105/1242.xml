Thus, airborne firefighting systems should be relatively small and lightweight, simple and safe to operate, with minimum impediments to government certification, while providing the longest possible endurance and the best possible effectiveness at a fire location.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Compressed Air Foam Systems (OAFS) are known in the firefighting industry for fighting fires from vehicles and platforms on the ground. Such systems include the use of a foaming agent that when combined or mixed with water, enhances the fire suppression capability of water alone. For example, when dispensed onto a fire, a water/foam mixture compared to water alone has the advantage of adhering to horizontal and vertical surfaces of a structure for long duration fire retardancy, acting as a surfactant thereby preventing re-ignition of the fire, in the case of a multi-story building, limiting water damage to the floors below the fire, and magnifying the fire suppression qualities of water by up to seven times.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Known OAFS systems for ground-based vehicles and firefighting platforms may include compressed air or inert gas injected into the water/foam mixture to aerate the water/foam mixture and to eject the water/foam mixture from a nozzle at relatively high velocities toward a relatively distant target. Compressed air or inert gas for this purpose is usually provided in the form of pressurized tanks or bottles or by one or more mechanical air compressors.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, use of pressurized tanks or bottles or air compressors as a source for pressurized air can consume valuable space and energy resources on an airborne vehicle, are relatively heavy thereby reducing the payload available for consumable fluids such as water, foam, and fuel, and increase the risk of accidents due to the hazards associated with pressurized systems. In addition, pressurized tanks must be attached securely to an airframe, which may lengthen turnaround times when replacing depleted air tanks. Moreover, structural and weight limitations prevent pressurization of one or more water tanks carried aboard aircraft or rotorcraft where pressurized water tanks would otherwise be usable for propelling water or a water/foam mixture toward a distant target.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed is a firefighting system configured for use in airborne vehicles, which overcomes the aforementioned limitations of existing OAFS systems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A fire suppression apparatus for fighting fires from a vehicle configured for flight is disclosed, comprising a fire retardant comprising a foam mixed with water, a foam proportioner for mixing the foam with the water at a selectable foam to water ratio, a gas generator for generating a gas for expelling the fire retardant from the vehicle toward a fire, the gas formed from the combustion of a fuel and an oxidizer in a combustion chamber associated with the gas generator, the combustion chamber comprising no moving parts, and an aimable boom comprising a nozzle on a distal end of the boom from which the fire retardant is dispensable toward the fire.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The foam proportioner of the fire suppression apparatus may be configured to receive the gas generated from the gas generator for injection into the fire retardant for expelling the fire retardant from the boom. The foam to water ratio of the fire suppression apparatus may range from approximately 0.1% to approximately 10.0%. The foam to water ratio of the fire suppression apparatus may range from approximately 0.4% to approximately 1.0%.

System <b>10</b> comprises water tank <b>20</b> and foam tank <b>30</b> for storing water <b>24</b> and foam (or foam concentrate) <b>34</b>, respectively, for use in creating a water/foam mixture for use in fighting fires. In a configuration of system <b>10</b>, foam tank <b>30</b> comprises approximately 5% to approximately 10% by volume of the amount of water carried in water tank <b>20</b>. A suitable foam is Phos-Chek&#xae; WD881 Class A Foam, which is available from ICL Performance Products LP of St. Louis, Mo.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Water <b>24</b> from water tank <b>20</b> and foam or foam concentrate <b>34</b> from foam tank <b>30</b> is brought together in foam proportioner <b>90</b> and mixed therein. System <b>10</b> includes water pump <b>22</b> and foam pump <b>32</b> connected to water tank <b>20</b> and foam tank <b>30</b>, respectively, for drawing water <b>24</b> and foam or foam concentrate <b>34</b> from water tank <b>20</b> and foam tank <b>30</b>, respectively, and for delivery of the water <b>24</b> and foam or foam concentrate <b>34</b> to foam proportioner <b>90</b> at a relatively large volumetric rate. Water pump <b>22</b> may be sized and configured to draw water <b>24</b> from water tank <b>20</b> and deliver it to foam proportioner <b>90</b> at a rate of approximately 20 to approximately 150 gallons per minute (gpm).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Foam proportioner <b>90</b> may be configured to selectively and automatically provide a desired ratio of foam to water ranging from approximately 0.1% to approximately 10.0%, and preferably from 0.4% to approximately 1.0%. Foam proportioner controller <b>92</b> connected to foam proportioner <b>90</b> provides an operator with the ability to select or otherwise input a desired foam to water ratio provided by foam proportioner <b>90</b> during operation of system <b>10</b>. In one embodiment, foam proportioner <b>90</b> is configured to provide one of a number of pre-set foam to water ratios according to the water/foam coverage needs on a fire. A suitable foam proportioner <b>90</b> for system <b>10</b> is a 2000 series unit available from Pentair Water&#x2014;FoamPro of New Brighton, MN 55112.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">System <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also shows fuel tank <b>40</b> and oxidizer tank <b>60</b> for storing a fuel and an oxidizer, respectively, onboard the aerial vehicle. Fuel <b>44</b> from fuel tank <b>40</b> and oxidizer <b>64</b> from oxidizer tank <b>60</b> may be brought together and ignited in gas generator <b>70</b> to form a substantial volume of exhaust gases <b>80</b> for injection into the water/foam mixture via foam proportioner <b>90</b>. In one embodiment, exhaust gases <b>80</b> may be supplied to foam proportioner <b>90</b> at a rate of approximately 70 cubic feet per minute (CFM).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, gas generator <b>70</b> may include injector <b>72</b> for receiving and injecting fuel <b>44</b> and oxidizer <b>64</b> into combustion chamber <b>74</b>. To inject fuel <b>44</b> and oxidizer <b>64</b> into combustion chamber <b>74</b>, injector <b>72</b> may comprise injector elements, such as injector posts, for each of fuel <b>44</b> and oxidizer <b>64</b>. Injector <b>72</b> may further comprise one or more features to help achieve stable combustion of fuel <b>44</b> and oxidizer <b>64</b>, such as a baffle apparatus. In one embodiment, a baffle apparatus may be formed by arranging fuel and/or oxidizer injector elements, such as injector posts, to form one or more baffles inside a fuel/oxidizer mixing zone of combustion chamber <b>74</b> to help achieve stable combustion of fuel <b>44</b> and oxidizer <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Depending on the characteristics of fuel <b>44</b> and oxidizer <b>64</b>, fuel <b>44</b> and oxidizer <b>64</b> may spontaneously or hypergolically ignite upon contact with one another in combustion chamber <b>74</b> or may be caused to ignite using an external energy source, such as a glow plug, a spark plug, or a pyrotechnic device. In one embodiment, fuel <b>44</b> and oxidizer <b>64</b> exist in liquid form, but either may be used in any combination of solids, liquids or gases or hybrids of these without departing from the scope or principles of the instant disclosure.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Gas generator controller <b>76</b> is connected to gas generator <b>70</b> for monitoring and automatically adjusting the mixture ratio of fuel <b>44</b> to oxidizer <b>64</b> by opening and closing one or more fuel and/or oxidizer valves. Gas generator controller <b>76</b> may be configured to monitor and control characteristics of the combustion process, such as temperatures, pressures and composition of combustion products, and the gas flow rate and delivery of exhaust gases <b>80</b> to foam proportioner <b>90</b>. Gas generator controller <b>76</b> may be configured to automatically and safely terminate the combustion process upon the occurrence of an event, such as the receipt of a signal corresponding to low fuel or oxidizer levels or of a signal or a command, such as one initiated by an operator or as a result of a sensor reading, by automatically closing the one or more fuel and/or oxidizer valves in a predetermined sequence, timing, and rate to cease delivery of fuel <b>44</b> and/or oxidizer <b>64</b> to gas generator <b>70</b>. Gas generator controller <b>76</b> may be configured for open loop or closed loop control of these elements and functions. In one embodiment, gas generator controller <b>76</b> is configured to automatically terminate the combustion process upon loss of vehicle electrical power, as may occur as a result of an in-flight shutdown of one or more flight-sustaining engines of the aerial vehicle or the shutdown of one or more onboard engines or auxiliary power units (APU's). System <b>10</b> can be configured to automatically reconfigure itself into a &#x201c;safe&#x201d; mode to cease dispensing the water/foam mixture, to cease combustion in gas generator <b>70</b>, and to stow boom <b>100</b> (discussed below) to minimize workload of the occupants of the vehicle in the event of, for example, an emergency involving the aerial vehicle.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Turning again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, system <b>10</b> may include fuel pump <b>42</b> and oxidizer pump <b>62</b> connected to fuel tank <b>40</b> and oxidizer tank <b>60</b>, respectively, for drawing fuel <b>44</b> and oxidizer <b>64</b> from fuel tank <b>40</b> and oxidizer tank <b>60</b>, respectively, and delivery of fuel <b>44</b> and oxidizer <b>64</b> to gas generator <b>70</b> at a relatively large volumetric rate. Fuel <b>44</b> and/or oxidizer <b>64</b> may alternatively be gravity fed or pressure fed to gas generator <b>70</b> if, for example, fuel tank <b>40</b> and/or oxidizer tank <b>60</b> are either pressurized or are configured for gravity delivery of the fluids from therein.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In situations where a foam proportioner is not needed or desired, foam or foam concentrate <b>34</b> may alternatively be premixed with water <b>24</b> at a predetermined ratio to form a batch, which may be carried onboard the aerial vehicle in a water/foam tank. In this situation, exhaust gases <b>80</b> may be brought together and mixed with a flow of the water/foam mixture to propel the water/foam/gas mixture from boom <b>100</b> toward a target.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Upon exiting foam proportioner <b>90</b>, the mixed water/foam/exhaust gas mixture <b>98</b> is then delivered to boom <b>100</b> and dispensed from boom <b>100</b> via nozzle <b>130</b> toward the aim point of boom <b>100</b>. Exhaust gases <b>80</b> aid in the formation of bubbles in boom <b>100</b> and increase the distance at which the water/foam mixture is discharged from nozzle <b>130</b>. Boom <b>100</b> may incorporate lightweight materials and geometry uniquely suited to permit a relatively lengthy boom <b>100</b> while providing a flow rate of fluids therefrom sufficient to suppress a fire located a substantial distance away from the vehicle. For example, boom <b>100</b> may be configured from one or more pieces and may be constructed of a composite material to provide sufficient rigidity to withstand excessive bending or deflection along its length, especially in the presence of, for example, rotor downwash when installed on a helicopter.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Boom <b>100</b> may also be configured to extend beyond the rotor tip diameter of a helicopter, for example, to avoid undesirable, pre-dispersion or atomization of the water/foam mixture. In one embodiment, boom <b>100</b> is approximately 6.7 to 7.3 meters long and extends at least approximately 1 meter past the rotor tip. At least the distal end of boom <b>100</b> may be constructed of one or more materials that provide electrical insulating properties to prevent the conduction and transmission of electricity should boom <b>100</b> be used in or near electrical power lines, for example, such as when fighting fires situated in close proximity to electrical power lines or when cleaning power line insulators on electrical power line towers. Besides composite materials, boom <b>100</b> may be constructed from other materials that provide the foregoing and other desirable properties and functionality, including wound carbon fiber and fiberglass, matt resin, and aluminum, among others. In view of its length beyond the rotor tip, boom <b>100</b> may be formed into a relatively light yet strong and deflection resistant structure to avoid excessive shifting of the center of gravity of the aerial vehicle and to avoid deflection of the distal tip of boom <b>100</b> into the path of the rotor blades.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Boom <b>100</b> may be constructed to permit its telescoping extension and retraction to, for example, provide compact stowage during ground operations and during flight while also providing the ability to position the distal end of nozzle <b>130</b> beyond the rotor tip while in use and on station at the location of a fire. Boom <b>100</b> may alternatively be constructed as a fixed length.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Boom <b>100</b> may be configured to operate in a &#x201c;wet&#x201d; configuration or in a &#x201c;dry&#x201d; configuration. For operation in a &#x201c;wet&#x201d; configuration, the working fluid, such as a water/foam mixture, is communicated through boom <b>100</b> to nozzle <b>130</b> and &#x201c;wets&#x201d; the internal surfaces of boom <b>100</b>. By contrast, boom <b>100</b> may be configured in a &#x201c;dry&#x201d; configuration in which an internal hose communicates the working fluid therein to nozzle <b>130</b>. A &#x201c;dry&#x201d; configuration involving an internal hose may not easily allow boom <b>100</b> to also be of a telescoping configuration, whereas boom <b>100</b> having a &#x201c;wet&#x201d; configuration coupled with a telescoping configuration may lead to binding of or leakage through telescoping elements of boom <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">System <b>10</b> may be configured to include two or more of booms <b>100</b> for dispensing fluids at multiple aim points or for increasing the volume and/or rate of dispensed fluids from a single aerial vehicle. The one or more booms <b>100</b> may be deployed toward the side of the aerial vehicle or toward the front of the aerial vehicle. Sideward deployment of boom <b>100</b> may reduce pilot workload if a dedicated operator of system <b>10</b> is located on the aerial vehicle or is remotely operating system <b>10</b> thereby allowing the pilot to fly the vehicle while also improving the firefighters' ability to target the fire independent of vehicle movement. Sideward deployment helps the pilot position and orient the vehicle to obtain optimum flight characteristics, and facilitates use of emergency escape routes because the vehicle is pointing away from the fire, potentially in the direction of intended travel. By contrast, forward deployment of boom <b>100</b> in a rotorcraft can negatively impact rotorcraft stability because a tail wind may be created by the consumption of air by the fire.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">System <b>10</b> may be configured to deliver the water/foam mixture from nozzle <b>130</b> at relatively low pressure but at relatively high volumes to suppress a fire downrange. The pressure for low pressure configurations of system <b>10</b> may range from approximately 50 to approximately 200 pounds per square inch (psi), depending on how far downrange the water/foam mixture or other fluid is desired to be delivered. In one embodiment, system <b>10</b> is configured to deliver the water/foam mixture from nozzle <b>130</b> at approximately 125 psi at a flow rate of approximately 150 gpm to a distance of approximately 132 feet from nozzle <b>130</b>, which corresponds to approximately 150 feet from the proximal end of boom <b>100</b> if boom <b>100</b> is approximately 7 meters long. In this way, system <b>10</b> may be used to suppress fires at a significant distance from the firefighting platform, including buildings located in urban areas, such as high rise buildings and warehouses. In another one embodiment, system <b>10</b> is configured to deliver the water/foam mixture from nozzle <b>130</b> at approximately 125 psi at a flow rate of approximately 20 gpm to a distance of approximately 65 feet from nozzle <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">System <b>10</b> may alternatively be configured to provide relatively low volumes of fluid at relatively high pressure to, for example, be used for pinpoint cleaning of insulators on electrical high tension wire towers, for cleaning windmills and the like, or for deicing structures, vehicles and the like. In one embodiment, system <b>10</b> may be configured for cleaning of high tension wire insulators to deliver a fluid from nozzle <b>130</b> at approximately 1500 psi to provide approximately 5.5 to approximately 6.0 gpm to a distance of approximately 12 to approximately 14 feet from nozzle <b>130</b>, which exceeds the distance currently provided by known cleaning systems of approximately 3 to approximately 6 feet from a nozzle.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one embodiment, system <b>10</b> includes a winch driven, manually operated, boom system with handlebars for manually guiding boom <b>100</b> left, right, up, and down. Springs <b>111</b> and/or hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders may assist an operator of boom <b>100</b> to move boom <b>100</b> vertically.

Tank assembly <b>180</b> includes housing <b>238</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>14</b></figref>) for housing and/or supporting water tank <b>20</b> and foam tank <b>30</b>. Foam tank <b>30</b> may be mounted in, on, or to housing <b>238</b>, whereas water tank <b>20</b> is housed within housing <b>238</b>. In other embodiments, foam tank <b>30</b> may be housed elsewhere on system <b>200</b> or the aerial vehicle. Tank assembly <b>180</b> also includes foam pump <b>32</b>, which like foam tank <b>30</b>, may be mounted in, on, or to housing <b>238</b>, or may be mounted elsewhere on system <b>200</b> or the aerial vehicle. Using foam pump <b>32</b>, as directed by the operator using, for example, one of the controls discussed above at operator station <b>240</b>, foam or foam concentrate of a known amount is drawn from foam tank <b>30</b> and added to a known amount of water in water tank <b>20</b> to create a water/foam batch mixture having a desired concentration of foam to water ranging from approximately 1% to approximately 10%.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In a configuration of system <b>200</b>, foam tank <b>30</b> comprises approximately 5% to approximately 10% by volume of the amount of water carried in water tank <b>20</b>. As described above for system <b>10</b>, the foam to water ratio of system <b>200</b> may range from a wet foam to a dry foam of approximately 0.1% to approximately 10.0%, as directed by an operator of system <b>200</b>.

Powerpack <b>140</b> is configured to provide water/foam/gas mixture <b>98</b> to boom <b>100</b> at approximately 20 to approximately 150 gallons per minute (gpm). Enclosure <b>270</b> may be configured as a plurality of individually removable, lightweight yet sturdy panels or panel subassemblies to enclose or partially enclose powerpack <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>24</b></figref> better illustrate some of the components of powerpack <b>140</b> including gas generator <b>274</b>. Like gas generator <b>70</b> discussed above, gas generator <b>274</b> is configured to produce gas to aid in the creation of tightly-formed foam bubbles of an optimum size with water/foam solution <b>182</b> before ejection of the mixture from nozzle <b>130</b> of boom <b>100</b> and to aid in achieving the greatest possible distance of the water/foam/gas mixture downrange of nozzle <b>130</b>. To produce gas, gas generator <b>274</b> differs from gas generator <b>70</b> in that it includes a store of liquid nitrogen that is passed through a heat exchanger to cause the liquid nitrogen to rapidly reach its boiling point to produce nitrogen gas in an amount equal to approximately 700 times the volume of liquid nitrogen.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">More particularly, gas generator <b>274</b> of system <b>200</b> includes dewar <b>276</b> for receiving and storing a quantity of liquid nitrogen aboard the aerial vehicle. In one embodiment, dewar <b>276</b> having model number 10C-0012-75, which is available from Essex Aerospace, is an approximately 22 inch vessel that is capable of holding approximately 20 gallons of liquid nitrogen, and weighs approximately 85 lbs empty and approximately 275 lbs when filled with liquid nitrogen.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Dewar <b>276</b> includes a pressure build cycle to continuously pressurize the ullage space above the liquid nitrogen level for pressurized delivery of the liquid nitrogen to heat exchanger <b>278</b>, and includes safety devices such as one or more pressure relief valves and burst valves to prevent over pressurization of dewar <b>276</b>. To pressurize the liquid nitrogen, a valve at or near the bottom of dewar <b>276</b> is opened to allow a portion of the liquid nitrogen stored in dewar <b>276</b> to be directed to a heat exchanger built into or on dewar <b>276</b> to create nitrogen gas that is then returned to the top of dewar <b>276</b> to pressurize the ullage space. This process, together with one or more pressure relief valves, maintains a desired pressure in dewar <b>276</b> whenever liquid nitrogen is being drawn from dewar <b>276</b> during operation of system <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Upon opening valve <b>286</b>, as directed by an operator using, for example, one of the controls discussed above at operator station <b>240</b>, conduit <b>288</b> directs liquid nitrogen <b>287</b> from dewar <b>276</b> to coil <b>279</b> of heat exchanger <b>278</b>, which is shown with its housing removed for clarity. At the same time, water/foam solution <b>182</b> at ambient temperature from water tank <b>20</b> is drawn by water/foam pump <b>290</b> to inlet <b>294</b> and through heat exchanger <b>278</b> to cause liquid nitrogen <b>287</b> in coil <b>279</b> to rapidly reach its boiling point to generate nitrogen gas <b>289</b>. The water/foam solution <b>182</b> is then drawn by water/foam pump <b>290</b> via conduit <b>292</b> and expelled by water/foam pump <b>290</b> at discharge <b>296</b>. Nitrogen gas <b>289</b> exiting heat exchanger <b>278</b> is then injected into water/foam solution <b>182</b> downstream of water/foam pump <b>290</b> at point <b>284</b> in an amount of approximately 75 scfm and at approximately 150 psi. The injection of the 150 psi nitrogen gas <b>289</b> compresses water/foam solution <b>182</b> for delivery through conduit <b>266</b> to boom <b>100</b>. In addition, water/foam solution <b>182</b> exiting heat exchanger <b>278</b> may be slightly colder than ambient as a result of the heat exchange with the liquid nitrogen <b>287</b>, which may aid suppression of a fire when ejected from boom <b>100</b>. Dewar <b>276</b> having a 20 gallon liquid nitrogen capacity will provide approximately 75 scfm at approximately 150 psi of nitrogen gas <b>289</b> to provide approximately 1 hour of operation of system <b>200</b> on a target. Dewar <b>276</b> may be scaled in physical size and capacity, either larger or smaller, along with the other elements of system <b>200</b>, to accommodate the payload carrying capacity of the aerial vehicle on which it is mounted.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Water/foam pump <b>290</b> may be configured as a centrifugal pump with a radial outflow impeller <b>291</b>.

Electrical power to operate system <b>200</b>, including cannon assembly <b>210</b>, operator station <b>240</b>, and powerpack <b>140</b> including electric motor <b>272</b>, may be obtained from the electrical bus of the aerial vehicle, from an electrical generator connected to the engine or transmission of the aerial vehicle, or from an auxiliary power unit (APU). In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>24</b></figref>, electric motor <b>272</b> is configured to turn at approximately 8000 RPM, while water/foam pump <b>290</b> is configured to turn at a rated speed of approximately 9400 RPM. Consequently, to operate water/foam pump <b>290</b> at maximum rated speed without overspeeding electric motor <b>272</b>, electric motor <b>272</b> may be coupled to a gearbox, which in turn, may be coupled to water/foam pump <b>290</b>.

At an approximately 0.5% foam to water ratio, system <b>200</b> having this configuration is capable of 5 minutes of use on-station.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, there is shown a schematic of another embodiment of system <b>200</b> including tank assembly <b>180</b>, powerpack <b>140</b>, and cannon assembly <b>210</b>. In this embodiment, powerpack <b>140</b> includes gas generator <b>310</b>, which unlike gas generator <b>274</b>, which generates nitrogen gas <b>289</b> to compress water/foam solution <b>182</b>, water/foam pump <b>290</b> of gas generator <b>310</b> draws in atmospheric air and pressurizes the air along with water/foam solution <b>182</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>, system <b>200</b> incorporating gas generator <b>310</b> provides for a more compact powerpack <b>140</b> and reduces weight and system complexity over system <b>200</b> incorporating gas generator <b>274</b>, but potentially with a slight decrease in quality of foam due to slightly less air volume to pressurize water/foam mixture <b>182</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">More particularly, gas generator <b>310</b> of system <b>200</b> includes adjustable air induction valve <b>315</b> connected to water/foam pump <b>290</b>, which is driven by electric motor <b>272</b>. As directed by an operator using, for example, one of the controls discussed above at operator station <b>240</b>, water/foam pump <b>290</b> is triggered &#x201c;on&#x201d; to draw water/foam solution <b>182</b> from water tank <b>20</b>. At the same time, air induction valve <b>315</b> may be automatically or manually commanded to its &#x201c;open&#x201d; position, whereby atmospheric air <b>316</b> is drawn into the suction side of water/foam pump <b>290</b> at point <b>320</b> at the rate of approximately 30 CFM to approximately 50 CFM. In one embodiment, air induction valve <b>315</b> comprises an electrically variable valve opening, controllable by an operator, to vary the amount of air introduced into the suction side of water/foam pump <b>290</b> while water/foam pump <b>290</b> is driven at a constant speed.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Water/foam pump <b>290</b> then pressurizes air <b>316</b> along with water/foam solution <b>182</b> to approximately 125 psi and expels the pressurized water/foam/air solution <b>325</b> at discharge <b>296</b> at approximately 150 gpm. The introduction of air <b>316</b> by system <b>200</b> for mixing with and pressurization of water/foam solution <b>182</b> for delivery through conduit <b>266</b> to boom <b>100</b> aids in the creation of tightly-formed foam bubbles of an optimum size before ejection of the mixture from nozzle <b>130</b> of boom <b>100</b> and to aid in achieving the greatest possible distance of the mixture downrange of nozzle <b>130</b>. Because water/foam pump <b>290</b> turns at a relatively high speed of approximately 9400 RPM, it does not appreciably lose suction when drawing in the approximately 30-50 CFM of air <b>316</b> along with water/foam solution <b>182</b>. And because air <b>316</b> is a limitless resource when drawn from the atmosphere, time on-station over a target, such as a fire, would be limited to the amount of other consumables carried aboard the aerial vehicle, such as water, foam, or fuel. Consequently, system <b>200</b> including gas generator <b>310</b> provides a simplified, highly efficient means for providing compressed air foam aboard aerial vehicles for use in engaging a target.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In one embodiment of system <b>200</b> comprising gas generator <b>310</b>, where water tank <b>20</b> is sized to hold approximately <b>800</b> gallons of water, foam tank <b>30</b> is sized to hold approximately 80 gallons of foam or foam concentrate, the dry weight of system <b>200</b> is approximately 1015 lbs, and when fully loaded with consumables, such as water and foam, the weight of system <b>200</b> is approximately 7580 lbs.
