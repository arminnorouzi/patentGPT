A class 2 circuit has sufficiently low voltage and current limitations such that the cables in the circuit do not have to be housed in raceway and conduit when they traverse the surface of a building. An NEC class 1 circuit can carry higher voltages and current, but the cables in such a circuit must be housed in raceway or conduit when they traverse the surface of a building. While different cables for different class 1 circuits can be routed together through common raceway and conduit, class 1 and class 2 circuits must be isolated from each other.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, electrical cable manufacturers have started offering cables for use in NEC class 1 circuits that include power wires for transmitting line power 110-120V AC as well as low-voltage wires for transmitting a 0-10V dimming signal. The overall cable is rated for use in class 1 circuits.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Controllers for lighting control systems such as The Watt Stopper Inc.'s Digital Lighting Management system typically include inputs for line power and one or more sensors, such as occupancy and vacancy sensors. The line power is connected to one or more outputs for lighting loads within the controller through internal relays so that the lighting loads can be turned on or off based upon the status of the sensors. The controllers also typically include an output for a 0-10V dimming signal. The output is typically only suitable for a connection to a cable that is part of a class 2 circuit.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The devices and methods described below provide for a hybrid dimming controller for a lighting control system providing isolated class 1 and class 2 dimming outputs. The controller has two NEC class 1 outputs for providing independent low-voltage dimming-control signals for two lighting loads and two NEC class 2 outputs for providing the same two independent dimming control-signals for the lighting loads. Thus, the controller has both a class 1 and a class 2 output for delivering the same dimming-control signal for each of the two lighting loads while maintaining within the controller the isolation that is required between class 1 and class 2 circuits. This provides an installer with greater flexibility when performing an installation of a lighting control system. The installer can choose to route the cable or wires transmitting the dimming signal through conduit or raceway for the class 1 circuits or could instead choose to route the cable or wires transmitting the dimming signal outside of such conduit or raceway.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The low-voltage dimming control signal may be a 0-10V signal. A subset of the class 2 outputs may be in the form of a class 2 connector. Each of the class 1 outputs may be in the form of two low-voltage wires, each of which has sufficient insulation for a class 1 circuit.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front perspective view of a controller for a lighting control system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a rear perspective view of the controller of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a rear exploded perspective view of the controller of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a first portion of circuitry in the controller of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a second portion of circuitry in the controller of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a controller <b>100</b> for a lighting control system according to the present disclosure. The controller <b>100</b> can communicate directly or through a network with one or more sensors (not shown) and can turn-on, turn-off, or change the intensity of, i.e., dim, two lighting loads, hereafter referred to as lighting loads A and B, according to the status of one or more of the sensors. Each of lighting loads A and B can be a single light source or a group of connected light sources. The sensors can be, for example, occupancy or vacancy sensors of the passive infrared or ultrasound type. Controller <b>100</b> includes a housing <b>110</b>. The top surface of housing <b>110</b> includes three buttons, switches or other suitable controllers <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, and <b>116</b>, and corresponding LEDs <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>. Buttons <b>116</b> and <b>114</b> are for manually connecting and disconnecting lighting loads A and B, respectively, to AC power via relays <b>164</b> and <b>166</b> inside of the controller <b>100</b> which are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. LEDs <b>122</b>, <b>120</b> each indicate the status of, respectively, the relay for loads A and B, i.e., whether or not that relay is in a power-connection state. Button <b>112</b> is for controller configuration. Button <b>112</b> can be used to put the controller into a learn mode. LED <b>118</b> adjacent to button <b>112</b> blinks periodically, for example once every three seconds, when the controller's communication channel is operating properly.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The front of controller <b>100</b> includes two network ports <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>.

Connector <b>128</b> can output a 0-10V dimming-control signal for lighting load A, and connector <b>130</b> can output a 0-10V dimming-control signal for lighting load B. Two low-voltage wires connected to connector <b>128</b> or connector <b>130</b> can transmit a dimming-control signal to the appropriate dimming device for the lighting load, for example, an LED driver or a ballast for fluorescent lighting. Thus, through connectors <b>128</b>, <b>130</b>, controller <b>100</b> can provide two independent dimming-control signals for independent dimming control of two lighting loads or two groups of lighting loads.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a rear perspective view of the controller <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The rear side of controller <b>100</b> includes a knock-out (&#x201c;KO&#x201d;) nipple <b>102</b> having threads on its outer surface. The KO nipple can be used to mount the controller <b>100</b> to, for example, an opening in a high-voltage electrical box. Exiting the controller <b>100</b> through the KO nipples are five wires. Power wires <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, and <b>136</b> are respectively for input power, output power for lighting load A, and output power for lighting load B. Power wire <b>138</b> is a neutral wire that is shared by lighting loads A and B. Low voltage wires <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> are for providing a 0-10V dimming-control signal for lighting load A. Low voltage wires <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> carry the exact same dimming-control signal that is output by connector <b>128</b>. In this way, an installer of a lighting control system can choose to deliver the dimming-control signal via the class 1 wires <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, which can travel in common enclosed spaces with other class 1 wires, including AC power wires, or via class 2 wires or a class 2 cable. This option provides the installer with greater flexibility when making the installation.

As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, inside of cover <b>112</b> of controller <b>100</b> there is a first circuit board <b>160</b> and a second circuit board <b>162</b>. Circuit board <b>160</b> primarily holds components that transmit and affect AC power, although it also contains circuits that transmit DC signals. Relays <b>164</b> and <b>166</b> are mounted to first circuit board <b>160</b>. Relays <b>164</b>, <b>166</b> can be individually opened and closed to, in the case of relay <b>164</b>, connect the AC power to the lighting load A, or, in the case of relay <b>166</b>, to connect AC power to lighting load B. Second circuit board <b>162</b> primarily holds components that transmit and condition DC power signals, including the logic signals input and output from the controller's main processor, as well as the class 2 circuits. Using separate boards helps to maintain the separation between class 1 and class 2 circuits that is required by the NEC.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a schematic of part of the circuitry located on the AC circuit board <b>160</b> in the controller <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A high-voltage pulsating signal passes through the input coil <b>204</b> of a transformer <b>202</b>. Input coil <b>204</b> is part of a class 1 circuit and therefore is able to carry the high-voltage signal. The transformer has three output coils <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>. The pulsating signal passing through input coil <b>204</b> induces a <b>12</b>V pulsating signal in both coils <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>. The <b>12</b>V pulsating signal in coil <b>206</b> is used for the generation of the dimming signals that is suitable for class 1 transmission and the 12V pulsating signal in coil <b>208</b> is used for the generation of the dimming signals that are suitable for class 2 transmission. Thus, through the use of a transformer a high-voltage signal that can only be transmitted in a class 1 circuit can be used to generate a suitable signal for use in low-voltage class 2 circuits without violating the requirement that class 1 and class 2 circuits be isolated from each other. The pulsating signal passing through input coil <b>204</b> induces a 24V pulsating signal in coil <b>210</b> that is used for powering the main processor and other logic circuits and for energizing the relays <b>164</b>, <b>166</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a schematic of circuitry <b>300</b> that is used to condition a 12V DC signal into a 0-10V DC dimming-control signal. Controller <b>100</b> contains four sets of circuitry <b>300</b>, two sets on circuit board <b>160</b> and two sets on circuit board <b>162</b>. One of the sets of circuitry <b>300</b> on each of first and second circuit boards <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> is for generating a dimming-control signal for load A. The dimming-control signal for lighting load A generated on first circuit board <b>160</b> is the exact same as the dimming-control signal for lighting load A generated on the second circuit board <b>162</b>. The other of the sets of circuitry <b>300</b> on each of first and second circuit boards <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> is for generating a dimming-control signal for load B. The dimming-control signal for lighting load B generated on first circuit board <b>160</b> is the exact same as the dimming-control signal for lighting load B generated on the second circuit board <b>162</b>. In the case of the two sets of circuitry <b>300</b> on first circuit board <b>160</b>, the 12V DC signal is created by conditioning the 12V pulsating signal generated in output coil <b>206</b> of transformer <b>202</b>. In the case of the circuitry <b>300</b> on second circuit board <b>162</b>, the 12V DC signal is created by conditioning the 12V pulsating signal generated in output coil <b>208</b> of transformer <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The particular level of the 0-10V signal output from circuitry <b>300</b> is determined by a pulse-width-modulated (&#x201c;PWM&#x201d;) signal output by the main processor of controller <b>100</b>. The duty cycle of the PWM signal determines the ultimate value of the 0-10V signal. That PWM signal is inputted to circuitry <b>300</b> at <b>310</b>. A first PWM signal is input to both the circuit <b>300</b> on first circuit board <b>160</b> for lighting load A and the circuit <b>300</b> on the second circuit board <b>162</b> for lighting load A. However, for the circuitry <b>300</b> on first circuit board <b>160</b>, that PWM input signal cannot directly interact with the rest of the conditioning circuit without interconnecting class 1 circuitry with a low-voltage digital-logic circuitry (the circuitry for the processors). Instead, the PWM input signal is passed through the input of the opto-coupler <b>312</b>, which is part of the digital logic circuitry. The output of the opto-coupler <b>312</b> is part of the class 1 circuitry. The opto-coupler is able to reproduce the signal on its input at its output while maintaining isolation between the input and output by using light energy. Once the signal is transmitted to the class 1 circuitry it can be used to condition a 12V DC signal into a 0-10V DC signal that is related to the duty-cycle of the PWM signal using standard circuit components in a manner that will be apparent to a person having ordinary skill in the art. The circuit components include one or more operational amplifiers <b>314</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The same input PWM signal input to the circuitry <b>300</b> for load A on circuit board <b>160</b> is input to the circuitry <b>300</b> for load A on circuit board <b>162</b>, where it is also transmitted via an opto-coupler, but this time to class 2 circuitry. The result is a class 2 dimming-control signal for load A on circuit board <b>162</b> that is the exact same as the class 1 dimming-control signal for load A that is generated on circuit board <b>160</b>. Similarly, a second input PWM signal can be input to both the circuitry <b>300</b> for load B on circuit board <b>160</b> and the circuitry <b>300</b> for load B on circuit board <b>162</b>. The result is a dimming-control signal for load B generated on circuit board <b>160</b> that is appropriate for class 1 transmission and an identical dimming-control signal for load B generated on circuit board <b>162</b> that is appropriate for class 2 transmission. In this manner, a single PWM input signal can generate a dimming-control signal in a class 1 circuit and the exact same dimming-control signal in a class 2 circuit without violating the separation required between class 1 and class 2 circuits.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Class 1 and class 2 circuits are defined by the National Electrical Code.
