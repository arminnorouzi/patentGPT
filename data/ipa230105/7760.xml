In the axial direction, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the gear portion <b>3</b> side is defined as one axial side D<b>1</b>, and the motor portion <b>2</b> side is defined as the other axial side D<b>2</b>. In addition, a radial direction orthogonal to a predetermined axis, such as the rotation axis J<b>1</b>, is simply referred to as a &#x201c;radial direction&#x201d;, and a circumferential direction around the predetermined axis, such as the rotation axis J<b>1</b>, is simply referred to as a &#x201c;circumferential direction&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the present specification, in the positional relationship between any one of orientations, lines, and surfaces and another one, the term &#x201c;parallel&#x201d; means not only a state where both never cross each other no matter how long they extend, but also a state where both are substantially parallel. In addition, the term &#x201c;perpendicular&#x201d; includes not only a state where both intersect each other at 90 degrees, but also a state where both are substantially perpendicular. That is, the terms &#x201c;parallel&#x201d; and &#x201c;perpendicular&#x201d; each include a state where the positional relationship between both permits an angular deviation to a degree that does not depart from the gist of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the present specification, the term &#x201c;extending&#x201d; in a predetermined direction includes a configuration in which an extending direction is substantially the predetermined direction in addition to a configuration in which the extending direction is strictly the predetermined direction. That is, the term &#x201c;extending&#x201d; in the predetermined direction includes a configuration in which there is a directional deviation from the predetermined direction to an extent that does not depart from the gist of the present invention.

The drive device <b>100</b> is used as the power source of the above-described vehicle <b>300</b>. The vehicle <b>300</b> has the drive device <b>100</b>. Since the drive device <b>100</b> is installed, the drive device <b>100</b> of the vehicle <b>300</b> including a neutralizing mechanism between a shaft <b>1</b> and a housing <b>4</b> can be downsized. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the drive device <b>100</b> drives front wheels of the vehicle <b>300</b>. Note that, the drive device <b>100</b> may drive at least any of the wheels. In addition, the vehicle <b>300</b> further includes a battery <b>200</b>. The battery <b>200</b> stores electric power to be supplied to the drive device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the drive device <b>100</b> includes a shaft <b>1</b>, a motor portion <b>2</b>, a gear portion <b>3</b>, a housing <b>4</b>, a liquid circulation portion <b>5</b>, a neutralizing device <b>6</b>, a rotation detector <b>7</b>, a first seal member <b>81</b>, and a second seal member <b>82</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The shaft <b>1</b> axially extends along the rotation axis J<b>1</b>. As described above, the drive device <b>100</b> includes the shaft <b>1</b>. The shaft <b>1</b> is rotatable about the rotation axis J<b>1</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the shaft <b>1</b> is rotatably supported by the housing <b>4</b> via a first motor bearing <b>4211</b>, a second motor bearing <b>4221</b>, a third motor bearing <b>4311</b>, and a fourth motor bearing <b>4611</b> to be described later. That is, the drive device <b>100</b> includes these bearings <b>4211</b>, <b>4221</b>, <b>4311</b>, and <b>4611</b>. These bearings <b>4211</b>, <b>4221</b>, <b>4311</b>, and <b>4611</b> rotatably support the shaft <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The shaft <b>1</b> has a tubular shape extending in the axial direction. A fluid F flows inside the shaft <b>1</b>. The drive device <b>100</b> further includes this fluid F. Note that the fluid F is a lubricant that lubricates the gear portion <b>3</b> and the bearings of the drive device <b>100</b>, and is, for example, an automatic transmission fluid (ATF) in the present preferred embodiment. In addition, the fluid F is used as a refrigerant for cooling the motor portion <b>2</b> and the like. As the shaft <b>1</b> rotates, the fluid F flowing inside the shaft <b>1</b> can be supplied to the motor portion <b>2</b>, the first motor bearing <b>4211</b>, the third motor bearing <b>4311</b>, and the like through a first shaft through-hole <b>101</b> to be described later. Therefore, a stator <b>22</b> (particularly, a coil end <b>2221</b> to be described later), the above-described bearings <b>4211</b> and <b>4311</b>, and the like can be cooled by the fluid F.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Note that the shaft <b>1</b> may be dividable, for example, at an intermediate portion in the axial direction. When the shaft <b>1</b> is dividable, the divided shafts <b>1</b> are connected by spline fitting, for example. Alternatively, the divided shafts <b>1</b> may be connected by screw coupling using a male screw and a female screw, or may be joined by a fixing method such as press-fitting and welding. When the fixing method such as press-fitting or welding is adopted, serrations combining recesses and protrusions extending in the axial direction may be adopted. With such a configuration, it is possible to reliably transmit the rotation.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The shaft <b>1</b> includes a shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> having a tubular shape surrounding the rotation axis J<b>1</b>. The shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> has a tubular shape and extends in the axial direction along the rotation axis J<b>1</b>. The shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> has conductivity, and is made of metal in the present preferred embodiment. In addition, the shaft <b>1</b> includes a hollow portion <b>12</b> and an inlet <b>111</b>. The hollow portion <b>12</b> is a space surrounded by an inner peripheral surface of the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>, and is arranged inside the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>. The inlet <b>111</b> is one axial end portion of the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> having the tubular shape, and is connected to a flow passage <b>465</b> of a gear lid <b>46</b> to be described later. The fluid F flows from the flow passage <b>465</b> into the hollow portion <b>12</b> through the inlet <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Next, the shaft <b>1</b> further includes a shaft wall <b>13</b>. The shaft wall <b>13</b> is arranged inside the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> and expands in the radial direction. The shaft wall <b>13</b> is arranged on the other axial side D<b>2</b> of the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>. In the present preferred embodiment, one axial end portion of the shaft wall <b>13</b> is arranged on the one axial side D<b>1</b> with respect to the rotation detector <b>7</b> and the second seal member <b>82</b>. A radially outer end portion of the shaft wall <b>13</b> is connected to an inner surface of the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>. Preferably, the shaft wall <b>13</b> is integrated with the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>. For example, the shaft wall <b>13</b> and the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> are mutually different parts of the same member in the present preferred embodiment. Since the shaft wall <b>13</b> is integrated with the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>, the shaft <b>1</b> can be easily manufactured. In addition, the number of components of the shaft <b>1</b> can be reduced, and thus, the drive device <b>100</b> is easily assembled. However, the present invention is not limited to this example, and the shaft wall <b>13</b> may be a separate member from the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The first shaft through-hole <b>101</b> is arranged in the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>. That is, the shaft <b>1</b> further includes the first shaft through-hole <b>101</b> penetrating the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> in the radial direction. The number of first shaft through-holes <b>101</b> may be one or plural. When the shaft <b>1</b> rotates, the fluid F in the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> flows out from the hollow portion <b>12</b> to the outside of the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> through the first shaft through-hole <b>101</b> by centrifugal force. In the present preferred embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first shaft through-hole <b>101</b> is arranged on the other axial side D<b>2</b> with respect to one axial end portion of the rotor <b>21</b> and on the one axial side D<b>1</b> with respect to the other axial end portion of the rotor <b>21</b>, and is connected to a rotor through-hole <b>2111</b> to be described later. However, the present invention is not limited to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and the first shaft through-hole <b>101</b> may be arranged on the one axial side D<b>1</b> with respect to the one axial end portion of the rotor <b>21</b> and on the other axial side D<b>2</b> with respect to the first motor bearing <b>4211</b>, and may be arranged on the other axial side D<b>2</b> with respect to the other axial end portion of the rotor <b>21</b> and on the one axial side D<b>1</b> with respect to the third motor bearing <b>4311</b>. That is, at least a part of the first shaft through-hole <b>101</b> may be arranged in at least one of these positions. Note that the above-described example does not exclude a configuration in which the first shaft through-hole <b>101</b> and the rotor through-hole <b>2111</b> are omitted.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> is arranged in the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b>. The shaft <b>1</b> further includes the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b>. The second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> penetrates the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> in the radial direction. Alternatively, the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> may penetrate the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> in a direction intersecting the radial direction and the axial direction. Note that the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> is an example of a &#x201c;shaft through-hole&#x201d; of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The number of second shaft through-holes <b>102</b> may be one or plural. In the latter case, the second shaft through-holes <b>102</b> can be arranged at equal intervals or different intervals in the circumferential direction. Note that the above-described example does not exclude a configuration in which the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> is omitted.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the present preferred embodiment, the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> is arranged at the other axial side D<b>2</b> with respect to the first shaft through-hole <b>101</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). A radially outer end portion of the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> is connected to a third motor bearing holder <b>431</b>. A radially inner end portion of the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> is arranged on the one axial side D<b>1</b> with respect to the shaft wall <b>13</b> and is connected to the hollow portion <b>12</b>. Then, the fluid F flowing in the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> can be supplied to the third motor bearing <b>4311</b> through the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the present preferred embodiment, the one axial end portion of the shaft wall <b>13</b> is arranged on the one axial side D<b>1</b> with respect to the other axial end portion of the opening <b>4312</b>. Alternatively, the one axial end portion of the shaft wall <b>13</b> may be at the same axial position as the other axial end portion of the opening <b>4312</b>. Then, an interval between the radially inner end portion of the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> and the shaft wall <b>13</b> in the axial direction can be further narrowed. Therefore, for example, the fluid F flowing inside the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> toward the other axial side D<b>2</b> easily flows to the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b>, and the fluid F staying between the radially inner end portion of the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> and the shaft wall <b>13</b> further decreases. Thus, the fluid F in the shaft tubular portion <b>11</b> can be more smoothly supplied to the third motor bearing <b>4311</b>. However, the above-described example does not exclude a configuration in which the one axial end portion of the shaft wall <b>13</b> is arranged on the other axial side D<b>2</b> with respect to the other axial end portion of the opening <b>4312</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The radially outer end portion of the second shaft through-hole <b>102</b> is arranged on the other axial side D<b>2</b> with respect to the third motor bearing <b>4311</b>.
