This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms, and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. Also, in the drawings, the thickness, the ratio, and the dimensions of elements are exaggerated for an effective description of technical contents.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0034">In the present disclosure, when an element (or a region, a layer, a portion, etc.) is referred to as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element, it means that the element may be directly disposed on/connected to/coupled to the other element, or that a third element may be disposed therebetween. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; another element, there are no intervening elements present.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0035">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms, including &#x201c;at least one,&#x201d; unless the content clearly indicates otherwise. &#x201c;At least one&#x201d; is not to be construed as limiting &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an.&#x201d; &#x201c;Or&#x201d; means &#x201c;and/or.&#x201d; The term &#x201c;and/or,&#x201d; includes all combinations of one or more of which associated configurations may define.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0036">It will be understood that, although the terms &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first element could be termed a second element, and, similarly, a second element could be termed a first element, without departing from the scope of example embodiments of the inventive concept. The terms of a singular form may include plural forms unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0037">In addition, terms such as &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; and the like are used to describe the relationship of the configurations shown in the drawings. The terms are used as a relative concept and are described with reference to the direction indicated in the drawings. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as being on the &#x201c;lower&#x201d; side of other elements would then be oriented on &#x201c;upper&#x201d; sides of the other elements. The exemplary term &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; can therefore, encompasses both an orientation of &#x201c;lower&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; depending on the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements.

For example, an isocyanate group of the diisocyanate-based cross-linking agent and a hydroxyl group of the first monomer unit may react to form a urethane group by cross-linking. The diisocyanate-based cross-linking agent may be isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), toluene diisocyanate (TDI), or hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), but the embodiment of the inventive concept is not limited thereto is not limited thereto.

A polymerization reaction may occur actively at a high temperature above room temperature, and a protection group of a cross-linking agent may be released by a deprotection reaction when a specific temperature at which the polymerization reaction actively occurs is reached.

As the cross-linking agent, hexamethylene diisocyanate which protects an isocyanate group with a protection group was used in each of the Examples and Comparative Examples.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0129">The alcohol rubbing evaluation was performed by screen-printing a polymer resin on glass and then curing the printed polymer resin at 150&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes, followed by leaving the cured polymer resin for 24 hours, and then measuring the number of times of rubbing at which the polymer resin was completely peeled off using an alcohol rubbing machine under a load of 1000 grams (g). If the number of times of rubbing was greater than 150 times, the printed polymer was evaluated and determined to be good, i.e., acceptable.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0130">The cross-cutting evaluation was performed by screen-printing a polymer resin on glass and then curing the printed polymer resin at 150&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes, followed by leaving the cured polymer resin for 24 hours, and then scratching the same in a lattice of a certain width using a knife. Thereafter, tape was attached on the applied polymer resin and then peeled off at a constant speed. When the result of 4B or greater was derived, it was evaluated to be good or acceptable, and when the result of 3B or less was derived, it was evaluated to be poor or unacceptable.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0131">The light transmittance evaluation was performed by screen-printing a polymer resin on a glass and then curing the printed polymer resin at 150&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes, followed by leaving the cured polymer resin for 24 hours, and then measuring the transmittance of visible light at a wavelength of 540 nm.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0132">Example 1, Example 2, Comparative Example 1, and Comparative Example 2 are examples and comparative examples for determining an appropriate amount or wt % of a cross-linking agent. When the addition of the cross-linking agent was less than 20 wt % based on the total weight of the monomers, one observed a decrease in the alcohol rubbing number&#x2014;an indication of a reduction in the cross-linking density of the polymer resin and an observed decrease in chemical resistance or greater deterioration of the printed polymer resin. When the addition of the cross-linking agent was greater than 25 wt %, one observed a decrease in the light transmittance of the printed polymer resin.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0133">Example 3, and Comparative Example 3 to Comparative Example 6 are an example and comparative examples for determining the appropriate mole ratio of the monomers. Example 3 showed excellent results in all of the transmittance evaluation, alcohol rubbing evaluation, and cross-cutting evaluation. Referring to Comparative Example 3 and Comparative Example 4, when the second monomer and the third monomer are mixed in a ratio of 80 mol %, one observed a deterioration of cross-cutting properties such that hardness significantly increased resulting in a reduction in durability. Referring to Comparative Example 6, when butyl acrylate was added instead of the second monomer, epoxy acrylate, the alcohol rubbing number decreased indicating a reduction in the chemical resistance of the printed polymer. That is, referring to Comparative Example 6, it can be seen that the polymer resin does not exhibit good properties by simply lowering glass transition temperature (Tg), and that a predetermined amount of the second monomer should be included.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0134">Referring to Comparative Example, 5, although Comparative Example 5 showed excellent results in all of the transmittance evaluation, alcohol rubbing evaluation, and cross-cutting evaluation, the example exhibited poor properties in a yellowing evaluation, see Table 3 below.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="91pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="6" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Inorg.</entry><entry>Curing</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>Monomer ratio (moles)</entry><entry>particle</entry><entry>agent</entry><entry/><entry>Pencil</entry><entry>Cross-</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="10"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>HPA</entry><entry>EA</entry><entry>Styrene</entry><entry>IBOA</entry><entry>BaSO<sub>4</sub></entry><entry>(Solid 65%)</entry><entry>Yellow</entry><entry>hard.</entry><entry>cutting</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="9" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="10"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="14pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="10" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Example 2</entry><entry>20</entry><entry>20</entry><entry>30</entry><entry>30</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>25</entry><entry>0.1</entry><entry>3H</entry><entry>5B</entry></row><row><entry>Example 4</entry><entry>20</entry><entry>10</entry><entry>35</entry><entry>35</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>20</entry><entry>0.1</entry><entry>3H</entry><entry>4B</entry></row><row><entry>Comp.

When the change in color coordinates was less than 0.2, it was evaluated to be good or acceptable.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0137">For the evaluation of pencil hardness, pencils of indicated hardness were raised above a polymer resin printed on glass at an angle of 45 degrees, and the polymer resin was scratched at a rate of 100 (millimeters per minute (mm/min) with a force of 1 kilogram (kg) load. Thereafter, the damage to the surface of the polymer resin was visually confirmed and tested.

In other words, a screen-printed polymer with the range of mole percent of monomers above exhibits the desired properties of chemical resistance (relatively high alcohol rubbing number), hardness, cross-cutting of 4B or greater, and minimal yellowing. In addition, it can be determined that when a cross-linking agent is added in a weight percent of 20 wt % to 25 wt % based on the total weight of the first monomer to the fourth monomer and the cross-linking agent, an excellent effect may be achieved.
