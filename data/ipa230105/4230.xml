that are configured to be mounted on the body of a user may be used to gather user input and to provide a user with output. For example, electronic devices that are configured to be worn on one or more of a user's fingers, which are sometimes referred to as finger devices or finger-mounted devices, may be used to gather user input and to supply output. A finger device may, as an example, include an inertial measurement unit with an accelerometer for gathering information on figure motions such as finger taps or free-space finger gestures, may include force sensors for gathering information on normal and shear forces in the finger device and the user's finger, and may include other sensors for gathering information on the interactions between the finger device (and the user's finger on which the device is mounted) and the surrounding environment. The finger device may include a haptic output device to provide the user's finger with haptic output and may include other output components.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">One or more finger devices may gather user input from a user. The user may use finger devices in operating a virtual reality or mixed reality device (e.g., head-mounted equipment such as glasses, goggles, a helmet, or other device with a display). During operation, the finger devices may gather user input such as information on interactions between the finger device(s) and the surrounding environment (e.g., interactions between a user's fingers and the environment, including finger motions and other interactions associated with virtual content displayed for a user). The user input may be used in controlling visual output on the display. Corresponding haptic output may be provided to the user's fingers using the finger devices. Haptic output may be used, for example, to provide the fingers of a user with a desired texture sensation as a user is touching a real object or as a user is touching a virtual object.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Finger devices can be worn on any or all of a user's fingers (e.g., the index finger, the index finger and thumb, three of a user's fingers on one of the user's hands, some or all fingers on both hands, etc.). To enhance the sensitivity of a user's touch as the user interacts with surrounding objects, finger devices may have inverted U shapes or other configurations that allow the finger devices to be worn over the top and sides of a user's finger tips while leaving the user's finger pads exposed. This allows a user to touch objects with the finger pad portions of the user's fingers during use. Users can use the finger devices to interact with any suitable electronic equipment. For example, a user may use one or more finger devices to interact with a virtual reality or mixed reality system (e.g., a head-mounted device with a display), to supply input to a desktop computer, tablet computer, cellular telephone, watch, ear buds, or other accessory, or to interact with other electronic equipment.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an illustrative system of the type that may include one or more finger devices.

Each sensor <b>100</b> may have a light emitter <b>102</b> and a light detector <b>104</b>. Light emitters <b>102</b> may be light-emitting diodes, lasers, or other light-emitting devices. Light detectors <b>104</b> may be phototransistors, photodiodes, or other photodetectors. Sensors <b>100</b> may operate at visible wavelengths, infrared wavelengths, and/or other suitable wavelengths.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">If desired, a finger device may have a single optical sensor <b>100</b>. In this arrangement, an optical sensor <b>100</b> on one side of finger <b>40</b> may emit light and may also detect whether any of the emitted light is reflected from surface <b>48</b> and received. The strength of the measured reflected signal may be proportional to the distance between sensor <b>100</b> (e.g., device <b>10</b> and housing <b>44</b>) and surface <b>48</b> of structure <b>50</b>. If device <b>10</b> is far from surface <b>48</b>, the reflected signal will be weak. If device <b>10</b> is near to surface <b>48</b>, the reflected signal will be strong.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In configurations in which device <b>10</b> contains multiple sensors <b>100</b>, light emitted from a first of sensors <b>100</b> on one side of finger <b>40</b> may be measured by a second of sensors <b>100</b> on an opposing side of finger <b>40</b>. When finger <b>40</b> is in contact with surface <b>48</b>, more of the emitted light may be blocked by finger <b>40</b> than when finger <b>40</b> is not in contact with finger <b>40</b>. Some light may also be transmitted through pulp <b>40</b>P, so the amount that finger <b>40</b> is compressed against surface <b>48</b> may also affect light transmission. As a result, the strength of the emitted light from one sensor <b>100</b> that is detected by another sensor <b>100</b> may provide information on whether finger <b>40</b> is in contact with surface <b>48</b>, how forcefully finger <b>40</b> is pressing against surface <b>48</b>, and other information about the orientation and motion of finger <b>40</b> relative to surface <b>48</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The optical characteristics of finger <b>40</b> (e.g., the outward appearance of finger <b>40</b> such as the color of finger <b>40</b>, the transmittance of finger <b>40</b> at one or more different wavelengths of light, etc.) may be monitored using optical sensors <b>100</b>. As an example, the light emitter <b>102</b> on the left of finger <b>40</b> may emit light at multiple wavelengths (e.g., one or more infrared wavelengths, one or more visible light wavelengths such as red, green, and blue wavelengths, etc.). The light detector <b>104</b> on the right side of finger <b>40</b> may be a color light sensor that contains multiple photodetectors that are configured to measure light at different respective wavelengths (e.g., one or more infrared wavelengths, one or more visible light wavelengths such as red, green, and blue wavelengths, or other wavelengths corresponding to the wavelengths of light emitted by emitter <b>102</b>) and/or light of different colors may be emitted at different times while light detector <b>104</b> makes synchronized measurements (e.g., so that the light transmission of finger <b>40</b> at each wavelength can be determined). As finger <b>40</b> is compressed against surface <b>48</b>, the color and light transmittance (transmission) of finger <b>40</b> will change. The transmission spectrum of finger <b>40</b> can be measured dynamically using the multi-wavelength light emitted by light emitter <b>102</b> and the color light sensor of detector <b>104</b>. By analyzing the transmission spectrum (e.g., the color of light transmitted through finger <b>40</b>), changes in the spectrum (e.g., color changes in finger <b>40</b> due to contact with surface <b>48</b>) can be detected.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">If desired, detector <b>104</b> may be a color light sensor that monitors the color of finger <b>40</b> under exposure to ambient light. Color changes can be detected when finger <b>40</b> contacts surface <b>48</b> (e.g., finger <b>40</b> may appear whiter when compressed against surface <b>48</b> so that blood vessels in finger <b>40</b> are pinched and contain less blood than when finger <b>40</b> is not touching surface <b>48</b> and is not compressed). When using ambient light illumination for finger <b>40</b>, light emitter <b>102</b> can be omitted.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Another illustrative configuration measures light transmission through finger <b>40</b> at a single wavelength, rather than gathering light transmission data at multiple wavelengths. The amount of light transmission will be affected by finger compression and can therefore be used to detect when finger <b>40</b> contacts surface <b>48</b>. If desired, infrared light, which penetrates into finger <b>40</b> more effectively than visible light, may be used (alone or in conjunction with making visible light measurements). For example, an infrared light-emitting diode may be located on the left of finger <b>40</b> and a corresponding infrared light detector may be located on the right of finger <b>40</b> to monitor infrared light transmission through finger <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">For measuring the optical characteristics of finger <b>40</b>, light sensors <b>100</b> may be mounted near fingernail <b>42</b>, where color changes under finger compression are often most evident. For example, one or more light-emitting diodes (visible, infrared, etc.) may emit light into one side of finger <b>40</b> near fingernail <b>42</b> while detector <b>104</b> monitors the amount of this light that is transmitted through finger <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Combinations of these arrangements, arrangements in which optical sensing is used to detect occlusion of a light ray traveling under finger <b>40</b> as pad <b>40</b>P touches surface <b>48</b>, and/or other optical finger sensing arrangements may be used.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some arrangements, information on devices <b>10</b> such as information on finger motion, finger location, finger forces arising from situations in which finger pulp <b>40</b>P is pressing against external surfaces, and/or other information on the orientation and motion of finger(s) <b>40</b> can be gathered using sensing arrangements of more than one type. For example, sensor circuitry for device <b>10</b> may include strain gauges, other force sensors, ultrasonic sensors, optical sensors, ultrasonic imaging sensors, ultrasonic sensors measuring finger pulp signal dampening, magnetic sensors, radio-frequency sensors, imaging sensors (e.g., tracking cameras), inertial measurement units (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes, and/or compass sensors), touch sensors (e.g., capacitive touch sensors), other sensors, any combination of sensors of one or more, two or more, three or more, or four or more of these sensor types, and/or other finger monitoring arrangements.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">During operation of system <b>8</b>, finger information gathered using one or more finger devices <b>10</b> can be used to detect user input. The user input may include user finger gestures including taps, swipes, multi-finger gestures such as pinch-to-zoom gestures, and/or other finger input. In response to finger input gathered with finger devices <b>10</b>, devices <b>10</b> and/or one or more devices that receives the finger information from devices <b>10</b> such as electronic device <b>24</b> of system <b>8</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> can take suitable action. As an example, haptic output can be provided to a user with haptic output devices in finger devices <b>10</b> and/or devices <b>24</b>, information may be displayed using a display and/or other light-based output devices (e.g., components in devices <b>24</b>), sound may be provided using speakers in devices <b>10</b> and/or devices <b>24</b>, and/or other output may be generated. Finger input from device <b>10</b> may be used in controlling any suitable software running on system <b>8</b> (e.g., mixed reality software, virtual reality software, drawing applications, gaming applications, word processing applications and other productivity applications, operating system functions, etc.).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">A perspective view of finger device <b>10</b> in an illustrative configuration in which housing <b>44</b> of device <b>10</b> has a curved trailing edge such as curved rear edge <b>44</b>E is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>. The shape of curved rear edge <b>44</b>E may provide clearance between housing <b>44</b>E and the user's knuckle to help prevent interference between housing <b>44</b> and a user's finger during situations in which the user's finger bends. When viewed from the side, edge <b>44</b>E may extend diagonally from lower forward portion <b>44</b>F to upper rear portion <b>44</b>R of housing <b>44</b>. Housing <b>44</b> may have a shape that conforms to a user's fingertip and that is suitable for gathering sensor measurements. For example, curved arms <b>52</b> may have tip portions <b>52</b>&#x2032; that taper towards each other at the forward ends of arms <b>52</b>. Arms <b>52</b> may be formed from flexible material (sheet metal, polymer, elastomeric material, other materials, and/or combinations of these materials) so that arms <b>52</b> can deflect under force from the flesh of a user's finger.
