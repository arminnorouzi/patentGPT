This disclosure also relates to a method of producing a mask.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application claims priority to Australian provisional patent application number 2021902041, filed Jul. 5, 2021, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Research has shown that sleep masks can have a positive effect on sleep, promoting melatonin and cortisol levels, and increasing REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Sleep masks are known to aid in blocking intrusive or undesired light and can be used by people who have (for example): i) trouble falling asleep; ii) insomnia or other sleep disorders; iii) a need to sleep during the day due to (for instance) shift work; or iv) a wish to sleep while travelling, such as on airplanes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Key features of a sleep mask are the ability to block as much light as possible and the ability to remain in place while the wearer is asleep. However, the technical field of sleep masks is still largely undeveloped and compromises between features such as comfort, shape, the weight of the mask and the material used are unrefined. Dermatological concerns are also commonly overlooked in the design of sleep masks and finer materials are ignored due to complexities in production.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accommodating for different facial features also remains an undeveloped area for sleep masks. Whilst some sleep masks have attempted to accommodate, for example, eye lash extensions, these look and feel akin to wearing swimming goggles and lack refinement. Furthermore, as these masks fail to appreciate the contours of a face, the eye lash extensions may still contact the sleep mask leading to damage of the eye lash extensions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Bearing this in mind, the present inventor(s) have developed a new mask, which is particularly suitable as a sleep mask.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Any reference to or discussion of any document, act or item of knowledge in this specification is included solely for the purpose of providing a context for the present invention.

The sleep mask <b>10</b> comprises a body <b>100</b> and a retaining part <b>700</b> connected to the body <b>100</b>. The body <b>100</b> is adapted to cover the eyes of a wearer of the sleep mask <b>10</b> and, as detailed further below, the retaining part <b>700</b> is configured to fit over the head of a wearer to retain the body <b>100</b> to the wearer.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0066">The body <b>100</b> has a largely straight edge <b>110</b> along the top of the body <b>100</b> and smooth curves at opposing sides <b>120</b> of the body <b>100</b>. The bottom of the body <b>100</b> has two symmetrical curves <b>130</b> that substantially form a w-shape. The two curves <b>130</b> have a nose portion <b>150</b> spaced between them. The nose portion <b>150</b> is designed to sit across the bridge of the wearer's nose. The body <b>100</b> has a height (H) of approximately 96 mm and a width (W) of approximately 210 mm (as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The height (H) may vary between 90 to 100 mm and the width (W) may vary between 205 to 220 mm. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the body <b>100</b> includes a face portion <b>200</b>, contoured recesses <b>300</b>, padding part <b>350</b>, filler part <b>400</b>, outer portion <b>500</b> and seam <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0067">The face portion <b>200</b> is shown further in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>6</b></figref>. The face portion <b>200</b> is intended to be placed against the face of a wearer when worn in a normal fashion. The face portion <b>200</b> is, preferably, made from silk and, in further embodiments, it may be made from satin or other materials. The silk absorbs less face cream compared to (for example) cotton. The silk also creates less friction on a wearer's skin compared to cotton. Satin can also have a low friction finish. The silk is preferably a (6 A) long fibre mulberry silk. The thickness of the silk is preferably approximately 22 momme. The face portion <b>200</b> is formed from a separate layer and, as detailed below, is stitched together with other components of the body <b>100</b> to form an external surface.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0068">The face portion <b>200</b> conforms to the recesses <b>300</b> (or vice versa). The contoured recesses <b>300</b> are associated with the eyes of a wearer when the sleep mask <b>10</b> is worn. That is, the contoured recesses <b>300</b> align with a wearer's eyes during use. As detailed further below, the shape of the contoured recesses <b>300</b> ensure that there is no or limited contact of the eyelashes or eyelash extensions to the mask <b>10</b> itself and in turn to the wearer's pillow or bedding. The contoured recesses <b>300</b> include an upper ridge <b>310</b>, an upper taper <b>315</b>, a lower ridge <b>320</b>, a lower taper <b>325</b>, a side ridge <b>330</b> and a valley portion <b>340</b>. The contoured recesses <b>300</b> are moulded into shape. In other words, the contoured recesses <b>300</b> are formed into specific, gradual shapes that suitable fit onto a wearer's face.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0069">The upper ridge <b>310</b> is configured engage against a forehead of the wearer. The upper ridge <b>310</b> is substantially located above the retaining part <b>700</b>. The upper ridge <b>310</b> extends adjacent to an upper portion of the valley portion <b>340</b>. The lower ridge <b>320</b> extends adjacent to a lower portion of the valley portion <b>340</b>. The lower ridge <b>320</b> is configured to engage against a cheek area of the wearer. The lower ridge <b>320</b> extends further away from the outer portion <b>500</b> of the body <b>100</b>, in a direction towards the eyes of the wearer, compared to the upper ridge <b>310</b>. This assists with the body <b>100</b> conforming to a variety of faces and, for example, blocking out sunlight whilst eyelash extensions are not compromised. The approximate width (F) of the ridges is approximately 28 mm to 29 mm and this may vary &#xb1;7.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0070">An upper taper portion <b>315</b> is formed between the upper ridge <b>310</b> and the valley portion <b>340</b>. A lower taper portion <b>325</b> is also formed between the lower ridge <b>320</b> and the valley portion <b>340</b>. The distance (T) between the upper end of the taper portion <b>315</b> and the upper end of taper portion <b>325</b> is approximately 49 mm. This distance (T) may vary between 38 and 58 mm. The lower taper <b>325</b> is formed with a shallower angle than the upper taper <b>315</b>. This again assists with suitably conforming the body <b>100</b> to multiple wearers. In addition, as detailed further below and evident in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the face portion <b>200</b> is at least partly offset from the padding part <b>350</b> in the lower taper portion <b>325</b>. This offset provides suitable leeway for body <b>100</b> conforming to a wearer. The taper portions <b>315</b>, <b>325</b> provide a gradual transition between the ridges <b>310</b>, <b>320</b> and the valley portion <b>340</b>. This transition is between 30 to 60 degrees.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0071">A side ridge <b>330</b> is located between the upper ridge <b>310</b> and lower ridge <b>320</b>. As will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art, the ridges <b>310</b>, <b>320</b> and <b>330</b> form one uniform ridge but the structure of each part has been detailed. The side ridges <b>330</b> are located adjacent the retaining part <b>700</b>. The side ridges <b>330</b> assists in blocking out light to the right and left of a wearer.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0072">As evident in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the valley portion <b>340</b> is substantially flat. The valley portion <b>340</b> of each recess <b>300</b> is substantially oval in shape. The shape of the valley portion <b>340</b> is formed by a seam within the contoured recess <b>300</b>. That is, the shape of the valley portion <b>340</b> is formed by stitching through the face portion <b>200</b> to the padding part <b>350</b>. The valley stitching is shown as <b>345</b>. The valley portion <b>340</b> is biased to one side of a longitudinal centre line <b>12</b> extending across the body <b>100</b>. As shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a greater proportion of the valley portion <b>340</b> is found above the longitudinal centre line <b>12</b> towards the upper ridge <b>310</b>. The valley portion <b>340</b> of this embodiment is asymmetrical. In this manner, the shape of the valley portion <b>340</b> is more suitable for matching the shape of an eye and eyelashes (including extensions if present) of a wearer. The valley portion <b>340</b> has a height (P) of approximately 26 mm and a width (A) of approximately 39 mm. This height (P) may vary between 21 to 31 mm and the width (A) may vary between 34 mm to 44 mm. The depth of the recesses <b>300</b> is approximately 15 mm but this can vary between 10 mm to 25 mm.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an exploded view the sleep mask <b>10</b>, and shows each layer of the mask <b>10</b>. Depicted adjacent the face portion <b>200</b> is a padding part <b>350</b>. The padding part <b>350</b> may be made from foam. The padding part <b>350</b> assists in forming the shape of the contoured recesses <b>300</b>. That is, the recesses <b>300</b> are substantially created by connecting the face portion <b>200</b> and the padding part <b>350</b>. In this regard, the padding part <b>350</b> (and subsequently the contoured recesses <b>300</b>) is of the depth and width required to accommodate various lengths and shapes of eyelashes and accommodate a variety of face sizes and shapes. It will be appreciated that the padding part <b>350</b> may be provided in one or multiple pieces.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0074">The padding part <b>350</b> is polyester in this embodiment. However, in further embodiments, the padding part <b>350</b> may be a memory foam. The memory foam may include polyurethane. The padding part <b>350</b> has an average density of approximately 32.6 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>and this may vary between approximately 28 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>to 38 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. To this end, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the density of the padding part <b>350</b> associated with the lower ridge <b>320</b> and the upper ridge <b>310</b> is lower compared to the density of the padding part <b>350</b> associated with the valley portion <b>340</b>. In other words, a middle portion of the padding part <b>350</b> is more dense compared to its outer part(s). The surface hardness of the padding part <b>350</b> is approximately 42-45 using an asker durometer type F. During manufacturing, the padding part <b>350</b> is compressed in a mould, with different elevated temperatures on its front and back surfaces, to obtain these desired mechanical properties. In this regard, the material of the padding part <b>350</b> (its relative composition and density) has been carefully selected and manufactured to ensure: that the compression of the foam to the user's face is not uncomfortable or has a rigid feeling; and the foam has sufficient rigidity such the mask may block light from the user's external environment.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0075">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a filler part <b>400</b> is found outboard from the padding part <b>350</b> in a direction away from the face portion <b>200</b>. In further embodiments, a filler part <b>400</b> may be located between the padding part <b>350</b> and the face portion <b>200</b>. The filler part <b>400</b> may take the form of a layer. The filler part <b>400</b> is designed to provide comfort. The filler part <b>400</b> assists in bridging contours between the different shape of the padding part <b>350</b> compared to a preferred continuous shape of the outer portion <b>500</b>. The filler part <b>400</b> includes a liner <b>410</b> and a filler <b>420</b>. The filler <b>420</b> is made from tussah silk. The liner <b>410</b> is made from mulberry silk. In further embodiments, the filler <b>420</b> and the liner <b>410</b> may be made from satin.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0076">The outer portion <b>500</b> (further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) forms an outer layer. The outer portion <b>500</b> is found the furthest from the face when worn by a user. The outer portion <b>500</b> is provided as a smooth layer of material with no stitching present. In a similar manner to the face portion <b>200</b>, the outer portion <b>500</b> is made from silk. A seam <b>600</b> connects the face portion <b>200</b> and the outer portion <b>500</b> together. This seam <b>600</b> can take the form of a stitching portion. The seam <b>600</b> runs around the border of the body <b>100</b>. The retaining part <b>700</b> is also preferably stitched to the seam <b>600</b>. In this regard, during production, the seam <b>600</b> is used to: i) contain the padding part <b>350</b> and filler part <b>400</b> between the face portion <b>200</b> and the outer portion <b>500</b>; and ii) connect the retaining part <b>700</b> to the body <b>100</b>. The stitching <b>345</b> also assists in forming/shaping the contoured recesses <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0077">As indicated above, the sleep mask <b>10</b> is held in place over the wearer's eyes with a retaining part <b>700</b>. The retaining part <b>700</b> extends from a first side of the body <b>100</b> to a second opposing side of the body <b>100</b>. The retaining part <b>700</b> is configured to extend around the back of the head of the wearer. The retaining part <b>700</b> is substantially located to one side of the axis <b>12</b>. The retaining part <b>700</b> is made of a flexible material, preferably elastic. The flexible material is covered by silk (and in further embodiments may be covered by satin). The retaining part <b>700</b> has a crumpled and/or pleated look.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0078">During use, a wearer stretches the retaining part <b>700</b> to place it around their head. The body <b>100</b> is positioned on the wearer's face such that the nose portion <b>150</b> sits on the wearer's nose. In this position, at least the ridges <b>310</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>330</b> distance the valley portion <b>340</b> in a position away from the wearer's face such that, if eye lash extensions are used, they do not engage with the recess portions <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0079">With the above in mind, the sleep mask <b>10</b> or certain embodiments may be capable of achieving certain advantages. These advantages may include some or all of the following: reducing contact of all or portions of a wearer's eyelash extensions and/or long eyelashes with the sleep mask <b>10</b>, the wearer's pillowcase and/or other bedding, thereby protecting the shape and bond of any eyelash extensions or long eyelashes; reducing contact between the wearer's eyes and the mask <b>10</b>, thereby increasing user comfort for those users who do not like to sleep with a traditional sleep mask which compresses/touches their eyes; simultaneously providing function of a traditional sleep mask, including by blocking light to the wearer's external environment; and improving wearer comfort via composition of each component of the product.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0080">In this specification, adjectives such as left and right, top and bottom, hot and cold, first and second, and the like may be used to distinguish one element or action from another element or action without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order.
