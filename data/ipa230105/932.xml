level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to an agent and a composition for preventing, treating or ameliorating stress disorders, and more specifically relates to an agent for preventing, treating or ameliorating stress disorders comprising a lactic acid bacterium and/or a lactic acid bacterium-derived ingredient as an active ingredient, and to a composition comprising the same.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0002">Stress disorders are physical and/or mental disorders caused by stress. Stress disorders can be classified into the following three groups.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">1. Adjustment Disorders</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Adjustment disorders are conditions of maladjustment which have resulted in mental and/or physical disorders due to inability to adapt to changes in the environment. According to ICD-10 (World Health Organization Diagnostic Guidelines), it is defined as &#x201c;states in which social function is significantly impaired, due to emotional or behavioral symptoms caused by stress factors.&#x201d; Symptoms of adjustment disorders include emotional symptoms such as anxiety, anger, impatience and tension, and behavioral symptoms such as aggressive behavior, e.g., binge eating, binge drinking and reckless driving, and &#x201c;acting like a baby&#x201d; in the case of children. In addition, as physical symptoms, symptoms of autonomic imbalance (sweating, palpitation, dizziness, neurotic reaction, and the like) may be observed. Adjustment disorders may manifest (be diagnosed) as depressive reaction, depression, neurotic reactions, manic depression, anxiety, panic disorder, sleep disorders, epilepsy, schizophrenia, atypical psychosis, and the like.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">2. Acute Stress Disorder</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">Acute stress disorder is diagnosed based on the criteria such as those recommended in &#x201c;the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition&#x201d; (DSM-5), including intrusive symptoms such as flashbacks, negative mood, dissociative symptoms, avoidance symptoms, and arousal symptoms. Patients have had direct or indirect exposure to a traumatic event, have recurrent recollections of the traumatic event, and present symptoms such as sleep disorders and difficulty concentrating. Acute stress disorder causes significant distress lasting three days or more, but unlike post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), it does not persist for one month or more. Patients' symptoms may also manifest as disorders of homeostasis (such as autonomic, endocrine, or immune system-induced psychosomatic disorders, hyperadaptive states, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa) and mental disorders (such as depressive reaction, neurotic reaction, manic-depressive illness, anxiety, panic disorder, and sleep disorders).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">3. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">Post-traumatic stress disorder is a maladaptive condition caused by too much unacceptable stress resulting from a fearful, helpless, or frightening event (e.g., combat, sexual assault, natural or man-made disaster, in which self or others are seriously injured or threatened with death) that is directly or indirectly experienced. In post-traumatic stress disorder, symptoms such as nightmares and flashbacks of the traumatic event, emotional numbing, depression, other anxiety disorders, drug abuse, and sleep disorders may be observed and may manifest as a continuation of acute stress disorder. Diagnosis is made clinically based on DSM-5 criteria.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">Stress disorders are diagnosed according to the respective diagnostic criteria, mainly by means of a thorough medical interview and psychological tests. There are many types of psychological tests. For example, the &#x201c;Comprehensive Health Check for Workers&#x201d; (CHCW; early check of mental and physical health for workers) was developed for early detection of stressful conditions and is also used to diagnose functional pathologies (Non-Patent Document 1, Non-Patent Document 2).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">Conventional treatments for stress disorders include counseling (psychoanalysis, cognitive-behavioral therapy, existential therapy, and the like), pharmacotherapy (psychotropic drugs such as antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications, antipsychotic drugs, herbal medicines, and the like), and physical therapy (translocation therapy, spa therapy, and the like).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">However, the drugs used in current pharmacotherapy have many side effects, from which patients may suffer. Counseling and physical therapy may be difficult to continue because the financial and time burdens involved are too much. Therefore, safer, more effective, and less burdensome means of treatment for patients is desired.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">In recent years, functional lactic acid bacteria have attracted attention in the maintenance and improvement of health, various strains have been isolated and the utility of these strains are being investigated. <i>Lactobacillus delbrueckii </i>subspecies <i>lactis </i>KLAB-4 strain (<i>Lactobacillus delbrueckii </i>subsp. <i>lactis </i>KLAB-4) is a strain isolated from fermented milk, and has been deposited to National Institute of Technology and Evolution (2-5-8, Kazusakamatari, Kisarazu-shi, Chiba, Japan) as a novel lactic acid bacterium belonging to genus <i>Lactobacillus</i>, species <i>delbrueckii</i>, subspecies <i>lactis </i>(Accession No. NITE BP-394; the national deposition strain of Aug. 9, 2007 of the original deposition date was transferred to the International Deposition under the Budapest Treaty (Sep. 22, 2008)). This lactic acid bacterium has been known to have an excellent anti-allergic function, and further an anti-autoimmune disease function, diabetes-improving function, and hypoglycemia-improving function (Patent Documents 1 and 2, Non-Patent Document 3).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0013">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Gazette No. 5554994</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0014">Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Gazette No. 6747724</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Non-Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0015">Non-Patent Document 1: &#x201c;Development of a New Stress Questionnaire &#x201c;Comprehensive Health Check for Workers&#x201d; (CHCW),&#x201d; Akira Tsuda, Teruichi Shimomitsu, Yuko Odagiri, Ayumi Fusejima, Yoshiyuki Tanaka, Hisayoshi Okamura, Hideyo Yamaguchi, Tetsuro Yamamoto, Harald Mori, Alexander Batthyany, Amarendra N.

Live bacteria mean bacterial cells that are alive, and dead bacteria mean bacterial cells that were killed by treatment with heat, pressure, a drug, or the like.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0041">Further, a lactic acid bacterium-derived ingredient which is obtained from a lactic acid bacterium can also be used in the present invention, as with the bacterial cell as long as said ingredient has a comparable function. The lactic acid bacterium-derived ingredient means a part or an ingredient of a bacterial cell, or an ingredient which contains any one of these, and may be, for example, a processed product of bacterial cells which can be obtained by applying at least one of processes such as grinding, crushing, extraction, fractionation, drying, heating, freezing, cooling, concentration, dilution, and the like to the lactic acid bacterium. The lactic acid bacterium-derived ingredient may be in any form such as liquid, paste, powder, granule, or the like. A residue which is obtained after extraction of any ingredient from the bacterial cells may also be used, and for example, a residue after extraction with hot water may be used.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0042">Lactic acid bacterium powder of KLAB-4 strain is commercially available under the product name of &#x201c;Lactic acid bacterium LAB4&#x201d; (produced by Kaneka Corporation), and this can also be used.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">&#x3c;Water-Soluble Dietary Fiber Ingredient&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0043">The agent for preventing or ameliorating stress disorders of the present invention can comprise a water-soluble dietary fiber ingredient in addition to the lactic acid bacterium or a lactic acid bacterium-derived ingredient therefrom as described above. It was found that the effect of the agent of the present invention can be enhanced by further comprising such an ingredient.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0044">The water-soluble dietary fiber ingredient means a water-soluble dietary fiber, or a food or drug or a food- or drug-material containing the same. A specific example of the water-soluble dietary fiber ingredient includes, for example, a natural or synthetic water-soluble dietary fiber or water-soluble dietary fiber-containing material, such as glucomannan, pectin, guar gum, alginic acid, polydextrose, &#x3b2;-glucan, fructan, inulin, levan, graminan, gum arabic, maltitol, <i>psyllium</i>, indigestible oligosaccharide, indigestible dextrin, agarose, sodium alginate, carrageenan, fucoidan, porphyran, laminaran, seaweed and agar.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0045">The water-soluble dietary fiber ingredient can be contained in the agent of the present invention, or can be combined with the lactic acid bacterium or a lactic acid bacterium-derived ingredient therefrom when administered or taken. Alternatively, separate preparations containing each can be administered or taken, and in such a case, both can be administered or taken simultaneously or at intervals. In other words, the agent or composition of the present invention includes not only an embodiment in which the lactic acid bacterium or a lactic acid bacterium-derived ingredient therefrom and a water-soluble dietary fiber are contained in the same composition, but also an embodiment in which they are administered or taken as separate agents or compositions simultaneously or at intervals. For example, the agent of the present invention enveloped in a capsule can be taken with a drink which comprises a water-soluble dietary fiber ingredient.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0046">In case in which a water-soluble dietary fiber ingredient is contained in the agent of the present invention, or in case in which the agent of the present invention and a water-soluble dietary fiber ingredient are used in combination, the ratio (by weight) is not particularly specified, but for example, 0.1 to 2 parts of the water-soluble dietary fiber ingredient is preferred to 1 part of the lactic acid bacterium or a lactic acid bacterium-derived ingredient therefrom.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0047">A mechanism with which the effect of lactic acid bacterium is enhanced by the water-soluble dietary fiber ingredient is not known, and the present invention is not bound by any specific mechanism. For example, glucomannan has a high hydrophilicity, and can absorb about 100 times by weight of water based on the weight of glucomannan. Therefore, it is thought that glucomannan absorbs water in the stomach whereby the volume of glucomannan increases to about 100 times, which leads to a condition where gastric mucosa is covered with a thin membrane. Therefore, it can be thought as one possibility that the presence of the water-soluble dietary fiber ingredient can regulate the absorption of lactic acid bacterium.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">&#x3c;Other Ingredients&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0047" num="0048">The agent for preventing or ameliorating stress disorders of the present invention comprises the lactic acid bacterium or a lactic acid bacterium-derived ingredient therefrom as described above as the only essential ingredient, but it can comprise another active ingredient such as a water-soluble dietary fiber ingredient or it can be used in combination with another active ingredient. The composition which comprises the agent for preventing or ameliorating stress disorders of the present invention comprises one or more other ingredients in addition to the agent of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0049">The composition of the present invention can be a pharmaceutical composition, a food or drink composition, a feed composition for animal, a pharmaceutical composition for animal, and the like, and a specific embodiment thereof is not limited.

Furthermore, in a case in which the agent or composition of the present invention is used in combination with other agent(s), the two may be used simultaneously or may be used one after the other.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057">The route of administration (or intake or application) of the agent or composition for preventing or ameliorating stress disorders of the present invention can be appropriately selected from, for example, oral, transdermal, transintestinal, intrarectal administration route, and the like. The amount of administration (or intake or application) per day of the agent or composition of the present invention which is effective for prevention or amelioration of stress disorders varies depending on the form of the preparation, the method or route of administration and the like, the age and body weight of the subject, the severity of the disease and the like; for example, in case of oral route, in the human being, generally about 0.1 mg to about 1000 mg/kg body weight/day, preferably about 1 mg to about 500 mg/kg body weight/day, and most preferably about 2 mg to about 300 mg/kg body weight/day, as the amount of the effective ingredient that is a lactic acid bacterium or a lactic acid bacterium-derived ingredient, can be administered or taken all at once or in divisions. The timing of administration or intake is not particularly specified, and for example, can be simultaneous with a meal, just after a meal, just before a meal, before bedtime, or the like.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0058">Since the agent or composition of the present invention is highly safe, it can be administered to not only patients but also healthy subjects. Further, the agent or composition of the present invention can be administered (or taken or applied) similarly to subjects, specifically human being and non-human animals, preferably mammals. Examples of the non-human animals include domestic animals such as cow, horse, pig and sheep, and companion animals such as dog and cat. The amount of administration can be adjusted depending on the characteristics of the animal, using the above amount as the standard. For example, in case of a small animal, the amount of administration or intake can be adjusted and given so that it corresponds to about 0.01 to about 1000 mg/kg body weight/day, more preferably about 0.1 to about 30 mg/kg body weight/day as the amount of the lactic acid bacterium or a lactic acid bacterium-derived ingredient therefrom.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0059">Whether stress disorders have been ameliorated or not by the agent or composition of the present invention can be evaluated by determining whether the number and/or degree of the symptoms has increased or decreased at a later time point as compared to an earlier time point out of different time points such as before and after the administration or intake, or during the administration or intake, or after the administration or intake.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0060">The method of evaluating stress disorders can be by medical examination based on the diagnostic criteria as described above, and the use of the CHCW is advantageous. The CHCW is a questionnaire composed of 30 items in four categories: physical (body), psychological (mind), social (environment), and existential (purpose in life), and is a simple yet statistically sound questionnaire method (Non-Patent Document 1, Non-Patent Document 2).
