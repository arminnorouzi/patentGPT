The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However, it will be clear and apparent to those skilled in the art that the subject technology is not limited to the specific details set forth herein and may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Wearable electronic devices, including watches, can perform a range of functions that is determined by the components (e.g., sensors, circuitry, and other hardware) included with the wearable device as manufactured. However, space, cost, and other considerations may limit the ability to provide, at every given moment, every component that might provide a desired function. For example, a user may choose to remove the watch to charge the battery thereof. By further example, the user may remove the watch for certain activities or for certain occasions. However, removing the entire watch from the user for charging or other purposes would prevent the watch from being able to perform its functions with respect to the user, such as tracking biometrics of the user with bio-sensors of the watch.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Given the multiple occasions on which a user may need or desire to remove at least a portion of a watch, it would be beneficial to provide an ability for other portions of the watch to remain with the user. Such an ability would allow the watch to continually monitor the health metrics of the user and/or other conditions even when the user removes other portions of the watch. Wearable electronic devices, including watches, of the present disclosure facilitate operation in multiple modes to provide the user with the opportunity to remove some components while still receiving the continued benefits of at least some functions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Systems of the present disclosure can provide a watch with a watch body and a band device that can be used together or independently of one another. The band device can provide continual operation of its functions even in the absence of the watch body. The assembly of the watch body and the band device can provide secure engagement, communication, and power sharing. Accordingly, neither the watch body nor the band device need to independently include components that provide every function that will be desired by the user. Instead, functions that are desired on a continual or long-term basis can be provided by the band device, and functions that are desired on an intermittent or short-term basis can be provided by the watch body.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">These and other embodiments are discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b></figref>. However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to these Figures is for explanatory purposes only and should not be construed as limiting.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to some embodiments, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a watch <b>10</b> includes a watch body <b>100</b> that is worn on a wrist <b>2</b> with a band device <b>200</b>. The watch body <b>100</b> can be portable and also attached to other body parts of the user and/or to other devices, structures, or objects. The band device <b>200</b> can be flexible and encircle at least a portion of the wrist <b>2</b> of a user. By securing the watch body <b>100</b> to the person of the user, the band device <b>200</b> provides security and convenience. In some embodiments, the watch body <b>100</b> includes a display <b>20</b> and a housing for containing components. The watch body <b>100</b> and the band device <b>200</b> can communicate with each other and operate in concert at least while connected to each other.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It will be appreciated that the teachings relating to a watch can be applied to other electronic devices, including wearable and/or portable computing devices. Examples include timekeeping devices, computerized glasses, navigation devices, sports devices, accessory devices, health-monitoring devices, medical devices, wristbands, bracelets, jewelry, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to some embodiments, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the watch body <b>100</b> can be separated from the band device <b>200</b> and removed from the wrist <b>2</b> of the user, and the band device <b>200</b> can remain on the wrist <b>2</b> of the user. The watch body <b>100</b> can be stored away from the band device <b>200</b>, for example on a charger device <b>300</b> connected to a power source <b>310</b>. Both the watch body <b>100</b> and the band device <b>200</b> can continue to operate and provide their respective functions while separated. For example, the band device <b>200</b> can include an electronic component <b>280</b>, such as a sensor, that can be operated independently of the watch body <b>100</b>. Such a sensor can continually monitor health metrics of the user or other conditions even when the watch body <b>100</b> is absent. When the watch body <b>100</b> is returned to the band device <b>200</b>, a band communication element <b>220</b> of the band device <b>200</b> can transmit to the watch body <b>100</b> recorded information, for example, relating to health metrics of the user or other conditions.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">By providing a band device <b>200</b> that with continual operation, the user can enjoy a greater range of options with respect to the watch body <b>100</b> without sacrificing the functions provided by the band device <b>200</b>. For example, the user can remove the watch body <b>100</b> at night to recharge its battery and continue to wear the band device <b>200</b> for ongoing monitoring. Such monitoring can include sleep tracking (e.g., movement, heart rate, etc.). Accordingly, such monitoring can be performed while the watch body <b>100</b> recharges, and the user can receive the benefit of the monitoring and the battery charge of the watch body for the next day. Furthermore, such monitoring can be performed continuously throughout an entire day and across several days without requiring interruptions to enable recharging.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">By way of further example, the user can elect to remove the watch body <b>100</b> for certain activities, such as exercising. The watch body <b>100</b> can be removed to protect it from potential harm, to reduce weight on the user, or to perform other functions elsewhere. During a session of activity or exercise, the band device <b>200</b> can provide can provide the functions relevant to such activity, such as activity tracking (e.g., movement, heart rate, etc.). Accordingly, the user can receive the benefit of the monitoring by wearing only the band device <b>200</b> during a session.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">By way of further example, the user can elect to remove the watch body <b>100</b> to alter an aesthetic appearance of the watch. On certain occasions, the user may prefer the aesthetic or cosmetic properties (e.g., color, patterns, and/or materials), ergonomic features, shape, size, flexibility, and/or tactile feel of the band device <b>200</b> without the watch body <b>100</b>. Additionally or alternatively, different watch bodies <b>100</b> can be paired with any given band device <b>200</b> to provide different aesthetic features, cosmetic features, and/or a look and feel.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a watch <b>10</b> including the watch body <b>100</b> that is useable with a band device <b>200</b>, according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The watch body <b>100</b> can include one or more I/O systems. For example, the watch body <b>100</b> can include a display <b>20</b> configured to output various information about the watch <b>10</b>. The display <b>20</b> of the watch body <b>100</b> can also be configured to receive touch input from a user. The watch body <b>100</b> can also have other input and output mechanisms. For example, the watch body <b>100</b> can include or interface with one or more buttons, a crown, keys, dials, trackpads, microphones and the like.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The watch body <b>100</b> can include a watch housing <b>30</b> that serves to surround a peripheral region of the watch body <b>100</b> as well as support the internal components of the watch body <b>100</b> in their assembled position. For example, the watch housing <b>30</b> encloses and supports various internal components (including for example integrated circuit chips, processors, memory devices and other circuitry) to provide computing and functional operations for the watch <b>10</b>. The watch housing <b>30</b> can optionally include a rigid material, such as a metal, ceramic, plastic, and the like.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The watch <b>10</b> can utilize a band device <b>200</b> for coupling to a wrist. The band device <b>200</b> can include a band body <b>250</b> that defines an outer surface <b>252</b> and an inner surface of the band device <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, the band body <b>250</b> can encase (e.g., entirely surround) one or more components of the band device <b>200</b>, such as the band communication element <b>220</b>, the electronic components <b>280</b>, and/or the connector <b>240</b>. Alternatively, the band body <b>250</b> can permit at least a portion of one or more of the components contained therein to be exposed at a surface thereof.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the band body <b>250</b> can define a continuous loop structure. For example, the band body <b>250</b> can form a closed loop, monolithic, and/or one-piece configuration capable of being elastically stretched to fit over a user's hand and contractible to comfortably and securely fit over the user's wrist to maintain contact for the sensors without being overly tight. The material of the band body <b>250</b> may include one or more elastomers, silicones, fluorosilicones, urethanes, synthetic thermosets, and any combination thereof. However, the various embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to the aforementioned materials, but may apply to any material capable of achieving the desired fit characteristics. In some embodiments, elastic material of the band body <b>250</b> may have a hardness of between about 20 A and about 100 A shore. The band body <b>250</b> can be formed by over-molding with respect to the other components of the band device <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Alternatively, the band body <b>250</b> can be configured to be releasably attached or secured to itself using a clasp or other attachment mechanism to form a loop. This loop can then be used to secure to a user's wrist. The loop can be secured (e.g., at a clasp) by one or more releasable locking mechanisms. For example, mechanisms such as locks, latches, snaps, screws, clasps, threads, magnets, and/or pins can be included to lock the band device <b>200</b> to the wrist of the user. The band device <b>200</b> can optionally remain locked from removal until a release mechanism is actuated. The release mechanism can be provided on an outer surface of the band device <b>200</b> for access by a user. For example, the release mechanism can be provided on an outer surface of the band device <b>200</b> and/or at a clasp.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The band body <b>250</b> can include natural and/or synthetic materials. The band body <b>250</b> can include, for example, leather, woven materials, non-woven materials, felt, metal, mesh, links, and/or the like. While the band body <b>250</b> is shown as forming a monolithic structure, it will be understood that the band body <b>250</b> can additionally or alternatively include multiple parts. Where multiple materials are used, each material may have different structural properties, tactile feel, and/or appearance. In some cases, the materials are selected to provide a band having composite properties: a first set of properties (associated with a first material) for an inner layer that comes in contact with a user's skin, and a second set of properties (associated with a second material) for an outer layer that is visible and exposed to various environmental elements.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the watch body <b>100</b> includes the housing <b>30</b> having an outer side <b>110</b> and an inner side <b>112</b> opposite the outer side <b>110</b>. The outer side <b>110</b> (e.g., at the display <b>20</b>) faces away from a wrist of the user when the watch <b>10</b> is worn, and the inner side <b>112</b> faces toward the wrist of the user when the watch <b>10</b> is worn. The body can include a controller <b>102</b> for controlling operations of the watch body <b>100</b> and/or the band device <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The band device <b>200</b> is attachable, for example, to the inner side <b>112</b> of the housing <b>30</b>. When the band device <b>200</b> is attached to the housing <b>30</b>, the electronic component <b>280</b> (e.g., sensor) of the band device <b>200</b> is operably connected to the controller <b>102</b> of the watch body <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the band device <b>200</b> forms an outer side <b>210</b> and an inner side <b>212</b> opposite the outer side <b>210</b>. The inner side <b>212</b> faces toward the watch body <b>100</b> and away from a wrist of the user when the watch <b>10</b> is worn. The outer side <b>210</b> faces away from the watch body <b>100</b> and toward the wrist of the user when the watch <b>10</b> is worn.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The watch body <b>100</b> can include one or more body engagement elements <b>130</b>, and the band device <b>200</b> can include one or more band engagement elements <b>230</b>. The body engagement elements <b>130</b> and the band engagement elements <b>230</b> facilitate mechanical coupling or connection of the watch body <b>100</b> and the band device <b>200</b>. The body engagement elements <b>130</b> and the band engagement elements <b>230</b> can include one or more of a variety of features, as discussed further herein.

The present disclosure contemplates that in some instances, this gathered data may include personal information data that uniquely identifies or can be used to contact or locate a specific person. Such personal information data can include demographic data, location-based data, telephone numbers, email addresses, twitter ID's, home addresses, data or records relating to a user's health or level of fitness (e.g., vital signs measurements, medication information, exercise information), date of birth, or any other identifying or personal information.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The present disclosure recognizes that the use of such personal information data, in the present technology, can be used to the benefit of users. For instance, health and fitness data may be used to provide insights into a user's general wellness, or may be used as positive feedback to individuals using technology to pursue wellness goals.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The present disclosure contemplates that the entities responsible for the collection, analysis, disclosure, transfer, storage, or other use of such personal information data will comply with well-established privacy policies and/or privacy practices. In particular, such entities should implement and consistently use privacy policies and practices that are generally recognized as meeting or exceeding industry or governmental requirements for maintaining personal information data private and secure. Such policies should be easily accessible by users, and should be updated as the collection and/or use of data changes. Personal information from users should be collected for legitimate and reasonable uses of the entity and not shared or sold outside of those legitimate uses. Further, such collection/sharing should occur after receiving the informed consent of the users. Additionally, such entities should consider taking any needed steps for safeguarding and securing access to such personal information data and ensuring that others with access to the personal information data adhere to their privacy policies and procedures. Further, such entities can subject themselves to evaluation by third parties to certify their adherence to widely accepted privacy policies and practices. In addition, policies and practices should be adapted for the particular types of personal information data being collected and/or accessed and adapted to applicable laws and standards, including jurisdiction-specific considerations. For instance, in the US, collection of or access to certain health data may be governed by federal and/or state laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); whereas health data in other countries may be subject to other regulations and policies and should be handled accordingly. Hence different privacy practices should be maintained for different personal data types in each country.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Despite the foregoing, the present disclosure also contemplates embodiments in which users selectively block the use of, or access to, personal information data. That is, the present disclosure contemplates that hardware and/or software elements can be provided to prevent or block access to such personal information data. For example, in the case of advertisement delivery services, the present technology can be configured to allow users to select to &#x201c;opt in&#x201d; or &#x201c;opt out&#x201d; of participation in the collection of personal information data during registration for services or anytime thereafter. In another example, users can select not to provide mood-associated data for targeted content delivery services. In yet another example, users can select to limit the length of time mood-associated data is maintained or entirely prohibit the development of a baseline mood profile. In addition to providing &#x201c;opt in&#x201d; and &#x201c;opt out&#x201d; options, the present disclosure contemplates providing notifications relating to the access or use of personal information. For instance, a user may be notified upon downloading an app that their personal information data will be accessed and then reminded again just before personal information data is accessed by the app.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Moreover, it is the intent of the present disclosure that personal information data should be managed and handled in a way to minimize risks of unintentional or unauthorized access or use. Risk can be minimized by limiting the collection of data and deleting data once it is no longer needed. In addition, and when applicable, including in certain health related applications, data de-identification can be used to protect a user's privacy. De-identification may be facilitated, when appropriate, by removing specific identifiers (e.g., date of birth, etc.), controlling the amount or specificity of data stored (e.g., collecting location data a city level rather than at an address level), controlling how data is stored (e.g., aggregating data across users), and/or other methods.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Therefore, although the present disclosure broadly covers use of personal information data to implement one or more various disclosed embodiments, the present disclosure also contemplates that the various embodiments can also be implemented without the need for accessing such personal information data. That is, the various embodiments of the present technology are not rendered inoperable due to the lack of all or a portion of such personal information data. For example, content can be selected and delivered to users by inferring preferences based on non-personal information data or a bare minimum amount of personal information, such as the content being requested by the device associated with a user, other non-personal information available to the content delivery services, or publicly available information.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">A reference to an element in the singular is not intended to mean one and only one unless specifically so stated, but rather one or more.
