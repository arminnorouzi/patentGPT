This mode is especially useful for the study of crystalline material, in which case crystallographic information can be obtained. In the case where a single (monocrystalline) crystal is studied, diffraction patterns can even be used for the reconstruction of the 3D potential distribution of the atoms that constitute the crystal. For isotropic resolution, diffraction patterns need to be collected for all orientations of the crystal. In practice, data is usually collected while continuous tilting of the crystal over an appropriate range. This technique is called micro Electron Diffraction, or 3D electron crystallography. Diffraction peak intensities only provide structure factor amplitudes, phase information is missing and has to be obtained by other methods. If the diffraction peaks extend to high resolution (order 1 Angstrom) and the number of atoms in the unit cell is limited, phases can be derived computationally using certain constraints (atomicity, phase correlations). For larger molecules and lower resolution, a method called &#x2018;molecular replacement&#x2019; is often used, using phase information from homologue structures as initial guess for the phase. For entirely unknown structures this cannot be done. Other popular phasing methods as used in X-ray crystallography (anomalous dispersion, isomorphous replacement) are not well applicable for electron crystallography.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Moreover, current transition electron microscopy (TEM) systems operating in electron diffraction mode struggle to obtain the full exit wave (of the specimen i.e., the complex exit wave including both amplitude and phase information). Instead, TEM systems operating in electron diffraction mode merely record the intensity of scattered and/or diffracted electrons at various points in a detector positioned in a magnified image of the diffraction plane, and then generate a reconstruction of the specimen based only on the detected intensity values (i.e., without phase information). This inability to determine phase information limits the types of objects that can be effectively imaged by TEM systems operating in electron diffraction mode. While current electron holography setups exist that allow for both intensity and phase information to be obtained via superposition of a coherent wave with the electrons scattered and/or diffracted electrons by an object, these systems are unable to generate results from electrons scattered and/or diffracted electrons that are detected in the diffraction plane. For example, off-axis holography is a well-known technique that has been developed to obtain full exit waves of a specimen, but currently this technique can only be only applied where the specimen is imaged onto the camera.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Methods for using electron diffraction holography to investigate a sample, according to the present disclosure include the initial steps of emitting a plurality of electrons toward the sample, forming the plurality of electrons into a first electron beam and a second electron beam, and then modifying the focal properties of at least one of the first electron beam and the second electron beam such that the two electron beams have different focal planes.

More specifically, the methods and systems disclosed herein include and/or are configured to allow for diffraction holograms of a sample to be generated from interference patterns between an in-focus electron beam and a wide reference electron beam that are detected in the diffraction plane. In the methods and systems, a plurality of electrons that have been emitted by an electron source are split into a coherent first and second electron beam, and the focal properties of at least one of the first electron beam and the second electron beam are modified such that corresponding focal planes of the first electron beam and the second electron beam are different. In some embodiments, the focal plane of at least one of the first electron beam and the second electron beam is modified such that the first electron beam is focused at a plane at or near the sample, and the second electron beam is made to be a parallel (or almost parallel), convergent, or divergent beam when incident on the sample. In various embodiments, the first electron beam passes through an aperture in the sample and/or a thin portion of the sample such that it is not substantially affected by the sample, allowing the first electron beam to serve as a reference beam. An interference pattern of the first electron beam and the diffracted second electron beam is then detected in the diffraction plane, and then used to generate a diffraction hologram. The diffraction hologram provides both phase and amplitude of the diffraction pattern.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, when the above process is used in micro-electron diffraction, diffraction holograms of a sample (e.g., a crystal) may be obtained at a plurality of sample tilts to determine information for the sample (e.g., phase and amplitude of diffraction peaks). Alternatively, the above processes may be used to generate a single diffraction hologram of a sample (e.g., crystalline, multi-crystalline, partly crystalline, non-crystalline, etc.) from which holographic techniques can be used to determine the full exit wave of the specimen (i.e., a complex exit wave including both phase and amplitude) can be retrieved. If this is repeated to obtain the full exit wave of the specimen at multiple sample tilts then 3D information (i.e., tomography) can be obtained using the above process. In some embodiments, the plurality of electrons are split and/or modified at least partially by a bifocal beamformer. The bifocal beamformers according to some embodiments of the present invention are configured to apply a at least a quadrupole lensing effect to at least one of the first electron beam and the second electron beam. In some embodiments, the bifocal beamformers causes the focal planes of the two electron beams to be different. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the bifocal beamforms causes a change in the focal properties of at least one of the electron beams such that, when the beams are passed through a multipole element (i.e., a multipole/corrector/stigmator that applies at least a quadrupole lensing effect) downstream of the bifocal beamformer, the corresponding focal planes of the two beams are caused to be different. For example, one beam may be caused to have a focal plan at a sample, and the other beam may have a corresponding focal plane at least 0.1%, 1%, 10%, or 100% of the objective lens focal distance above and/or below the specimen. The diameter of one beam at the sample may be at least one of 50, 100, 500, or 1000 times greater than the diameter of the other electron beam (i.e., the geometric spot size). Alternatively, or in addition, the diameter of one beam at the sample may be at least one of 50, 100, 500, or 1000 times greater than the diameter of the other electron beam when the other electron beam is in focus.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an illustration of bifocal multibeam system(s) <b>100</b> that is set up to conduct diffraction holography, according to the present invention.

Alternatively, or in addition, the bifocal beamformer may include a biprism, an amplitude-division electron beam splitter made of thin crystals or nanofabricated gratings, a beam splitting laser system, or another type of mechanism known to those skilled in the art for splitting electron beams.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">At <b>306</b>, the focal properties of at least one of the first electron beam and the second electron beam is modified. Specifically, according to the present invention the bifocal beamformer or a component thereof is further configured to modify the focal properties of at least one of the first electron beam and a second electron beam such that the two beams have different corresponding focal planes. In some embodiments, the focal properties and/or focal planes of both beams is adjusted. However, in other embodiments, the focal properties and/or focal planes of just one of the two beams is adjusted.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the bifocal beamformer is a MEMS device that comprises a plurality of electrodes configured to, when certain voltages are applied thereto, generate an electromagnetic field pattern that applies at least quadrupole a lensing effect to one of the electron beams. In another example, where the bifocal beamformer comprises a plurality of apertures and/or cavities, the plurality of apertures and/or cavities form a pattern that creates an electromagnetic field that applies at least a quadrupole lensing effect to one of the electron beams during use of the bifocal beamformer. Such lensing effects focus, stigmate, or otherwise modify at least the electron beam such that the corresponding focal properties of the two beams are made different. In some embodiments, a quadrupole lensing effect applied by the bifocal beam former adjusts the focal properties of one of the electron beams while applying an astigmatism to the beam that causes it to be non-cylindrically symmetric (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). In such embodiments, a multipole element (e.g., a stigmator) downstream of the bifocal beamformer applies a complimentary quadrupole lensing effect to the one of the electron beams to cause it to become a cylindrically symmetric beam again. Thus, downstream of such a corrector each electron beam may be cylindrically symmetric, while having different focal planes. In various setups this corrector may be placed in a focal plane of the other electron beam so that the quadrupole lensing effect is not applied to the other electron beam.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Alternatively, or in addition, the bifocal beamformer may include one or more lenses positioned or otherwise configured to modify the focal planes of the first or second electron beam. In some embodiments, the bifocal beamformer adjusts the focal properties and/or focal planes of different regions of the electrons emitted by the electron source before they are split into the first and second electron beams, such that when the electrons are split into the two electron beams, the two beams have different corresponding focal planes.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">At <b>308</b>, one of the electron beams is focused onto a first plane on the sample, and at <b>310</b>, the other electron beam is focused on a second plane that is not at or near the sample. In various embodiments, the one of the electron beams is focused so that it passes through an aperture in the sample and/or a portion of the sample that is thin enough that the electron beam is not substantially affected by the sample. This allows the one of the electron beams to serve as a reference beam that enables diffraction electron holography.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the other electron beam is focused on a plane located at least 0.1%, 1%, 10%, or 100% of the objective lens focal distance above and/or below the sample. Additionally, the two electron beams may be focused such that the diameter of one of the electron beams at the sample is at least one of 50, 100, 500, or 1000 times greater than the diameter of the other electron beam at the sample. In some embodiments, the electron beams pass through a focusing column that directs them onto their respective focus planes. The focusing column may include one or more correctors, transfer lenses, deflectors, scan coils, beam blankers, etc. necessary to enable and/or enhance the investigation of the sample.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">At <b>312</b>, electrons and/or emissions resultant from the electron beams interacting with the sample are detected. For example, one or more detectors positioned in the diffraction plane may detect portions of the electron beams that are transmitted through the sample, electrons diffracted by the sample, emissions from the sample, or a combination thereof. Specifically, an interference pattern of the two electron beams is detected. In some embodiments, the interfere pattern is detected in the diffraction plane.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">At <b>314</b>, a diffraction hologram is generated is generated based on the interference pattern of the two electron beams. Because the two beams are mutually coherent, the one of the electron beams has a known phase and acts as a reference beam to enable the phase of the electrons diffracted by the sample, allowing both the phase and the amplitude of the diffraction pattern to be determined. As discussed above, this process can be used to determine the phase and amplitude of the diffraction peaks in the interference pattern/diffraction hologram, which can in turn be used to determine the structure and/or other crystallographic information about the crystal, even where no prior information was known about the crystal.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Moreover, the diffraction hologram can then be used to retrieve the specimen exit wave function (e.g., both amplitude and phase). In some embodiments, this specimen wave function can then be used to determine the crystal lattice (i.e., crystal structure) and/or a hologram image of the sample structure.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In an alternate or supplemental process step, the phase information of the specimen exit wave function may be determined separate from the holography analysis discussed above. For example, where the beam that is focused so that it passes through the sample is applied multiple times with different known relative phase shifts (e.g., by shifting, defocusing, or causing other kinds of aberrations to one of the two beams using, e.g., the bifocal beamforming MEMS device, etc.), the resulting intensity patterns can be recorded and then used to derive the relative phase of the wave at the detector/in the diffraction plane. For example, a phase difference &#x3c6; between the detected interference pattern/diffraction hologram and the reference beam may be according to the relationships:</p><p id="p-0062" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <mrow>       <mi>tan</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>&#x3c6;</mi>      </mrow>      <mo>=</mo>      <mfrac>       <mrow>        <mrow>         <mi>L</mi>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <msubsup>          <mi>s</mi>          <mi>b</mi>          <mn>2</mn>         </msubsup>        </mrow>        <mo>-</mo>        <msubsup>         <mi>s</mi>         <mi>a</mi>         <mn>2</mn>        </msubsup>       </mrow>       <mrow>        <mrow>         <msub>          <mi>Lc</mi>          <mi>b</mi>         </msub>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <msub>          <mi>s</mi>          <mi>b</mi>         </msub>        </mrow>        <mo>-</mo>        <mrow>         <msub>          <mi>c</mi>          <mi>a</mi>         </msub>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <msub>          <mi>s</mi>          <mi>a</mi>         </msub>        </mrow>       </mrow>      </mfrac>     </mrow>     <mo>;</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>L</mi>      <mo>=</mo>      <mfrac>       <mrow>        <msub>         <mi>I</mi>         <mn>2</mn>        </msub>        <mo>-</mo>        <msub>         <mi>I</mi>         <mn>1</mn>        </msub>       </mrow>       <mrow>        <msub>         <mi>I</mi>         <mn>3</mn>        </msub>        <mo>-</mo>        <msub>         <mi>I</mi>         <mn>1</mn>        </msub>       </mrow>      </mfrac>     </mrow>     <mo>;</mo>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>s</mi>       <mi>a</mi>      </msub>      <mo>=</mo>      <mrow>       <mi>sin</mi>       <mo>&#x2061;</mo>       <mo>(</mo>       <mrow>        <mi>&#x3b1;</mi>        <mo>/</mo>        <mn>2</mn>       </mrow>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>     </mrow>     <mo>;</mo>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>c</mi>       <mi>a</mi>      </msub>      <mo>=</mo>      <mrow>       <mi>cos</mi>       <mo>&#x2061;</mo>       <mo>(</mo>       <mrow>        <mi>&#x3b1;</mi>        <mo>/</mo>        <mn>2</mn>       </mrow>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>     </mrow>     <mo>;</mo>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>s</mi>       <mi>b</mi>      </msub>      <mo>=</mo>      <mrow>       <mi>sin</mi>       <mo>&#x2061;</mo>       <mo>(</mo>       <mrow>        <mi>&#x3b2;</mi>        <mo>/</mo>        <mn>2</mn>       </mrow>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>     </mrow>     <mo>;</mo>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>c</mi>       <mi>b</mi>      </msub>      <mo>=</mo>      <mrow>       <mi>cos</mi>       <mo>&#x2061;</mo>       <mo>(</mo>       <mrow>        <mi>&#x3b2;</mi>        <mo>/</mo>        <mn>2</mn>       </mrow>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>     </mrow>     <mo>;</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mn>1</mn>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">where I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, and I<sub>3 </sub>are the measured intensities for 3 different phase shifts between the two beams, &#x3b1; is the phase shift difference of one of the beams between a first measurement and a second measurement, and &#x3b2; is the phase shift difference of one of the beams between the first measurement and a third measurement.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref> are illustrations of the optical performance of a bifocal multibeam system(s) <b>100</b> according to the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows example beam paths of example bifocal multibeam system <b>400</b> setup to conduct electron diffraction holography.
