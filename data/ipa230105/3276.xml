This is typically done by including a suspension between the wheels and the vehicle body. When such vehicles travel over bumps and cracks, the suspension absorbs the vertical movement of the wheels so that the vehicle body generally stays at the same height, or moves up and down much more slowly. This helps to avoid damage to the vehicle, as well as harm to the driver and passengers. However, it is still possible for the suspension to bottom out when traveling at higher speeds or over rougher terrain. When this occurs, damage is done to the vehicle frame and the suspension components. Other parts of the vehicle may collide as well, causing additional damage. In addition, the vehicle passengers can experience serious bodily harm, such as spinal compression.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aspects of this document relate to a bump stop assembly for a UTV comprising a frame attachment configured to couple with a frame of the UTV, the frame attachment having an upper clamp and a lower clamp each configured to grip the frame of the UTV, the upper clamp separated from the lower clamp by a saddle configured to support the frame within the frame attachment, a shock absorber attachment having at least one clamp, at least one panel extending between the frame attachment and the shock absorber attachment, the at least one panel having a bend extending diagonally across the at least one panel and dividing the at least one panel into a first section and a second section, a shock absorber gripped by the at least one clamp of the shock absorber attachment, the shock absorber having a piston configured to absorb and dissipate energy transferred to the bump stop assembly by a force applied to a suspension system of the UTV, and a bump stop bracket coupled to a trailing arm of the suspension system, the bracket having a bump plate located to contact the shock absorber when the force applied to the suspension system causes the suspension system to reach a predetermined level of a capacity of the suspension system to absorb, the bump plate bracket configured to transfer a portion of the force applied to the suspension system to the shock absorber.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Particular embodiments may comprise one or more of the following features.

Unless specifically noted, it is intended that the words and phrases in the specification and the claims be given their plain, ordinary, and accustomed meaning to those of ordinary skill in the applicable arts. The inventors are fully aware that they can be their own lexicographers if desired. The inventors expressly elect, as their own lexicographers, to use only the plain and ordinary meaning of terms in the specification and claims unless they clearly state otherwise and then further, expressly set forth the &#x201c;special&#x201d; definition of that term and explain how it differs from the plain and ordinary meaning. Absent such clear statements of intent to apply a &#x201c;special&#x201d; definition, it is the inventors' intent and desire that the simple, plain and ordinary meaning to the terms be applied to the interpretation of the specification and claims.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The inventors are also aware of the normal precepts of English grammar. Thus, if a noun, term, or phrase is intended to be further characterized, specified, or narrowed in some way, then such noun, term, or phrase will expressly include additional adjectives, descriptive terms, or other modifiers in accordance with the normal precepts of English grammar. Absent the use of such adjectives, descriptive terms, or modifiers, it is the intent that such nouns, terms, or phrases be given their plain, and ordinary English meaning to those skilled in the applicable arts as set forth above.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, the inventors are fully informed of the standards and application of the special provisions of 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 112 (f).

When the off-road vehicle travels over a bump or crack, the force applied to the off-road vehicle is mostly absorbed by the suspension system of the off-road vehicle. In situations where the capability of the suspension system to absorb the force is exhausted to a predetermined level, the bump stop assembly <b>100</b> may be configured to engage. The bump stop assembly <b>100</b> is configurable, such that any predetermined level may be selected. For example, in one embodiment, the bump stop assembly <b>100</b> may engage once the suspension system has exhausted 75% of its ability to absorb the force applied. Another embodiment may be configured to engage at 25 or 50%. As stated above, any percentage may be selected.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref> illustrate one embodiment of the bump stop assembly <b>100</b> of the UTV <b>200</b>. The bump stop assembly <b>100</b> has a frame attachment <b>102</b> and a shock absorber attachment <b>104</b>. Additionally, the bump stop assembly <b>100</b> may have at least one panel <b>106</b>, a shock absorber <b>108</b>, and a bracket or bump plate bracket <b>110</b>. In some instances, the shock absorber <b>108</b> may be a bump stop, such as a bump stop (or hydraulic bump stop) made by King Shocks, Fox, or another supplier as known in the art. The bump stop assembly <b>100</b> may be implemented on each wheel of the off-road vehicle, including the front and rear wheels, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref>. The frame attachment <b>102</b> is configured to couple to a frame <b>112</b> of an off-road vehicle. The frame attachment <b>102</b> may couple to a roll cage or frame member of the off-road vehicle or UTV <b>200</b> as well. The frame attachment <b>102</b> may have at least one clamp <b>114</b>, which may include an upper clamp <b>116</b> and a lower clamp <b>118</b>. In some embodiments, the at least one clamp <b>114</b> is configured to wrap around and grip a member <b>119</b> of the frame <b>112</b> of the off-road vehicle <b>200</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, the at least one clamp <b>114</b> may include at least one mechanical fastener <b>120</b>, such as a screw, which tightens the at least one clamp <b>114</b> around the frame <b>112</b>. In other embodiments, the at least one clamp <b>114</b> is another type of mount or assembly configured to join the frame attachment <b>102</b> to the frame <b>112</b>. Alternatively, or in addition, the frame attachment <b>102</b> may couple to the frame <b>112</b> through a weld <b>121</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Other methods of attaching the bump stop assembly <b>100</b> to the frame <b>112</b> may be used. The upper clamp <b>116</b> may be separated from the lower clamp <b>118</b> by a saddle <b>122</b>. The saddle <b>122</b> is configured to support the frame <b>112</b> within the frame attachment <b>102</b>. As shown, the saddle <b>122</b> may be an open pipe which joins the upper clamp <b>116</b> to the lower clamp <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In embodiments with the at least one panel <b>106</b>, the at least one panel <b>106</b> extends between the frame attachment <b>102</b> and the shock absorber attachment <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the at least one panel <b>106</b> is two panels <b>106</b>, but may be any desirable number of members or subcomponents that are joined, as well as a single or integrally formed member. The at least one panel <b>106</b> may or may not be a flat sheet, may take any shape, and may be formed of shaped, bent, or formed sheet material, channel material, extruded members, cast members, billet members, forged members, or be machined from a block or larger component or source of material. In some instances, panel <b>106</b> may be absent and frame attachment <b>102</b> may be in direct contact with, or directly attached to, the shock absorber attachment <b>104</b>, without any intervening members or elements, such as panel <b>106</b>. The purpose of the at least one panel <b>106</b> is to join the frame attachment <b>102</b> to the shock absorber attachment <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the frame attachment <b>102</b> is directly coupled to the shock absorber attachment <b>104</b>, and the at least one panel <b>106</b> is not needed. Each of the at least one panel <b>106</b> may have a bend <b>124</b> which extends across the panel <b>106</b> and divides the panel <b>106</b> into a first section <b>126</b> and a second section <b>128</b>. The bend <b>124</b> may extend diagonally across the panel <b>106</b>. The bend <b>124</b> allows for a flat or planar member to accommodate positions or multiple members to which it is coupled, and that otherwise would not be aligned. Each of the panels <b>106</b> may have at least one attachment tab <b>130</b> on each of the first section <b>126</b> and the second section <b>128</b>. Each of the at least one attachment tab <b>130</b> is configured to mate with a slot <b>132</b> on one of the frame attachment <b>102</b> and the shock absorber attachment <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The shock absorber attachment <b>104</b> is configured to couple to the shock absorber <b>108</b>. Similar to the frame attachment <b>102</b>, the shock absorber attachment <b>104</b> may have at least one clamp <b>114</b> which is configured to grip the shock absorber <b>108</b>. The shock absorber attachment <b>104</b> may also couple to the shock absorber <b>108</b> through a weld. Other methods of attaching the shock absorber attachment <b>104</b> to the shock absorber <b>108</b> may be used. The shock absorber <b>108</b> is configured to absorb energy transferred to the bump stop assembly <b>100</b> by the force applied to the suspension system. In addition, some embodiments dissipate this energy transferred to the bump stop assembly <b>100</b>. For example, the shock absorber <b>108</b> may be configured so that when a force is applied to the suspension system that exceeds the predetermined level of the capacity of the suspension system to absorb on its own, the bump stop assembly <b>100</b> engages and absorbs a portion of the force applied through the shock absorber <b>108</b>. In some embodiments, this force is transferred to the bump stop assembly <b>100</b> specifically through a piston <b>134</b> of the shock absorber <b>108</b>. The piston <b>134</b> may be one or more of a shaft, a spring, a dashpot, an elastically deformable material, and a rubber mount. The piston <b>134</b> may be a charged piston or a hydraulic piston. In embodiments with a charged piston, the piston <b>134</b> is pneumatic and thus compresses a charged fluid to absorb a portion of the energy transferred to the bump stop assembly <b>100</b>. Some of this energy is also dissipated through heat as the charged fluid is compressed. The charged fluid may be any suitable fluid, including nitrogen or air. In other embodiments, the charged piston may be electric, magnetic (whether electromagnet, rare earth magnet, or other magnet), or any other suitable type known in the art.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The bracket or bump plate bracket <b>110</b> may be coupled to a trailing arm of the suspension system. In some embodiments, the bracket <b>110</b> is welded to the trailing arm, while in other embodiments, the bracket <b>110</b> is coupled to the trailing arm with at least one fastener or clamp. Other methods of coupling components together may also be used. To aid in the transfer of force from the suspension system to the bump stop assembly <b>100</b>, the bump plate bracket <b>110</b> comprises or has a bump plate <b>136</b>. The bump plate <b>136</b> is located to contact the shock absorber <b>108</b> when the force applied to the suspension system causes the suspension system to reach the predetermined level of the capacity of the suspension system to absorb. In addition, the bump plate <b>136</b> may be oriented horizontal to the surface supporting the vehicle. Because the bump plate <b>136</b> and the shock absorber <b>108</b> are not fixed to each other either translationally or rotationally, but instead only contact each other, the bump plate <b>136</b> mainly transfers only certain directions of the force to the shock absorber <b>108</b>. For example, the bump plate <b>136</b> may be configured to transfer a vertical component of the force applied to the suspension system to the shock absorber <b>108</b> without transferring a horizontal component of the force.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The bump stop assembly is used on the UTV <b>200</b>, which for the purposes of this disclosure, includes, but is not limited to: a(n) all-terrain vehicle (&#x201c;ATV&#x201d;), off-highway vehicle (&#x201c;OHV&#x201d;), off-road vehicle (&#x201c;ORV&#x201d;), utility task vehicle, recreational off-highway vehicle (&#x201c;ROV&#x201d;), side-by-side UTV or ROV, quad, quad bike, four-wheeler, snowmobile, dune buggy, or the like. In certain implementations, the bump stop assembly is used in a vehicle that may experience high stresses or be driven with less care than normal, such as: golf carts, farm or ranch vehicles, construction vehicles, rental cars, commercial vehicles, go-carts, racing vehicles, mid- or light-duty snowplows, or other vehicles that encounter rugged terrain and/or abusive driving habits. In some implementations, the bump stop assembly is used on UTVs such as a side-by-side UTV or ROV vehicle such as: a Polaris&#xae; RZR&#xae;, a Polaris&#xae; Ranger&#xae;, a Kawasaki&#xae; Mule&#x2122;, Arctic Cat&#xae; Wildcat&#x2122;, Arctic Cat&#xae; Prowler&#xae;, Can-Am&#xae; Maverick&#xae;, Can-Am&#xae; Maverick&#xae; X3, Yamaha&#xae; YXZ1000R&#xae;, Yamaha&#xae; Wolverine&#xae;, or other similar ROV or UTV vehicles currently existing or yet to be developed.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The at least one panel <b>106</b> couples the frame attachment <b>102</b> to the shock absorber attachment <b>104</b>, such that the shock absorber attachment <b>104</b> securely holds the shock absorber <b>108</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, when a force is applied to the wheels of the vehicle <b>200</b>, the wheels <b>202</b> move upward, which compresses the suspension of the vehicle. If the force exceeds the predetermined level of the capacity of the suspension system to absorb on its own, the bump stop assembly <b>100</b> engages and passes the excess force to the shock absorber <b>108</b>, causing the piston <b>134</b> to compress into the shock absorber <b>108</b>. This absorbs a portion of the force applied and stretches the duration of the transfer of the force from the wheels to the frame <b>112</b> over a longer period of time. This decreases the stresses that occur in the frame <b>112</b> and other vehicle components, as well as protects passengers of the vehicle from excessive forces.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> is a top schematic view of the UTV <b>200</b> with the bump assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> installed on both front wheels <b>202</b> and both rear wheels <b>202</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> is a close-up view of the front wheel <b>202</b> of the UTV <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, taken from circular section line <b>9</b>B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref> is a close-up view of the back wheel <b>202</b> of the UTV <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, taken from circular section line <b>9</b>C.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">It will be understood that implementations of a bump stop assembly are not limited to the specific assemblies, devices and components disclosed in this document, as virtually any assemblies, devices and components consistent with the intended operation of a bump stop assembly may be used.
