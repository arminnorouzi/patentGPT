No. 16/618,430, filed Dec. 2, 2019, which is a 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 371 national phase filing of International Application No. PCT/SE2017/050590, filed Jun. 2, 2017, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to a method and a power control unit, for supplying electric power to a first radio unit of a network node in a wireless network, so the first radio unit can transmit radio signals to wireless devices.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the field of wireless communication, network nodes of a wireless network typically comprise one or more radio units from which radio signals are transmitted to be received by various wireless devices. This transmission requires supply of electric power which is conventionally accomplished by means of a power supply unit that may serve a number of radio units of a network node. One or more radio units are typically arranged on top of a tower while the power supply unit is arranged at the bottom. If the tower height is substantial, this means that the distance between the power supply unit and the radio units is correspondingly large and the cables used for feeding the electric power up to the radio units must also be of substantial length so that energy dissipates from the cable in the form of heat.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As new radio technologies and systems are introduced in wireless networks to meet the ever growing demands for wireless services, the power consumption of radio units will also increase rapidly. Implementation of new features and functions and improvements on hardware components of the radio units will enable increasing amounts of wireless devices to be served and with higher data rates. As a result, the power consumption of radio units will also increase and more efficient technologies and equipment are not enough to reduce the overall power consumption, which in turn requires high capacity of the power supply unit and its power feeding cables connected to the radio units.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In new technologies and networks, e.g. for the fifth Generation &#x201c;5G&#x201d; and New Radio &#x201c;NR&#x201d;, more antennas will typically be added on radio heads within the radio units which will further increase the power consumption per radio unit. Today, the capacity of the power supply unit and the power feeding cables must be dimensioned for the highest power consumption that occurs over time, referred to as peak power, in order to provide wireless services also when the transmissions are at a maximum. However, the periods when the power consumption is at a maximum are quite short and the power consumption is much lower most of the time such that the capacity of the power supply unit is rarely utilized.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of embodiments described herein to address at least some of the problems and issues outlined above. It is possible to achieve this object and others by using a method and a power control unit as defined in the attached independent claims.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one aspect, a method is performed by a power control unit for supplying electric power to a first radio unit of a network node in a wireless network. In this method the power control unit obtains a scheduled power demand related to an amount of electric power required in the first radio unit for transmissions scheduled in an imminent time interval, such as a resource block or a subframe. Electric power is supplied to the first radio unit from a power supply unit if the power demand does not exceed a power threshold. Electric power is supplied to the first radio unit from the power supply unit and a supplementary power source if the power demand exceeds the power threshold.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another aspect, a power control unit is arranged to supply electric power to a first radio unit of a network node in a wireless network. The power control unit is configured to obtain a scheduled power demand related to an amount of electric power required in the first radio unit for transmissions scheduled in an imminent time interval. The power control unit is further configured to supply electric power from a power supply unit to the first radio unit if the power demand does not exceed a power threshold, and to supply electric power from the power supply unit and a supplementary power source to the first radio unit if the power demand exceeds the power threshold.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an advantage in this solution that the power supply unit can be dimensioned with lower capacity than in conventional solutions since as soon as the power demand goes above the power threshold, the supplementary power source adds the extra power needed. Another advantage is that thinner cables can be used between the power supply unit and the first radio unit thanks to the reduced maximum power from the power supply unit, and the energy losses by heat dissipation from the cables is also reduced. The supplementary power source may be a relatively simple battery which can be installed close to the radio unit, e.g. at the top of a tower, using a relatively short cable.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The above method and power control unit may be configured and implemented according to different optional embodiments to accomplish further features and benefits, to be described below.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A computer program is also provided which comprises instructions which, when executed on at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to carry out either of the methods described above. A carrier containing the above computer program is further provided, wherein the carrier is one of an electronic signal, an optical signal, a radio signal, or a computer readable storage medium.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The solution will now be described in more detail by means of exemplary embodiments and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a structure view illustrating how electric power is conventionally supplied to a set of radio units of a network node, according to the prior art.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a structure view illustrating how the solution may be employed for supplying electric power to a first radio unit in a set of radio units of a network node, according to some example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example of how a power control unit may be structured and operate, according to further example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating a procedure in a power control unit, according to further example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating how the power demand in one or more radio units may vary over time in a wireless network.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating an example of how a power control unit may operate in more detail, according to further example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating how a power control unit may be structured to undertake any of the procedures described herein, according to further example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating how a battery may be arranged to enable flexible usage and charging, according to further example embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Briefly described, a solution is provided to avoid the necessity of a power supply unit with &#x201c;over-sized&#x201d; capacity to cope with peak power occurring only with short duration, meaning that most of the time the full capacity of such a unit is far from utilized, i.e. when the power demand is normally much lower. A power supply unit (PSU) with considerably reduced capacity can be used instead by also employing a supplementary power source at a radio unit, in addition to the power supply unit, if the power demand for that radio unit exceeds a predefined power threshold. As long as the power demand is not above the power threshold, it is sufficient to use only the power supply unit which can thereby be dimensioned with lower capacity than in conventional solutions. Thinner cables can also be used between the power supply unit and the radio units and the energy losses by heat dissipation from the cables can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The supplementary power source may be a relatively simple battery which can be installed close to the radio unit, e.g. at the top of a tower. The supplementary power source in this solution may also be called a radio battery unit (RBU) which term is sometimes used below.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this disclosure, the term &#x201c;power demand&#x201d; basically indicates how much electric power is needed in a radio unit for performing transmissions scheduled in an imminent time interval, which may also be referred to as &#x201c;scheduled power demand&#x201d;. Information about the radio unit's power demand scheduled for an imminent, or next, time interval can be obtained from a scheduling function of the network node which schedules transmissions in radio resource elements of each upcoming time interval. The scheduled power demand can thus be obtained on a dynamic basis per time interval which may be a resource block or a subframe in which transmissions are scheduled to one or more wireless devices. The time interval discussed in this description should be understood as a time interval in which transmissions can be scheduled, which may have a duration in the range of one or more milliseconds or even a fraction of a millisecond, depending on the radio technology used.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">This means that the scheduled power demand may change instantly from one time interval to another depending on how the transmissions are scheduled for the radio unit, and the supply of power to the radio unit can be adapted accordingly. In more detail, the supplementary power source can be connected and disconnected to/from the first radio unit depending on whether the power demand for an imminent time interval exceeds the power threshold or not. The power threshold may be set so that it does not exceed an available capacity of the power supply unit.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, the scheduled power demand may be dependent on how much transmissions are scheduled, and also on how far away the intended recipients are located from the network node which may be subject to more or less dynamic power regulation. Further, broadcast information is typically transmitted with relatively high power to reach the fringes of a cell, while dedicated data and messages may be transmitted with less power necessary to reach a particular recipient such as a wireless device. It should be noted that the scheduled power demand can be very precise, i.e. not more than needed for performing scheduled transmissions from the radio unit.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a conventional arrangement for power supply at a network node where a power supply unit (PSU) <b>100</b> is located at the bottom of a tower <b>102</b> of substantial height, e.g. to provide radio coverage across one or more macro cells. In this example, three radio units <b>104</b>A-C are mounted at the top of the tower <b>102</b> and electric power is supplied by the PSU <b>100</b> to each radio unit <b>104</b>A-C over respective cables <b>106</b> running along the entire height of the tower <b>102</b>. The cables <b>106</b> used for feeding electric power up to the radio units <b>104</b>A-C are thus of substantial length and they must also be dimensioned thick enough to deliver the highest occurring peak power according to conventional procedures.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As mentioned above, drawbacks of this normally used arrangement include high requirements for capacity of the PSU <b>100</b> and dimensioning of the cables <b>106</b>, resulting in high costs. The PSU <b>100</b> thus needs to be dimensioned to provide electric power to all radio units <b>104</b>A-C for handling power consumption from minimum level to peak power. It is thus a problem that capacity capable of delivering peak power must be obtained in the power supply, while this capacity is used in full only during a fraction of the total time. These drawbacks and problems can be solved or at least reduced as follows.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an arrangement where the solution is used at a similar network node <b>200</b> which likewise employs a PSU <b>202</b> for feeding electric power to three radio units <b>204</b>A-C situated on top of a tower. This arrangement is however different by also employing a supplementary power source RBU <b>208</b> located close to the radio unit <b>204</b>A, in addition to the PSU <b>202</b>, such that the RBU <b>208</b> is connected to the radio unit <b>204</b>A over a cable <b>208</b>C only if the scheduled power demand for radio unit <b>204</b>A exceeds a predefined power threshold. It should be understood that similar supplementary power sources, not shown here, can also be employed for the other radio units <b>204</b>B and <b>204</b>C. Thereby, the PSU <b>202</b> and a feeding cable <b>206</b> to each radio unit can be dimensioned with considerably less capacity and energy losses than in a conventional arrangement.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> in more detail, only showing entities and functions needed for one radio unit, here called a first radio unit <b>302</b>, of a network node <b>304</b>. The solution can be realized by functionality in a power control unit <b>300</b> which may be arranged within or connected to the first radio unit <b>302</b>. A PSU <b>308</b> remains connected to the first radio unit <b>302</b> for supplying electric power more or less on a continuous basis. The PSU <b>308</b> may be a site power system or the like supplying power to several radio units and other equipment at the network node. A supplementary power source RBU <b>310</b> is further located close to the first radio unit <b>302</b> and can be connected and disconnected in manner described below. Such a supplementary power source may be employed at each radio unit of the network node.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The network node <b>304</b> further comprises a transmission control function <b>304</b>A in which a scheduling function <b>304</b>B, denoted &#x201c;scheduler&#x201d; for short, operates to schedule transmissions from the first radio unit <b>302</b> on a time interval basis. As mentioned above, the time interval may be a resource block or a subframe in which transmissions can be scheduled. The transmission control function <b>304</b>A may operate in a base band (BB) according to regular procedures not necessary to describe here since the transmission control as such lies outside the solution. It is also shown that the network node <b>304</b> belongs to a wireless network <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In this figure, a first action <b>3</b>:<b>1</b> illustrates that the power control unit <b>300</b> obtains from the scheduler <b>304</b>B a scheduled power demand for transmissions scheduled in an imminent time interval for the first radio unit <b>302</b>, as indicated by a dashed arrow to the power control unit <b>300</b>. Normally, the scheduling function of a network node provides information about a radio unit's scheduled power demand to the PSU of the network node, as illustrated by a dashed arrow to PSU <b>308</b>, so that the PSU can feed the required amount of power in real time to that radio unit. In this example, the scheduler <b>304</b>B thus provides this information to the power control unit <b>300</b> as well. This action is repeated for every new time interval.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a next action <b>3</b>:<b>2</b>, the power control unit <b>300</b> makes sure that the required amount of power according to the obtained power demand is supplied to the first radio unit <b>302</b>, either from the PSU <b>308</b> alone if the obtained power demand does not exceed a power threshold, or from both the PSU <b>308</b> and the RBU <b>310</b> if the obtained power demand exceeds the power threshold. Accordingly, action <b>3</b>:<b>2</b> includes an action <b>3</b>:<b>2</b>A where the power control unit <b>300</b> activates or deactivates the RBU <b>310</b>, by connection and disconnection thereof by means of a switch <b>310</b>A as indicated by another dashed arrow, to deliver power to the first radio unit <b>302</b> whenever the power demand exceeds the power threshold. Hence, actions <b>3</b>:<b>1</b> and <b>3</b>:<b>2</b>-<b>3</b>:<b>2</b>A are repeated for every new time interval which ensures that the required amount of power is supplied to the first radio unit <b>302</b> while employing the RBU <b>310</b> no more than necessary. During periods when the RBU <b>310</b> is not employed, which is likely to be most of the time, the battery therein can be connected to a power supply for charging so as to remain charged at all times. The above-mentioned PSU <b>308</b> may be used as the power supply for charging.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">By using the above procedure and arrangement, it is an advantage that the demands for capacity in the power supply unit or PSU <b>308</b> and its feeding cables are considerably reduced which means that simpler equipment can be used resulting in lower costs. Another advantage is that the activation and deactivation of the supplementary power source RBU <b>310</b> is performed in a dynamic manner on a time interval basis, so that the PSU and the RBU are used as efficiently as possible while supplying the correct amount of electric power to the radio unit at all times. Since the PSU is no longer required to deliver peak power by itself, the above procedure and arrangement may be referred to as &#x201c;time interval based peak power shaving&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">An example will now be described, with reference to the flow chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, of how the solution may be employed in terms of actions which may be performed by the above-mentioned power control unit. Some optional example embodiments that could be used in this procedure will also be described below. Reference will also be made, without limiting the described features and embodiments, to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. As indicated above, the wireless network may be of any type with network nodes that transmit radio signals in time intervals such as resource blocks or subframes, and any suitable protocols and standards may be employed in the network.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The power control unit <b>300</b> in this procedure is arranged to supply electric power to a first radio unit <b>302</b> of a network node <b>304</b> in a wireless network <b>306</b>. A first optional action <b>400</b> illustrates that the power control unit <b>300</b> may obtain information about capacity of a power supply unit <b>308</b> which is used for supplying electric power at the network node <b>304</b>. The capacity information obtained in this action may include a maximum power that the power supply unit <b>308</b> is capable to supply to the first radio unit <b>302</b>. As indicated above, the power supply unit <b>308</b> may supply power to several radio units and other equipment in the network node at the same time, which means that the first radio unit <b>302</b> effectively shares the power supply unit <b>308</b> and its capacity with other power consumers so that the total capacity needs to be distributed amongst the power consumers. For example, if a new radio unit is added or an existing radio unit is removed, the power available for the first radio unit <b>302</b> may be reduced or increased, respectively. It may therefore be useful to perform action <b>400</b> at least occasionally.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A next action <b>402</b> illustrates that the power control unit <b>300</b> obtains a scheduled power demand related to an amount of electric power required in the first radio unit <b>302</b> for transmissions scheduled in an imminent time interval. In one example embodiment, the power control unit <b>300</b> may obtain the scheduled power demand from a scheduling function <b>304</b>A which is operative to schedule said transmissions in resource elements of each time interval. In other example embodiments, the imminent time interval may be a resource block or a subframe in which said transmissions are scheduled to one or more wireless devices. The term imminent time interval could be replaced by impending, upcoming or next time interval.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a following action <b>404</b>, the power control unit <b>300</b> checks whether the obtained scheduled power demand exceeds a predefined power threshold or not. If it is found in action <b>404</b> that the power demand does not exceed the power threshold, electric power is supplied from a power supply unit <b>308</b> to the first radio unit <b>302</b> in an action <b>406</b>, i.e. without employing the supplementary power source <b>310</b> which can therefore be disconnected from the first radio unit <b>302</b>. On the other hand, if it is found in action <b>404</b> that the power demand exceeds the power threshold, electric power is supplied both from the power supply unit <b>308</b> and a supplementary power source <b>310</b> to the first radio unit <b>302</b> in an alternative action <b>408</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In more detail, action <b>406</b> may be performed by actively disconnecting the supplementary power source <b>310</b> to the first radio unit <b>302</b> in case it was used in the previous time interval, or by keeping the supplementary power source <b>310</b> disconnected from the first radio unit <b>302</b> in case it was not used also in the previous time interval. Correspondingly, action <b>408</b> may be performed by actively connecting the supplementary power source <b>310</b> to the first radio unit <b>302</b> in case it was not used in the previous time interval, or by keeping the supplementary power source <b>310</b> connected to the first radio unit <b>302</b> in case it was used also in the previous time interval.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">After executing either action <b>406</b> or <b>408</b>, the procedure may continue by repeating actions <b>402</b>, <b>404</b> . . . for a next imminent time interval. Some further example embodiments that can be used in the procedure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> will now be described. In one example embodiment, the supplementary power source <b>310</b> may comprise a battery which is charged during periods when electric power is not supplied from the supplementary power source <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In another example embodiment, the power control unit <b>300</b> may adjust the power threshold based on a ratio of usage time when electric power has been supplied from the supplementary power source <b>310</b>. When a battery is used in the supplementary power source <b>310</b>, the latter embodiment may be useful to ensure that there is enough time to charge the battery so that it will not become drained too much when used. This embodiment may thus be applied by raising the power threshold if said ratio of usage time is high meaning that the supplementary power source <b>310</b> has been active for a relatively long time. Raising the power threshold will basically reduce the ratio of usage time. Conversely, the power threshold can be lowered if said ratio of usage time is low meaning that the supplementary power source <b>310</b> has been active for a relatively short time. Lowering the power threshold will basically increase the ratio of usage time.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another example embodiment, the power supply unit <b>308</b> may be shared with one or more other radio units, which was also exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> where three radio units <b>204</b>A-C share the power supply unit <b>202</b>. In another example embodiment, the power threshold may be set so that it does not exceed an available capacity of the power supply unit <b>308</b>. It was explained above that the capacity available to the first radio unit <b>302</b> may be dependent on how much power is used by other power consumers, e.g. radio units, sharing the power supply unit <b>308</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the supplementary power source <b>310</b> comprises a battery, another example embodiment may be that the battery comprises two or more segments that can be used and charged individually. Thereby, the capacity of the battery is flexible in that the number of segments in use can be adapted to the current power demand, while any segment(s) not in use can be charged instead. For example, the currently most charged segment(s) may be connected to the radio unit <b>302</b> while the other less charged segment(s) are being connected to the power supply unit <b>308</b> for charging. An example of this embodiment will be described later below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In another example embodiment, the power control unit <b>300</b> may control the electric power from the supplementary power source <b>310</b> by connecting and disconnecting the supplementary power source <b>310</b> to/from the first radio unit <b>302</b>, e.g. by operating a switch <b>310</b>A arranged on a cable between the supplementary power source <b>310</b> and the first radio unit <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In another example embodiment, the first radio unit <b>302</b> may be located at the top of a tower and the power supply unit <b>308</b> may be located at the bottom of said tower, which was illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. In this case, another example embodiment may be that the supplementary power source <b>310</b> is located at the top of said tower, i.e. close to the first radio unit <b>302</b> which means that the feeding cable from the supplementary power source <b>310</b> can be relatively short to minimize energy losses.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It was mentioned above that the power demand typically varies greatly over time, e.g. depending on how much transmissions are performed which in turn is dependent on the intensity of ongoing communications, referred to as traffic. An example of this is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> which is a diagram with measurements of both how the traffic in a wireless network may vary over the <b>24</b> hours of a day and how the power demand in one or more radio units may fluctuate over a limited time period of a few milliseconds. It can be seen that the power required by the radio unit can change very rapidly between the maximum peak power and virtually no load. The above-described solution may be used to adapt the power supply instantaneously to such a fluctuating power demand in an efficient manner.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A more detailed example of how the procedure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and some of its embodiments could be executed in practice will now be described with reference to the flow chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The actions in this figure can thus be performed by the above-described power control unit <b>300</b> to control supply of power to the first radio unit <b>302</b>, and reference will again be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. It is assumed that the supplementary power source <b>310</b> comprises a battery that needs to be charged now and then in order to work properly. A first action <b>600</b> illustrates that the power control unit <b>300</b> sets an initial power threshold, e.g. to a default value or the like which may have been determined based on previous usage of the power supply unit <b>308</b> and the supplementary power source <b>310</b> described herein.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The following actions <b>602</b>-<b>608</b> are the same as actions <b>402</b>-<b>408</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and they are thus performed in the manner described above. An additional action <b>610</b> illustrates that the power control unit <b>300</b> determines a ratio of usage time when electric power has been supplied from the supplementary power source RBU <b>310</b>. The power control unit <b>300</b> then checks in an action <b>612</b> whether the ratio of usage time has changed significantly over time. If the change is large enough to motivate adjustment of the power threshold, the power control unit <b>300</b> accordingly adjusts the power threshold in an action <b>614</b>. If the ratio of usage time has not changed significantly, action <b>614</b> is skipped and actions <b>602</b>-<b>612</b>/<b>614</b> are repeated for the next imminent time interval.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In more detail, if it is found in action <b>612</b> that the ratio of usage time has changed significantly, action <b>614</b> may be performed in such a manner that the ratio of usage time is restored to a desired level which may correspond to a charging time that is enough to keep the battery alive and working. It has been described above that adjusting the power threshold may include raising the power threshold if the ratio of usage time has increased, so that the ratio of usage time will be reduced, or alternatively lowering the power threshold if the ratio of usage time has decreased, so that the ratio of usage time will be increased. Thereby, a desired balance between usage time and charging time can be maintained for the battery or RBU <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The block diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a detailed but non-limiting example of how a power control unit <b>700</b> may be structured to bring about the above-described solution and embodiments thereof.
