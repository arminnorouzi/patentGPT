A user of the electronic device can interact with the electronic device via the displayed user interface. User interfaces can enable one or more operations to be performed on the electronic device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some techniques for managing user interfaces related to time using electronic devices, however, are generally cumbersome and inefficient. For example, some existing techniques use a complex and time-consuming user interface, which may include multiple key presses or keystrokes. Existing techniques require more time than necessary, wasting user time and device energy. This latter consideration is particularly important in battery-operated devices.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, the present technique provides devices with faster, more efficient methods and interfaces for managing user interfaces related to time. Such methods and interfaces optionally complement or replace other methods for managing user interfaces related to time. Such methods and interfaces reduce the cognitive burden on a user and produce a more efficient human-machine interface.

In some embodiments, the electronic device is a computer system that is in communication (e.g., via wireless communication, via wired communication) with a display generation component. The display generation component is configured to provide visual output, such as display via a CRT display, display via an LED display, or display via image projection.

Touch-sensitive display <b>112</b> is sometimes called a &#x201c;touch screen&#x201d; for convenience and is sometimes known as or called a &#x201c;touch-sensitive display system.&#x201d; Device <b>100</b> includes memory <b>102</b> (which optionally includes one or more computer-readable storage mediums), memory controller <b>122</b>, one or more processing units (CPUs) <b>120</b>, peripherals interface <b>118</b>, RF circuitry <b>108</b>, audio circuitry <b>110</b>, speaker <b>111</b>, microphone <b>113</b>, input/output (I/O) subsystem <b>106</b>, other input control devices <b>116</b>, and external port <b>124</b>. Device <b>100</b> optionally includes one or more optical sensors <b>164</b>. Device <b>100</b> optionally includes one or more contact intensity sensors <b>165</b> for detecting intensity of contacts on device <b>100</b> (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> of device <b>100</b>). Device <b>100</b> optionally includes one or more tactile output generators <b>167</b> for generating tactile outputs on device <b>100</b> (e.g., generating tactile outputs on a touch-sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> of device <b>100</b> or touchpad <b>355</b> of device <b>300</b>). These components optionally communicate over one or more communication buses or signal lines <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As used in the specification and claims, the term &#x201c;intensity&#x201d; of a contact on a touch-sensitive surface refers to the force or pressure (force per unit area) of a contact (e.g., a finger contact) on the touch-sensitive surface, or to a substitute (proxy) for the force or pressure of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface. The intensity of a contact has a range of values that includes at least four distinct values and more typically includes hundreds of distinct values (e.g., at least 256). Intensity of a contact is, optionally, determined (or measured) using various approaches and various sensors or combinations of sensors. For example, one or more force sensors underneath or adjacent to the touch-sensitive surface are, optionally, used to measure force at various points on the touch-sensitive surface. In some implementations, force measurements from multiple force sensors are combined (e.g., a weighted average) to determine an estimated force of a contact. Similarly, a pressure-sensitive tip of a stylus is, optionally, used to determine a pressure of the stylus on the touch-sensitive surface. Alternatively, the size of the contact area detected on the touch-sensitive surface and/or changes thereto, the capacitance of the touch-sensitive surface proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto, and/or the resistance of the touch-sensitive surface proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto are, optionally, used as a substitute for the force or pressure of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface. In some implementations, the substitute measurements for contact force or pressure are used directly to determine whether an intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is described in units corresponding to the substitute measurements). In some implementations, the substitute measurements for contact force or pressure are converted to an estimated force or pressure, and the estimated force or pressure is used to determine whether an intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is a pressure threshold measured in units of pressure). Using the intensity of a contact as an attribute of a user input allows for user access to additional device functionality that may otherwise not be accessible by the user on a reduced-size device with limited real estate for displaying affordances (e.g., on a touch-sensitive display) and/or receiving user input (e.g., via a touch-sensitive display, a touch-sensitive surface, or a physical/mechanical control such as a knob or a button).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As used in the specification and claims, the term &#x201c;tactile output&#x201d; refers to physical displacement of a device relative to a previous position of the device, physical displacement of a component (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface) of a device relative to another component (e.g., housing) of the device, or displacement of the component relative to a center of mass of the device that will be detected by a user with the user's sense of touch. For example, in situations where the device or the component of the device is in contact with a surface of a user that is sensitive to touch (e.g., a finger, palm, or other part of a user's hand), the tactile output generated by the physical displacement will be interpreted by the user as a tactile sensation corresponding to a perceived change in physical characteristics of the device or the component of the device. For example, movement of a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch-sensitive display or trackpad) is, optionally, interpreted by the user as a &#x201c;down click&#x201d; or &#x201c;up click&#x201d; of a physical actuator button. In some cases, a user will feel a tactile sensation such as an &#x201c;down click&#x201d; or &#x201c;up click&#x201d; even when there is no movement of a physical actuator button associated with the touch-sensitive surface that is physically pressed (e.g., displaced) by the user's movements. As another example, movement of the touch-sensitive surface is, optionally, interpreted or sensed by the user as &#x201c;roughness&#x201d; of the touch-sensitive surface, even when there is no change in smoothness of the touch-sensitive surface. While such interpretations of touch by a user will be subject to the individualized sensory perceptions of the user, there are many sensory perceptions of touch that are common to a large majority of users. Thus, when a tactile output is described as corresponding to a particular sensory perception of a user (e.g., an &#x201c;up click,&#x201d; a &#x201c;down click,&#x201d; &#x201c;roughness&#x201d;), unless otherwise stated, the generated tactile output corresponds to physical displacement of the device or a component thereof that will generate the described sensory perception for a typical (or average) user.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">It should be appreciated that device <b>100</b> is only one example of a portable multifunction device, and that device <b>100</b> optionally has more or fewer components than shown, optionally combines two or more components, or optionally has a different configuration or arrangement of the components.

External port <b>124</b> (e.g., Universal Serial Bus (USB), FIRREWIRE, etc.) is adapted for coupling directly to other devices or indirectly over a network (e.g., the Internet, wireless LAN, etc.). In some embodiments, the external port is a multi-pin (e.g., 30-pin) connector that is the same as, or similar to and/or compatible with, the 30-pin connector used on iPod&#xae; (trademark of Apple Inc.) devices.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Contact/motion module <b>130</b> optionally detects contact with touch screen <b>112</b> (in conjunction with display controller <b>156</b>) and other touch-sensitive devices (e.g., a touchpad or physical click wheel). Contact/motion module <b>130</b> includes various software components for performing various operations related to detection of contact, such as determining if contact has occurred (e.g., detecting a finger-down event), determining an intensity of the contact (e.g., the force or pressure of the contact or a substitute for the force or pressure of the contact), determining if there is movement of the contact and tracking the movement across the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., detecting one or more finger-dragging events), and determining if the contact has ceased (e.g., detecting a finger-up event or a break in contact). Contact/motion module <b>130</b> receives contact data from the touch-sensitive surface. Determining movement of the point of contact, which is represented by a series of contact data, optionally includes determining speed (magnitude), velocity (magnitude and direction), and/or an acceleration (a change in magnitude and/or direction) of the point of contact. These operations are, optionally, applied to single contacts (e.g., one finger contacts) or to multiple simultaneous contacts (e.g., &#x201c;multitouch&#x201d;/multiple finger contacts). In some embodiments, contact/motion module <b>130</b> and display controller <b>156</b> detect contact on a touchpad.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In some embodiments, contact/motion module <b>130</b> uses a set of one or more intensity thresholds to determine whether an operation has been performed by a user (e.g., to determine whether a user has &#x201c;clicked&#x201d; on an icon). In some embodiments, at least a subset of the intensity thresholds are determined in accordance with software parameters (e.g., the intensity thresholds are not determined by the activation thresholds of particular physical actuators and can be adjusted without changing the physical hardware of device <b>100</b>). For example, a mouse &#x201c;click&#x201d; threshold of a trackpad or touch screen display can be set to any of a large range of predefined threshold values without changing the trackpad or touch screen display hardware. Additionally, in some implementations, a user of the device is provided with software settings for adjusting one or more of the set of intensity thresholds (e.g., by adjusting individual intensity thresholds and/or by adjusting a plurality of intensity thresholds at once with a system-level click &#x201c;intensity&#x201d; parameter).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Contact/motion module <b>130</b> optionally detects a gesture input by a user. Different gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns (e.g., different motions, timings, and/or intensities of detected contacts). Thus, a gesture is, optionally, detected by detecting a particular contact pattern. For example, detecting a finger tap gesture includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting a finger-up (liftoff) event at the same position (or substantially the same position) as the finger-down event (e.g., at the position of an icon). As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the touch-sensitive surface includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting one or more finger-dragging events, and subsequently followed by detecting a finger-up (liftoff) event.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Graphics module <b>132</b> includes various known software components for rendering and displaying graphics on touch screen <b>112</b> or other display, including components for changing the visual impact (e.g., brightness, transparency, saturation, contrast, or other visual property) of graphics that are displayed.

Event information includes information about a sub-event (e.g., a user touch on touch-sensitive display <b>112</b>, as part of a multi-touch gesture). Peripherals interface <b>118</b> transmits information it receives from I/O subsystem <b>106</b> or a sensor, such as proximity sensor <b>166</b>, accelerometer(s) <b>168</b>, and/or microphone <b>113</b> (through audio circuitry <b>110</b>).

Views are made up of controls and other elements that a user can see on the display.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0159">Another aspect of the user interface associated with an application is a set of views, sometimes herein called application views or user interface windows, in which information is displayed and touch-based gestures occur. The application views (of a respective application) in which a touch is detected optionally correspond to programmatic levels within a programmatic or view hierarchy of the application. For example, the lowest level view in which a touch is detected is, optionally, called the hit view, and the set of events that are recognized as proper inputs are, optionally, determined based, at least in part, on the hit view of the initial touch that begins a touch-based gesture.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0160">Hit view determination module <b>172</b> receives information related to sub-events of a touch-based gesture. When an application has multiple views organized in a hierarchy, hit view determination module <b>172</b> identifies a hit view as the lowest view in the hierarchy which should handle the sub-event. In most circumstances, the hit view is the lowest level view in which an initiating sub-event occurs (e.g., the first sub-event in the sequence of sub-events that form an event or potential event). Once the hit view is identified by the hit view determination module <b>172</b>, the hit view typically receives all sub-events related to the same touch or input source for which it was identified as the hit view.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0161">Active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b> determines which view or views within a view hierarchy should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In some embodiments, active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b> determines that only the hit view should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b> determines that all views that include the physical location of a sub-event are actively involved views, and therefore determines that all actively involved views should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, even if touch sub-events were entirely confined to the area associated with one particular view, views higher in the hierarchy would still remain as actively involved views.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0162">Event dispatcher module <b>174</b> dispatches the event information to an event recognizer (e.g., event recognizer <b>180</b>). In embodiments including active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b>, event dispatcher module <b>174</b> delivers the event information to an event recognizer determined by active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b>.

Each application view <b>191</b> of the application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b> includes one or more event recognizers <b>180</b>. Typically, a respective application view <b>191</b> includes a plurality of event recognizers <b>180</b>. In other embodiments, one or more of event recognizers <b>180</b> are part of a separate module, such as a user interface kit or a higher level object from which application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b> inherits methods and other properties.

Event recognizer <b>180</b> includes event receiver <b>182</b> and event comparator <b>184</b>. In some embodiments, event recognizer <b>180</b> also includes at least a subset of: metadata <b>183</b>, and event delivery instructions <b>188</b> (which optionally include sub-event delivery instructions).</p><p id="p-0148" num="0166">Event receiver <b>182</b> receives event information from event sorter <b>170</b>. The event information includes information about a sub-event, for example, a touch or a touch movement. Depending on the sub-event, the event information also includes additional information, such as location of the sub-event. When the sub-event concerns motion of a touch, the event information optionally also includes speed and direction of the sub-event. In some embodiments, events include rotation of the device from one orientation to another (e.g., from a portrait orientation to a landscape orientation, or vice versa), and the event information includes corresponding information about the current orientation (also called device attitude) of the device.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0167">Event comparator <b>184</b> compares the event information to predefined event or sub-event definitions and, based on the comparison, determines an event or sub-event, or determines or updates the state of an event or sub-event. In some embodiments, event comparator <b>184</b> includes event definitions <b>186</b>. Event definitions <b>186</b> contain definitions of events (e.g., predefined sequences of sub-events), for example, event <b>1</b> (<b>187</b>-<b>1</b>), event <b>2</b> (<b>187</b>-<b>2</b>), and others. In some embodiments, sub-events in an event (<b>187</b>) include, for example, touch begin, touch end, touch movement, touch cancellation, and multiple touching. In one example, the definition for event <b>1</b> (<b>187</b>-<b>1</b>) is a double tap on a displayed object. The double tap, for example, comprises a first touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a first liftoff (touch end) for a predetermined phase, a second touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, and a second liftoff (touch end) for a predetermined phase. In another example, the definition for event <b>2</b> (<b>187</b>-<b>2</b>) is a dragging on a displayed object. The dragging, for example, comprises a touch (or contact) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a movement of the touch across touch-sensitive display <b>112</b>, and liftoff of the touch (touch end). In some embodiments, the event also includes information for one or more associated event handlers <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0168">In some embodiments, event definition <b>187</b> includes a definition of an event for a respective user-interface object. In some embodiments, event comparator <b>184</b> performs a hit test to determine which user-interface object is associated with a sub-event. For example, in an application view in which three user-interface objects are displayed on touch-sensitive display <b>112</b>, when a touch is detected on touch-sensitive display <b>112</b>, event comparator <b>184</b> performs a hit test to determine which of the three user-interface objects is associated with the touch (sub-event). If each displayed object is associated with a respective event handler <b>190</b>, the event comparator uses the result of the hit test to determine which event handler <b>190</b> should be activated. For example, event comparator <b>184</b> selects an event handler associated with the sub-event and the object triggering the hit test.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0169">In some embodiments, the definition for a respective event (<b>187</b>) also includes delayed actions that delay delivery of the event information until after it has been determined whether the sequence of sub-events does or does not correspond to the event recognizer's event type.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0170">When a respective event recognizer <b>180</b> determines that the series of sub-events do not match any of the events in event definitions <b>186</b>, the respective event recognizer <b>180</b> enters an event impossible, event failed, or event ended state, after which it disregards subsequent sub-events of the touch-based gesture. In this situation, other event recognizers, if any, that remain active for the hit view continue to track and process sub-events of an ongoing touch-based gesture.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0171">In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer <b>180</b> includes metadata <b>183</b> with configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how the event delivery system should perform sub-event delivery to actively involved event recognizers. In some embodiments, metadata <b>183</b> includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how event recognizers interact, or are enabled to interact, with one another. In some embodiments, metadata <b>183</b> includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate whether sub-events are delivered to varying levels in the view or programmatic hierarchy.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0172">In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer <b>180</b> activates event handler <b>190</b> associated with an event when one or more particular sub-events of an event are recognized. In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer <b>180</b> delivers event information associated with the event to event handler <b>190</b>. Activating an event handler <b>190</b> is distinct from sending (and deferred sending) sub-events to a respective hit view. In some embodiments, event recognizer <b>180</b> throws a flag associated with the recognized event, and event handler <b>190</b> associated with the flag catches the flag and performs a predefined process.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0173">In some embodiments, event delivery instructions <b>188</b> include sub-event delivery instructions that deliver event information about a sub-event without activating an event handler. Instead, the sub-event delivery instructions deliver event information to event handlers associated with the series of sub-events or to actively involved views. Event handlers associated with the series of sub-events or with actively involved views receive the event information and perform a predetermined process.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0174">In some embodiments, data updater <b>176</b> creates and updates data used in application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b>.

In some embodiments, object updater <b>177</b> creates and updates objects used in application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b>. For example, object updater <b>177</b> creates a new user-interface object or updates the position of a user-interface object. GUI updater <b>178</b> updates the GUI. For example, GUI updater <b>178</b> prepares display information and sends it to graphics module <b>132</b> for display on a touch-sensitive display.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0175">In some embodiments, event handler(s) <b>190</b> includes or has access to data updater <b>176</b>, object updater <b>177</b>, and GUI updater <b>178</b>.

In some implementations that include a cursor or other location marker, the cursor acts as a &#x201c;focus selector&#x201d; so that when an input (e.g., a press input) is detected on a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touchpad <b>355</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> or touch-sensitive surface <b>451</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>) while the cursor is over a particular user interface element (e.g., a button, window, slider, or other user interface element), the particular user interface element is adjusted in accordance with the detected input. In some implementations that include a touch screen display (e.g., touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> or touch screen <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>) that enables direct interaction with user interface elements on the touch screen display, a detected contact on the touch screen acts as a &#x201c;focus selector&#x201d; so that when an input (e.g., a press input by the contact) is detected on the touch screen display at a location of a particular user interface element (e.g., a button, window, slider, or other user interface element), the particular user interface element is adjusted in accordance with the detected input. In some implementations, focus is moved from one region of a user interface to another region of the user interface without corresponding movement of a cursor or movement of a contact on a touch screen display (e.g., by using a tab key or arrow keys to move focus from one button to another button); in these implementations, the focus selector moves in accordance with movement of focus between different regions of the user interface. Without regard to the specific form taken by the focus selector, the focus selector is generally the user interface element (or contact on a touch screen display) that is controlled by the user so as to communicate the user's intended interaction with the user interface (e.g., by indicating, to the device, the element of the user interface with which the user is intending to interact). For example, the location of a focus selector (e.g., a cursor, a contact, or a selection box) over a respective button while a press input is detected on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touchpad or touch screen) will indicate that the user is intending to activate the respective button (as opposed to other user interface elements shown on a display of the device).</p><p id="p-0178" num="0218">Attention is now directed towards embodiments of user interfaces (&#x201c;UI&#x201d;) and associated processes that are implemented on an electronic device, such as portable multifunction device <b>100</b>, device <b>300</b>, or device <b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0219"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>H</figref> illustrate exemplary user interfaces for displaying and enabling an adjustment of a displayed time zone, in accordance with some embodiments.

In some embodiments, the graphical indication of the time that has elapsed is displayed within the analog clock face in the watch user interface (e.g., <b>800</b>). Displaying the graphical indication of a time that has elapsed from the time when the first user input while the graphical indicator is displayed at the second position relative to the analog clock face enables a user to quickly and easily recognize that the time has been initiated and the time that has elapsed.

In some embodiments, the second user input is an input of a second type (e.g., a touch input on a touch-sensitive surface that is integrated with the display generation component) that is different from the first type.

Shifting (e.g., rotating) the analog dial in accordance with the movement of the graphical indicator such that a scale of the analog dial is aligned to begin at the second position relative to the analog clock face provides visual feedback of the starting position of the time counter in an intuitive manner.

In some embodiments, moving the graphical indicator (e.g., 806) in response to detecting the first user input includes snapping the graphical indicator to the second position relative to the analog clock face (e.g., 804) such that the graphical indicator is aligned with the first clock hand (e.g., <b>802</b>B).</p><p id="p-0270" num="0310">In some embodiments, in response to the first input (e.g., <b>808</b>) (<b>910</b>), in conjunction with moving the graphical indicator (e.g., <b>806</b>) (e.g., a marker (e.g., a triangular marker)) to the second position relative to the analog clock face (e.g., <b>804</b>) (e.g., in response to detecting the first user input; when the graphical indicator is moved from the first position to the second position), the computer system (e.g., <b>600</b>) generates (<b>916</b>) (e.g., via one or more tactile output generators that is in communication with the computer system) a tactile output (e.g., a tactile output sequence that corresponds to moving the graphical indicator to the second position). Generating the tactile output in conjunction with moving the graphical indicator (e.g., a marker (e.g., a triangular marker)) to the second position relative to the analog clock face provides feedback that the time counter has been initiated.

In some embodiments, in response to detecting the input directed to the rotatable input device, the computer system changes (e.g., modifies) the visual characteristic of (e.g., dims; changes the color of (e.g., to be the same color as the graphical indicator and/or as the graphical indication of the time)) the first clock hand (e.g., <b>802</b>B) to include the first visual characteristic (e.g., a dimmed color or visual state; the color of the graphical indicator and/or the graphical indication of the time).</p><p id="p-0280" num="0320">In some embodiments, in response to detecting the first user input (e.g., <b>808</b>), the computer system (e.g., <b>600</b>) changes (e.g., modifies) a shape of (e.g., changes a feature of; changes the size of; makes smaller; shrinks) the first clock hand (e.g., <b>802</b>B) to be a first shape (e.g., a smaller, shrunk clock hand).

Changing the shape of the first clock hand to be the first shape in response to detecting the first user input provides visual feedback that an operation(e.g., the counting) has been enabled, thereby enhancing the operability of the device and making the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to more easily recognize that the operation has been initiated) which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0321">In some embodiments, while the graphical indicator (e.g., <b>806</b>) (e.g., a marker (e.g., a triangular marker)) is displayed at the second position relative to the analog clock face, the computer system (e.g., <b>600</b>) displays (e.g., continues to display), in the analog clock face (e.g., <b>804</b>), a movement of the first clock hand (e.g., <b>802</b>B) to indicate the current time (e.g., the &#x201c;minute&#x201d; of the current time). In some embodiments, while displaying the movement of the first clock hand, the computer system displays, in the analog clock face (e.g., <b>804</b>) (e.g., in a dial region of the analog clock face), visual indicators (e.g., visual markers (e.g., tick marks), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>G-<b>8</b>H</figref>) along a path of movement of (e.g., the tip of) the first clock hand as the first clock hand is moving (e.g., rotating) around the analog clock face (e.g., the visual indicators appear along the path of movement of the first clock hand as the first clock hand is moving circularly within the analog clock face). Displaying the visual indicators along the path of movement of (e.g., the tip of) the first clock hand as the first clock hand is moving (e.g., rotating) around the analog clock face provides visual feedback that the counting is on-going, thereby enhancing the operability of the device and making the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to more easily recognize that the operation has been initiated) which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0322">In some embodiments, while concurrently displaying the movement of the first clock hand (e.g., <b>802</b>B) and the visual indicators, in accordance with a determination that the visual indicators are already displayed along a full path of movement of (e.g., the tip of) the first clock hand (e.g., fully around the analog clock face (e.g., fully around a dial region of the analog clock face)), the computer system (e.g., <b>600</b>) removes display of the visual indicators along the path of movement of (e.g., the tip of) the first clock hand (e.g., <b>802</b>B) as the first clock hand is moving (e.g., rotating) around the analog clock face (e.g., <b>804</b>) (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>I</figref>).</p><p id="p-0283" num="0323">In some embodiments, in response to detecting the first user input (e.g., <b>808</b>), the computer system (e.g., <b>600</b>) moves the graphical indicator (e.g., <b>806</b>) to the second position relative to the analog clock face (e.g., <b>804</b>) such that the graphical indicator is aligned with the first clock hand (e.g., <b>802</b>B) (e.g., such that the graphical indicator is pointing to or marking the position of the first clock hand; such that the graphical indicator is at the outer end of the first clock hand) and displays the graphical indication of the time (e.g., <b>810</b>) (e.g., a time counter; a digital counter) but does not automatically initiate a counting of the time using the graphical indication of the time.

In some embodiments, if the input directed to confirming the initiation of the counting of the time is not detected by the computer system for a predetermined time period (e.g., 5 seconds; 10 seconds; 30 seconds), the computer system moves the graphical indicator back to its previous position (the first position) relative to the analogic clock face.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0324">Note that details of the processes described above with respect to method <b>900</b> (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B</figref>) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the method described above and below.

In some embodiments, the computer system displays or causes display of an animation via the first facial feature (e.g., blinking of the displayed time if the first facial feature represents eyes) based on a change in the time or non-periodically.</p><p id="p-0415" num="0455">In some embodiments, while displaying the representation of the second face (e.g., <b>1206</b>, or <b>1222</b>) having the first facial feature (e.g., <b>1208</b> or <b>1224</b>) and the second facial feature (e.g., <b>1210</b>, <b>1212</b>, <b>1214</b>, <b>1216</b>, <b>1218</b>, <b>1220</b>, <b>1226</b>, <b>1228</b>, <b>1230</b>, <b>1232</b>, <b>1234</b>, or <b>1236</b>) in the time user interface (e.g., <b>1204</b>), the computer system (e.g., <b>600</b>) displays, via the first facial feature of the second face, an animation (e.g., a blinking animation) that includes ceasing display of at least a portion of the first facial feature of the second face for a period of time, and re-displaying the at least a portion of the first facial feature of the second face after the period of time has elapsed. In some embodiments, the animation is a blinking animation of the first facial feature that includes a temporary/brief movement or change in shape/form of the first facial feature such that the first facial feature mimics the movement of a human eye blinking. In some embodiments, the computer system periodically, based on time, (e.g., every 1 minute; every 5 minutes; every 30 minutes; every hour) displays the animation (e.g., blinking animation). Providing a blinking animation via the first facial feature (e.g., periodically, based on time) provides visual feedback about the change in time in an intuitive manner. Providing improved visual feedback enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to provide proper inputs and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device) which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0416" num="0456">In some embodiments, the first facial feature (e.g., <b>1208</b>, <b>1224</b>) is an indication of a current time and the animation is a blinking animation where the current time is animated to look like blinking eyes (e.g., the hour and minute indicators are compressed vertically and then expand vertically).</p><p id="p-0417" num="0457">In some embodiments, displaying, via the first facial feature (e.g., <b>1208</b>, <b>1224</b>) of the second face (e.g., <b>1206</b>, <b>1222</b>), the animation (e.g., blinking) includes non-periodically (e.g., not in regular intervals; at random times; not based on a period change in time) displaying, via the first facial feature of the second face, the animation.</p><p id="p-0418" num="0458">In some embodiments, the second face (e.g., <b>1206</b> or <b>1222</b>) (e.g., the main face portion of the second face) includes a primary color scheme (e.g., a predominant color; a most-prevalent color). In some embodiments, the second visual characteristic for the second facial feature (e.g., <b>1210</b>, <b>1212</b>, <b>1214</b>, <b>1216</b>, <b>1218</b>, <b>1220</b>, <b>1226</b>, <b>1228</b>, <b>1230</b>, <b>1232</b>, <b>1234</b>, or <b>1236</b>) (e.g., the neck; the neck and shoulder) of the second face is a second color that is based on (e.g., is the same as; is a similar tone as; is within a range of color variants of) the primary color scheme (e.g., the neck is a slightly lighter shade of the color of the face or the neck is a slightly darker shade of the color of the face) (<b>1332</b>). In some embodiments, the color of the second facial feature has a predetermined relationship to the color of the first facial feature for a plurality of different faces (e.g., the neck is a predetermined amount lighter than the face for a plurality of faces or the neck is a predetermined amount darker than the face for a plurality of faces).</p><p id="p-0419" num="0459">In some embodiments, the second facial feature (e.g., <b>1210</b>, <b>1212</b>, <b>1214</b>, <b>1216</b>, <b>1218</b>, <b>1220</b>, <b>1226</b>, <b>1228</b>, <b>1230</b>, <b>1232</b>, <b>1234</b>, or <b>1236</b>) of the second face (e.g., <b>1206</b> or <b>1222</b>) is selected from the group consisting of: hair, facial outline (e.g., including cheeks and/or jawline), nose, eyes, mouth (e.g., lips) neck, and shoulders (<b>1334</b>).</p><p id="p-0420" num="0460">In some embodiments, the second visual characteristic for the second facial feature (e.g., <b>1210</b>, <b>1212</b>, <b>1214</b>, <b>1216</b>, <b>1218</b>, <b>1220</b>, <b>1226</b>, <b>1228</b>, <b>1230</b>, <b>1232</b>, <b>1234</b>, or <b>1236</b>) of the first face (e.g., <b>1206</b> or <b>1222</b>) is a third color, and the second visual characteristic for the second facial feature (e.g., <b>1210</b>, <b>1212</b>, <b>1214</b>, <b>1216</b>, <b>1218</b>, <b>1220</b>, <b>1226</b>, <b>1228</b>, <b>1230</b>, <b>1232</b>, <b>1234</b>, or <b>1236</b>) of the second face (e.g., <b>1206</b> or <b>1222</b>) is a fourth color different from the third color, wherein the fourth color is programmatically selected (e.g., determined), without user input, from a plurality of available colors by the computer system (e.g., <b>600</b>) (<b>1336</b>). In some embodiments, the application process selects (e.g., programmatically determines) the fourth color based on a color of the computer system (e.g., a color of a housing or case of the computer system). In some embodiments, the application process selects (e.g., programmatically determines) the fourth color based on usage history of a user of the computer system (e.g., based on a previous user-selected color or color scheme). Programmatically selecting, without user input, colors for facial features of a displayed face provides a diverse range of characteristics that are displayed via the time user interface without requiring user input to enable the diverse range of characteristics. Reducing the number of inputs needed to perform an operation enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to provide proper inputs and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device) which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0421" num="0461">Note that details of the processes described above with respect to method <b>1300</b> (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref>) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the methods described above and below.
