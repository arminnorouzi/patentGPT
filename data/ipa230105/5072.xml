After a loss event (e.g., an event during which some amount of personal property was lost, such as fire, flooding, or theft), a policyholder typically files an insurance claim seeking reimbursement for lost property, and the insurance company may issue a payout to the policyholder based at least in part upon incurred damages.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Historically, the insurance claim process is slow, laborious, and difficult to verify. In many cases, the policyholder may not have taken a thorough inventory of personal possessions prior to the loss event, thereby creating difficulties for the policyholder in specifying all of the items that may have been damaged during the loss event. Additionally, the insurance provider may be needed to verify the items and the claimed values in order to mitigate potentially inaccurate or fraudulent insurance claims. The process is labor-intensive and potentially expensive for both parties.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, a system that simplifies and streamlines the insurance claim process is desired.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present embodiment may relate to systems and methods for determining personalized loss valuations for a loss event and generating a loss event policy for a user.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, a computer system for determining personalized loss event valuations is provided.

In particular, the systems and methods described herein include a loss valuation (&#x201c;LV&#x201d;) computer system configured to utilize user data and personal property information to estimate loss valuations (e.g., monetary damages or costs) associated with various loss events for a particular user and generate a loss event policy based at least in part upon the loss valuations.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one example embodiment, the LV computer system is used in an insurance-related process for generating flat-rate payouts for policyholders. In some insurance systems, payouts to policyholders after loss events may be based at least in part upon inventory and/or property lost by the user, wherein the lost inventory is determined based at least in part upon comparing a post-event inventory to a pre-event inventory. In some cases, the pre-event inventory is determined before the event, while in other cases, the pre-event inventory is determined retroactively. In the present embodiment, however, rather than generating payouts based at least in part upon inventory comparisons, the LV computer system may generate flat-rate payouts for loss events based at least in part upon user data and event information. For example, the LV computer system may be configured to generate a loss event policy detailing flat-rate payouts for different loss events. The loss event policy may include a list of loss events with associated flat-rate payouts, such as &#x201c;Fire&#x2014;$6,000&#x201d;, &#x201c;Flood&#x2014;$2,000&#x201d;, &#x201c;Theft&#x2014;$1,000&#x201d;, etc. In some embodiments, the insurance payout process is utilized for a renter's insurance policy. In alternative embodiments, the insurance payout process is utilized for any type of insurance policy or for non-insurance related processes.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the exemplary embodiment, The LV computer system includes a loss valuation (&#x201c;LV&#x201d;) computing device configured to receive user data (including personal and property information), analyze the data (e.g., using a trained machine learning model), and generate loss valuations for a plurality of potential loss events based at least in part upon the analysis. The LV computing device is further configured to generate a loss event policy based at least in part upon the loss valuations and generate revised loss valuations in light of additional received data.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the exemplary embodiment, the LV computer system includes the LV computing device in communication with a user computer device, a third party computer device, an insurance provider computer device, and a loss valuation (&#x201c;LV&#x201d;) database. The LV computing device is configured to receive user data from the user computer device and a valuation model from the LV database and generate loss valuations for a plurality of loss events based at least in part upon the user data. The LV computing device is further configured to generate a loss event policy based at least in part upon the loss valuations and transmit the loss event policy to at least one of the insurance provider device and the user computer device.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The LV computing device is further configured to receive event data and inventory data from the user computer device, along with third party event data from the third party computer device. The LV computing device is configured to analyze the event data and generate a specific event valuation based at least in part upon the specific event. The LV computing device is further configured to analyze the inventory data and third party event data and generate a revised valuation in light of the additional data. The LV computing device is configured to transmit the specific event valuation and the revised valuation to at least one of the insurance provider device and user computer device.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, &#x201c;loss valuation&#x201d; or &#x201c;loss event valuation&#x201d; may refer to monetary losses or costs associated with repairing, replacing, or otherwise handling damages to personal property or real-estate due to a loss event. &#x201c;Flat-rate payouts&#x201d; or &#x201c;payouts&#x201d; refer to monetary compensation provided to a user or an insurance policyholder after a loss event. In alternative embodiments, payouts are the same as loss valuations and/or based at least in part upon loss valuations. For example, the LV computing device may determine a loss event valuation and an insurance device may issue a payout equal to the loss event valuation. In another example, the LV computing device may determine a loss event valuation and an insurance device (or the LV computing device) may issue a payout based at least in part upon applying a formula to the loss event valuation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein, determining a single value or number may also, in alternative embodiments, include determining a range of values and/or a confidence level associated with the range of values.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Examples of Generating Loss Event Policies</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the exemplary embodiment, the LV computer system is configured to generate loss event policies based at least in part upon user data. Specifically, the LV computing device is configured to analyze user data and event-related data in order to determine loss valuations associated with various potential events. The LV computing device is further configured to generate a loss event policy based at least in part upon the loss valuations associated with specific loss events. For example, the LV computer system may receive user data including a value of a user's home, demographic information about the user, and security systems associated with the user's home. The LV computer system may generate estimated loss valuations for a number of potential loss events, such as theft, fire, flood, and earthquake, among others. In other words, based at least in part upon the user's specific information (e.g., value of home, user demographics, user behaviors, risk-mitigating systems in the user's home, etc.), the LV computer system generates personalized loss valuations for various loss events. For example, for a particular user's loss event policy, a fire loss event may be assigned a valuation of $6,000 and a break-in loss event may be assigned a valuation of $2,000.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the exemplary embodiment, loss events may be any event that causes damage to a user's personal property or real-estate, or any event that causes some other kind of monetary or opportunity cost for a user. For example, loss events may include, but are not limited to, natural disasters (e.g., forest fire, flooding, earthquake, tornado, hurricane, blizzard, hail, sink holes, other weather events, etc.), systems failures (e.g., power surge, power outage, plumbing failure and house flooding, electrical fires, etc.), or human-caused damages (e.g., theft, vandalism, break-ins, arson, negligence, etc.).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the exemplary embodiment, user data may include demographic information, personal information, digital information, housing information, real-estate information, personal property information, location information, pet-related information, medical information, or any other type of data/information that is related to a user and/or aspects of a user's real-estate and personal property.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the exemplary embodiment, the LV computing device is configured to utilize a trained machine learning (&#x201c;ML&#x201d;) model to analyze user data and generate loss valuations and a loss event policy for a user. Specifically, the LV computing device is configured to receive user data from a user computer device and a trained ML model from a database. The LV computing device is configured to analyze the user data using the ML model and identify patterns, make predictions, determine potential outcomes, and determine various loss valuations for loss events based at least in part upon the user data.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the LV computing device utilizes a ML model trained using supervised learning, such that the LV computing device is able to predict an output based at least in part upon specific types of inputs on which the ML model was trained. For example, the LV computing device may receive images of fire damage, analyze the images using image recognition techniques, and estimate total damage caused by the fire based at least in part upon the image analysis.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another embodiment, the LV computing device utilizes a ML model trained using unsupervised learning, such that the LV computing device is able to identify patterns in unorganized data and predict outputs based at least in part upon various types of input data. For example, the LV computing device may receive demographic information including the location of a user's home, the age of the user, and the occupation of the user, and the LV computing device may determine a likely value of the user's home and a like value of the possessions owned by the user. Further, the LV computing device may determine the likely loss value caused by a break-in based at least in part upon the values of the user's home and the user's possessions.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the exemplary embodiment, the LV computing device is configured to generate loss valuations for a number of loss events and compile the loss valuations to generate a loss event policy for the user. The loss event policy may include any number of loss events with associated loss valuations (e.g., payouts or flat-rate payments). In one embodiment, the LV computing device is configured to compile various loss valuations for a particular user into a single loss event policy. The LV computing device is configured to transmit the loss event policy or individual loss valuations to the user computer device or the insurance provider.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In alternative embodiments, the LV computing device <b>102</b> is configured to utilize additional data, such as event data, inventory data, and third party event data in generating loss valuations and loss event policies. Event data, inventory data, and third party event data are described in more detail below.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Examples of Generating Event-Specific Loss Valuations and Revised Valuations</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the exemplary embodiment, the LV computing device is configured to receive event data, inventory data, and third party event data and generate an event-specific loss valuation and/or a revised evaluation. In one embodiment, the LV computing device is configured to receive event data from the user computer device, where event data are any data describing, detailing, or reporting a loss event. For example, event data may include, but is not limited to, text, video, image, message, or form data received from the user computer device. In one embodiment, a user logs into an application or web-site that connects his/her user computer device to the LV computer system. The LV computing device may present the user with a number of options such as text forms, multiple choice selections, or other input options with which the user can describe and/or report a loss event.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the exemplary embodiment, based at least in part upon the event data, the LV computing device is configured to determine a specific event valuation. In one embodiment, the LV computing device compares the reported event to the events detailed in the loss event policy and determines the specific event valuation based at least in part upon the loss event in the loss event policy that matches the event data. In another embodiment, the LV computing device analyzes the event data and determines which event in the loss event policy most closely resembles the described event. In another embodiment, the LV computing device analyzes the event data and determines an appropriate specific event valuation that doesn't match any particular loss event valuation described in the loss event policy. For example, the LV computing device may determine that an event in the loss policy matches the event data exactly. In another example, the LV computing device may determine that the event data indicates a loss event somewhere in between events described in the loss event policy and generate a specific event valuation based at least in part upon averaging certain valuations in the loss event policy.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the exemplary embodiment, the LV computing device is further configured to receive inventory data and third party event data and determine a revised valuation based at least in part upon the received data. In the exemplary embodiment, the LV computing device is configured to receive inventory data detailing a user's inventory taken after a loss event. Based at least in part upon recovered inventory, the LV computing device is configured to determine if a revised valuation needs to be generated and, if so, revises the specific event valuation to be either lower or higher than the original value. For example, a user may report a fire loss event, and the LV computing device may determine a specific event valuation of $15,000, or the full predicted value of the user's possessions. The LV computing device may further receive inventory data indicating that the user was able to recover a television, a video game system, and a grand piano, which combined are valued at $3,000. The LV computing device may then determine a revised valuation of $12,000 (the specific event valuation less the value of recovered items). As another example, a user may report a flood loss event, and the LV computing device may determine a specific event valuation of $1,000. However, the user may have had an unusual amount of electronics that were damaged in the flood, and, based at least in part upon received inventory data, the LV computing device may determine that likely damages to good are higher than $1,000 and generate a revised valuation of $2,000.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the exemplary embodiment, the LV computing device is configured to receive third party event data and utilize the third party event data to revise specific event valuations. Third party event data may include any data about a loss event received from a third party computer device or third party computer system, and may include data such as police report, emergency services reports, maintenance reports, security system reports, smoke detector reports, power meter reports, or any other reports, data, or information related to a loss event. The LV computing device is configured to analyze the received third party event data and determine if the specific event valuation needs to be revised, and, if so, generate a revised valuation. For example, a user may report a break-in, and the LV computing device may determine a specific event valuation of $2,000 based at least in part upon the user's loss event policy. However, the LV computing device may further receive a police report indicating that no items were stolen during the break-in, and the LV computing device may generate a revised valuation of $500 to cover a broken window.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the exemplary embodiment, the LV computing device is further configured to generate a payout based at least in part upon a specific event valuation or a revised valuation.

For example, a fire in a multi-story mansion may cause significantly more monetary damage than a fire in a one-story ranch-style house. LV computing device <b>102</b> may take into account the size and layout of a house when predicting loss event damages. As another example, basement flooding may cause significantly more monetary damage in a house with a finished basement than in a house with an unfinished basement.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the exemplary embodiment, LV computing device <b>102</b> utilizes valuation model <b>204</b> to generate loss event valuations for a number of different loss events based at least in part upon user data <b>202</b>, and compiles the loss event valuations to generate loss event policy <b>206</b>. In other words, LV computing device <b>102</b> generates a loss event policy <b>206</b> that indicates a number of loss events with associated predicted loss valuations. Loss events may include, but are not limited to, any natural disaster (e.g., fire, flooding, tornado, hurricane, earthquake, tsunami, hail, blizzard, etc.), system failures (e.g., electrical fire, power outage, power surge, plumbing leakage or malfunction, heating or air conditioning malfunction, etc.), or human-caused loss (e.g., negligence, arson, vandalism, theft, etc.). For example, LV computing device <b>102</b> may determine that for a specific user's property, a fire loss event is worth $10,000, a flooding loss event is worth $8,000, and a theft loss event is worth $2,000.

In other embodiments, LV computing device <b>102</b> generates loss valuations and loss event policy <b>206</b> without the intermediary step of generating separate user-related outputs based at least in part upon user data <b>202</b>. For example, rather than determine a list of items a user is likely to own and a predicted value for the items, LV computing device <b>102</b> may utilize a model that analyzes user data and generates a loss valuation for a fire that intrinsically takes into account the likely value of a user's possessions, without separately determining and outputting the value of the user's possessions.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, the specific loss events for which LV computing device <b>102</b> determines loss valuations are determined by valuation model <b>204</b>.

In other words, user computer device <b>104</b> may capture user input selecting a specific loss event, and the user selected loss event is transmitted to LV computing device <b>102</b> as event data <b>208</b>. For example, a user may log in to an application, select that a loss event has occurred, and select that the loss event was a fire. In another embodiment, event data <b>208</b> includes qualitative or quantitative descriptions of a loss event, and may include, but is not limited to, user audio description, user text description, user selection from a variety of loss event categories, sub-types, and levels, user photos or videos, or any other medium through which a user may describe a loss event.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Based at least in part upon event data <b>208</b>, LV computing device <b>102</b> is configured to analyze event data <b>208</b> and generate specific event valuation <b>214</b>.

For example, event data <b>208</b> may indicate that the loss event is a fire and may further include images of the fire. LV computing device <b>102</b> may analyze the images of the fire and determine the fire has a damage level of &#x201c;high&#x201d;.

In other words, after determining a loss event valuation, LV computing device <b>102</b> may receive additional data that necessitates an alteration of the loss event valuation. Specifically, LV computing device <b>102</b> is configured to receive at least one of inventory data <b>210</b> and/or third party event data <b>212</b>, analyze the data in relation to event data <b>208</b> and specific event valuation <b>214</b>, and determine that specific event valuation <b>214</b> should be revised in light of the new data.

In one embodiment, LV computing device <b>102</b> generates a new specific event valuation based at least in part upon the additional data inputs, compares the new specific event valuation to specific event valuation <b>214</b>, and determines a revised valuation needs to be generated based at least in part upon the comparison (e.g., if the new specific event valuation and specific event valuation <b>214</b> differ at all or by a predetermined amount/threshold). In another embodiment, LV computing device <b>102</b> determines a qualitative or quantitative impact that the additional data inputs might have on specific event valuation <b>214</b> and determines that a revised valuation should be calculated based at least in part upon the potential impact of the additional data inputs. For example, if LV computing device <b>102</b> generates a specific event valuation for a &#x201c;small fire&#x201d; and receives third party event data indicating that the fire was large, the LV computing device <b>102</b> may determine that the third party event data would have a large impact if incorporated into the loss valuation.
