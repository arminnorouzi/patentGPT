However, many of these therapies have failed to achieve desired outcomes, partly due to low cell viability and failure to attach to a site of injury.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While cell therapy is touted as one of the major advances that will occur in regenerative medicine in the future, there is a strong need for materials that are able to preserve and control the release and engraftment of stem cells in vivo. Without structural support, transplanted cells lack matrix protection and may undergo apoptosis. Of the cells that survive, most lack a matrix to be spatially retained and organized and typically leave the lesion for the surrounding viable host tissue.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In many cases, transplanting cells also indicate that a protecting gel matrix might be beneficial to match mechanical properties, maintain integrity and viability of cells during transplantation, and biodegrade within an acceptable time frame without triggering an inflammatory response from the host. In this respect, biomaterials have been shown to play a major role in maintaining cell phenotype, proliferation and viability ex-vivo, protecting cells from the most adverse stresses present in-vivo (e.g. shear, oxidative, chemical or mechanical stress).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Certain aspects of the present disclosure are directed to methods of treating or preventing an ocular disorder in a subject in need thereof, the method including: administering a therapeutically effective amount of a composition into an eye of the subject; wherein the composition includes gelatin hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (gelatin-HPA), hyaluronic acid-tyramine (HA-Tyr), and an ocular cell, and wherein the composition attaches to an inner portion eye after administration into the eye.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the ocular disorder includes congenital retinal disease, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, optic neuropathy, retinal neuron damage, or any combination thereof.

A short-term viability study, corresponding to the encapsulation of retinal stem cells in different example hydrogels, was performed for 3 days. The results suggested that only networks incorporating Gelatin Hydroxyphenyl propionic acid (Gtn-HPA) and Hyaluronic acid tyramine (HA-Tyr) have a sufficient biocompatibility (hence cell viability) to be considered as candidate for enhancing retinal regeneration (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E</figref>). These might have been anticipated because the vitreous is the only part of the body that contains both of these biopolymers. However, their particular structure is not the same as that of the hybrid gels.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0136">For the IPN hydrogel system, both networks were in-situ enzymatically crosslinked with Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(see details in Example 1; section titled &#x201c;Hydrogel Preparation&#x201d;). The results showed that the crosslinking is very specific, having observable selectivity and thus, yielding a hybrid interpenetrating network (IPN) and not a random heteropolymer network. Networks with different contents (ranging from pure Gtn-HPA to pure HA-Tyr) were prepared and enzymatically degraded while their mass loss was checked throughout time. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, applying either collagenase or hyaluronidase treatment degraded the exact proportion of respectively Gtn-HPA or HA-Tyr that was included in the preparation of networks: e.g. IPN75 (containing 75% of Gtn-HPA and 25% of HA-Tyr) possessed a mass loss of 75% when mixed with collagenase and a mass loss of 25% when mixed with hyaluronidase. Complete degradation was observed on homopolymeric networks mixed with their respective enzymes. A difference in degradation time was seen, where HA-Tyr possesses a degradation time constant that doubles the one for Gtn-HPA with a delay of 30-40 min. This, along with the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref>), confirms the formation of a hybrid IPN.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0137">To assess whether mechanical tunability of these IPN can be controlled by their content (amount of Gtn-HPA) oscillatory rheology and unconfined compression testing were performed.

This tendency can be explained by the measurement of G&#x2032; for both homo-polymeric networks (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-C</figref>), which shows that HA-Tyr possesses a shear modulus 2-5 times larger than Gtn-HPA (depending on the amount of crosslink added).

To measure the gel points of the samples, micro-rheology was used due to the extremely fast gelation of these IPN which prevented the possibility to measure it during common oscillatory rheology. As explained in Example 1; section titled &#x201c;Passive micro-rheology measurements and PLGA microbeads tracking,&#x201d; PLGA microbeads were mixed with the networks and their mean square displacement (MSD), due to Brownian motion, was measured over time. All studied samples (Gtn-HPA, IPN75 and IPN50) presented double exponential decay of microbeads MSD (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>); however, different characteristic times were observed. The higher the HA-Tyr content in the IPN and the longer the microbeads moves corresponded to a longer gel point time. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>C</figref> show the time evolution of loss and storage modulus, calculated from microbeads' MSD, which corresponded to the MSD being null. Gel point ranged from 42 seconds (s) for Gtn-HPA to 2 minutes 47 seconds for IPN50, which conveyed the fact that gelation time is tunable by controlling the Gtn-HPA content of IPN.

For this purpose, human retinal ganglion cells (see Example 2; section titled &#x201c;Source and viability of hRGC&#x201d;) were encapsulated in multiple IPN with different content and crosslinker concentrations. Results obtained from a short-term viability study, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, yielded the optimal crosslinker (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) concentration which would lead to the highest cell viability both in IPN and homo-polymeric hydrogels: 1 mM of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows the impact of Gtn-HPA content in IPN on encapsulated cell viability. A viability threshold, corresponding to a content of &#x3e;30% of Gtn-HPA, was observed for all crosslinker concentrations proving that cells do not thrive in HA-Tyr. This finding can be related to the understanding that hRGCs possess integrins to attach to the gelatin backbone but not to the hyaluronic acid backbone. This result reduced the number of hydrogel candidates to IPN possessing a Gtn-HPA content higher than 50% (which include Gtn-HPA itself). Of note is that cell viability in all IPN was significantly higher than when cells were left in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) for 3 days.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0151">To compare the efficacy of different IPN, the rest of in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed with IPN50, IPN75, and Gtn-HPA, which satisfied the actual requirement and had different mechanical and chemical properties. A long-term in vitro viability assay was performed (1, 3, and 7 days) by leaving cells in PBS or adding defined media in hydrogels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). hRGCs receiving media, encapsulated or not, were significantly more viable than those receiving PBS even after 7 days. This suggested a favorable diffusion of nutrients inside IPN. However, when cells receive no nutrients viability decreased significantly with time, reaching &#x3c;7% for the PBS sample after 7 days. IPN reduced this drop of viability by protecting the cells from the lack of nutrients for all time points, by being significantly higher for all IPN compared to PBS. After 1 week of media deprivation, 35-45% of hRGCs were still viable. This result was unexpected due to the relative fragility of hRGC, and further suggested that these IPNs are excellent candidates for enhancing the ability of encapsulated cells to regenerate the retina.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0152">To determine the distribution of cells throughout hydrogels, the intensity of live (CalceinAM-FITC) and dead (Ethidium Bromide-APC) cells was averaged, normalized, and measured in function of all directions (x,y,z). Directions were averaged into 150 &#x3bc;m and compared to a sample of cells in media on a flat slide (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). The flat microscope slide showed a peak in intensity around its zero positions with a quickly decaying intensity when distancing from the slide, while all hydrogel samples showed a constant intensity in all directions. This suggested a uniform distribution of both live and dead cells inside and/or within IPN, which is critical for the release of cells at the injection site. Due to the enzymatic and surface degradation of the in-situ crosslinking hydrogels, a uniform distribution of encapsulated cells signified a constant release concentration of cells on the retina.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0153">The size, compactness, and distribution of hRGC (after live and dead staining) was visualized via confocal microscopy throughout 300 &#x3bc;m sections of gels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>).

No difference was noted between time points; however, cell size was measured to be significantly larger for cells encapsulated in gel compared to media and PBS while their compactness was smaller (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>B</figref>). This finding suggested that hydrogels may enable cell differentiation and processes formation, which could not be seen in media samples.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0154">Cell phenotype was checked by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry after 7 days of culture in 2D (media) or 3D (gels with media) environment.

Interfaces were analyzed as follow: where hydrogel was visible (attached or not to the retina), the interface was split into 200 &#x3bc;m parts (usually 2-3 per image); the interface of each part was then characterized by looking at the region of attachment (red regions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>) and the others (white regions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>). Afterwards, the percentage of attachment for each interface (proportion of red regions compared to white regions), and the distribution of the gel at the interface (holes in the red regions) were calculated using a MATLAB algorithm.

This algorithm was based on Otsu's method of thresholding and enables a specific quantification of the gel degradation in vivo. After taking the OCT images of the section of the retina, 10 fields of views were analyzed for each group. In order to apply and use Otsu's method, the retina and the noise were processed to be considered as the background while the gels were processed to be considered as the foreground. Most of the noise was deleted by the plugin in the SD-OCT software, hence the rest of the image was just composed of a bright retina (curved with different layers) and islands of gel on top of it). In order to process the retina as background, different values of the presence of the retina with no injections were calculated: this consists in counting the number of foreground pixels found with Otsu's algorithm in OCT images without injection. These values were used as a normalization in order to find the surplus of foreground pixels where gel was present. This quantification was performed for all groups at all time points and an in vivo degradation curve (which was confirmed with in vitro degradation) was calculated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0029" level="2">Image Processing Algorithms for Detection of Cell Migration, Co-Localization and Orientation Compare to Retinal Layers</heading><p id="p-0168" num="0162">The improvement in engraftment of hRGCs by the IPN hydrogels was quantified by measuring cell migration (e.g., location in retinal layers after 1 month), co-localization (e.g., expressing both Brn3b intrinsically and STEM121 human markers), and, for large cells, orientation (e.g., angle formed by extended processes and retina). After using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope to image the test groups (60 fields of view per group), as explained earlier, colored images (VioBlue for DAPI, FITC for STEM121 and PE for TdTomato) were analyzed.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0163">To segment cells from images, a two-step algorithm was designed. First, pixel intensities of input images were normalized from 0 to 1. Due to the large amount of noise in the image, the segmentation pipeline was started with a small amount of gaussian blur to smooth the image. Part of the cells were very dim; therefore, to segment them, a first low threshold (around 10% of intensity) was used to segment cells. To remediate cells which displayed small holes, a closing morphological operation (consisting of a dilation followed by an erosion) was incorporated. An opening (an erosion followed by a dilation) was run to remove small clusters of pixels that were most likely noise. For large cells, the low threshold followed by morphological operation led to a high recall for cell pixels. The brightest part of cells was segmented using a second larger threshold (about 0.3). To merge those two segmentations, a fusion algorithm was designed. Using the rough segmentation obtained from the first threshold, a connected component algorithm was employed to label each independent group of segmented pixels. A group was defined as independent if it was not in contact with another group of segmented pixels. Then, each labeled group of segmented pixels, which did not contain pixels from the high threshold segmentation, was eliminated. The final result had a high precision (due to the high threshold) and a high recall (due to the low threshold). Labeled groups of segmented pixels were used to compute the area of segmented cells.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0164">All images were manually annotated using an online annotation tool (Makesense.ai).

Following this, images were filtered, selected based on a threshold, and analyzed with the co-localization, Pearson's, and Mader's algorithms. Co-localization consists in finding the fraction of pixels which possess a high intensity in both colors (green and red, in this study) with linear approximation.

To investigate whether the IPN hydrogels of the disclosure can answer this question IPN50, IPN75 and Gtn-HPA hydrogels (with no cells) were injected into the vitreous of Long Evans rats. The daily morphology of their vitreous and retina was checked daily with SD-OCT, and, after 3 days, these retinal samples were histologically stained with H&#x26;E and imaged (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). Histology images show the presence of islands of hydrogels in the vitreous and attachment of the hydrogels to the inner limiting membrane (ILM) of the retina. By encapsulating cells into these biomaterials, a controlled and constant release of cells was performed right onto the first layer of the retina. H&#x26;E staining suggested qualitatively that the stiffer the IPN gel (e.g., IPN50) the greater attachment of the hydrogel to the retina is achieved. That is, the study results qualitatively indicated that stiffer IPN hydrogels degraded more slowly and had less &#x201c;holes&#x201d; (i.e., degraded portions of the hydrogel) at the retinal interface.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0168">To quantify this finding, the interfaces between IPN hydrogels and the retina were analyzed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>). The results showed an average percent of attachment increasing with stiffness; 50% attachment of Gtn-HPA hydrogels to the retinal surface, 59% attachment of IPN75 hydrogels to the retinal surface, and 79% attachment of IPN50 hydrogels to the retinal surface. The actual distribution of attachment was measured for n=10 and normalized per 200 &#x3bc;m portions, which gives a sense of &#x201c;holes&#x201d; present at the interface and therefore, the aptitude of each IPN hydrogel to attach to the ILM. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, IPN50 hydrogel possessed the highest attachment with the lowest number of &#x201c;holes&#x201d; (shown as dark bands), while the distribution of Gtn-HPA hydrogel was uneven with numerous &#x201c;holes&#x201d; throughout the interface.

As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, all IPN hydrogels degrade within 6-10 days. Results showed the longest degradation time, after 9-10 days, corresponded to IPN50 hydrogels. In vitro degradation showed a comparable result (see inset of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, which showed an average R<sup>2 </sup>value of 0.97). These results confirmed the presence of enzymes at corresponding concentrations used (Example 1; section titled &#x201c;In vitro degradation assays for IPNs&#x201d;). A curious trend is shown for IPN75 hydrogels, which degraded faster than Gtn-HPA hydrogels despite being stiffer. This phenomenon can be explained by the presence of both hyaluronidase and collagenase in the vitreous. Indeed, IPN75 hydrogels, which include 75% of Gtn-HPA and 25% of HA-Tyr can be simultaneously affected by both enzymes. On the other hand, homo-polymeric Gtn-HPA hydrogels are degraded by collagenase only (as was previously shown in the in vitro degradation study). Of note, the SD-OCT images and analysis of the retina before injection and after total degradation of IPN hydrogels (7 days for Gtn-HPA, 6 days for IPN75, and 9 days for IPN50) showed no detachment nor injury to the retina.

Oxidative stress was already really high at 2.5 mM with a viability ranging from 20% to 35% while being maximal at 5 mM where most cells died (only 5-8% viable). This broad testing of hydrogen peroxide effect on cell viability in both homo-polymeric networks suggested that a concentration around 1 mM should be used in order to make the most biocompatible hydrogel. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, a sharper testing for different IPNs content with crosslinker concentration ranging from 0.8 to 1.3 mM was performed. The optimal IPN was found to contain at least 30% of Gtn-HPA with a crosslinker concentration of 1 mM. The catalyst (HRP) concentration was optimized at 0.1 U/mL to enable encapsulated cells to thrive.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0186">Live and dead staining of cells encapsulated in IPNs and grown in PBS are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>. Images represent a maximal projection of 200 um z-stack for hydrogels samples which were seeded at the same concentration. Cells in 2D culture appeared more fibroblastic with a higher number of dead cells. In contrast, cells encapsulated in Gtn-HPA and IPNS looked to retain their phenotypic morphology. These results clearly demonstrated the effect of oxidative stress and protective nature of Gtn-HPA and IPNs for hRGC culture and possible transplantation.</p><heading id="h-0038" level="1">Example 10&#x2014;Analysis of Cell Size and Shape with Image Processing Algorithm</heading><p id="p-0193" num="0187">Counting and analyzing cell size and shape manually is a tedious error prone process. To be able to analyze a large data set from fluorescent confocal microscopy images a basic computer vision technique was used. This image processing algorithm enabled for cell segmentation from a black background image based on cell intensity and staining. The method used basic morphological operations and the watershed algorithm to segment the cells and was implemented in MATLAB. This method was chosen for its simplicity and ease of implementation.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0188">For each sample group, n=10 fluorescent maximum projection of fields of view obtained from live and dead staining images of cells encapsulated or grown in 2D conditions were analyzed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>). Each image was then converted to a greyscale (from the specific staining analyzed live: green and red: dead). To be able to analyze cells correctly, multiple image rendering processes were used. The extraction of dimmer cells was performed by contrast adjustments. The elimination of objects on the borders (which can cause noise and be artifacts) was realized with an intrinsic MATLAB function. Noise removal, critical to extract only cells and not artifacts, was done with adaptive filtering (small window). The final image rendering included using a global Otsu's thresholding method to convert the image to binary, filling the image region and holes, performing a morphological opening using a disc kernel and finally removing all small cells (connected components with low number of pixels &#x3c;10 px). The final image can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>. To further analyze cells, perimeters extraction of cell or cell groups were performed, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>. Some cells might be grouped and counting their number may be critical for viability results. To extract cells in groups a watershed algorithm was applied, which can divide the groups into distinct cells. The watershed algorithm interprets different levels of gray intensity, in an image, as altitude. It then finds objects which are delimited by their perimeter with a high altitude in their center (high overlapping intensity). To implement the watershed algorithm, the image was modified by finding the maxima (corresponding to the cell nuclei) and transformed the image to show the perimeter and these maxima (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>D</figref>). The watershed algorithm was finally applied, which finds all connected components and enables for an easy cell counting (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>E</figref>). In the sample image, 33 cells were extracted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>F</figref>). Cell size was also extracted and measured with the longest line drawn inside each object (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>G</figref>). Cell compactness (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>H</figref>) was extracted, which corresponds to the relative shape of one cell compared to a circle: C=(4*&#x3c0;*A)/(P<sup>2</sup>) (C=1 being a perfect circle). Due to small cell size, while most cells were correctly detected, some were taken as dust and deleted. Segmenting grouped cells worked well and enabled a coherent cell size and number measurement. Detected cells appeared to have a similar size to real cells (broadly measured with scale on confocal microscope). By counting some fields of views manually and comparing to the algorithm result, it is estimated that this algorithm has a rate of success of about 95%.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0189">This image processing algorithm was applied to the long viability assay performed on hRGC for 1, 3, and 7 days in different conditions (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> in the main text). All extracted values from the image processing algorithm can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>B</figref> for all samples. Live (green) and dead (red) cell size distribution was analyzed for all groups and shows no significant difference in time. The results suggested that dead cells are, on average, 10 &#x3bc;m smaller than live cells. A significantly higher live cell size was found in hydrogel samples (around 15 um for Gtn-HPA, 20 &#x3bc;m for IPN75 and IPN50) compared to cells cultured in 2D environment (8-10 um for media and PBS).</p><p id="p-0196" num="0190">Compactness was also analyzed for both live and dead cells for all samples and showed no difference between time points. A significantly lower compactness was observed for cells in hydrogels samples compared to media and PBS. Dead cells, mostly due to the loss of cytoplasm, nucleus and shape, showed a low compactness for all samples. These findings suggested that Gtn-HPA and IPNs can enable cell growth and differentiation due to their higher size while enabling morphological extension of primary processes, as shown with a lower compactness.</p><heading id="h-0039" level="1">Example 11&#x2014;Immunohistochemistry and Flow Cytometry Assay</heading><p id="p-0197" num="0191">Phenotype was checked by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry on cells cultured for 5 days in 2D (media) or 3D (Gtn-HPA, IPN75 and IPN50 with media) conditions. The hRGC phenotypic expression was measured in previous studies and was shown to have a high positive cell population expressing early RGC markers (as Brn3a and Brn3b) with a moderate population of late retinal ganglion cells. Percentage of expression of retinal ganglion cells (Brn3b, Brn3a, RBPMS and Thy1.1), neuronal (NeuN), apoptosis (Cas3), proliferation (Ki67) and stemness (Cmyc and Oct4) was measured and is reported in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref> while actual cell expression is shown with confocal microscopy fluorescent images (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>). Images were taken at field of views presenting a high expression of each marker and are not representative of overall marker percentage of expression. Of note is that a critical factor of using a scaffold to encapsulate cells was to ensure the maintenance of phenotype throughout the entire experiment.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0192">Stemness, proliferation, and apoptosis expression were remarkably low in all samples. This suggested an already differentiated cell population (with low number of pluripotent stem cells) which is past mitosis (cannot proliferate anymore). A low apoptosis expression in all samples enabled consideration of the hydrogels as non-toxic and confirm the viability assay performed on all IPN with healthy cells in 2D and 3D environments.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0193">As previously explained in Example 2, section titled &#x201c;Source and viability of hRGC,&#x201d; hRGCs were Brn3b-Tdtomato positive; therefore, Brn3b expression was primordial to confirm maintenance of cell phenotype by hydrogels and protocols. Critically, the Brn3b expression was high for all samples (about 80%), which also indicated the possibility of locating injected cells in tissue without the need to stain for multiple cell markers. Brn3a is a marker which overlaps with Brn3b and was shown here to be relatively high for all samples (about 50%) indicating a high percent of early retinal ganglion cells in the population. RBPMS and Thy1.1 are markers for late retinal ganglion cells, already fully differentiated. Part of the hRGC population (about 20%) was expressing those two markers, suggesting cells differentiated already present.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0194">Finally, retinal ganglion cells' main objective is to extend processes (e.g., axons) that merge into fibers to form the optic nerve. These fibers express some neuronal markers such as NeuN. A small part of the hRGC population expressed NeuN after 5 days of encapsulation in hydrogels (about 10%), which suggested that injected cells could potentially be able to extend processes that could attach the retina and regenerate a dying RGC layer. This assay enabled the confirmation of the maintenance of hRGC phenotype when encapsulated in IPN with nutrients for 5 days in vitro.</p><heading id="h-0040" level="1">Example 12&#x2014;Gel-Retina Interface Analysis with H&#x26;E Staining</heading><p id="p-0201" num="0195">To prove if IPN hydrogels could be mechanically tuned in order to make contact or attach with the back of the eye (inner limiting membrane of the retina: ILM) Gtn-HPA, IPN75, and IPN50 were injected in the vitreous of Long Evans rats. Three days post hydrogel injection, eyes were enucleated, sectioned and stained with H&#x26;E staining. H&#x26;E staining showed gel presence on top of the retina for all samples.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0196">To quantify the presence and attachment of IPNs, the contact between IPNs and retinal layers for n=10 fields of view for each sample was measured. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, 200 &#x3bc;m portions of sectioned retina were analyzed (H&#x26;E staining) by outlining the interface and calculating contact (in red) or not (in white). Percentage of attachment was calculated for each portion and summed over all replicates which gave for Gtn-HPA, IPN75 and IPN50 respectively 50%, 59%, and 79%. By summing over all replicates, the actual distribution of attachment was obtained, which suggested the presence of holes at the interface (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). These findings suggested that a higher stiffness and mechanical strength (as in IPN50) could enable a better attachment of injected hydrogels to the retina: higher average attachment and less holes at the interface. When injected cells in saline in the vitreous, cells do not have a matrix to stay at the site of injection (usually ILM or RGC layer) and can potentially leave the site and start the process of apoptosis, not being able to attach to other cells. Using these tunable IPNs cells can be encapsulated and injected at the interface where stiffer hydrogels could then attach and release cells directly onto the targeted layer of the retina.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0197">Of note is that H&#x26;E staining was performed 1- and 10-days post-injections. In the first case, the hydrogel was not fully attached to the eye but was present in the vitreous cavity, while in the latter case, most of the hydrogel was already degraded without any detachment of the retina or its layers.</p><heading id="h-0041" level="1">Example 13&#x2014;Optical Coherence Tomography Data</heading><p id="p-0204" num="0198">When injecting in vitreous Gtn-HPA, IPN75 and IPN50 live Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) was performed to image the back of the eye and portions of the retina using infrared (IR) light without sacrificing animals. For the first time, it was possible to image and observe hydrogels injected into the vitreal in vivo. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, images of the back of the eye showing healthy blood vessels, the core of the vitreous and multiple sections of the retina before, after and each day post-injection were acquired.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0199">Due to the size of the animals, and the SD-OCT apparatus not designed for rodents, the quality of SD-OCT images was lower than expected. However, the presence of islands of hydrogels was observed in the bulk of the vitreous right after injection for all samples, which implied a difficult imaging of the section of the retina at that time point. Indeed, islands of gels were refracting the OCT light far away from the retina therefore sectioned looked cut in half. This can be mainly solved by waiting for the setting of the gel on top of the retina. These islands are characteristics of Gtn-HPA and HA-Tyr in-situ crosslinking hydrogel formation and suggested a successful injection. While the back of the eye was still blackened by the gel, its islands were observed to be sitting on top of the retina around 2-3 days for all samples. White regions of gels attached to the retina suggested 3 days to be the optimal time for setting and start of degradation. A drop-in gel presence was observed starting at 4, 5, and 6 days for IPN75, Gtn-HPA, and IPN50, respectively. This finding was reinforced by the total absence of gel for all samples after specific time marked on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> (8-9 days for IPN50, 6-7 days for Gtn-HPA and 4-5 days for IPN75). One crucial finding was that morphology of the retina and the back of the before injection and after total degradation of gel are similar, showing no sign of retinal injury nor detachment. These findings suggested successful injection of gel that was enabled to sit on top of the retina and degraded at a moderately fast rate without provoking retinal detachment.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0200">To quantify these findings, SD-OCT data was analyzed with an image processing algorithm based on Otsu's thresholding method (see Example 3; section titled &#x201c;Hydrogels-retina interface and OCT analysis algorithms&#x201d;). An extraction of background and foreground was performed on n=10 images for each group. The variation from the common thresholding method was to use a 2-step algorithm. First, sections of the retina were analyzed with no gel and were considered as 100% background (while removing noise). Then, when analyzing an image containing islands of gel sitting on the retina, same consideration for background was kept and the only foreground was made of the hydrogels. This enabled to partially quantify the presence of hydrogel in the eye in vivo throughout time (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>). This quantification was then compared with a long-term in vitro degradation assay by using degrading enzymes (hyaluronidase and collagenase) with their actual concentrations found in vivo in the vitreous. Both in vitro and in vivo data showed similar trends with a high correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>=0.97), which suggested a correct analysis and measurement of gel presence in vivo with SD-OCT.</p><heading id="h-0042" level="1">Example 14&#x2014;Confocal Imaging of Eyes Sections Containing Injected Cells</heading><p id="p-0207" num="0201">hRGCs, encapsulated in 3 &#x3bc;L of Gtn-HPA, IPN75, IPN50 or in PBS, were injected in the vitreous of n=5 immunosuppressed Long Evans rats. After 1 month of immunosuppression rats were sacrificed and eyes were enucleated, sectioned and stained with FITC-STEM121 (human cytoplasmic maker) and VioBlue-DAPI (nuclei marker) for further analysis. To prove broad presence of human cells 1 month after injection, tiling of the whole retina was captured for all samples. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref>, STEM121 positive cells were observed next to the optic nerve for IPN50 and IPN75 while being in the center of the retina for Gtn-HPA and sparsely distributed everywhere for the PBS sample. Due to its low intensity and the size of tiling, intrinsic TdTomato-Brn3b was observed to be really dimmed in all tiling. These tiling suggested not only the success of the xenotransplantation, but also of engraftment due to the long-term experiment. Indeed, due to the fast degradation of hydrogels injected cells had to attach and integrate to living tissue in order to thrive for 1 month in vivo. These tiling also enabled to measure the size of the retina and by using an image processing algorithm (explained in the next section) to calculate the exact fraction of injected cells (50 k per eye) engrafted after 1 month for each whole eye.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0202">To further analyze location and engraftment of injected human retinal ganglion cells, sample sections were imaged at 20&#xd7; magnification (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B</figref>). Cells were found to be mainly in the retinal ganglion cell (RGC), which is the targeted layer, and the inner nuclear layer (INL) some migrated towards the choroid and stopping in the outer nuclear layer (ONL). On first sight, it was observed that cells in stiffer hydrogels (IPN5) and IPN75) were larger and more abundant than the one in Gtn-HPA. Overall cells injected in PBS were found to have the smallest size and were really low in number throughout all sections analyzed. Compared to tiling, intrinsic TdTomato-Brn3b was observable in these images and shows coherent location with injected cells (co-localization of both markers being analyzed in the next section).</p><p id="p-0209" num="0203">To understand and explain why injected hRGCs, in the vitreous, migrate towards another layer of the retina, the difference in size and morphology required more examination due to the experiment being a xenotransplantation. As a fact, human RGC are 2-3 times bigger than rats RGC; therefore, even being attracted to stay and engraft on the RGC layer, those cells try to find the right place to thrive by migrating into other layer with bigger cells (as in INL or ONL). Of note is the location of most cells being in the targeted layer (RGC) for hydrogels groups suggesting a better release of cells throughout time onto the retina compared to cells injected in PBS only.</p><heading id="h-0043" level="1">Example 15&#x2014;Cell Migration, Orientation and Colocalization Algorithms</heading><p id="p-0210" num="0204">Most stem cell in vivo transplantations are usually analyzed qualitatively by observing stained sectioned and cell morphology without applying quantification processes. To enhance this analysis, an image processing algorithm was created. The image processing algorithm was capable of localizing cells in their respective layer of the retina, calculating their relative orientation compared to the tissue, and measuring the amount of both markers (STEM121 and Brn3b) co-localization in the cell body. A learning data set consisting of n=60 pictures in the center of the retina (usually the injected site) was created. The learning data set, taken at 63&#xd7; magnification, for all samples, is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0205">As explained in Example 3, (section titled &#x201c;Image processing algorithms for detection of cell migration, co-localization and orientation compare to retinal layers&#x201d;), the algorithm consisted in a 2-step thresholding process which separated the cell center (possessing a high intensity) from their surrounding (dimmer intensity). To use a simple non-realistic analogy, whole cells were first segmented, then nuclei were segmented, and finally cells not containing any nucleus were removed. This extraction worked with most cells however, precision suffered: some pixels&#x2014;especially around the border of the image&#x2014;were above the threshold, leading to segmentation towards unwanted parts of the image. To solve this issue, the 5-pixel border of each image (which corresponded to &#x3c;1% of the image) was deleted. The 5-pixel border usually only removed about 1-2 cells per picture. To set a constant and relatable quantification an intensity normalization for all images was performed and almost all cells in each image were localized, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref> where the red circle corresponds to the high intensity center and the red regions to the dimmer cell body. Nonetheless, being able to extract cell location on each image was not sufficient to significantly quantify the xenotransplantation; therefore, each image was annotated with the retinal layers as seen with DAPI staining (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-<b>17</b>B</figref>). This annotation was done by hand using a simple online tool (Makesense.ai), which enabled each image to be divided into retinal regions (Choroid, ONL, INL, RGC and Vitreous). By merging the coordinates of cell extraction with the retinal layer, each cell engraftment in the retina was finally able to be localized (as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0212" num="0206">By observing most of the learning data set, it was noticeable that many cells had started their differentiation and extension of long processes toward or in the optic nerve during their engraftment. To quantify this finding, cell size was calculated (not only body but also processes), which worked well except with crescent shape cells or very round-shaped cells. Morphologically, retinal ganglion cells extended their processes towards the optic nerve parallel to all retinal layers; hence, the relative orientation of the injected cells was also measured with the annotated layers of the retina. The actual orientation of each cell corresponded to the angle difference between its body and the layer it was located in. Both angles were measured by fitting the largest possible ellipse in both the extracted cell body and annotated layers (cell ellipses shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref>) and using their long axes angle.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0207">Most human markers (including STEM121 or STEM101) are usually also staining some blood vessels, especially in the retina. Therefore, to guarantee that the in vivo quantification was performed on human injected cells and not host blood vessels (i.e., artifacts) a colocalization algorithm was used, which measured the presence of both STEM121 marker and human intrinsic Brn3b for each extracted cell. This code found the M1 and M2, which corresponded to the amount of green and red pixels, respectively, in each image while measuring the correlation coefficient of these pixels. This enabled the demonstration that events found during staining were injected cells and not artifacts.</p><heading id="h-0044" level="1">Example 16&#x2014;M&#xfc;ller and Immune Cells Expression</heading><p id="p-0214" num="0208">While in vivo xenotransplantation was performed on immunosuppressed Long Evans rats, analyzing and measuring the core immune response to injected cells and biomaterials is critical to any transplantation. To do so, sections of ocular tissue stained with IBA1 and CD45 cell markers (mainly expressed in microglia and immune cells in response to injection). By imaging with fluorescent confocal microscopy (15 random fields of views), the presence of both markers in all samples was observed, as it can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref>. Most IBA1 expression was found in the inner nuclear layer while CD45 was localized next to the injection site in the retinal ganglion cells layer. To create a significant quantification of the immune response due to injection, a simple image processing algorithm was used. The algorithm consisted in calculating the surface coverage of each marker: calculating the number of positive pixels for each marker (green for IBA1 and red for CD45) and normalizing by the total number of pixel in the image. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>, expression of both immune markers was significantly higher in PBS than all other samples. In order to decouple the effect of the hydrogels from the injection itself, these data was compared to the sham condition (i.e., consisting in stabbing the eye with the needle without injecting hydrogels, cells, or buffers). All hydrogel samples possessed a similar expression of immune cell markers compared to the sham condition but had a higher expression than the control condition.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0209">These findings suggested that the main cause of immune response when injecting cells encapsulated in the IPN hydrogel is the needle injection itself, as injecting cells in PBS provoked a higher immune response. The immune reaction analysis showed the injury due to the injection could trigger a reaction from the host as seen with CD45 staining. In the PBS group, hRGC suspension was exposed to the invading leukocytes, especially as xenograft in non-immunosuppressed animals. Gtn-HPA and HA-Tyr, being FDA approved biocompatible and biodegradable polymers, can form a protective barrier for hRGC, protecting them from the migrating immune cells.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0210">M&#xfc;ller cells form the entrance path inside the retina. They extend their process through all the layers partly forming the barrier between the retinal ganglion cell layer and the vitreous: the inner limiting membrane. When activated, due to entrance of pathogens, migrating immune cells or exogenous ed human cells, M&#xfc;ller cells express largely Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). To measure M&#xfc;ller cells activation, ocular tissue sections were stained with GFAP and imaged via fluorescent confocal microscopy, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>. By using the same image processing algorithm used for the immune response, GFAP expression was quantified for all samples (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref>). An identical trend, as for immune reaction, was found in M&#xfc;ller cell activation with a significantly higher expression in PBS samples compared to all other groups. No differences were found between all gels and sham samples. These findings corroborated the immune response expression previously explained. While being a delivery vehicle and protecting cells from the intrinsic immune response, hydrogels (and especially these IPNs hydrogels) also facilitated the entry of exogenous cells inside the layers of the retina with less M&#xfc;ller cell activation observed.</p><heading id="h-0045" level="1">Other Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0217" num="0211">It is to be understood that while the invention has been described in conjunction with the detailed description thereof, the foregoing description is intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the invention, which is defined by the scope of the appended claims.
