Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">5<sup>th </sup>generation (5G) mobile communication technologies define broad frequency bands such that high transmission rates and new services are possible, and can be implemented not only in &#x201c;Sub 6 gigahertz (GHz)&#x201d; bands such as 3.5 GHz, but also in &#x201c;Above 6 GHz&#x201d; bands referred to as mmWave including 28 GHz and 39 GHz. In addition, it has been considered to implement 6<sup>th </sup>generation (6G) mobile communication technologies (referred to as Beyond 5G systems) in terahertz bands (for example, 95 GHz to 3 terahertz (THz) bands) in order to accomplish transmission rates fifty times faster than 5G mobile communication technologies and ultra-low latencies one-tenth of 5G mobile communication technologies.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At the beginning of the development of 5G mobile communication technologies, in order to support services and to satisfy performance requirements in connection with enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB), Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), and massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC), there has been ongoing standardization regarding beamforming and massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) for mitigating radio-wave path loss and increasing radio-wave transmission distances in mmWave, supporting numerologies (for example, operating multiple subcarrier spacings) for efficiently utilizing mmWave resources and dynamic operation of slot formats, initial access technologies for supporting multi-beam transmission and broadbands, definition and operation of BandWidth Part (BWP), new channel coding methods such as a Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) code for large amount of data transmission and a polar code for highly reliable transmission of control information, L2 pre-processing, and network slicing for providing a dedicated network specialized to a specific service.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, there are ongoing discussions regarding improvement and performance enhancement of initial 5G mobile communication technologies in view of services to be supported by 5G mobile communication technologies, and there has been physical layer standardization regarding technologies such as Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) for aiding driving determination by autonomous vehicles based on information regarding positions and states of vehicles transmitted by the vehicles and for enhancing user convenience, New Radio Unlicensed (NR-U) aimed at system operations conforming to various regulation-related requirements in unlicensed bands, NR UE Power Saving, Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) which is UE-satellite direct communication for providing coverage in an area in which communication with terrestrial networks is unavailable, and positioning.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, there has been ongoing standardization in air interface architecture/protocol regarding technologies such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for supporting new services through interworking and convergence with other industries, Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) for providing a node for network service area expansion by supporting a wireless backhaul link and an access link in an integrated manner, mobility enhancement including conditional handover and Dual Active Protocol Stack (DAPS) handover, and two-step random access for simplifying random access procedures (2-step RACH for NR). There also has been ongoing standardization in system architecture/service regarding a 5G baseline architecture (for example, service based architecture or service based interface) for combining Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technologies, and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) for receiving services based on UE positions.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As 5G mobile communication systems are commercialized, connected devices that have been exponentially increasing will be connected to communication networks, and it is accordingly expected that enhanced functions and performances of 5G mobile communication systems and integrated operations of connected devices will be necessary.

For example, two blocks shown in succession may in fact be executed concurrently or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As used herein, &#x201c;unit&#x201d; refers to a software element or a hardware element, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), which performs a predetermined function. However, the term &#x201c;unit&#x201d; does not always have a meaning limited to software or hardware. &#x201c;Unit&#x201d; may be constructed either to be stored in an addressable storage medium or to execute one or more processors.

Further, the term &#x201c;unit&#x201d; in the embodiments may include one or more processors.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">A wireless communication system has developed into a broadband wireless communication system that provides a high-speed and high-quality packet data service according to communication standards such as high-speed packet access (HSPA) of third generation partnership project (3GPP), LTE or evolved universal terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA), LTE-advanced (LTE-A), LTE-Pro, high rate packet data (HRPD) of 3GPP2, ultra mobile broadband (UMB), and 802.16e of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) beyond the initially provided voice-based service.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">An LTE system, which is a representative example of the broadband wireless communication system, employs an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme for a downlink (DL) (the term &#x201c;downlink&#x201d; and the term &#x201c;DL&#x201d; are used interchangeably throughout the disclosure), and employs a single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) scheme for an uplink (UL) (the term &#x201c;uplink&#x201d; and the term &#x201c;UL&#x201d; are used interchangeably throughout the disclosure). The uplink is a radio link through which a UE (or an MS) transmits data or a control signal to a BS (or an eNode B), and the downlink is a radio link through which the BS transmits data or a control signal to the UE. In the multiple access schemes as described above, time-frequency resources for carrying data or control information are allocated and operated in a manner to prevent overlapping of the resources, that is, to establish the orthogonality, between users, so as to identify data or control information of each user.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">A post-LTE communication system, that is, a 5G communication system, should be able to freely reflect various requirements of a user and a service provider, and thus it is required to support a service which satisfies the various requirements. Services which are considered for the 5G communication system include enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communication (mMTC), and ultra reliability low latency communication (URLLC).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The eMBB aims to provide a data transmission rate which is improved so as to surpass the data transmission speed supported by conventional LTE, LTE-A, or LTE-Pro. For example, in the 5G communication system, the eMBB should provide a peak downlink data rate of 20 gigabits per second (Gbps) and a peak uplink data rate of 10 Gbps from the viewpoint of one BS. Further, the 5G communication system should provide not only the peak data rate but also an increased user-perceived data rate. In order to satisfy such requirements, improvement of various transmission/reception technologies, including a further improved multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmission technology, is needed. Further, while the current LTE system uses transmission bandwidths from a bandwidth of 2 GHz to a maximum bandwidth of 20 megahertz (MHz) to transmit signals, the 5G communication system uses a frequency bandwidth wider than 20 MHz in frequency bands of 3 to 6 GHz or higher than or equal to 6 GHz, whereby the data transmission rate required by the 5G communication system can be satisfied.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Also, in order to support an application service such as the IoT, mMTC is considered in the 5G communication system. The mMTC is required to support access of a multitude of UEs within a cell, improve coverage of the UE, increase a battery lifetime, and reduce the costs of the UE in order to efficiently provide IoT technology. IoT technology is used in conjunction with various sensors and devices to provide communication, and thus should support a large number of UEs (for example, 1,000,000 UEs/kilometer2 (km2)) within the cell. Since the UE supporting the mMTC is highly likely to be located in a shaded area, such as a basement of a building, which a cell cannot cover due to service characteristics, the mMTC may require wider coverage than other services provided by the 5G communication system. The UE supporting the mMTC needs to be produced at low cost and it is difficult to frequently exchange a battery thereof. Thus, a long battery lifetime, for example, 10 to 15 years, may be required.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The URLLC is a cellular-based wireless communication service used for a particular (mission-critical) purpose. For example, services used for remote control of robots or machinery, industrial automation, unmanned aerial vehicles, remote health care, and emergency alerts may be considered. Accordingly, communication provided by the URLLC should provide very low latency and very high reliability. For example, services supporting the URLLC should satisfy a radio access delay time (air interface latency) shorter than 0.5 milliseconds and also have a requirement of a packet error rate equal to or smaller than 10-5. Accordingly, for services supporting the URLLC, the 5G system should provide a transmit time interval (TTI) smaller than that of other systems and also have a design requirement of allocating a wide array of resources in a frequency band in order to guarantee reliability of a communication link.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Three services of 5G, namely eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC, may be multiplexed and transmitted in one system. At this time, in order to meet the different requirements of the respective services, different transmission/reception schemes and transmission/reception parameters may be used for the services. Of course, 5G is not limited to the above-described three services.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">NR Time-Frequency Resources</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Hereinafter, a frame structure of a 5G system is described in more detail with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a basic structure of a time-frequency domain which is a radio resource domain in one subframe <b>110</b> in which data or a control channel is transmitted in a 5G system according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a horizontal axis indicates a time domain and a vertical axis indicates a frequency domain.

The information may be transmitted to the UE from the BS through higher-layer signaling, for example, radio resource control (RRC) signaling. Among one or a plurality of configured BWPs, at least one BSP may be activated. Information indicating whether to activate the configured BWPs may be semi-statically transferred from the BS to the UE through RRC signaling or may be dynamically transferred through DCI.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0086">According to some embodiments, the UE may receive a configuration of an initial BWP for initial access from the BS through a master information block (MIB) before the RRC connection. More specifically, the UE may receive configuration information for a CORESET (&#x201c;CORESET&#x201d; and &#x201c;control resource set&#x201d; are used interchangeably throughout the disclosure) and a search space (the term &#x201c;search space&#x201d; and the term &#x201c;SS&#x201d; are used interchangeably throughout the disclosure) in which a PDCCH for receiving system information (remaining system information (RMSI) or system information block 1 (SIB1)) required for initial access through the MIB can be transmitted in an initial access step. The control resource set and the search space configured as the MIB may be considered as an identity (ID) 0. The BS may inform the UE of configuration information such as frequency allocation information for control resource set #0, time allocation information, and numerology, through the MIB. Further, the BS may inform the UE of configuration information for a monitoring period and an occasion of control resource set #0, that is, configuration information for search space #0 through the MIB. The UE may consider a frequency region configured as control resource set #0 acquired from the MIB as an initial bandwidth part for initial access. At this time, the ID of the initial BWP may be considered as 0.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0087">The configuration for the BWP supported by the 5G system may be used for various purposes.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0088">When a bandwidth supported by the UE is narrower than a system bandwidth, it may be supported through the BWP configuration. For example, the BS may configure a frequency location (configuration information <b>2</b>) of the BWP in the UE, and thus the UE may transmit and receive data at a specific frequency location within the system bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0089">Further, in order to support different numerologies, the BS may configure a plurality of BWPs in the UE. For example, in order to support the UE to perform data transmission and reception using both subcarrier spacing of 15 kilohertz (kHz) and subcarrier spacing of 30 kHz, two BWPs may be configured as subcarrier spacings of 15 kHz and 30 kHz, respectively. Different BWPs may be frequency division-multiplexed, and when data is to be transmitted and received at specific subcarrier spacing, BWPs configured at the corresponding subcarrier spacing may be activated.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0090">In order to reduce power consumption of the UE, the BS may configure BWPs having different sizes of bandwidths in the UE. When the UE supports a very large bandwidth, e.g., 100 MHz, but always transmits and receives data through the bandwidth, a very high power consumption may be generated. Particularly, monitoring an unnecessary downlink control channel through a large bandwidth of 100 MHz in the state in which there is no traffic is very inefficient from the aspect of power consumption. In order to reduce power consumption of the UE, the BS may configure a BWP having a relatively narrow bandwidth, e.g., 200 MHz. The UE may perform a monitoring operation in the bandwidth part of 200 MHz in the state in which there is no traffic, and if data is generated, may transmit and receive data through the bandwidth part of 100 MHz according to an instruction from the BS.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0091">In a method of configuring the BWP, UEs before the RRC connection may receive configuration information for an initial bandwidth part through an MIB in an initial access step. More specifically, the UE may receive a configuration of a CORESET for a downlink control channel in which DCI for scheduling an SIB can be transmitted from an MIB of a physical broadcast channel (PBCH). A bandwidth of the control resource set configured as the MIB may be considered as an initial bandwidth part, and the UE may receive a PDSCH, in which the SIB is transmitted, through the configured initial bandwidth part. The initial BWP may be used not only for reception of the SIB but also other system information (OSI), paging, or random access (RA) (the term &#x201c;random access&#x201d; and the term &#x201c;RA&#x201d; are used interchangeably throughout the disclosure).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0092">BWP Change</p><p id="p-0096" num="0093">When one or more BWPs are configured in the UE, the BS may indicate a change (or switching or transition) in the BWPs to the UE through a BWP indicator field within the DCI. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, when a currently activated BWP of the UE is BWP #1 <b>301</b>, the BS may indicate BWP #2 <b>302</b> to the UE through a BWP indicator within DCI and the UE may make a BWP change to BWP #2 <b>302</b> indicated by the received BWP indicator within DCI.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0094">As described above, since the DCI-based BWP change may be indicated by the DCI for scheduling the PDSCH or the PUSCH, the UE should be able to receive or transmit the PDSCH or the PUSCH scheduled by the corresponding DCI in the changed BWP without any difficulty if the UE receives a BWP change request.

When the BS desires to schedule a data channel in the new BWP, the BS may determine time domain resource allocation for the data cannel in consideration of the BWP change delay time (T<sub>BWP</sub>) of the UE. That is, when scheduling the data channel in the new BWP, the BS may schedule the corresponding data channel after the BWP change delay time using a method of determining the time domain resource allocation for the data channel. Accordingly, the UE may not expect that the DCI indicating the BWP change indicates a slot offset (K<sub>0 </sub>or K<sub>2</sub>) smaller than the BWP change delay time (T<sub>BWP</sub>).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0097">If the UE receives DCI indicating the BWP change (for example, DCI format 1_1 or 0_1), the UE may perform no transmission or reception during a time interval from a third symbol of a slot for receiving the PDCCH including the corresponding DCI to a start point of the slot indicated by the slot offset (K0 or K2) indicated through a time domain resource allocation field within the corresponding DCI. For example, when the UE receives DCI indicating the BWP change in slot n and a slot offset value indicated by the corresponding DCI is K, the UE may perform no transmission or reception from the third symbol of slot n to a symbol before slot n+K (that is, the last symbol of slot n+K&#x2212;1).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0098">SS/PBCH Block</p><p id="p-0103" num="0099">Subsequently, a synchronization signal/PBCH block in a 5G system is described.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0100">The synchronization signal/PBCH block may be a physical layer channel block including a primary synchronization signal (PSS), a secondary synchronization signal (SSS), and a PBCH.

The number of CCEs required to transmit the PDCCH may be 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 according to the aggregation level (AL), and the different number of CCEs may be used to implement link adaptation of the downlink control channel. For example, if AL=L, one downlink control channel may be transmitted through L CCEs. The UE should detect a signal in the state in which the UE does not know information on the downlink control channel, and a search space indicating a set of CCEs is defined to perform blind decoding in a wireless communication system (for example, 5G or NR system). The search space is a set of downlink control channel candidates including CCEs for which the UE should attempt decoding at the given aggregation level, and there are several aggregation levels at which one set of CCEs is configured by 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 CCEs, so that the UE may have a plurality of search spaces. A search space set may be defined as a set of search spaces at all the configured aggregation levels.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0125">The search space may be classified into a common search space and a UE-specific search space. UEs in a predetermined group or all UEs may search for a common search space of the PDCCH in order to receive cell-common control information such as dynamic scheduling for system information or paging messages. For example, PDSCH scheduling allocation information for transmission of an SIB including information on a service provider of a cell may be received by searching for (monitoring) a common search space of the PDCCH. In the case of the common search space, UEs in a predetermined group or all UEs should receive the PDCCH, so that the common-search space may be defined as a set of pre-arranged CCEs. Scheduling allocation information for the UE-specific PDSCH or PUSCH may be received by searching for a UE-specific search space of the PDCCH. The UE-specific search space may be UE-specifically defined as a UE identity and a function of various system parameters.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0126">A parameter for a search space of a PDCCH in a wireless communication system (for example, a 5G or NR system) may be configured in the UE by the BS through higher-layer signaling (for example, SIB, MIB, or RRC signaling). For example, the BS may configure, in the UE, the number of PDCCH candidates at each aggregation level L, a monitoring period of the search space, a monitoring occasion in units of symbols within the slot for the search space, a search space type, that is, a common search space or a UE-specific search space, a combination of a DCI format and an RNTI to be monitored in the corresponding search space, and a control resource set index for monitoring the search space. For example, the following information shown below in Table 9 may be included in the information configured by the BS.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00009" num="00009"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="161pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="98pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 9</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>SearchSpace ::=</entry><entry>&#x2003;SEQUENCE {</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>&#x2003;-- Identity of the search space.

Rate matching refers to the control of the size of a signal in consideration of the amount of resources available for transmitting the signal. For example, rate matching of a data channel may mean mapping data channels to specific time and frequency resource domains without transmission, so as to control the size of data according thereto.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0241"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates a method by which the BS and the UE transmit and receive data in consideration of a downlink data channel and rate matching resources according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0242">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, a downlink data channel (PDSCH) <b>1201</b> and a rate matching resource <b>1202</b> are illustrated. The BS may configure one or a plurality of rate matching resources <b>1202</b> in the UE through higher-layer signaling (for example, RRC signaling). The rate matching resource <b>1202</b> configuration information may include time axis resource allocation information <b>1203</b>, frequency axis resource allocation information <b>1204</b>, and period information <b>1205</b>. In the following description, a bitmap corresponding to the frequency axis resource allocation information <b>1204</b> is named a &#x201c;first bitmap&#x201d;, a bitmap corresponding to the time axis resource allocation information <b>1203</b> is named a &#x201c;second bitmap&#x201d;, and a bitmap corresponding to the period information <b>1205</b> is named a &#x201c;third bitmap&#x201d;. When all or some of the time and frequency resources of the scheduled data channel <b>1201</b> overlap the configured rate matching resources <b>602</b>, the BS may rate-match the data channel <b>1201</b> in the part of the rate matching resources <b>1202</b> and transmit the data channel, and the UE may perform reception and decoding on the basis of the assumption that the data channel <b>1201</b> is rate-matched in the part of the rate matching resources <b>1202</b>.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0243">The BS may dynamically notify the UE of whether to rate-match the data channel in the configured rate matching resource part through an additional configuration (corresponding to a &#x201c;rate matching indicator&#x201d; in the above-described DCI format). Specifically, the BS may select some of the configured rate matching resources, group the selected rate matching resources into a rate matching resource group, and inform the UE of whether to perform rate matching on the data channel for each rate matching resource group through DCI using a bitmap scheme. For example, when 4 rate matching resources, RMR #1, RMR #2, RMR #3, and RMR #4 are configured, the BS may configure rate matching groups RMG #1={RMR #1, RMR #2} and RMG #2={RMR #3, RMR #4}, and inform the UE of whether to perform rate matching in each of RMG #1 and RMG #2 by using 2 bits within a DCI field. For example, &#x201c;1&#x201d; may be indicated when rate matching should be performed, and &#x201c;0&#x201d; may be indicated when rate matching should not be performed.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0244">In the 5G system, granularity at an &#x201c;RB symbol level&#x201d; and an &#x201c;RE level&#x201d; is supported as a method of configuring the rate matching resource in the UE.

For the coexistence of long-term evolution (LTE) and new RAT (NR) (LTE-NR coexistence), NR provides a function of configuring a pattern of cell-specific reference signal (CRS) of LTE to an NR UE. More specifically, the CRS pattern may be provided by RRC signaling including at least one parameter within a ServingCellConfig information element (IE) or a ServingCellConfigCommon IE. The parameters may be, for example, lte-CRS-ToMatchAround, lte-CRS-PatternList1-r16, lte-CRS-PatternList2-r16, crs-RateMatch-PerCORESETPoolIndex-r16, and the like.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0255">In Rel-15 NR, a function of configuring one CRS pattern per serving cell may be provided through the parameter lte-CRS-ToMatchAround. In Rel-16 NR, the function is expanded to configure a plurality of CRS patterns per serving cell. More specifically, one CRS pattern per LTE carrier may be configured in a single-transmission and reception point (TRP) configuration UE, and two CRS patterns per LTE carrier may be configured in a multi-TRP configuration UE. For example, a maximum of three CRS patterns per serving cell may be configured in the single-TRP configuration UE through the parameter lte-CRS-PatternList1-r16. In another example, the CRS may be configured for each TRP in the multi-TRP configuration UE. That is, a CRS pattern for TRP1 may be configured through the parameter lte-CRS-PatternList1-r16, and a CRS pattern for TRP2 may be configured through the parameter lte-CRS-PatternList2-r16. Meanwhile, when the two TRPs are configured, whether to apply all of the CRS patterns of TRP1 and TRP2 to a specific physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) or only the CRS pattern for one TRP is determined through the parameter crs-RateMatch-PerCORESETPoolIndex-r16, and only the CRS pattern of one TRP is applied when the parameter crs-RateMatch-PerCORESETPoolIndex-r16 is configured to be enabled and, otherwise, all of the CRS patterns of the two TRPs are applied.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0256">Table 17 shows the ServingCellConfig IE including the CRS pattern, and Table 18 shows the

For example, the individual configuration information for SRS resources may include time-frequency axis mapping information within the slot of SRS resources, which may include information on intra-slot or inter-slot frequency hopping of SRS resources. Further, the individual configuration information for SRS resources may include a time-axis transmission configuration of SRS resources and may be configured as one of &#x2018;periodic&#x2019;, &#x2018;semi-persistent&#x2019;, and &#x2018;aperiodic&#x2019;.

For example, the BS may activate or deactivate periodic SRS transmission to the UE through higher-layer signaling. The BS may indicate activation of an SRS resource set having a resourceType configured as periodic through higher-layer signaling, and the UE may transmit SRS resources referred to by the activated SRS resource set. Time-frequency axis resource mapping within the slot of the transmission SRS resources follows resource mapping information configured in the SRS resources, and slot mapping including the transmission period and the slot offset follows a periodicityAndOffset configured in the SRS resources. Further, a spatial domain transmission filter applied to the transmission SRS resources may refer to spatial relation info configured in the SRS resources or refer to associated CSI-RS information configured in the SRS resource set including the SRS resources. The UE may transmit SRS resources within an uplink BWP activated for activated semi-persistent SRS resources through higher-layer signaling.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0315">For example, the BS may activate or deactivate semi-persistent SRS transmission to the UE through high-layer signaling. The BS may indicate activation of the SRS resource set through MAC CE signaling, and the UE may transmit SRS resources referred to by the activated SRS resource set. The SRS resource set activated through MAC CE signaling may be limited to an SRS resource set having the resourceType configured as semi-persistent. Time-frequency axis resource mapping within the slot of the transmission SRS resources follows resource mapping information configured in the SRS resources, and slot mapping including the transmission period and the slot offset follows a periodicityAndOffset configured in the SRS resources. Further, a spatial domain transmission filter applied to the transmission SRS resources may refer to spatial relation info configured in the SRS resources or refer to associated CSI-RS information configured in the SRS resource set including the SRS resources. When spatial relation info is configured in the SRS resources, a spatial domain transmission filter may be determined with reference to configuration information for spatial relation info transmitted through MAC CE signaling activating semi-persistent SRS transmission without following the spatial relation info. The UE may transmit SRS resources within an uplink BWP activated for activated semi-persistent SRS resources through higher-layer signaling.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0316">For example, the BS may trigger aperiodic SRS transmission to the UE through DCI. The BS may indicate one of the aperiodic SRS resource triggers (aperiodicSRS-ResourceTrigger) through an SRS request field of DCI. The UE may understand that an SRS resource set including the aperiodic SRS resource trigger indicated through DCI in an aperiodic SRS resource trigger list among SRS resource set configuration information is triggered. The UE may transmit the SRS resources referred to by the triggered SRS resource set. Time-frequency axis resource mapping within the slot of the transmitted SRS resources follows resource mapping information configured in the SRS resources. Further, slot mapping of the transmitted SRS resources may be determined through a slot offset between a PDCCH including DCI and the SRS resources, which may refer to a value(s) included in a slot offset set configured in the SRS resource set. Specifically, the slot offset between the PDCCH including DCI and the SRS resources may apply a value indicated by a time domain resource assignment field of DCI among an offset value(s) included in the slot offset set configured in the SRS resource set. Further, a spatial domain transmission filter applied to the transmission SRS resources may refer to spatial relation info configured in the SRS resources or refer to associated CSI-RS information configured in the SRS resource set including the SRS resources. The UE may transmit SRS resources within an uplink BWP activated for triggered aperiodic SRS resources through DCI.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0317">When the BS triggers aperiodic SRS transmission to the UE through DCI, the UE may need a minimum time interval between the PDCCH including DCI for triggering aperiodic SRS transmission and the transmitted SRS in order to transmit the SRS through the application of configuration information for SRS resource. The time interval for SRS transmission by the UE may be defined as the number of symbols between the last symbol of the PDCCH including DCI for triggering aperiodic SRS transmission and the first symbol to which the SRS resource that is first transmitted among the transmitted SRS resource(s) is mapped. The minimum time interval may be defined with reference to a PUSCH preparation procedure time required for preparing PUSCH transmission by the UE. Further, the minimum time interval may have different values according to a used place of the SRS resource set including the transmitted SRS resource. For example, the minimum time interval may be defined as N2 symbols defined in consideration of the UE processing capability according to the UE capability with reference to the PUSCH preparation procedure of the UE. Further, the minimum time interval may be determined as N2 symbols when the used place of the SRS resource set is configured as &#x2018;codebook&#x2019; or &#x2018;antennaSwitching&#x2019; in consideration of the used place of the SRS resource set including the transmitted SRS resource, and may be determined as N2+14 symbols when the used place of the SRS resource set is configured as &#x2018;nonCodebook&#x2019; or &#x2018;beamManagement&#x2019; The UE may perform aperiodic SRS transmission when the time interval for aperiodic SRS transmission is longer than or equal to the minimum time interval, and may ignore DCI for triggering the aperiodic SRS when the time interval for aperiodic SRS transmission is shorter than the minimum time interval.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0000"><tables

A DMRS antenna port for PUSCH transmission is the same as an antenna port for SRS transmission. PUSCH transmission may follow each of a codebook-based transmission method and a non-codebook-based transmission method according to whether a value of txConfig within pusch-Config of Table 28 which is higher-layer signaling is &#x2018;codebook&#x2019; or &#x2018;nonCodebook&#x2019;.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0324">As described above, PUSCH transmission may be dynamically scheduled through DCI format 0_0 or 0_1 or semi-statically configured by the configured grant. When the UE receives an indication of scheduling of PUSCH transmission through DCI format 0_0, the UE performs a beam configuration for PUSCH transmission by using pucch-spatialRelationInfoID corresponding to a UE-specific PUCCH resource corresponding to a minimum ID within the activated uplink BWP in the serving cell in which case the PUSCH transmission is based on a single antenna port. The UE does not expect scheduling of PUSCH transmission through DCI format 0_0 within a BWP in which the PUCCH resource including pucch-spatialRelationInfo is not configured. When the UE does not receive a configuration of txConfig within pusch-Config of Table 28, the UE does not expect reception of scheduling through DCI format 0_1.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0000"><tables

Time domain resource allocation information within the DCI or the configured grant is resources of the first repetitive transmission indicated by the BS. Time domain resource information of the remaining repetitive transmissions may be determined with reference to resource information of the first repetitive transmission and uplink or downlink directions of symbols. When the time domain resource information of repetitive transmission indicated by the BS is over the slot boundary or includes an uplink/downlink switching point, the corresponding repetitive transmission may be divided into a plurality of repetitive transmissions.

In the following description, this is referred to as a UE capability report.</p><p id="p-0343" num="0376">The BS may transmit a UE capability enquiry message that makes a request for a capability report to the UE in the connected state. The message may include a UE capability request for each radio access technology (RAT) type of the BS. The request for each RAT type may include supported frequency band combination information. In the case of the UE capability enquiry message, a plurality of UE capabilities for respective RAT types may be requested through one RRC message container transmitted by the BS or the BS may insert the UE capability enquiry message including the UE capability request for each RAT type multiple times and transmit the same to the UE. That is, the UE capability enquiry is repeated multiple times within one message and the UE may configure a UE capability information message corresponding thereto and report the same multiple times. In the next-generation mobile communication system, a UE capability request for NR, LTE, E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity (EN-DC), and multi-RAT dual connectivity (MR-DC) may be made. The UE capability enquiry message is generally transmitted initially after the UE is connected to the BS, but may be requested at any time when the BS needs the same.</p><p id="p-0344" num="0377">The UE receiving the request for the UE capability report from the BS in the above step may configure a UE capability according to RAT type and band information requested by the BS. A method by which the UE configures the UE capability in a wireless communication system (for example, a 5G or NR system) is described below</p><p id="p-0345" num="0378">1. When the UE receives a list of LTE and/or NR bands from the BS through a UE capability request, the UE configures a band combination (BC) for EN-DC and NR stand alone (SA). That is, the UE configures a candidate list of BCs for EN-DC and NR SA on the basis of requested bands in FreqBandList. The bands sequentially have priorities as stated in FreqBandList.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0379">2. When the BS sets a &#x201c;eutra-nr-only&#x201d; flag or an &#x201c;eutra&#x201d; flag and makes a request for the UE capability report, the UE completely removes NR SA BCs from the configured candidate list of BCs. Such an operation may occur only when the LTE BS (eNB) makes a request for an &#x201c;eutra&#x201d; capability.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0380">3. Thereafter, the UE removes fallback BCs from the candidate list of BCs configured in the above stage. The fallback BC is a BC which can be obtained by removing a band corresponding to at least one SCell from a predetermined BC, and a BC before the removal of the band corresponding at least one SCell can cover the fallback BC and thus the fallback BC can be omitted. This stage is applied to MR-DC, that is, LTE bands. BCs left after the stage are a final &#x201c;candidate BC list&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0381">4. The UE selects BCs suitable for a requested RAT type in the final &#x201c;candidate BC list&#x201d; and selects BCs to be reported. In this stage, the UE configures supportedBandCombinationList according to a determined order. That is, the UE configures BCs and UE capability to be reported according to an order of a preset rat-Type (nr-&#x3e;eutra-nr-&#x3e;eutra). Further, the UE configures featureSetCombination for the configured supportedBandCombinationList and configures a list of &#x201c;candidate feature set combination&#x201d; in a candidate BC list from which a list for fallback BCs (including capability at the same or lower stage) is received. The &#x201c;candidate feature set combination&#x201d; may include all feature set combinations for NR and EUTRA-NR BCs, and may be acquired from a feature set combination of UE-NR-Capabilities and UE-MRDC-Capabilities containers.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0382">5. When the requested rat Type is eutra-nr and influences, featureSetCombinations are included in all of the two containers of UE-MRDC-Capabilities and UE-NR-Capabilities. However, the NR feature set includes only UE-NR-Capabilities.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0383">After configuring the UE capability, the UE may transfer a UE capability information message including the UE capability to the BS.

For the PDCCH repetitive transmission based on multiple TRPs, various methods may exist depending on how each TCI state, which is applied when transmitting PDCCH in each TRP, to apply to the aforementioned various parameters used for PDCCH transmission. For example, various parameters used for PDCCH transmission to which different TCI states are applied may include a CCE, a PDCCH candidate, a CORESET, and a search space.

The same payload of repeatedly transmitted control information may mean all pieces of PDSCH scheduling information of each control information, for example, the number of PDSCH repetitive transmissions, time domain PDSCH resource allocation information, that is, a slot offset (K<sub>0</sub>) between control information and PDSCH #1 and the number of PDSCH symbols, frequency domain PDSCH resource allocation information, DMRS port allocation information, PDSCH-to-HARQ-ACK timing, and a PUCCH resource indicator may be the same as each other. The UE may improve reception reliability of control information by soft-combining repetitive transmission control information having the same payload.</p><p id="p-0455" num="0541">In order to perform soft combining, the UE is required to know in advance the resource location of control information to be repeatedly transmitted and the number of repetitive transmissions.

That is, all coded bits for the repeatedly transmitted PDCCH in respective TRPs may be the same as each other. In order to make all of the coded bits the same, information values for respective DCI fields within the PDCCHs may be configured to be the same. For example, all fields (e.g., TDRA, FDRA, TCI, Antenna ports, and the like) included in the DCI may be configured to have the same value. The same value may be interpreted as one meaning, but may be analyzed as a plurality of meanings if the value implies or corresponds to a plurality of (for example, two) values. A detailed description therefor is made below.</p><p id="p-0462" num="0548">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, for example, when the BS repeatedly transmits the PDCCH twice (for example, m=2), the BS may repeatedly transmit the PDCCH on the basis of the same or different beams in an aspect of a spatial domain by mapping one PDCCH to each of a TRP A and a TRP B. At this time, PDCCH repetitive transmission may be performed on the basis of CORESETs connected to two search spaces explicitly that are connected through higher-layer signaling. When IDs of the CORESETs connected to the search spaces are the same or TCI states of the CORESETs are the same, PDCCH repetitive transmission may be performed on the basis of a single TRP. When all IDs of the CORESETs connected to the search spaces are different or all TCI states of the CORESETs are different, PDCCH repetitive transmission may be performed on the basis of multiple TRPs.</p><p id="p-0463" num="0549">When the BS repeatedly transmits the PDCCH four times, the BS may map two PDCCHs to each of the TRP A and the TRP B, in which case the two PDCCHs of each TRP may be transmitted to be divided in the time domain. PDCCH repetitive transmission divided in the time domain can be repeated in units of time based on a slot, s subslot, or a mini-slot.</p><p id="p-0464" num="0550">The above-described method is only an example and the disclosure is not limited thereto. In the disclosure, the UE and the BS may consider the following methods for the PDCCH repetition operation.<ul id="ul0065" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0065-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0066" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0066-0001" num="0551">PDCCH repetition in an aspect of time/frequency/spatial domain within the same slot within the same CORESET.</li>        <li id="ul0066-0002" num="0552">PDCCH repetition in an aspect of time/frequency/spatial domain between different slots within the same CORESET.</li>        <li id="ul0066-0003" num="0553">PDCCH repetition in an aspect of time/frequency/spatial within the same slot between different CORESETs.</li>        <li id="ul0066-0004" num="0554">PDCCH repetition in an aspect of time/frequency/spatial domain between different slots between different CORESETs.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0465" num="0555">Further, when CORESETPoolindex is configured, CORESETPoolindex may also be considered in addition to the CORESET. Further, the number of PDCCH repetitions may independently increase, and accordingly the methods may be combined and considered at the same time.</p><p id="p-0466" num="0556">The BS may pre-configure information on a domain through which the PDCCH is repeatedly transmitted in the UE through an RRC message. For example, in the case of PDCCH repetitive transmission in the time domain, the BS may pre-configure information on the time slot corresponding to one of the slot, the subslot, or the mini-slot according to which the repetitive transmission is performed in the UE. In the case of PDCCH repetitive transmission in the frequency domain, the BS may pre-configure information on one of the CORESET, the bandwidth part (BWP), or component carrier (CC) according to which the repetitive transmission is performed in the UE. In the case of PDCCH repetitive transmission in the spatial domain, the BS may pre-configure information related to a beam for PDCCH repetitive transmission through a configuration for each QCL type in the UE. Alternatively, the BS may combine the listed information and transmit the same to the UE through the RRC message. Accordingly, the BS may repeatedly transmit the PDCCH according to pre-configured information through the RRC message, and the UE may repeatedly receive the PDCCH according to the pre-configured information through the RRC message.</p><p id="p-0467" num="0557">Method 1-2, a Method of Repeatedly Transmitting a Plurality of Pieces of Control Information Having Different DCI Formats and/or Payloads</p><p id="p-0468" num="0558">Method 1-2 is a method of repeatedly transmitting a plurality of pieces of control information having different DCI formats and/or payloads. The control information schedules repetitive transmission PDSCHs, and the number of PDSCH repetitive transmissions indicated by each pieces of the control information may be different. For example, while PDCCH #1 may indicate information scheduling {PDSCH #1, PDSCH #2, PDSCH #Y}, PDCCH #2 may indicate information scheduling {PDSCH #2, PDSCH #Y}, . . . , and PDCCH #X may indicate information scheduling {PDSCH Y}. The method of repeatedly transmitting the control information has an advantage of reducing a total of delay time required for control information and PDSCH repetitive transmission compared to method 1-1. On the other hand, in the method, since payloads of repeatedly transmitted control information may be different from each other, soft combining of the repeatedly transmitted control information is impossible, and thus reliability may be lower than that of method 1-1.</p><p id="p-0469" num="0559">In method 1-2, the UE may not need to know in advance the location of resources of control information to be repeatedly transmitted and the number of repetitive transmissions, and may independently decode and process each piece of the repeatedly transmitted control information. When the UE decodes a plurality of pieces of repeatedly transmitted control information scheduling the same PDSCH, only the first repeatedly transmitted control information may be processed and the other repeatedly transmitted control information from the second control information may be ignored. Alternatively, the BS may indicate in advance the location of resources of control information to be repeatedly transmitted and the number of repetitive transmissions, and an indication method may be the same as the method described in method 1-1.</p><p id="p-0470" num="0560">Method 1-3, a Method of Repeatedly Transmitting Each Piece of Plurality of Control Information Having Different DCI Formats and/or Payloads</p><p id="p-0471" num="0561">Method 1-3 is a method of repeatedly transmitting each piece of a plurality of control information having different DCI formats and/or payloads. At this time, each piece of repeatedly transmitted control information may have the same DCI format and payload. Since the plurality of pieces of control information in method 1-2 may not be soft-combined, it may have lower reliability than method 1-1, and method 1-1 may have a longer total delay time required for control information and PDSCH repetitive transmission. Method 1-3 is a method that makes use of the advantages of method 1-1 and method 1-2, and may transmit control information with higher reliability compared to method 1-2 while reducing the total delay time required for control information and PDSCH repetitive transmission compared to method 1-1.</p><p id="p-0472" num="0562">In order to decode and soft-combine repeatedly transmitted control information, method 1-3 may use soft combining of method 1-1 and individual decoding of method 1-2. For example, in repetitive transmission of a plurality of pieces of control information having different DCI formats and/or payload, the first transmitted control information may be decoded through method 1-2 and repetitive transmission of the decoded control information may be soft-combined through method 1-1.</p><p id="p-0473" num="0563">Meanwhile, the BS may select and configure one of method 1-1, method 1-2, or method 1-3 for repetitive transmission of control information. The method of repeatedly transmitting control information may be explicitly indicated to the UE by the BS through higher-layer signaling. Alternatively, the method of repeatedly transmitting control information may be indicated after a combination with other configuration information. For example, a higher-layer configuration indicating the PDSCH repetitive transmission scheme may be combined with an indication of control information repetitive transmission. When repetitive transmission of the PDSCH in a frequency division multiplexing (FDM) scheme is indicated, control information may be repeatedly transmitted only through method 1-1, and the reason thereof is that there is no effect of reduction in the delay time for PDSCH repetitive transmission in the FDM scheme by method 1-2. For a similar reason, when repetitive transmission of the PDSCH in an intra-slot time division multiplexing (TDM) scheme is indicated, control information may be repeatedly transmitted through method 1-1. On the other hand, when repetitive transmission of the PDSCH in an inter-slot TDM scheme is indicated, method 1-1, method 1-2, or method 1-3 for control information repetitive transmission may be selected through higher-layer signaling or L1 signaling.</p><p id="p-0474" num="0564">Meanwhile, the BS may explicitly indicate the unit of control information repetitive transmission to the UE through a configuration such as higher layer. Alternatively, the unit of control information repetitive transmission may be combined with other configuration information and indicated. For example, the higher-layer configuration indicating the PDSCH repetitive transmission scheme may be combined with the unit of control information repetitive transmission. When repetitive transmission of the PDSCH in the FDM scheme is indicated, control information may be repeatedly transmitted in the FDM or spatial domain multiplexing (SDM) scheme, and the reason thereof is that, if control information is repeatedly transmitted in the inter-slot TDM scheme, there is no effect of reduction in the delay time by the PDSCH repetitive transmission in the FDM scheme. For a similar reason, when repetitive transmission of the PDSCH in the intra-slot TDM scheme is indicated, control information may be repeatedly transmitted in the TDM, FDM or SDM scheme. On the other hand, when repetitive transmission of the PDSCH in the inter-slot TDM scheme is indicated, higher-layer signaling may be selected for repetitive transmission of control information in the inter-slot TDM scheme or the intra-slot TDM, FDM, or SDM scheme.</p><p id="p-0475" num="0565">Method 1-4, a Method of a PDCCH Transmission Scheme Applying Respective TCI States to Different CCEs within the Same PDCCH Candidates</p><p id="p-0476" num="0566">In order to improve reception performance of the PDCCH without PDCCH repetitive transmission, method 1-4 may perform transmission after applying different TCI states, meaning transmission from multiple TRPs to different CCEs within PDCCH candidates.

Different CCEs to which different TCI states are applied may be separated in a time or frequency dimension, and the UE needs to know in advance the location of resources to which different TCI states are applied.

A UE capability reporting method will now be described.</p><p id="p-0480" num="0570">UE capability report method 1, a UE may report, to a BS, only on whether soft combining is possible during PDCCH repetition transmission in the form of possibility or impossibility via a UE capability.</p><p id="p-0481" num="0571">For example, if the UE has reported information that soft combining is possible during PDCCH repetition transmission to the BS via the UE capability, the BS may determine whether soft combining of the UE is possible as the most flexible degree (for example, determine that the UE can perform soft combining at a log likelihood ratio (LLR) level), and notify the UE of PDCCH repetition transmission-related configuration as flexibly as possible at the time of PDCCH transmission-related configuration. As an example related to PDCCH repetition configuration, the BS may assume that the UE can perform soft combining between control resource sets or search spaces having different configurations, soft combining between PDCCH candidates in the same aggregation level, or soft combining between PDCCH candidates between different aggregation levels, and notify the UE of the corresponding configuration.</p><p id="p-0482" num="0572">For another example, if the UE has reported information that soft combining is possible during PDCCH repetition transmission to the BS via the UE capability, the BS may most conservatively determine a level at which the UE can perform soft combining (for example, determine that the UE can perform soft combining at an OFDM symbol level), and most restrictively notify the UE of PDCCH repetition transmission-related configuration at the time of PDCCH transmission-related configuration. As an example related to PDCCH repetition configuration, the BS may assume that the UE can perform soft combining between multiple control resource sets having the same configuration or soft combining between PDCCH candidates having the same aggregation level, and notify the UE of the corresponding configuration.</p><p id="p-0483" num="0573">UE capability report method 2, in order to express an operation of soft combining which can be performed in a UE as a UE capability in more detail compared to the UE capability report method 1 described above, the UE may report, as a UE capability, levels divided with respect to the degree of possibility of soft combining during PDCCH repetition transmission to a BS. That is, among the respective signal levels generated from reception operation processes of the UE, the UE may identify a signal level at which soft combining can be applied with respect to PDCCH repetition transmission, and the UE may report such information to the BS as the UE capability. For example, the UE may inform that soft combining is possible at an OFDM symbol level, as a signal level at which soft combining can be applied, may inform that soft combining is possible at a modulation symbol level, and may inform that soft combining is possible at an LLR level. According to each signal level reported by the UE, the BS may notify the UE of an appropriate configuration such that the UE can perform soft combining, according to the reported UE capability.</p><p id="p-0484" num="0574">UE capability report method 3, a UE may transmit, via a UE capability, restrictions necessary for allowing soft combining to be possible at the UE side during PDCCH repetition transmission to a BS. For example, the UE may report, to the BS, that configurations of respective control resource sets including two repeated PDCCHs are required to be the same. In addition, the UE may report, to the BS, that two repeated PDCCH candidates are required to at least have the same aggregation level.</p><p id="p-0485" num="0575">UE capability report method 4, when a UE receives PDCCH repetition transmission from a BS, the UE may report supported a PDCCH repetition transmission scheme, via a UE capability. For example, the UE may report information about supporting the method 1-5 (an SFN transmission scheme) to the BS. For another example, the UE may report, to the BS, information about supporting an intra-slot TDM, inter-slot TDM, or FDM scheme of the method 1-1 (a method for repeatedly transmitting a plurality of PDCCHs having the same payload). In particular, in the case of TDM, the UE may report the maximum value (or, minimum value) of a time interval between two repeated PDCCHs to the BS. For example, if the UE has reported the maximum value of the time interval between the two repeated PDCCHs as 4 OFDM symbols, in the case of performing TDM-based PDCCH repetition transmission to the UE, based on the corresponding information, the BS may be required to adjust the time interval between the two repeated PDCCHs to 4 OFDM symbols or less.</p><p id="p-0486" num="0576">UE capability report method 5, when receiving PDCCH repetitive transmission from the BW, the UE may report the number of blind decodings to the BS through a UE capability. For example, the UE may report the number of blind decodings consumed during reception of the PDCCH repetitive transmission to the BS as 1, 2, or 3 regardless of a UE reception method (for example, individual decoding, soft combining, other reception methods, or a combination thereof). When the UE receives PDCCH repetitive transmission, the BS may assume that the UE consumes the number of reported blind decodings and transmit a configuration for searches and control resource sets that do not exceed the number of blind decodings which can be maximally used by the UE within the slot or span to the UE.</p><p id="p-0487" num="0577">The above-described UE capability report methods can be configured in combinations of two or more in actual application. For example, the UE may report that soft combining is possible at an LLR level by the UE capability report method 2 and report that two repeated PDCCH candidates are required to have the same aggregation level by the UE capability report method 3, and support PDCCH repetition transmission TDMed by the UE capability report method 4, but report the maximum value of a time interval between two repeated PDCCHs as 4 OFDM symbols.

When a BS performs PDCCH repetition transmission to a UE, based on the method 1-1 (a method for repeatedly transmitting a plurality of PDCCHs having the same payload) among various PDCCH repetition transmission methods described above, the BS may configure and indicate, to the UE, information indicating that an explicit connection (linkage or association) is established between repeated PDCCH candidates, so as to reduce the number of blind decodings based on whether soft combining of the UE is possible. The information indicating that an explicit connection (linkage or association) is established between repeated PDCCH candidates may be configured via higher layer signaling, indicated via L1 signaling, or configured and indicated via a combination of higher layer signaling and L1 signaling. In more detail, various linkage methods may exist as follows.</p><p id="p-0489" num="0579">There may be various methods for configuring PDCCH repetitive transmission and explicit linkage via higher layer signaling as follows.</p><p id="p-0490" num="0580">PDCCH repetition configuration method 1, when configuration information exists in higher layer signaling PDCCH-config</p><p id="p-0491" num="0581">A BS may transmit, to a UE, configuration information (e.g., a PDCCH-repetition-config) in a PDCCH-config, which is higher layer signaling (e.g., an RRC), in order to configure PDCCH repetition transmission and explicit linkage-related configuration.

In this case, in the configured control resource set, one or more of a plurality of different TCI states may be configured via higher layer signaling, indicated via L1 signaling or MAC-CE signaling, or configured and indicated via a combination of higher layer signaling and L1 signaling or MAC-CE signaling. In addition, if the PDCCH repetition transmission scheme is configured as the SFN, the UE may not expect that a search space index is configured in the control resource set-search space combination to be used during PDCCH repetition transmission.</p><p id="p-0494" num="0591">For another example, the PDCCH repetition transmission scheme may be configured as a TDM or FDM scheme, and a total of two control resource set-search space combinations to be used during PDCCH repetition transmission may be configured. For example, control resource set index 1 and search space index 1 may be configured for the first combination, and control resource set index 2 and search space index 2 may be configured for the second combination. In this case, the UE may expect that a PDCCH is to be repeatedly transmitted in a TDM or FDM scheme via the method 1-1 by using two control resource set-search space combinations. In this case, in each of configured control resource sets, a plurality of TCI states which are the same or different from each other may be configured via higher layer signaling, indicated via L1 signaling or MAC-CE signaling, or configured and indicated via a combination of higher layer signaling and L1 signaling or MAC-CE signaling. In addition, if the PDCCH repetition transmission scheme is configured as TDM or FDM, the UE may expect that up to two control resource set-search space combinations to be used during PDCCH repetition transmission are configured, and expect that both a control resource set index and a search space index are configured in each combination.</p><p id="p-0495" num="0592">Additionally, a value of at least one of the five pieces of information may be updated based on MAC-CE without RRC reconfiguration. If the BS does not configure the PDCCH-repetition-config for the UE, the UE does not expect the PDCCH to be repeatedly transmitted, and only a single PDCCH transmission can be expected. All of the above-described aggregation level, PDCCH candidate index, and frequency resources for explicit linkage may not be configured, or at least one may be configured according to an explicit linkage method to be described later.</p><p id="p-0496" num="0593">PDCCH repetition configuration method 2, when configuration information exists in higher layer signaling (e.g., RRC) for a search space</p><p id="p-0497" num="0594">A BS may add a higher layer signaling parameter in a searchSpace information element (IE), which is higher layer signaling for a search space, to configure PDCCH repetition transmission, and notify a UE of the same.

For example, a search space in which repetition is configured to be on may be one or two. For example, if, in the searchSpace IE, which is higher layer signaling for search space index 1, searchSpaceId is configured to be 1, controlResourceSetId is configured to be 1, and repetition is configured to be on, the UE may expect that PDCCH repetition transmission is performed according to the method 1-5 (an SFN transmission method) in control resource set 1 linked to search space 1.</p><p id="p-0498" num="0595">As another example, if in searchSpace IE, which is higher layer signaling for search space index 1, searchSpaceId is configured to be 1, controlResourceSetId is configured to be 1, and repetition is configured to be on, and in searchSpace IE, which is higher layer signaling for search space index 2, searchSpaceId is configured to be 2, controlResourceSetId is configured to be 2, and repetition is configured to be on, the UE may identify that PDCCH repetition transmission is performed by TDM or FDM by using the method 1-1 between a combination of control resource set 1 and search space 1, and a combination of control resource set 2 and search space 2. TDM and FDM may be divided according to time and frequency configurations via higher layer signaling of control resource sets 1 and 2 and search spaces 1 and 2. In addition, in higher layer signaling for the search space in which repetition is configured to be on, an aggregation level or PDCCH candidate indexes for explicit linkage specified in the PDCCH repetition configuration method 1 may be configured, both of the aggregation level and PDCCH candidate indexes may not be configured, only one of them may be configured, or both of them may be configured according to an explicit linkage method to be described later.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Embodiment 4: Multi-TRP-Based PDSCH SFN Transmission Method</heading><p id="p-0499" num="0596">As an embodiment of the disclosure, an indication and configuration method of the BS through a combination of L1 signaling and higher-layer signaling for multi-TRP-based PDSCH SFN transmission and a reception method of the UE are described.
