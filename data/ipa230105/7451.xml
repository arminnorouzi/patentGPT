However, beacons do not typically judge which user or phone is closest to a beacon and they are not generally triggered but are rather configured for continuously transmitting.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">U.S. Pat. No. 9,733,808B2 describes a sensor device that upon a trigger sends its unique device ID to a server, which decides what happens based on the device ID. The message that the sensor device sends only contains the device ID.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Proximity sensors, e.g. disclosed in US20140073262A1, may trigger alarms based on the sensors signal strength, but these sensors are always connected to a phone.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Common smart button solutions may be enough when there is only one user of a button or when a button is configured to control a third device such as a connected light bulb. When the button is pushed, the button informs so to whichever device it is connected to, but the system doesn't know who pushed the button or which mobile communication device is closest to the button.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Certain aspects of the present disclosure advantageously alleviate the problems described above by introducing a solution that allows a simple way for interacting with mobile telecommunications related services in response to trigger events such as a button press or when a sensor or detector of the sensor device obtains a pre-defined threshold value.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The technology disclosed relates to methods, a sensor device, a communication node and a system for providing a user associated with a mobile communication device with information by determining which user is closest to the sensor device at least partly based on at least one of the determined signal strength of a broadcast signal and a distance measurement by means of phase of a plurality of broadcast signals having different frequencies received by the mobile communication device of the user determined to be closest to the sensor device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In embodiments, the technology disclosed relates to methods, a sensor device, a communication node and a system for determining which mobile communication device, and associated user, is currently closest to a sensor device at least partly based on at least one of a determined signal strength of a broadcast signal/message transmitted by the sensor device and/or at least partly based on distance measurements by means of phase using a plurality of broadcast signals/messages having different frequencies received from the sensor device, and which is/are received by a plurality of mobile communication devices.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In embodiments, the technology disclosed relates methods, a sensor device, a communication node and a system for collecting signal strengths of signals or messages transmitted in response to a trigger event and then comparing these signals strength values with at least one of other signal strength values or a pre-defined signal strength threshold value to determine which mobile communication device, and/or associated user, is closest to the sensor device.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In embodiments, the technology disclosed relates methods, a sensor device, a communication node and a system for determining distances by measurements by means of phase using a plurality of broadcast signals where the plurality of broadcast signals are transmitted by the sensor device in response to a trigger event.

Several of the aspects and embodiments may be combined together to form a further embodiment of the present disclosure. A system, a method, a sensor device, or a communication node which is an aspect of the present disclosure may comprise at least one of the embodiments of the present disclosure described above.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0287">A sensor device is herein defined as a device comprising at least one of an input means (e.g. a button), a temperature sensor, an accelerometer, a motion sensor, a gyro, a microphone, a potentiometer, a pressure sensor and a sensor for measuring the concentration of particles in media. The sensor device according to the technology disclosed comprises input means such as a touch-sensitive button and/or may be configured to at least one of measuring, detecting or recording at least one parameter related to at least one of temperature, pressure, luminance, particles in medium, movement and acceleration.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0288">In wireless communications, particularly in radio frequency, signal strength (also referred to as field strength) refers to the transmitter power output as received by a reference antenna at a distance from the transmitting antenna. High-powered transmissions, such as those used in broadcasting, are expressed in dB-millivolts per metre (dBmV/m). For very low-power systems, such as mobile phones, signal strength is usually expressed in dB-microvolts per metre (dB&#x3bc;V/m) or in decibels above a reference level of one milliwatt (dBm). In broadcasting terminology, 1 mV/m is 1000 &#x3bc;V/m or 60 dB&#x3bc;. (often written dBu).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0289">In embodiments of the technology disclosed, distance measurements by means of phase which are performed by the mobile communication devices are used for determining which mobile communication device is closest to the sensor device.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0290">In certain embodiments, a distance measurement by means of phase is used in a scheme to locate a transmitter. The system typically consists of three antennas. There is a transmitter in the sensor device, that in a sense acts as a target, in terms of radar concepts. Two receivers in the mobile communication device are used to determine the distance needed to find the position of the transmitter, i.e. the position of the sensor device.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0291">A simpler way to measure distance according to certain embodiments of the technology disclosed is to calculate the phase shift between the received signal and the transmitted signal. The set-up considered here is not a typical radar since the target is replaced by a transmitter. In wave motion, the phase increases in the direction of propagation. Phase shifts are often measured in degrees. Frequency and phase evaluation results are combined to reach the aspired accuracy in the m range. Consequently, after the coarse detection using the frequency a correction of the estimated position is accomplished by the evaluated phase information within the unambiguous range. The important entity is the phase difference between the reference and the received wave/signal. In certain embodiments, the phase method may to some degree be combined with a Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) measurement.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0292">FMCW radar (Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave radar=FMCW radar) is a special type of radar sensor which radiates continuous transmission power like a simple continuous wave radar (CW-Radar). In contrast to this CW radar FMCW radar can change its operating frequency during the measurement: that is, the transmission signal is modulated in frequency (or in phase). Possibilities of Radar measurements through runtime measurements are only technically possible with these changes in the frequency (or phase).</p><p id="p-0118" num="0293">Simple continuous wave radar devices without frequency modulation have the disadvantage that it cannot determine target range because it lacks the timing mark necessary to allow the system to time accurately the transmit and receive cycle and to convert this into range. Such a time reference for measuring the distance of stationary objects but can be generated using of frequency modulation of the transmitted signal. In this method, a signal is transmitted, which increases or decreases in the frequency periodically.
