Specifically, the invention is related to an improved knotless anchor assembly and method of securing tissue, ligaments, sutures, grafts, allografts, membrane, gap fillers, tension members or bone to bone in stabilization procedures.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Tendon, ligament and joint capsular injuries account for 45% of the orthopedic injuries which seek medical attention (Pennisi, 2002). Tendon injuries alone effect 30 million people annually (Wong, 2003), resulting in an enormous amount of physical and financial burden to both the individuals and the economy. Most of the affected people are treated with surgical repair or reconstruction to avoid long-term disability and pain relief Tears can be primary and related to an injury or secondary and related to a re-tear after a primary repair or surgery. There has been an increased incidence of secondary tears and a large proportion of them may be avoided by using a better device to perform the procedure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Secondary or type 2 failure occurs where the tendon fails medially to the repair, close to the muscle tendon attachment (Cho et al., 2011; Christoforetti et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2016; Kullar et al., 2015; Virk et al., 2017; Cho et al., 2010). Secondary medial cuff failure near the muscle tendon attachment after repair (type 2 failure) has been associated with the placement of knots and abrasive suture materials near the muscle tendon attachment, thus, potentially resulting in acute or chronic subacromial knot impingement, medial row stress concentration, tendon strangulation, and/or suture cut-out in this area (Cho et al., 2011; Christoforetti et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2016; Kullar et al., 2015; Virk et al., 2017). When failure occurs, the tendon/muscle is found to be torn medial to the previous repair site of the cuff tendon insertion (Cho et al., 2011; Christoforetti et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2016; Kullar et al., 2015; Virk et al., 2017).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Studies suggest that primary prevention can address secondary type 2 re-tears, and techniques such as utilizing knotless, linked and bridging constructs have been developed to prevent tissue strangulation and improve force distribution (Mazzocca et al., 2005; Denard et al., 2012). The use of tapes with these knotless repairs also decreases the compressive stress per unit area of tendon (Park et al., 2013; Vaishnav et al., 2010). The lack of knots avoids the possibility of acute or chronic postoperative knot impingement within the subacromial space (Yamakado et al., 2010), decreases operative time (Bukhart et al., 2009) and improves efficiency (Park, 2013; Park et al., 2014). Studies also suggest that rotator cuff tears that are repaired with a &#x201c;tension overload mechanism&#x201d; over a portion of the muscle-tendon units will undergo gradual failure with physiologic cyclic loading. Therefore, tendons should be repaired without tension if possible (Burkhart et al., 1997).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Several factors currently lead to an increased failure of repair. They are mainly a) knots causing impingement (Yamakado et al., 2010) and b) problems related to tensioning of repair, which can lead to strangulation of tissue causing necrosis over time, increased stresses on the anchoring device and failure with suture pulling out through tissue (Park, 2013; Park et al., 2014; Mazzocca et al., 2005; Denard et al., 2012).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Knotless anchors currently in the market only address knot related problems but continue to have other limitations whereby they either must be used in combination with another system, such as a secondary anchor, have limitation of the number of fibers passing through the anchor and continue to have major challenges related to tissue tensioning. These deficiencies hinder the surgeon's ability to adjust tissue tension at the time of repair or readjust once the repair is complete. This leads to under tensioning and failure due to gap formation or over-tensioning of the repair and failure at repair site, strangulation of blood supply to the tissue and re-tear. Thus, a need exists for a knotless anchor assembly that doesn't require a secondary anchor and allows for tension adjustment at the time of repair.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Knotless assemblies that secure bone and tissue fragments can lose tension or over tension before the assemblies can lock or at the time of locking resulting in inefficient placement of the assembly during surgical procedures. The presently disclosed invention is a method and device comprising an anchor and a compression member, wherein the anchor further comprises a first end, second end and anchor body. During procedures to tension the knotless anchor assembly, the anchor is driven into bone, and the tension member is urged into the anchor body recess. The compression member is secured to the anchor body to lock the tension member in place. The knotless anchor assembly gives the surgeon or user the ability to optimize tensioning by having the ability to change tension in the tension member(s) by adjusting the compression member and does not require the use of an additional system, such as a secondary anchor.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further advantages of the invention will become apparent by reference to the detailed description of preferred embodiments when considered in conjunction with the drawings:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> depict a perspective views of the first embodiment of the knotless anchor assembly.

For purposes of explanation, specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required to practice the invention. Descriptions of specific applications are provided only as representative examples. Various modifications to the preferred embodiments will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the scope of the invention. The present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown, but is to be accorded the widest possible scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Knotless anchors in the prior art hinder surgeons' ability to adjust tissue tension at the time of repair or readjust once the repair is complete resulting in under tensioning and failure due to gap formation or over-tensioning of the repair and failure at repair site, strangulation of blood supply to the tissue and re-tear. The knotless anchor assembly disclosed herein <b>32</b> allows the surgeon to adjust the repair tension based on the tissue biology of the tendon and, hence, optimizes the mechanical construct of the repair by providing a stable tension free repair. This reduces failures of repair due to inappropriate soft tissue tensioning. Further, surgical cost will be reduced due to decreasing the number of devices needed for the procedure, as the knotless anchor assembly <b>32</b> can be used independently and does not require other systems or anchors. The knotless anchor assembly <b>32</b> allows more sutures to pass through the anchor body and reduces the operative time since it eliminates the need for knot tying.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Additionally, the knotless anchor assembly can be used as a self-tapping anchor and can have multiple threaded components to increase the pull-out force. Several embodiments allow the surgeon or user performing the procedure to modify the repair during or after implanting the anchor body in the bone by adding more tension members and changing the size of the compression member, if required.
