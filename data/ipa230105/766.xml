No. 16/309,787, filed 12 Dec. 2018, which is the &#xa7; 371 U.S. National Stage of International Application No. PCT/IB2017/053710, filed 21 Jun. 2017, which claims the benefit of European Application No. 16177156.3, filed 30 Jun. 2016, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to nicotine particles that are suitable for inhalation. The nicotine particles are formed by spray drying followed by milling.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Dry powder inhalers (DPI) are known and are used to treat respiratory diseases by delivering a dry powder comprising a pharmaceutically active compound, in aerosol form through inhalation to the patients' airways. In pharmaceutical dry powders, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is usually agglomerated on the surface of larger carrier particles, such as lactose for example. DPI's operate complex mechanisms to ensure such agglomerates disperse, break up or disaggregate before the API is inhaled into the lungs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It may be difficult to deliver nicotine particles to the lungs at inhalation at air flow rates that are within conventional smoking regime inhalation or air flow rates. Nicotine particles may have a tendency to agglomerate and stick to inhaler or processing surfaces, especially as a size of the nicotine particle deceases. Nicotine particles with an MMAD of less than about 10 micrometres tend to be increasingly thermodynamically unstable due to a high surface area to volume ratio, which provides an increasing surface free energy with this decreasing particle size, and consequently increases the tendency of particles to agglomerate and the strength of the agglomerate. Forming nicotine particles may be difficult and costly.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Nicotine particles may be irritating when inhaled and may induce a cough reflex. Cough suppressants such as menthol have been added to nicotine particle compositions. These cough suppressants may have a tendency to agglomerate the nicotine particles and cause stickiness of the composition. This may lead to handling and storage concerns of the nicotine particle compositions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It would be desirable to provide nicotine particles that may reduce or mitigate a cough reflex when inhaled and provide an enhanced inhalation experience. It would be desirable that the nicotine particles be formed and processed easily and exhibit a stable particle size distribution. It may be desirable that the nicotine particles be free of a cough suppressant material.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Nicotine particles may be formed by spray drying a liquid mixture to form a first plurality of particles. The liquid mixture comprises nicotine. The liquid mixture may also comprise a sugar, or an amino acid, or both a sugar and amino acid. The liquid mixture may comprise a short peptide comprising 2 or 3 amino acid. The first plurality of particles is then milled to form a second plurality of particles.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The second plurality of nicotine particles may have a particle size distribution where about 90% the plurality of particles have a particle size of less than about 2.8 micrometres, and about 50% of the plurality of particles have a particle size of less than about 1.35 micrometres, and about 10% of the second plurality of particles having a particle size of less than about 0.65 micrometres.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably the milling step is performed with a fluid energy mill. The fluid energy mill may decrease an average particle size or mass median aerodynamic diameter of the nicotine particles.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Advantageously, the method described herein utilizes a spray dryer to provide homogenous nicotine particles that can be further reduced in size with a fluid energy mill to achieve a specific and controlled particle size distribution. This method advantageously maximizes product yield in a cost effective manner. The final size distribution of the second plurality of nicotine particles may be stable over time and form a flowable composition. The final size distribution of the second plurality of nicotine particles is sufficient to deliver nicotine to the lungs at inhalation or air flow rates that are within conventional smoking regime inhalation or air flow rates, to provide an enhanced inhalation experience.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The term &#x201c;nicotine&#x201d; refers to nicotine and nicotine derivatives in any form, including but not limited to, a free-base nicotine, nicotine salt, or in a matrix such as a sugar matrix or organometallic complex.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The term &#x201c;amino acid&#x201d; refers to a single unmodified or modified amino acid moiety, preferably unmodified.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The term &#x201c;short peptide&#x201d; refers to a peptide comprising two or three amino acids.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The phrase &#x201c;fluid energy milling&#x201d; refers to particle size reduction by colliding particle streams. Fluid energy milling includes air jet milling or jet milling.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The phrase &#x201c;plurality of particles&#x201d; unless otherwise specified, means the first plurality of particles, the second plurality of particles, or both the first and the second plurality of particles.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The size of a particle, stated herein, preferably refers to the aerodynamic diameter of the particle. The aerodynamic diameter of a powder system is preferably measured with a cascade impactor. The term &#x201c;MMAD&#x201d; refers to the mass median aerodynamic diameter.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">This disclosure relates to nicotine particles that are suitable for inhalation and methods for forming the same. These nicotine particles may provide for gentle or smooth inhalation without inducing or minimizing a cough reflex. The nicotine particles may be formed by spray drying a liquid mixture to form a first plurality of particles. The liquid mixture comprises nicotine. The liquid mixture may also comprise a sugar, or an amino acid, or both a sugar and amino acid. Spray drying the liquid mixture may form a homogenous first plurality of particles. The first plurality of particles may then be milled (preferably with a fluid energy mill) to form a second plurality of particles having a size distribution that is reduced as compared to the size distribution of the first plurality of particles. The second plurality of nicotine particles may have a particle size distribution where about 90% (by volume) of the plurality of particles have a particle size of less than about 2.8 micrometres, and about 50% of the plurality of particles have a particle size of less than about 1.35 micrometres, and about 10% of the second plurality of particles having a particle size of less than about 0.65 micrometres. The percentages relating to particle size distribution described herein are based on particle volume (% by volume). A dry powder composition may be formed form these nicotine particles. An inhalation delivery consumable element may contain the nicotine particles or dry powder composition described herein.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The combination of spray drying followed by milling (preferably fluid energy milling) advantageously provides nicotine particles that may be flowable, have a specific, controlled and stable particle size distribution and provide an enhanced inhalation experience. Spray drying forms a first plurality of particles having a first size distribution. Advantageously, milling or fluid energy milling decreases an average particle size of the particles. Milling or fluid energy milling utilizes the first plurality of particles and forms a second plurality of particles having a second size distribution. The second size distribution is preferably reduced as compared to the first size distribution.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The nicotine may be dissolved in the liquid carrier to form the liquid mixture. Sugar may be dissolved in the liquid carrier to form the liquid mixture. An amino acid may be dissolved in the liquid carrier to form the liquid mixture. A short peptide may be dissolved in the liquid carrier to form the liquid mixture.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Spray drying utilizes a spray or atomization nozzle to atomize a liquid mixture (under pressure) and evaporate liquid carrier from the liquid mixture. The resulting dry particles may be spheroid shaped within a designed particle size distribution.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Fluid energy milling is a size reduction unit operation that utilizes colliding fluid streams (for example gas or compressed gas or air) carrying particles. The colliding fluid streams provide particle to particle impact to facilitate size reduction. There are generally no moving parts in a fluid energy mill and generally no mechanical forces act on the particles during size reduction.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Fluid energy or jet mills are typically capable of reducing solids to particle sizes in the low-micron to submicron range. The size reduction energy is typically created by gas streams from horizontal grinding air nozzles. Typically, particles in the fluidized bed created by the gas streams are accelerated towards the center of the mill, colliding with slower moving particles or particles moving in a different direction. The gas streams and the particles carried in them typically create a violent turbulence and as the particles collide with one another they are reduced in size.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The second plurality of particles may be formed by fluid energy milling or colliding air streams with entrained nicotine particles. Preferably, the particle compositions of colliding air streams are substantially similar and homogenous. Fluid energy milling may increase the amount of respirable nicotine particles (particles able to reach the lungs) as compared to spray dried only nicotine particles. Fluid energy milling may increase this amount by at least about 10% or at least about 20% or at least 30%.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The fluid energy milling step may reduce the particle size or average particle size or particle size distribution by about 10% or greater, or about 20% or greater. Larger particles may be reduced a greater amount than smaller particles in the same size distribution. For example the 90% size threshold may be reduced (from the first size distribution 90% threshold to the second size distribution 90% threshold) by about 10% or greater, or about 20% or greater, or about 30% or greater, or in a range from about 10% to about 40%, or from about 20% to about 40%.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The fluid energy milling step may reduce the mass median aerodynamic diameter of the first plurality of particles to a mass median aerodynamic diameter of the second plurality of particles by a ratio of about 1.1:1 to about 10:1, or about 1.2:1 to about 5:1, or about 1.2:1 to about 3.6:1, or about 1.5:1 to about 3:1, or about 3:1, or about 2:1.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferably, the ratio of the mass median aerodynamic diameter of the first plurality of particles to the mass median aerodynamic diameter of the second plurality of particles is between about 1.1:1 to about 10:1, or about 1.2:1 to about 5:1, or about 1.2:1 to about 3.6:1, or about 1.5:1 to about 3:1, or about 3:1, or about 2:1.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The first plurality of particles may comprise about 90%, or about 95%, or about 98% of particles having an aerodynamic diameter of about 4.5 micrometres or less. The first plurality of particles may comprise at least about 50% of particles having an aerodynamic diameter of about 2.5 micrometres or less. The first plurality of particles may comprise at least about 10% of particles having an aerodynamic diameter of about 0.85 micrometres or less. The first plurality of particles may have a mass median aerodynamic diameter in a range from about 1 to about 4 micrometres. Substantially all of the first plurality of particles may have an aerodynamic diameter in a range from about 500 nanometers to about 5 micrometres.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Fluid energy milling reduces the size of the first plurality of particles to form a second plurality of particles. The second plurality of particles may comprise at least about 90%, or about 95%, or about 98% of particles having an aerodynamic diameter of about 3 micrometres or less, or 2.8 micrometres or less. The second plurality of particles may comprise at least about 50% of particles having an aerodynamic diameter of about 1.5 micrometres or less, or 1.35 micrometres or less. The second plurality of particles may comprise at least about 10% of particles having an aerodynamic diameter of about 0.7 micrometres or less, or 0.65 micrometres or less. The second plurality of particles may have a mass median aerodynamic diameter in a range from about 1 to about 2.5 micrometres.

The spray drying atomization pressure may be in a range from about 3 to about 7 bar, or 4 to about 6 bar, or about 5 bar.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The spray drying inlet temperature may be about 140 degrees Celsius or less, or about 135 degrees Celsius or less, or about 130 degrees Celsius or less, or in a range from about 100 to about 150 degrees Celsius, or in a range from about 110 to about 140 degrees Celsius, or in a range from about 125 to about 135 degrees Celsius. The spray drying outlet temperature may be about 100 degrees Celsius or less, or about 95 degrees Celsius or less, or about 90 degrees Celsius or less, about 85 degrees Celsius or less, or about 80 degrees Celsius or less, or in a range from about 30 to about 90 degrees Celsius, or in a range from about 40 to about 90 degrees Celsius, or in a range from about 50 to about 85 degrees Celsius.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The second plurality of particles may be formed by fluid energy milling the first plurality of particles formed by the spray drying unit operation. The first plurality of particles may be processed with a fluid energy mill by colliding the first plurality of particles with each other to form the second plurality of particles or particles.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The first plurality of particles (formed by the spray drying process) may be fluid energy milled at a temperature of about 50 degrees Celsius or less, or about 40 degrees Celsius or less, or about 30 degrees Celsius or less, about 20 degrees Celsius or less, or about 10 degrees Celsius or less, or in a range from about &#x2212;20 to about 40 degrees Celsius, or in a range from about &#x2212;10 to about 30 degrees Celsius, or in a range from about 0 to about 30 degrees Celsius.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The reduction in particle size by fluid energy milling may be increased by fluid energy milling at lower temperatures. The particles may tend to be more brittle at lower temperatures, and may therefore fracture more readily so that the milled particles tend to be smaller at lower temperatures. The first plurality of particles (formed by the spray drying process) may be fluid energy milled at a temperature below room temperature, preferably at a temperature below about 20 degrees Celsius, or below about 10 degrees Celsius, or below about 0 degrees Celsius.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Fluid energy milling may be carried out at milling or grinding pressures between about 0.1 and about 12 bar. Varying the pressure allows control over the amount of particle size reduction. The milling pressure may be in a range from about 1 to about 7 bar, or about 2 to about 6 bar, or about 3 to about 5 bar, or about 4 bar. Particle feed pressure may be greater than the milling pressure. Feed pressure may be in a range from about 5 to about 13 bar, or about 5 to about 10 bar, or about 6 to about 8 bar, or about 7 bar.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Fluid energy milling may be carried out in two or more stages, to combine the beneficial effects of the milling at different pressures. The use of multiple steps may allow one to tailor the properties of the fluid energy milled particles to suit a particular inhaler device or to target particular parts of the lung.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">An additive material can be combined with the first plurality of particles and processed in the fluid energy mill. Combining an additive material with the first plurality of particles may be termed &#x201c;co-jet or co-fluid energy&#x201d; milling. The additive may coat the particles, depending on the milling pressure.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The fluid energy mill may be any useful type of fluid energy mill. Useful fluid energy mills include, for example, an Atritor M3 Spiral jet mill, a AS50 Spiral jet mill, a MC50 Hosakawa Microniser, other spiral jet mills, pancake jet mills or opposed fluid bed jet mills. The feed rate for the fluid energy mill will depend on the size of the mill. Small spiral jet mills may use a feed rate of, for example, about 1 to about 4 g per minute, whilst industrial scale mills will have a feed rate in the order of kilograms per hour. Examples below utilize the Atritor M3 Spiral jet mill. This fluid energy mill provided at greater than about 90% product yield or less than about a 10% product loss.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The properties of the fluid jet milled particles may, to an extent, be tailored or adjusted by making changes to the fluid jet milling unit operation. For example, the degree of particle size reduction may be adjusted by changing the number of jets which are used in the fluid jet mill, or by adjusting their orientation, that is, the angles at which they are positioned.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">All scientific and technical terms used herein have meanings commonly used in the art unless otherwise specified.
