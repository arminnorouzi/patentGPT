Relevant statistical organizations forecast that the inventory of smartphones will exceed 6 billion by 2020, and the average use time of smartphones will exceed 5 hours. With development of electronic device technologies and improvement of performance of hardware such as a system on chip (system on chip, SoC) and a display of a smartphone, high-quality mobile games emerge one after another. However, a user is quite less entertained by a game with excellent images when watching the game image on a small display of a mobile phone. Although a large-screen device such as a smart television can display game images in a large size, it is difficult for a player to play a game by touching the large-screen device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although an image displayed on a smartphone can be projected to a display of the smart television by using a projection technology to implement image linkage and synchronization between the smartphone and the smart television, when a game needs to be controlled, the player still needs to observe a display of the smartphone to calibrate a location of a finger touch. Therefore, during the game, the player cannot focus on the game images on the smart television, and has poor immersive experience in the game.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, solutions for playing an electronic game on a smart television are as follows:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">(1) Hardware, for example, a physical game joypad or a hover touch sensor, is introduced to implement head-up interaction. However, this solution is costly. In addition, the physical game joypad has poor universality. The user needs to change an operation habit. This means poor operation convenience. When the hover touch sensor is operated by the user, a hover event and a touch event simultaneously occur, causing poor reactions and a higher false touch rate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">(2) A virtual game joypad application is run on a mobile phone. A display of the mobile phone gives no tactile feedback. Therefore, to complete an operation, the user still needs to switch viewing angles between a television and the mobile phone back and forth, resulting in poor immersive experience in a game.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, according to existing solutions, it is difficult for a user to implement head-up interaction with good operation experience and better immersive experience at a low cost.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of this application provide a human-computer interaction method and a device, to quickly and accurately operate an application in absence of visual feedback.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a first aspect, a human-computer interaction method is provided. The method is executed by a first computer device. The first computer device is communicatively connected to a second computer device. The first computer device runs an application, and displays a first image of the application. The second computer device displays a second image of the application. Both the first image and the second image have one or more functional areas. The functional areas in the first image one-to-one correspond to the functional areas in the second image. The method includes: The first computer device receives a first touch operation performed on the first image, where the first touch operation is directly performed on an area outside a first functional area, and the first functional area is a functional area in the first image; and the first computer device generates, based on the first touch operation, a second touch operation directly performed on the first functional area, generates image data in response to the second touch operation, and sends the generated image data to the second computer device, so that the second computer device updates the second image based on the image data.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In other words, in the method provided in the first aspect, a computer device can convert a touch operation not directly performed on a functional area into a touch operation directly performed on the functional area, so that the computer device can be triggered to execute a corresponding function of the functional area, to generate image data. The image data may be used for updating an image displayed on another computer device. Therefore, when viewing the image displayed on the another computer device, a user can quickly and accurately operate an application on a portable device. This improves operation experience of head-up interaction.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some implementations, the first computer device is a portable device, for example, a mobile phone, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, or a game console. The second computer device is a large-screen device, for example, a smart television or a smart display. The large-screen device herein refers to a computer device whose display is larger than that of the portable device. A specific display size of the large-screen device is not limited in this application.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For ease of understanding, a scenario of interaction between the portable device and the large-screen device is used as an example for description in this application. However, the method in this application may also be applied to another scenario.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a possible implementation, the first image and the second image may be the same, or may be different. For example, if the application is a game application, the first image includes only functional areas for operations, and the second image includes a game content image and functional areas. The functional areas in the first image one-to-one correspond to the functional areas in the second image, but display styles do not need to be the same. For example, to better present game content, the functional area in the second image may be displayed as transparent, or the functional area is displayed only when a function of the functional area is triggered.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a possible implementation, there may be a plurality of functional areas. For example, the plurality of functional areas may be a plurality of independent areas. A shape of each area is not limited. Alternatively, the plurality of functional areas may be adjacently connected to each other. In another possible implementation, the functional area may alternatively be a continuous area. The area includes a plurality of functional units.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a possible implementation, the second touch operation is a touch operation whose start point is in the first functional area. The first touch operation is a touch operation whose start point is not in the first functional area.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a possible implementation, the first functional area includes one or more virtual keys. The touch operation directly performed on the first functional area refers to a touch operation (for example, pressing or sliding) directly performed on one or more of the one or more virtual keys. The touch operation not directly performed on the functional area is a touch operation other than the pressing operation. The virtual key herein includes but is not limited to a tap key, a double-tap key, a touch and hold key, a pressure-sensitive key, a key that supports another type of touch operation, or the like.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a possible implementation, the touch operation directly performed on the area outside the first functional area is an operation whose start touch point is located in the area outside the first functional area. For example, the touch operation is a tap operation whose tapping location is located in the area outside the first functional area. For another example, the touch operation is a slide operation that starts from the area outside the first functional area. Correspondingly, the second touch operation directly performed on the first functional area equals to or is equivalent to an operation whose start touch point is located in the first functional area.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In other words, in this implementation, the operation whose start touch point is located in the area outside the first functional area may be converted into the operation whose start touch point is located in the first functional area, so that the portable device can be triggered to execute one or more corresponding functions of the first functional area.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a possible implementation, the first image includes an auxiliary touch layer. The auxiliary touch layer is generated based on an image drawn and rendered by the application and a preset configuration file. The auxiliary touch layer has one or more auxiliary touch functional areas. The image drawn and rendered by the application has one or more functional areas. The auxiliary touch functional areas in the auxiliary touch layer one-to-one correspond to the functional areas in the image drawn and rendered by the application.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In other words, in this implementation, the portable device may display the auxiliary touch layer, so that the user quickly learns an operation manner in this embodiment of this application.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a possible implementation, the first image is synthesized at least based on the image drawn and rendered by the application and the auxiliary touch layer. The auxiliary touch layer is generated based on the image drawn and rendered by the application and the preset configuration file. The auxiliary touch layer has one or more auxiliary touch functional areas. The image drawn and rendered by the application has one or more functional areas. The auxiliary touch functional areas in the auxiliary touch layer one-to-one correspond to the functional areas in the image drawn and rendered by the application.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In other words, in this implementation, the portable device may display the image that is synthesized based on the auxiliary touch layer and the image drawn and rendered by the application, so that the user quickly learns the operation manner in this embodiment of this application.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a possible implementation, an initialization operation area may be set in the area outside the first functional area in the first image. The first touch operation is a slide operation that starts from the initialization operation area and that passes through or reaches the first functional area.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In other words, in this implementation, the portable device can be triggered, through a slide operation that starts from a specific area and passes through or reaches a functional area, to execute a function of the functional area. This reduces a misoperation and improves operation accuracy in absence of visual feedback.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a possible implementation, dwell time of the slide operation in the first functional area is greater than a dwell time threshold.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In other words, in this implementation, the portable device may determine, based on the dwell time of the slide operation in the functional area, whether to execute a function of the functional area. This can reduce a misoperation and improve operation accuracy in absence of visual feedback.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a possible implementation, a sliding speed of the slide operation in the first functional area is less than a sliding speed threshold.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In other words, in this implementation, the portable device may determine, based on the sliding speed of the slide operation in the functional area, whether to execute a function of the functional area. This can reduce a misoperation and improve operation accuracy in absence of visual feedback.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a possible implementation, a gesture operation area may be set in the area outside the first functional area in the first image. The first touch operation is a touch operation performed on the gesture operation area.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">This implementation may be specific to a case in which a distance between the first functional area and the gesture operation area is large (for example, greater than a distance threshold), and/or a size of the first functional area is small (less than a size threshold). Specifically, in this implementation, the portable device can be triggered, through an operation performed on a specific area, to execute a function of a long-distance small-sized functional area. Compared with a case that the portable device is triggered, through tapping on the long-distance small-sized functional area, to execute the function of the long-distance small-sized functional area, this case has higher operation accuracy and shorter operation time.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a possible implementation, a frequent operation area may be set in the first image based on historical touch operation data. The frequent operation area may be an area in which a quantity of touch operations is large (for example, greater than a specific threshold) in unit time, where the quantity of touch operations is obtained through calculation based on the historical touch operation data. It should be understood that the frequent operation area usually includes a functional area. An area that is in the frequent operation area and that is outside the functional area is a first area. The first touch operation is performed on the first area. A closeness degree of association between the first touch operation and the first functional area is greater than a closeness degree of association between the first touch operation and another functional area. The another functional area is a functional area, other than the first functional area, of the functional areas in the first image.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In other words, in this implementation, the portable device may determine a closeness degree of association between an operation performed on a specific area and each functional area, and execute a function of a functional area corresponding to a largest closeness degree of association. This can improve operation accuracy of the frequent operation functional area.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a possible implementation, a closeness degree of association between the first touch operation and the first functional area is positively correlated to a size of the first functional area and negatively correlated to a first distance. The first distance is a distance between a touch point of the first touch operation and the first functional area.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In other words, in this implementation, the closeness degree of association between the touch operation and the functional area may be determined based on the size of the functional area and the distance between the touch point of the touch operation and the functional area.

Therefore, the user can learn a touch position of a touch object (for example, a finger or a stylus) by viewing the image displayed on the large-screen device. Particularly, when the touch operation is the slide operation, a sliding track can be seen due to persistence of vision effect of human eyes, so that the user learns the touch position of the touch object, and accordingly determines a subsequent sliding direction or sliding speed. This improves accuracy of the operation and improves operation experience of head-up interaction.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to a second aspect, a human-computer interaction method is provided.

A mobile phone game still keeps original operation logic that a user performs a touch operation on a mobile phone side to control the game application. Generally, the user needs to tap a region of interest (region of interest, ROI) (which may also be referred to as a functional area, and may be a virtual control key or area on the screen) on the game screen to control a game. This may lead to the following problems.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Problem 1: The user watches a touchscreen of the mobile phone when performing the touch operation. In other words, when operating the game, the user switches viewing angles between the mobile phone and the large-screen device. In this case, head-up interaction cannot be implemented, and the user has poor immersive experience in the game.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">If the user keeps watching the large-screen device when performing the touch operation, the user cannot perceive a specific location of a finger of the user on the mobile phone side, and therefore cannot accurately touch the ROI on the game screen. Generally, in a touch operation on a specific ROI, a finger hovers and the user presses down the ROI with the finger. It may be understood that when the user watches the touchscreen of the mobile phone to perform the touch operation, the user may usually accurately touch the functional area that the user wants to touch. However, because the user does not stare at the touchscreen, visual feedback is absent. Therefore, before the user touches the touchscreen of the mobile phone, it is difficult for the user to perceive a location of the finger relative to the functional area, and touch effect can be perceived only after the finger touches the touchscreen of the mobile phone. This means poor touch accuracy: A non-functional area is usually touched, causing an invalid operation, or another functional area is touched, causing a misoperation. Specifically, the game screen generally has a plurality of functional areas. The plurality of functional areas are distributed in various places on the game screen, resulting in frequent misoperations and invalid operations.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Problem 2: A long-distance small-sized ROI generally exists on the game screen. It may be understood that when properly operating the game, the user usually holds the mobile phone with fingers other than a thumb, and taps the ROI with the thumb to operate the game. The long-distance ROI herein is an ROI that is on the game screen and that is far away from the thumb when the user properly controls the game. If the user wants to tap the long-distance ROI, the thumb needs to move for a long distance to touch the ROI.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">It is difficult to accurately tap the long-distance small-sized ROI, and it takes a long time for the finger to reach the ROI. According to the Fitts' law, time required for tapping a target ROI by the user is: T=a+blog<sub>2</sub>(1+D/W), where D is a distance between the target ROI and a current location of a finger (the finger is a finger for touching the target ROI) of the user, and W is a size of the target ROI, a and b are constant parameters. It may be learned that the time T required for tapping a target that is far away from the current location of the finger (large D) and has a small size (small W) is long. Therefore, how to quickly and accurately tap the long-distance small-sized ROI is also a problem that needs to be considered during game experience optimization.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Problem 3: Based on big data statistics of game operations, the game generally has one or more high-trigger-frequency keys (namely, frequent operation ROIs on the game screen), for example, ROIs such as an attack key, a turret destroy key, and a last hit key in a multiplayer online battle arena (multiplayer online battle arena, MOBA). When playing the game, the user performs most operations on an area in or near the frequent operation ROI. Even when watching the mobile phone, the user is likely to inaccurately tap the frequent operation ROI. Especially, a speed of tapping the ROI is a key factor that affects game experience. Therefore, the game experience of the user is severely affected if the tapping speed is sacrificed to ensure tapping accuracy. When the user does not watch the mobile phone, the foregoing problem is more serious.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an embodiment of this application provides a human-computer interaction system.

For example, the image A<b>1</b> may be shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref>, or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>G</figref>. The image A<b>1</b> may include at least one auxiliary touch ROI (the ROI may also be referred to as a functional area). The at least one auxiliary touch ROI one-to-one corresponds to at least one ROI in the running image of the application A. An operating system of the portable device <b>100</b> may receive a touch operation performed on the image A<b>1</b>, so that the user controls running of the application A.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">When the application A runs on the portable device <b>100</b>, when the touch operation is directly performed on an area outside the ROI in the image A<b>1</b>, the operating system of the portable device <b>100</b> determines or recognizes the touch operation, to determine a target ROI for the touch operation. If the target ROI for the touch operation is recognized, the portable device <b>100</b> may generate a touch event (for example, a down (down) event) for the target ROI, and transfer the touch event to the application A, so that the application A performs a function of the target ROI. The touch operation directly performed on the area outside the ROI on the screen may also be referred to as a touch operation not directly performed on the ROI. For example, the touch operation not directly performed on the ROI may be an operation whose start touch point is located in the area outside the ROI, for example, a tap operation whose tapping location is not located in the ROI, or a slide operation whose start touch point is not located in the ROI. The ROI herein may be any ROI on the screen. In other words, the touch operation not directly performed on the ROI may be a touch operation not directly performed on any ROI on the screen.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">For example, as described in the foregoing description of the problem 1, based on an existing operation manner, when the user wants to touch a specific ROI, the finger hovers and the user presses down the ROI with the finger. In this manner, tapping accuracy and touch accuracy are poor without the aid of eyes. In the solution provided in this embodiment of this application, a slide operation starting from a specific location may be converted into a touch operation directly performed on an ROI, to trigger a function of the ROI. This resolves a problem that it is difficult for the user to determine a hovering location of the finger and perform accurate tapping without the aid of eyes. For example, the touch operation directly performed on the ROI is an operation generated by the portable device <b>100</b>, and equals to or is equivalent to an operation whose start touch point is located in the ROI.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref>, the image A<b>1</b> may include an initialization operation area. There is no overlapping area between the initialization operation area and the ROI. When the touch operation not directly performed on the ROI is a slide operation starting from the initialization operation area, the portable device <b>100</b> may determine a target ROI for the slide operation. When or after the target ROI is determined, a touch event (for example, a down event) for the target ROI may be generated, to trigger a corresponding function of the target ROI. For example, as described in the foregoing description of the problem 2, it is usually difficult for the user to accurately and quickly tap a long-distance small-sized ROI. Therefore, in the solution provided in this embodiment of this application, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, the image A<b>1</b> may include a shortcut gesture operation area and a plurality of ROIs. There is no overlapping area between the shortcut gesture operation area and the ROI. The shortcut gesture operation area may also be referred to as a gesture operation area for short. At least one shortcut gesture may be preset. Each shortcut gesture is corresponding to one ROI. An ROI corresponding to the shortcut gesture may be a long-distance ROI, a small-sized ROI, or a long-distance small-sized ROI. The long-distance ROI may be an ROI whose distance to the shortcut gesture operation area is greater than a distance threshold D<b>1</b>. The small-sized ROI may be an ROI whose size is less than a size threshold W<b>1</b>. The long-distance small-sized ROI may be an ROI whose distance to the shortcut gesture operation area is greater than a distance threshold D<b>2</b> and whose size is less than a size threshold W<b>2</b>. The distance threshold D<b>1</b> and the distance threshold D<b>2</b> may be the same, or may be different. The size threshold W<b>1</b> and the size threshold W<b>2</b> may be the same, or may be different.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The distance threshold D<b>1</b>, the distance threshold D<b>2</b>, the size threshold W<b>1</b>, and the size threshold W<b>2</b> may be preset based on experience. In the solution provided in this embodiment of this application, a shortcut gesture for a slide operation performed on the shortcut gesture operation area may be determined, and an ROI corresponding to the determined shortcut gesture is used as a target ROI corresponding to the slide operation, so that the slide operation is converted into an operation directly performed on the target ROI, to trigger a function of the target ROI. This may further resolve a problem of inaccurate tapping, especially inaccurate tapping and long tapping time of a long-distance small-sized ROI.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">For example, as described in the foregoing description of the problem 3, tap operations on a frequent ROI are usually inaccurate. Therefore, in this embodiment of this application, a touch operation performed on an area near the frequent ROI may be converted into a touch operation directly performed on the frequent ROI. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>G</figref>, the image A<b>1</b> may include a frequent operation area. The frequent operation area may include an attract area. There is no overlapping area between the attract area and the ROI. When the touch operation not directly performed on the ROI is a touch operation performed on the attract area, a target ROI for the touch operation may be determined by using a preset algorithm. When or after the target ROI is determined, a touch event (for example, a down event) for the target ROI may be generated, to trigger a corresponding function of the target ROI. The frequent operation area may be an area in or near the frequent operation ROI, and may be determined based on historical touch operation data (user touch big data). Details are described below and not described herein again.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">When the application A runs on the large-screen device <b>200</b>, the large-screen device <b>200</b> may receive a touch operation (specifically, may receive a touch event, where the touch event is a touch event that is triggered through a touch operation performed on an auxiliary touch layer) from the portable device <b>100</b>. When the touch operation is an operation not directly performed on an ROI, an operating system of the large-screen device <b>200</b> determines or recognizes the touch operation, to determine a target ROI based on the touch operation. For details, refer to the foregoing description of determining, by the portable device <b>100</b>, the target ROI for the operation not directly performed on the ROI.

When a down operation of the tap operation or the slide operation is performed on the ROI, namely when a start touch point of the touch operation is located in the ROI (in other words, a touch point corresponding to the down event is located in the ROI), the touch event corresponding to the touch operation may be referred to as a valid touch event.

Specifically, if the touch point (namely, the start touch point of the slide operation) of the down event of the touch event is located in the initialization operation area, it may be determined that the touch operation corresponding to the touch event is a slide operation whose start touch point is located in the initialization operation area. The auxiliary touch ROIs passed through by or reached by the slide operation may be determined based on touch coordinates corresponding to a plurality of move events.

For example, insertion time of the down subevent may be recognition time of the target ROI. For example, the insertion time of the down subevent may alternatively be time after the recognition time of the target ROI.
