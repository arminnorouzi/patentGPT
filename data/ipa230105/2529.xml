id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0001">The present invention relates to a thermosetting resin composition, a cured film, a method for forming a multilayer coating film, an ester compound, and a polymer.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0002">The present inventors have studied thermosetting resin compositions that use a transesterification reaction as a curing reaction (PTLs 1 to 3). By a recent study, it is becoming clear that curing performance equivalent to that of curing using a generally known melamine resin or polyisocyanate compound can be ensured by using a transesterification reaction as a curing reaction.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0003">On the other hand, in recent years, due to the demand for energy saving, it has been desired to perform curing at a lower temperature than before. Also in various methods as described in PTLs 1 to 3, the temperature can be sufficiently lowered, however, it is preferable if the curing can be achieved at a still lower temperature than ever before.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0004">Further, it has also been desired to reduce the volatilization amount of a volatile organic compound, and the conversion into an aqueous form of a thermosetting composition has also been studied. When the conversion into an aqueous form of a thermosetting composition that uses transesterification as a curing reaction was studied, it became clear that the thermosetting reactivity is lowered by the conversion into an aqueous form, and there arises a need to perform the reaction at a high temperature during curing.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0005">It is presumed that such a problem is caused by introducing an acid group into the resin in order to perform conversion into an aqueous form. Therefore, even in the case of an organic solvent-based thermosetting resin composition, when a multilayer coating film is formed by wet-on-wet coating with an aqueous coating material, there is a problem that also in the case where a resin composition that uses transesterification as a curing reaction is not an aqueous coating material, the reactivity of the curing reaction is lowered due to the presence of the aqueous coating material of the lower layer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0006">PTL 4 discloses a curable resin composition that uses a compound containing an ester group represented by a specific structure and causes a curing reaction by transesterification.

Further, when it is used as a coating material, it is known that there is a problem in acid resistance due to its chemical structure.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0055">An epoxy compound is said to have high curability and high coating film physical properties, but have low storage stability and a high curing temperature, and a polyisocyanate curing system is said to have high curability and high coating film physical properties, but have a narrow range of design.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0056">The present inventors have studied a transesterification-type thermosetting resin composition that can improve these problems, can be cured at a low temperature, is highly safe, and can realize low cost.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0057">The present invention is a thermosetting resin composition characterized by containing a resin component (A), which includes a structure (a) represented by the following general formula (1) and a hydroxy group (b), and a transesterification catalyst (B).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-C00005" he="35.81mm" wi="76.28mm" file="US20230002530A1-20230105-C00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0065" num="0058">n=0 to 20</p><p id="p-0066" num="0059">R<sub>1 </sub>is an alkyl group having 50 or less carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0060">R<sub>3 </sub>is hydrogen or an alkyl group having 10 or less carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0061">The ester group represented by the above general formula (1) has high transesterification reactivity, although the reason is unknown. Therefore, by using an ester compound having the functional group as a part or the whole of the resin component (A), a thermosetting resin composition having more excellent curing performance than before can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0062">Further, as described above, in the transesterification reaction, the presence of a carboxylate group lowers the catalytic activity and makes it difficult for the reaction to proceed. On the other hand, when an aqueous thermosetting resin composition is used, in many cases, a carboxylate group is introduced into a resin and neutralized with a basic compound such as an amine compound to make the resin water soluble and use the resultant.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0063">Due to the action of the carboxylate group introduced as such a hydration functional group, the aqueous thermosetting resin composition that uses a transesterification reaction as a curing reaction has a problem that the curing reactivity is lowered as compared with a solvent-based resin composition, and there arises a need to perform curing at a high temperature.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0064">On the other hand, the ester group represented by the above general formula (1) has high transesterification reactivity, and therefore, the high reactivity can be maintained even when a carboxylate group is present. Accordingly, an aqueous thermosetting resin composition that causes a transesterification reaction at a low temperature can be provided.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0065">Further, even when the thermosetting resin composition is used as a coating material and wet-on-wet coating is performed, the thermosetting resin composition of the present invention has a better effect than ever before and can be suitably used.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0066">In the coating field such as automobile coating materials, formation of a multilayer coating film in which a plurality of coating film layers are laminated is often performed.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0067">In the formation of such a multilayer coating film, a coating film forming method in which a solvent-based clear coating material is applied onto an uncured coating film, for which only drying is performed after coating an aqueous base coating material and thermal curing is not performed, and the two layers are simultaneously cured is generally performed.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0068">In such coating, the components of the aqueous base coating film are transferred to the clear coating film. As a result, the catalytic activity of the solvent-based clear coating material was deactivated, and the curability of the clear coating material was not sufficiently obtained in some cases. For this reason, curing could not be sufficiently achieved at a low temperature, and the effect of achieving low temperature curing was not sufficiently obtained in some cases.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0069">Since the ester group having the structure of the above general formula (1) has high reactivity as described above, even if a mixed layer with a coating film of another layer is generated in the formation of a multilayer coating film by the wet-on-wet process described above, curing can be carried out at a relatively low temperature. As a result, a multilayer coating film can be efficiently formed by curing at a low temperature.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0070">In the formation of a multilayer coating film by the wet-on-wet process described above, the thermosetting resin composition of the present invention can also be used as an aqueous base coating material composition for the lower layer or can also be used as a solvent-based clear coating material composition for the upper layer.
