The image forming station comprises a plurality of print bars configured to apply ink droplets to the ITM to form an image. The ink drying station is configured to dry the ink image applied to the ITM, and the impression station is configured to transfer the ink image from the ITM to a target substrate such as a sheet of paper or a continuous web.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The digital printing system may further comprise a blanket treatment station, at which the blanket is cleaned, cooled and treated using a treatment fluid, before returning to the image forming station.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The digital printing system further comprises a processor configured to control the operation of these stations and other components of the digital printing system. In a printing process, it is important to accurately deposit ink droplets on the ITM to precisely form an ink image, and subsequently, to transfer the ink image from the ITM to the target substrate in a precise manner. The precision of the printing process rely, among other factors, on the ability to monitor the movement and the behavior (e.g. stretching) of the ITM as precisely and continuously as possible.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In principle, it is possible to attach labels to the ITM surface, and to control the movement of the ITM using the labels, but such labels may deteriorate in time (e.g., peel-off or erode) due to high duty cycle of the ITM operation in the printing process. In the disclosed embodiments, at least some of the markers are formed in the ITM and are used for the control of the ITM.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the ITM comprises an integrated encoder comprising a set of markers that may be formed during the production of the ITM using various techniques, such as forming structures in the ITM layers or on its surface, by engraving the markers, and/or jetting ink and/or printing three-dimensional (3D) structures on one or more layers of the ITM, or a combination thereof. For example, a marker may be formed by engraving a trench in the ITM surface, and subsequently, printing 3D structures in the trench.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, a processor of the digital printing system is configured to receive, from sensors that are mounted at one or more locations relative to the ITM, signals indicative of positions of respective encoder markers. The processor is further configured to control, based on the signals, a motion profile (e.g., speed, acceleration, and deceleration) of the ITM, by controlling rollers and dancers of the digital printing system, which are configured to move the ITM.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, engraving the markers in the ITM surface may be carried out using any suitable technique, such as laser marking, laser ablating, and/or direct part marking (e.g., mechanical punching and/or pinning). The engraved markers may have any suitable size and shape of footprint (e.g., round, rectangular, square, or star shapes shown in a top-view) or profile (e.g., hole, trench, or staircase shapes, shown in a sectional view).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, the engraved markers may be fully or partially filled with a suitable filling material, so as to provide the markers with mechanical support, and to add features to the markers of the encoder. For example, the filling materials may change the magnetic properties of the ITM by applying magnetic materials to the engraved markers and/or to the ITM surface. Alternatively or additionally, the filing materials may change the optical properties of the engraved markers and/or of the ITM surface and/or of at least one layer of the ITM, by adding various types of pigments, e.g., to the filling materials.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the encoder may comprise various types of encoded structures that may serve as markers, such as grid markers, quick response (QR) codes, AZTEC codes, or a combination thereof. These markers may be sensed using any suitable type of sensors, such as optical-based sensors (e.g., visible light, infrared, ultraviolet) or magnetic-based sensors.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, one or more encoders are typically located at the bevels of the ITM and may comprise various types of markers, interleaved with one another along the ITM. Additionally, or alternatively, markers of different types may be grouped at different respective locations of the ITM.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The disclosed techniques improve the quality of printed images by accurately controlling a plurality of operations of the digital printing system, such as the deposition of ink droplets on the ITM so as to form the ink image, the drying of the ink droplets, the transfer of the ink image from the ITM to a target substrate and the treatment of the ITM before returning to the image forming station. The disclosed technique may be used to reduce the complexity of the digital printing system, for example, by reducing the need to integrate rotary encoders to the rollers. Moreover, the disclosed encoders are designed and produced to demonstrate high endurance even at high duty cycles typically used in digital printing systems.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">System Description</heading><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic side view of a digital printing system <b>11</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
