id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Recently, liquid crystal displays (LCD), organic light emitting device (OLED) displays, and micro LED displays are competing to implement large-area displays in the display technology field.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">On the other hand, when a semiconductor light emitting device having a diameter or cross-sectional area of 100 &#x3bc;m or less (micro LED) is used for a display, a very high efficiency can be provided because the display does not absorb light using a polarizing plate or the like. However, since a large display requires millions of semiconductor light emitting devices, it is difficult to transfer the devices compared to other technologies.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The technologies currently being developed for the transfer process include a pick and place method, a laser lift-off (LLO) method, or a self-assembly method. Among them, the self-assembly method is a method in which the semiconductor light emitting device finds its own position in a fluid, and is the most advantageous method for realizing a large-screen display device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, although a micro LED structure suitable for self-assembly has been proposed in U.S. Pat. No. 9,825,202, research on a technology for manufacturing a display through self-assembly of micro LED is still insufficient. Accordingly, the present invention proposes a new type of manufacturing device in which the micro LED can be self-assembled.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the present invention is to provide a new manufacturing process having high reliability in a large-screen display using a micro-sized semiconductor light emitting device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another object of the present invention is to provide a device for correcting a bending phenomenon of a substrate due to gravity when a semiconductor light emitting device is self-assembled into a temporary substrate or a wiring substrate.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another object of the present invention is to provide a structure and a manufacturing method capable of preventing the semiconductor light emitting device from being separated from a substrate during a process after self-assembly of the semiconductor light emitting device.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to achieve the above purpose, the present display device can include a base part, a plurality of assembly electrodes disposed on the base part, and having a first electrode and a second electrode that generate an electric field when power is applied, a dielectric layer formed to cover the assembly electrodes and a plurality of semiconductor light emitting devices seated on a surface of the dielectric layer, concave-convex structure respectively formed on one surface of the semiconductor light emitting device facing the dielectric layer and one surface of the dielectric layer facing the semiconductor light emitting device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment, the concave-convex structures formed on each of the semiconductor light emitting device and the dielectric layer may be arranged to engage with each other.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, the passivation layer may be disposed on the dielectric layer and include a plurality of cells, and the semiconductor light emitting devices may be disposed inside the cell.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, the concave-convex structure formed on the dielectric layer may be formed only in a region overlapping the cell.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, the concave-convex structure formed on the dielectric layer may be formed to overlap at least a portion of the passivation layer.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment, the concave-convex structure formed on each of the semiconductor light emitting device and the dielectric layer may be formed at a predetermined interval.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the plurality of semiconductor light emitting devices may include a first semiconductor light emitting device including a concave-convex structure formed at first interval and a second semiconductor light emitting device including a concave-convex structure formed at second interval.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment, the dielectric layer may include a concave-convex structure formed at the first interval and a concave-convex structure formed at the second interval, respectively.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the concave-convex structure formed on the semiconductor light emitting device may be made of any one of Au, Ag, Al, Cu, Mo, Cr, Ti, Ni, W, Ge, or an alloy in which at least some of the metals are mixed.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment, the concave-convex structure formed on the dielectric layer may be made of a metal oxide or made of the same material as the dielectric layer.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Effects of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the present invention having the above configuration, in a display device in which individual pixels are formed of micro light emitting diodes, a large number of semiconductor light emitting devices can be assembled at once.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As described above, according to the present invention, after pixelate a large amount of semiconductor light emitting devices on a small-sized wafer, it is possible to transfer semiconductor light emitting devices to a large-area substrate.

Through this, the present invention can prevent the pre-assembled semiconductor light emitting devices from being separated from the substrate.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition, according to the present invention, by diffusely reflecting the light directed to the dielectric layer in the opposite direction, the amount of light of the display device can be increased.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition, according to the present invention, by increasing the contact area between the semiconductor light emitting device and the dielectric layer, heat generated in the semiconductor light emitting device can be rapidly transferred to the dielectric layer.
