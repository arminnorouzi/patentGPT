A memory device often includes a semiconductor die where memory cells and associated circuitry are formed. Many packaging techniques are available to assemble the die in a package. Such a package is also referred to as an integrated circuit (IC) package or IC chip. The package has electrical connections to allow transmission of electrical signals between circuitries on the die and external devices outside the package.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Packaging processes during assembly can induce stress on the die. Such stress can be difficult to detect. Thus, normally only permanent damages (e.g., damaged after the package is assembled) can be observed. Some conventional techniques of detecting die stress due to assembly of the die are often based on a limited number of failing dies. Such conventional techniques also usually lack data that shows the impact of die stress from assembly on circuitries of the die. Moreover, circuitries of the die may suffer from process variations during fabrication of a memory device. Some conventional techniques may use limited data from a small sample of dies to quantify and predict the expected impact of such process variations. These limitations of conventional techniques can reduce yield, introduce marginalities in die functionality, create reliability issues during normal mode of operations of the memory device that includes the die, and/or other drawbacks discussed below.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a side view of a package including a base, a die, and an enclosure, according to some embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a top view of the package of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> including conductive pads of the die, conductive contacts of the base, and wires (e.g., bonding wires) connecting between the conductive pads and the conductive contacts, and outlines (e.g., layout) of circuitries located under respective portions of the die, according to some embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a side view in the Y-Z direction of the package of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> including circuits of the circuitry located under a conductive pad portion of the die of the package, according to some embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of a sensor circuit of the circuitry of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> including ring oscillators, according to some embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a structure of a portion of a memory device including memory cells located on different levels of the memory device, according to some embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a system including a package, according to some embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart showing a method of fabricating a package, according to some embodiments described herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The techniques described herein include providing an active monitor on a die of a memory device for analyzing (e.g., risk assessment) the properties (e.g., electrical and physical properties) of a particular portion of the die. In an example, the active monitor includes a sensor circuit embedded in the die. The sensor circuit can be enabled during different stages (e.g., pre-package and post-package stage) of fabrication of the memory device to provide evaluation information. The evaluation information collected from the sensor circuit can help detection of variations in the process (e.g., CMOS process) of fabricating the memory device. The collected evaluation information can also allow analysis on the impact of stress on the die during packaging assembly (e.g., during pre-package and post-package stage). In an example, ring oscillators are included in the sensor circuit. The sensor circuit can be formed at locations (e.g., under conductive bonding pads) that is often subject to bonding and package stress. The techniques described herein can allow reliable circuitry to be formed in more locations (e.g., under conductive bonding pads) of the die that normally would be wasted. The techniques described herein can also allow detection of stress on the die during assembly, thereby correction can be made to reduce or eliminate the number of dies that have permanent damage. The described techniques can improve yield, maintain the reliability of the circuitry in the memory device, and improve fabrication process.
