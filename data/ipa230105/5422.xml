As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the pixel driving circuit of the sub-pixel may include a first transistor T<b>1</b> to a fifth transistor T<b>5</b> (here all of them being P-type transistors is taken as an example), and a capacitor C. Referring to the signal timing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in a frame, a process of driving the light emitting device D by the pixel driving circuit to emit light includes a scanning period and a light emitting period. In the scanning period, the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> write a data signal Vdata transmitted through a data voltage terminal DL into the capacitor C in response to a scan signal Vgate from a scan signal line GL. In the light emitting period, the fourth transistor T<b>4</b> and the fifth transistor T<b>5</b> connect a first voltage terminal ELVDD to the light emitting device D in response to an emission control signal Vem from an emission control line EL, so that the third transistor T<b>3</b> drives the light emitting device D to emit light.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It will be noted that, in the scanning period, time required by the sub-pixel to write the data signal Vdata is 1H, that is, a duration of a low level of the scan signal Vgate is 1H. In this case, a duration of an off level of the emission control signal Vem is at least 1H, which may ensure that the fourth transistor T<b>4</b> and the fifth transistor T<b>5</b> are maintained in an off state during the scanning period. Here, the emission control signal Vem generally has high levels and low levels (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), and the off level of the emission control signal Vem refers to a level that enables the fourth transistor T<b>4</b> and the fifth transistor T<b>5</b> to be in the off state. For example, in a case where the fourth transistor T<b>4</b> and the fifth transistor T<b>5</b> are P-type transistors as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the off level of the emission control signal Vem refers to the high level of the emission control signal Vem.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, an off level of a certain signal described below refers to a level of the signal that enables a corresponding transistor to be in the off state; and similarly, an on level of a certain signal described below refers to a level of the signal that enables a corresponding transistor to be in an on state.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the light emitting period, a duration in which the emission control signal Vem is at a high level may be changed, which may control the time during which the fourth transistor T<b>4</b> and the fifth transistor T<b>5</b> are in the off state in the light emitting period. That is, the time during which the first voltage terminal ELVDD is connected to the light emitting device D may be controlled, so that the time during which the third transistor T<b>3</b> drives the light emitting device D to emit light may be controlled. For example, in a case where the duration of the high level of the emission control signal Vem is increased from 1H to nH (n is an integer greater than 1), the time during which the light emitting device D emits light is shortened, so that brightness of the sub-pixel may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It will also be noted that, the emission control signals Vem for sub-pixels in different rows usually have the same waveform. For example, the emission control signals Vem may be shifted and registered by row driving circuits of the display panel, so as to realize row-by-row transmission. On this basis, an overall brightness of a screen may be controlled by controlling durations of the off levels of the emission control signals Vem. However, if durations of the off levels of the emission control signals Vem are relatively long so that the screen has relatively low brightness, there are many rows of sub-pixels in a non-light emitting state at the same time, resulting in continuous rows of sub-pixels in the non-light emitting state in the screen. As a result, bright and dark stripes may appear on the screen, which causes flickering of the screen. For example, in a case where a display apparatus with low screen brightness is photographed by a camera, the screen of the display apparatus in the photographed image may have bright and dark stripes.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, some embodiments of the present disclosure provide a display apparatus <b>1000</b>, and the display apparatus <b>1000</b> includes a display panel <b>100</b> and an emission time control chip <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The display panel <b>100</b> has a plurality of sub-pixels SP. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, each sub-pixel SP includes a light emitting device D, a pixel driving circuit <b>101</b>, and an emission time control circuit <b>102</b>. The pixel driving circuit <b>101</b> is configured to provide a driving signal SD for driving the light emitting device D to emit light. The emission time control circuit <b>102</b> is electrically connected between the pixel driving circuit <b>101</b> and the light emitting device D, and is configured to connect the pixel driving circuit <b>101</b> to the light emitting device D in response to an emission time control signal Vemt from the emission time control chip <b>200</b>, so as to control a duration of transmission of the driving signal SD to the light emitting device D.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the emission time control chip <b>200</b> includes at least one output terminal O, and emission time control circuits <b>102</b> of the plurality of sub-pixels SP are electrically connected to the at least one output terminal O. The emission time control chip <b>200</b> is configured to transmit emission time control signal(s) Vemt to the emission time control circuits <b>102</b> of the plurality of sub-pixels SP through the at least one output terminal O. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the emission time control signal Vemt is a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">It will be understood that any existing chip or circuit structure capable of generating the PWM signal may be used as the emission time control chip <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the display apparatus <b>1000</b>, a proportion of a first level L1 (i.e., a level at which the transmission of the driving signal SD to the light emitting device D is stopped) of the emission time control signal Vemt transmitted by the emission time control chip <b>200</b> to the emission time control circuit <b>102</b> is adjusted, that is, a pulse width of the PWM signal is adjusted, so that the emission time control circuit <b>102</b> may adjust the emission time of the sub-pixel SP. As a result, luminous brightness of the sub-pixel may be adjusted. In this case, there is no need to control the brightness of the screen by changing the duration of the off level of the emission control signal Vem. Therefore, it may be possible to avoid a case where the duration of the off level of the emission control signal Vem is made relatively long to achieve the relatively low screen brightness. In this way, the number of rows of sub-pixels that are in the non-light emitting state at the same time may be reduced, thereby preventing the bright and dark stripes and flickering from occurring with the screen, which may prevent the bright and dark stripes from occurring on a screen in a photographed picture in a case where the display apparatus <b>1000</b> having the relatively low screen brightness is photographed by a camera.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It will be understood that the emission time control signal Vemt (i.e., the PWM signal) includes first levels L1 and second levels L2 that are alternatively arranged (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).

In a case where the emission time control circuit <b>102</b> includes a transistor, the first level L1 of the emission time control signal Vemt refers to an off level of the transistor, and the second level L2 refers to an on level of the transistor.
