For this purpose, an endless chain provided with scoops runs between two sprockets in an elevator housing, which has an upward section and a return section. Due to the constant use of agricultural machinery outdoors, these conveyor chains are exposed to both weather-related influences and dust and dirt.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To date, grain conveyor chains have the disadvantage that in addition to the conveyor scoop, an additional element (the bracket) is required for fastening the conveyor scoop on the chain. The weight and the production costs of the conveyor chain are thus increased, in case of damage, the conveyor chain is complex to service.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would therefore be desirable and advantageous to provide an improved grain conveyor chain for a harvesting vehicle to obviate prior art shortcomings and to attain higher conveyed quantity of harvested grain per unit of time, while yet being cost-effective, reliable in operation, cost-effective to produce, and easy to maintain.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It would also be desirable and advantageous to provide an improved scoop and method for fastening a scoop on a grain conveyor chain to obviate prior art shortcomings.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one aspect of the present invention, a scoop includes a scoop body having a scoop surface. The scoop surface is designed to accommodate the material to be transported. Furthermore, the scoop has a fastening element, which is provided and suitable for the purpose of being fastened directly on a standard chain element. Directly fastened in the meaning of this document refers to fastenings which manage without adapters or additional parts, for example angled plates, as are typically used in these applications. The fastening elements of the scoops are thus in direct contact with one or more standard chain elements.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the scoop additionally can include two flanks which enclose the chain over the outer plates of the chain. The distance of the flanks from one another is dimensioned in such a way that the flanks directly abut the chain, in particular an outer plate. Therefore, there is no space between chain and scoop, and the conveyed grain cannot get between chain and scoop in operation. Furthermore, the depth of the flanks corresponds to the height of the grain conveyor chain, so that the chin formed by the rear side of the chain facing away from the scoop terminates with the edges of the flanks of the scoop extending in parallel. No space thus results behind the chain, through which the crop could fail from the scoop.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the scoop can be formed in one piece. The scoop advantageously only has one component, or additional components are connected in a formfitting manner to the scoop. The scoop can therefore be produced by means of known methods in large-scale production, in particular if the scoop is made of a plastic. The scoop can then be produced cost-effectively, for example, by means of injection molding methods. Components are understood as one piece in the meaning of this document which only consist of one part or comprise multiple parts which are not detachably connected (for example multicomponent injection molding). In an optional refinement of the invention, the scoop is formed in one piece with the fastening element.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the scoop can have a fastening element, for example in the form of a fastening opening, through which a pin can be guided for fastening the scoop on a standard chain element. By means of the pin, the scoop is fastened directly on the standard chain element such as a pin or outer plate of the chain.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the fastening element can be arranged on one or both flanks of the scoop. Advantageously, both flanks each have a fastening element which are aligned with one another in such a way that a pin for fastening the scoop on a standard chain element of the chain can be guided through the fastening elements.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, each flank can have two fastening elements, for example in the form of fastening openings. The fastening openings are aligned with one another in pairs in such a way that a pin can be guided through each two of the fastening openings aligned with one another, using which the scoop is fastenable on a standard chain element of the chain.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the fastening element can have a first reinforcement. The first reinforcement reinforces the fastening elements in such a way that a pin that can be guided through the fastening elements only has little play and the scoop is thus fastenable without play on a standard chain element of the chain by the pin.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the first reinforcement can be made of a different material than the scoop surface. The scoop surface is advantageously formed from a plastic which can be produced cost-effectively, for example, by means of Injection molding. To increase the service life of the fastening element, the first reinforcement is manufactured from a material which increases the strength and breakage resistance of the fastening element.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the first reinforcement can be made of a metal. A first reinforcement made of a metal, for example aluminum or steel, meets this requirement and is mass producible cost-effectively.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the first reinforcement can only include a part of the flank. To reduce weight and costs of the scoop, only the part of the flank which is subjected to the highest stresses in running operation is reinforced.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the first reinforcement can be a sleeve. The sleeve reinforces the fastening elements in such a way that a pin that can be guided through the fastening elements only has little play and the scoop is thus fastenable without play on a standard chain element of the chain by the pin.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the first reinforcement can have the form of an outer plate. In an optional refinement of the invention, the outer plate of the first reinforcement, after fastening of the scoop on the chain, replaces the outer plates of the chain link on which the scoop is fastened.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the reinforcement can be embedded in the fastening elements. The first reinforcement is not detachably connected to the fastening element. The scoop forms a one-piece component and can be replaced quickly in case of service.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the scoop can have a scoop surface reinforcement. The scoop surface reinforcement reinforces the scoop body against stresses under load in such a way that the scoop does not deform under load, and more material per unit of time can thus be conveyed, or even breaks.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the scoop surface reinforcement can be a support structure under the scoop surface. A support structure effectively prevents a deformation of the scoop body under load and has a low weight at the same time. The support structure can be formed by support ribs, for example. Furthermore, struts made of a different material than the scoop can be provided as the support structure. The scoop surface reinforcement can be designed in such a way that it is integrated, for example, by injection molding into the scoop during production of the scoop.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the scoop surface reinforcement of the scoop can be made of a different material than the scoop surface. To increase the strength and in particular breakage resistance of the scoop surface, the reinforcement is manufactured from a material which increases the strength and breakage resistance of the scoop surface.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the scoop surface can be made of a plastic and the scoop surface reinforcement is made of a metal. The scoop surface is advantageously made of a plastic which can be produced cost-effectively, for example, by means of injection molding. To increase the strength and in particular breakage resistance of the scoop surface, the reinforcement is manufactured from a material which increases the strength and breakage resistance of the scoop surface.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the scoop can be fastened on the grain conveyor chain according to the invention. The grain conveyor chain has a chain. The chain has standard chain elements, wherein the standard chain elements have inner plates, outer plates, pins, and/or sleeves.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the scoop and/or the fastening means can have dimensions that correspond to the dimensions of one of the chain components, for example sleeve, pin, inner plate, and/or outer plate, and/or the chains of a standard chain according to British Standard (DIN 8188) or ANSI Standard (DIN 8187). These dimensions of the scoop and/or the fastening means can be one or more dimensions of the standard chain from the group of the following dimensions: the pin and/or sleeve diameter, the outer distance of opposite outer plates, the inner distance of opposite inner plates, the distance between two pins, the distance between two sleeves, the length of a chain link, the length of an inner plate, the length of an outer plate, or any other dimension that results from the dimensions of a standard chain according to British Standard (DIN 8188) or ANSI Standard (DIN 8187) or their chain components.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to another aspect of the invention, a grain conveyor chain includes a chain. The chain has standard chain elements, wherein the standard chain elements have inner plates, outer plates, pins, and/or sleeves. The grain conveyor chain also has multiple scoops fastened on the chain. According to the invention, a scoop is in direct contact with a standard chain element. In particular, the scoops are fastened on the chain and in direct contact with a standard chain element such that there is no space between the chain and the scoop. This effectively prevents the material being transported on the scoop from falling during operation, and the grain conveyor chain according to the invention operates more efficiently.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the scoop can be fastened directly on a standard chain element. The scoop therefore does not require a further bracket or spacer to fasten it on the chain. Due to the direct fastening of the scoop on a standard chain element, the grain conveyor chain according to the invention can be produced more easily and with less effort than previously known conveyor chains. The grain conveyor chain according to the invention can therefore be operated more efficiently.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the scoop can be fastened on the chain by means of a pin directly on the outer plate. The pin can be designed in such a way that the pin both fastens the scoop and at the same time serves as a chain pin. Therefore, no additional components are required to fasten the scoop on the chain, the grain conveyor chain is lighter than comparable grain conveyor chains and is additionally producible more cost-effectively.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the scoop can have a fastening element which is used to fasten the scoop on the standard chain element. Optionally, the fastening element can be an opening through which a pin is guided, by which the scoop is fastened directly on a standard chain element of the chain, for example the outer plate and/or inner plate and the pin.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the pin as a chain pin can represent a joint between an inner plate and an outer plate of the chain. The pin is arranged in such a way that the scoop is held perpendicular to the chain is running operation in the upward region (load side) by its own weight and the material transported on the scoop surface.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, each scoop can be fastened on the chain by means of two pins. This makes the chain-scoop connection more stable, the pins serve at the same time as chain pins of the chain link on which the scoop is fastened. Further components for fastening the scoop on the chain are not required.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to still another aspect of the invention, a method for fastening a scoop on a grain conveyor chain includes two method steps: In the first method step, a scoop is positioned in relation to a standard chain element of a chain. The standard chain element is an inner plate, an outer plate, a pin, and/or a sleeve, in the second method step, the scoop is fastened directly on the standard chain element of the chain. The scoop therefore does not require a further bracket or spacer to fasten it on the chain. Due to the direct fastening of the scoop on a standard chain element, the grain conveyor chain according to the invention can be produced more easily and with less effort than previously known conveyor chains. The grain conveyor chain according to the invention can therefore be operated more efficiently. In particular, the scoops are fastened on the chain and in direct contact with a standard chain element such that there is no space between the chain and the scoop. This effectively prevents the material being transported on the scoop from falling during operation, and the grain conveyor chain according to the invention operates more efficiently.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the scoop can have two flanks, each having a fastening element. The scoop is fastened on the grain conveyor chain by the fastening element. The distance between the flanks is equal to the chain width and is dimensioned in such a way that the flanks directly abut the chain, in particular an outer plate. Therefore, there is no space between chain and scoop, and the conveyed grain cannot get between chain and scoop in operation.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the scoop can be fastened on the chain by a pin directly on an outer plate. The pin can be designed in such a way that the pin both fastens the scoop and at the same time serves as a chain Om Therefore, no additional components are required to fasten the scoop on the chain, the grain conveyor chain is lighter than comparable grain conveyor chains and is additionally producible more cost-effectively.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, each scoop can be fastened on the chain by means of two pins. This makes the chain-scoop connection more stable, the pins serve at the same time as chain pins of the chain link on which the scoop is fastened. Further components for fastening the scoop on the chain are not required.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the scoop can have a fastening element, through which a pin for fastening the scoop on the standard chain element is guided. The pin can be designed in such a way that the pin both fastens the scoop and at the same time serves as a chain pin. Therefore, no additional components are required to fasten the scoop on the chain.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, a first reinforcement can be arranged on the fastening element. The first reinforcement reinforces the fastening element in such a way that a pin that can be guided through the fastening elements only has little play and the scoop is thus fastenable without play on a standard chain element of the chain by the pin.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the first reinforcement can be made of a different material than the scoop surface of the scoop. The scoop surface is advantageously formed from a plastic which can be produced cost-effectively, for example, by means of injection molding.
