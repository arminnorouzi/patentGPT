The rotor can be rigidly connected to a driving and/or driven shaft and can form part of a rotary electric machine in the form of an alternator, an electric motor or a reversible machine of the alternator-starter type that can operate in the two modes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The stator is mounted in a housing configured to rotatably support the shaft on bearings by means of roller bearings. The rotor is, for example, of the &#x201c;claw rotor&#x201d; type, and comprises two pole wheels each having claws nested one inside the other in order to form the poles and a core, around which a rotor coil is wound. According to another example, the rotor comprises a body formed by a stack of layers of metal sheets held in the form of a packet by means of a suitable fastening system. The rotor comprises poles that are formed, for example, by permanent magnets housed in cavities provided in the magnetic mass of the rotor. Alternatively, in an architecture called salient pole architecture, the poles are formed by coils wound around arms of the rotor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a packet of metal sheets and a winding of a stator as a perspective view according to the prior art.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows part of the packet of metal sheets and the winding of the stator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as a perspective view.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a stator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> further comprising an interconnector as a perspective view according to the prior art.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the stator <b>100</b> comprises a stator body <b>110</b> formed by a stack of thin metal sheets forming a crown, the inner face of which is provided with slots <b>111</b> that are radially open inwardly in order to accommodate a winding <b>120</b> formed by phase windings. These phase windings of the winding <b>120</b> pass through the slots <b>111</b> of the stator body and form a bundle <b>125</b>, <b>126</b> on either side of the stator body <b>110</b>. The phase windings of the winding <b>120</b> are polyphase windings, connected as a star or a triangle shape, with one end of each phase winding of the winding forming a phase output <b>123</b> and each phase output <b>123</b> is connected to an electrical control module and the other end of each phase winding of the winding forms a connection point <b>122</b> that is either connected together in the case of a star-shaped assembly forming the neutral point or is connected to a phase output <b>123</b> of another winding in the case of a triangle-shaped assembly.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The phase windings of the winding <b>120</b> are obtained from conductive elements in the form of pins <b>121</b>. A pin <b>121</b> has two branches connected by a curved head, or collateral portion, and the intermediate rectilinear portions, or central portions, of which are placed in two different slots that are angularly offset from each other by a predetermined angle. The heads of the pins <b>121</b> are twisted and form the upper bundle <b>125</b>. The phase windings of the winding <b>120</b> in this example further comprise an end half-pin comprising a single branch. The upper bundle is provided with the ends of the half-pins forming the phase outputs and the connection points are neutral points in this example. The free ends of the branches of the pins are connected together, for example, by welding, and are twisted in order to form the lower bundle <b>126</b>, namely the bundle downstream of the winding.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The pins <b>121</b> are electrically connected together. Two pins <b>121</b> of the same winding are directly connected together by welding, for example. In this example, each phase winding <b>120</b> comprises an inversion pin <b>130</b> connecting one end <b>121</b><i>a </i>of one pin to one end <b>121</b><i>b </i>of another pin of the winding, in particular of the same phase winding <b>120</b>. In general, the inversion pins <b>130</b> are located above the upper bundle, i.e. in the axial extension of the winding, so as to connect two pins.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Each phase winding <b>120</b> therefore comprises two winding ends having a phase output <b>124</b> and a connection point <b>122</b>. The winding therefore comprises a plurality of winding ends <b>124</b>, <b>122</b>. When the phase windings are connected as a star shape, the connection point is a neutral point. When the phase windings are connected as a triangle shape, the connection point is a point for connecting two separate windings in order to form the triangle connection. The stator winding therefore comprises a plurality of connection points <b>122</b> and a plurality of phase outputs <b>124</b> distributed along a periphery of the stator <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the case of the star-shaped assembly, the connection points <b>122</b> of the same phase system must be connected together while ensuring electrical isolation with the phase outputs <b>124</b> in order to maintain the power supply to the stator winding. To this end, the stator <b>100</b> generally comprises an electrical connection component, also called an interconnector <b>140</b>, that electrically connects the connection points <b>122</b> together while avoiding the phase outputs <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The interconnector is mounted on the winding. It comprises at least one trace having trace ends that are each electrically connected to one of the neutral points <b>122</b> of the winding in order to connect them together.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The footprint of the interconnector created a proximity between the housing (not shown) and the trace ends in particular. Such proximity generates a risk of contact between the housing and the trace ends leading to a short circuit.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, assembling the interconnector with the winding requires precise installation, particularly radially, of the interconnector, as well as axially and angularly, and also requires that said component is properly held in position throughout the entire duration of the assembly method with the neutral points <b>122</b>, which makes the manufacturing method difficult.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The radial direction is the direction transverse to the X-axis of the machine, and the axial direction is the direction of the X-axis of the machine.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An axial surface is understood to mean a surface that extends parallel to the axis of the machine. The axial surface can be cylindrical or flat, for example.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A radial surface is understood to mean a surface that extends in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the machine.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A winding end is understood to mean an end of a conductor of the winding, for example, a phase, a neutral, or even an end of a conductor changing the repeated profile of the winding, such as the end of an inversion half-pin.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The inner element, for two adjacent elements along the X-axis, is understood to mean the element closest to the axis and the outer element is understood to mean the element farthest from the axis. The lower surface will be the surface axially closest to the winding and the upper surface will be the surface axially farthest from the winding.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The invention provides a solution for maintaining the radial clearance between the interconnector and the housing, in particular, and for facilitating the operation involving assembling the interconnector with the winding.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In order to address the aforementioned problems, the applicant proposes a stator of a rotary electric machine in which the interconnector comprises means for positioning and for holding the position for the assembly operation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a first aspect, the invention

id="p-0032" num="0031">According to one embodiment, the interconnector is symmetrical relative to a plane containing the X-axis and angularly intersecting the middle of the interconnector and a plane transverse to the X-axis and axially intersecting the interconnector.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to one embodiment, the positioning means is a positioning lug radially extending from the

partially overmolded over the traces, is described in detail hereafter, with reference to the appended drawings. These embodiments illustrate the features and advantages of the invention. However, it should be noted that the invention is not limited to these embodiments. In particular, for example, the interconnector can comprise only one trace and can be an inverted interconnector, the trace ends of which are connected to two half-pins in order to form an inverted pin connected to two other pins of a winding, or even can be a phase interconnector for connecting two phase outputs of a winding with a star-shaped assembly. Throughout the remainder of the description, the neutral point interconnector is called interconnector.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the figures, identical elements are identified using identical reference signs.

The conductors are pins, for example. The winding also could be wired. As previously explained, the winding <b>2</b> comprises an upper bundle <b>21</b>A and a lower bundle <b>21</b>B (not shown) at each end of the stator body <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The winding <b>2</b> of the stator A comprises winding ends <b>22</b> (not shown in the figures) axially extending beyond the upper bundle <b>21</b>A from the stator body <b>1</b>, thus passing through the upper bundle <b>21</b>A.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The winding <b>2</b> is a star-shaped winding, for example. The winding ends <b>22</b> comprise neutral points <b>22</b>N and phase outputs <b>22</b>P. The winding also could be a triangle-shaped winding.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, each winding end <b>22</b> forming a phase output <b>22</b>P is connected to a terminal <b>220</b><i>p </i>in order to be connected to an electronic power unit, but can also be directly connected to another power interconnector by welding, for example.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The winding ends <b>22</b> forming the phase outputs <b>22</b>P particularly axially protrude from the interconnector <b>3</b> and are also insulated by an insulator <b>221</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an interconnector <b>3</b> is mounted in the extension of the bundles <b>21</b>A.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the examples shown, the interconnector <b>3</b> is preferably positioned in the axial extension of the upper bundle <b>21</b>A in order to limit the radial footprint, with it being understood that offset positions can be contemplated for advantages other than the footprint.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The interconnector <b>3</b> comprises one or more electrically conductive elements called traces <b>30</b>, for example, made of copper, overmolded with an electrically insulating material forming an insulating casing, called insulating body <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the illustrated embodiment, the interconnector <b>3</b> comprises two traces <b>30</b>, each having two trace ends <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The traces <b>30</b>, also called tracks, predominantly extend inside the insulating body <b>31</b> and the trace ends <b>300</b> are, outside said insulating body <b>31</b>, electrically connected to the winding ends <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows greater details of the trace ends <b>300</b> of each of the traces <b>30</b> radially extending out of said insulating body <b>31</b> in order to each form the connection output with a neutral point <b>22</b>N of a three-phase system.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Thus, the phase windings of the stator form, at each end thereof, a winding neutral point <b>22</b>N, and these neutral points are connected to each other by means of the interconnector <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">More specifically, each trace end <b>300</b> radially extends out of the body <b>31</b>, forming an angle of the order of 90&#xb0; with the insulating body <b>31</b>. Each trace end <b>300</b> is connected, for example, by laser welding or electric welding, to a neutral point <b>22</b>N.

A welding operation, for example, electric or laser welding, ensures the electrical connection between the neutral point <b>22</b>N and each of the trace ends <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The insulating body <b>31</b> made of electrically insulating and heat-resistant material of the interconnector <b>3</b> of the winding can be positioned, as in the illustrated example, in abutment on the upper bundle <b>21</b>A of the stator. The insulating body <b>31</b> comprises an upper radial bearing surface and a lower radial bearing surface, with the lower surface <b>310</b> being in contact with the bundle. Such positioning of the interconnector on the bundle of the winding allows the footprint generated by the presence of the interconnector <b>3</b> to be limited and allows the vibrations generated on said interconnector by the rotary electric machine to be limited.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The insulating body <b>31</b> also advantageously comprises an inner axial surface and an outer axial surface, with the trace ends <b>300</b> extending from the outer axial surface.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a first embodiment, the positioning means <b>35</b> is a positioning wall. Such a wall is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Said positioning wall <b>35</b> radially extends from the interconnector body <b>31</b>. The wall extends by axially projecting relative to the interconnector body <b>31</b>, at least toward the lower bearing surface <b>310</b>, into a projecting portion <b>350</b>.

The bearing part of the bundle <b>230</b> is an inversion pin portion <b>23</b>, for example. The bearing part <b>3500</b> has an axial surface in radial abutment on an axial surface of the pin. The lower radial surface <b>310</b> of the interconnector body is in axial abutment on a radial surface of the pin <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The positioning wall <b>35</b> is advantageously molded with the interconnector body, for example.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As an alternative embodiment for another type of winding, the positioning wall <b>35</b> is in radial abutment on an axial surface of an end part of the bundle forming a bearing portion <b>230</b> and the insulating body <b>31</b> is in axial abutment on a radial surface of an end part of the bundle <b>21</b>A.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As an alternative embodiment of this embodiment, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the interconnector <b>3</b> comprises two positioning walls <b>35</b>, <b>35</b>&#x2032;, for which at least one portion projecting from a positioning wall <b>350</b> comprises a bearing part <b>3500</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, having an axial surface in radial abutment on an axial surface of a bearing portion <b>230</b> of the bundle.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the case of a pin winding, the upper bundle <b>21</b>A comprises two bearing portions <b>230</b> per three-phase system, formed by two of the three inversion pins <b>23</b> of the three-phase system. Each positioning wall <b>35</b>, <b>35</b>&#x2032; comprises a bearing part <b>3500</b> in radial abutment on an axial surface of the corresponding pin bearing portion <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Given the footprint and thermal constraints in the case of a three-phase double system in particular, in which each of the six winding ends forming a neutral point <b>22</b>N is assembled on at least one trace end of the interconnector, two interconnectors with a small angular extension are used instead of a single interconnector with a greater angular extension. Each small interconnector is used to connect one of the two three-phase systems.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The two interconnectors <b>3</b> are substantially positioned on either side of the circumference of the upper bundle <b>21</b>A, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, with each connecting three neutral points <b>22</b>N. The term &#x201c;connected&#x201d; is understood to mean physically and not only electrically, in other words intended to be directly electrically connected without having to pass through other pins.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Each interconnector <b>3</b> is advantageously symmetrical relative to a plane containing the X-axis and angularly intersecting the middle of the interconnector <b>3</b> and a plane transverse to the X-axis and axially intersecting the interconnector <b>3</b>. In other words, the traces <b>30</b>, the trace ends <b>300</b>, the insulating body <b>31</b>, the positioning means(s) <b>35</b> are symmetrical relative to a plane containing the X-axis and angularly intersecting the middle of the interconnector and a plane transverse to the X-axis and axially intersecting the interconnector.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The two small interconnectors thus can be interchanged. In addition, since the interconnector <b>3</b> is reversible, mounting the interconnector on the winding will therefore be simplified.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Thus, the two radial surfaces <b>310</b> of the insulating body <b>31</b> of each one of the interconnectors <b>3</b> are symmetrical relative to a radial plane, with one of the two radial surfaces <b>310</b> being in axial abutment against the two bearing portions <b>230</b> of the two inversion pins <b>23</b>, as previously described.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Each positioning wall <b>35</b> is symmetrical relative to a radial plane passing through the middle of the axially measured height of the interconnector <b>3</b>. Thus, the interconnector <b>3</b> can be equally mounted on one side and on the other side in order to connect to the neutral point <b>22</b>N of a three-phase system on the bundle.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the case of two positioning means <b>35</b>, they are also symmetrical relative to each other relative to an axial plane passing through the middle between the opposite trace ends <b>300</b>, i.e. angularly intersecting in the middle thereof. Thus, the interconnector can be equally mounted on one side and on the other side on the bundle.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to a second embodiment of the stator A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the interconnector <b>3</b> comprises at least one positioning means <b>35</b> formed by a pair of positioning walls <b>35</b><i>a </i>and <b>35</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The walls <b>35</b><i>a </i>and <b>35</b><i>b </i>are symmetrical relative to each other relative to the radial plane intersecting the interconnector body in the middle of the axial height thereof. Thus, the previously described symmetry for the interconnector is maintained.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">When assembling the interconnector <b>3</b> with the winding <b>2</b>, only one of the two walls <b>35</b><i>a </i>or <b>35</b><i>b </i>of a pair has its projecting portion <b>350</b> in contact with the bearing portion <b>230</b> of the bundle.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Each wall of the pair radially extends from the outer axial surface of the insulating body and extends by axially projecting relative to the interconnector body</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In this example, the interconnector <b>3</b> comprises two positioning means <b>35</b>, <b>35</b>&#x2032; or two pairs of walls <b>35</b><i>a, </i><b>35</b><i>b </i>and <b>35</b>&#x2032;<i>a, </i><b>35</b>&#x2032;<i>b. </i>The two pairs are symmetrical relative to each other relative to an axial plane passing through the middle between the opposite trace ends <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In a third embodiment, the positioning means is a positioning lug <b>36</b> radially extending from the axial surface of the body <b>31</b> of the interconnector. The lug advantageously extends, for example, from the outer axial surface of the body, i.e. on the same side as the trace ends <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The lug <b>36</b> comprises a shape, for example, an opening, adapted to engage with a tool for holding the interconnector in position on the winding.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The lug <b>36</b> also can be symmetrical in a radial plane in order to allow the interconnector <b>3</b> to be held in two ways. The interconnector can also comprise two positioning pins that are symmetrical relative to an axial plane in order to allow it to be held with two branches of a tool in two ways, thereby simplifying the manufacture of the stator.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The method for assembling an interconnector <b>3</b> comprising at least one positioning wall <b>35</b> on the bundle comprises positioning the interconnector on the winding by positioning the trace ends <b>300</b> opposite the winding ends <b>22</b> forming the neutral points <b>22</b>N of a three-phase system and the at least one wall in radial abutment on a bearing portion of the bundle of the winding, i.e. the bearing part <b>3500</b> of the wall <b>35</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, is radially in abutment against the bearing portion <b>230</b> of the inversion pin <b>23</b>. Bearing the positioning wall <b>35</b> on the bearing portion <b>230</b> ensures that the clearance is provided between the casing in which the stator is mounted and the trace ends. A short-circuiting risk is thus avoided. The lower radial surface <b>310</b> of the insulating body <b>31</b> is also positioned against the radial surface <b>230</b> of two inversion pins <b>23</b>. The interconnector <b>3</b> positioned thus is advantageously wedged and radially and axially positioned, which limits the risk of any offset between the interconnector <b>3</b> and the winding during assembly. The three winding ends forming the neutral points <b>22</b>N of a three-phase system are assembled by connecting each of the two neutral points <b>22</b>N of the three-phase system that are angularly farthest apart from each other to the trace ends <b>300</b> that are angularly farthest apart from each other and the neutral point <b>22</b>N located between the other two neutral points <b>22</b>N is connected to the two trace ends that are closest to each other.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the case whereby the interconnector <b>3</b> comprises at least one positioning lug <b>36</b>, the interconnector <b>3</b> is positioned on the winding <b>2</b> by assembling the lug <b>36</b> with a tool for holding and positioning the interconnector <b>3</b> on the winding. The assembly between the trace ends <b>300</b> and the neutral points <b>22</b>N is then carried out before removing the tool.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The lug radially extending from the interconnector body advantageously can be replaced by a hole axially perforated in the body of the interconnector.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The above description focuses on a winding connected as a star shape. Of course, replacing the star-shaped coupling with a triangle-shape coupling does not depart from the scope of the invention, with the neutral points then being replaced by phase outputs <b>22</b>P and the interconnector <b>3</b> is identical, for example, to that described except in that it comprises a single trace and two trace ends allowing two phase windings to be connected together in order to form the triangle connections.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Furthermore, whether a star- or triangle-shaped winding is involved, the inversion pins <b>23</b> can be produced by two conductors each comprising a winding end <b>22</b> connected to each other by means of an interconnector as described, except that it comprises a single trace and two trace ends. The conductors can be half-pins, such as those comprising neutral points and phases.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Even though it has been described by means of a certain number of examples, alternative embodiments and embodiments, the rotary electric machine according to the invention comprises various variations, modifications and improvements that will become clearly apparent to a person skilled in the art, with it being understood that these variations, modifications and improvements form part of the scope of the invention, as defined by the following claims. For example, replacing the plurality of welded together electrical conductors that form the winding with continuous wires with a round or rectangular cross-section does not depart from the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Obviously, the invention will not be limited to the winding with pins, and can be applied to any type of winding.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
