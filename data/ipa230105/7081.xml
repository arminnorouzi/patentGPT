Methane sources that leak into the atmosphere may include oil and gas industry infrastructure (e.g., equipment and industrial sites for production, processing, transmission, storage, and distribution), as well as agricultural sites, landfills, and abandoned oil and gas fields. There are a variety of methane-sensing technologies being deployed, with varying sensitivities, spatial and temporal resolution, and price of acquisition. These technologies include satellites, aerial surveys, Internet of Things (IoT) sensor grids, unmanned vehicles, and other sensors. Satellite data, for example, from Sentinel-5P TROPOMI may have coarse spatial resolution and low methane detection sensitivity but near-daily global coverage. Aircraft surveys, on the other hand, may provide a much richer picture of an area of interest with higher spatial resolution, but such surveys are intermittent. Ground sensors may provide real-time data streams, but may have a high cost associated with deploying sensor grids to cover large swaths of land.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is with respect to these and other general considerations that aspects have been described.

These aspects may be combined, other aspects may be utilized, and structural changes may be made without departing from the present disclosure. Aspects may be practiced as methods, systems, or devices. Accordingly, aspects may take the form of a hardware implementation, an entirely software implementation, or an implementation combining software and hardware aspects. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present disclosure is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present disclosure describes various examples of a computing device that determines locations for placement of pollutant sensors. For example, the computing device receives data from pollutant source, environmental sensors, and/or external data sources and determines suitable locations for placement of pollutant sensors. In some aspects, the computing device also determines a number of pollutant sensors to be placed and/or characteristics of the pollutant sensors. The characteristics may include detection type, pollutant detection sensitivities, spatial resolution, temporal resolution, purchase cost, maintenance cost, and/or other suitable characteristics. In some scenarios, the pollutant sensors detect the presence or measure levels of pollutants such as methane or other greenhouse gases.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">This and many further aspects of a computing device are described herein. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a block diagram of an example of an environmental sensor system <b>100</b> (hereinafter, &#x201c;system <b>100</b>&#x201d;) configured to determine locations for placement of pollutant sensors <b>160</b>, according to an example embodiment. The environmental sensor system <b>100</b> comprises a computing device <b>110</b>, one or more pollutant sources <b>120</b>, and one or more environmental sensors <b>130</b>. In some aspects, the system <b>100</b> also includes one or more data sources <b>140</b>. At least some of the computing device <b>110</b>, pollutant sources <b>120</b>, environmental sensors <b>130</b>, and data sources <b>140</b> may be communicatively coupled by a network <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Computing device <b>110</b> may be any type of computing device, including a mobile computer or mobile computing device (e.g., a Microsoft&#xae; Surface&#xae; device, a laptop computer, a notebook computer, a tablet computer such as an Apple iPad&#x2122;, a netbook, etc.), or a stationary computing device such as a desktop computer or PC (personal computer). In some aspects, computing device <b>110</b> is a network server, cloud server, or other suitable distributed computing system. Computing device <b>110</b> may be configured to execute one or more software applications (or &#x201c;applications&#x201d;) and/or services and/or manage hardware resources (e.g., processors, memory, etc.), which may be utilized by users (e.g., customers) of the computing device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The pollutant sources <b>120</b> may comprise ground locations, buildings, equipment (e.g., fixed industrial equipment), that may leak one or more pollutants, in various aspects. In general, a pollutant as used herein is a substance that has undesired effects on an environment, or adversely affects the usefulness of a resource or device. In some aspects, the pollutants may include greenhouse gases (GHG) such as methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, carbon dioxide, or other gases that contribute to a &#x201c;greenhouse effect.&#x201d; In other aspects, the pollutants may include carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, other gases, liquids (e.g., gasoline, kerosene), vapors, aerosols, particulate matter (e.g., soot from internal combustion engines, coal dust), or other chemicals and compounds. In still other aspects, the pollutants may be other substances, even those generally considered beneficial (such as breathable oxygen or potable water), that are being emitted in an undesirable area, such as water leaks from a device that generates or filters water, or oxygen leaks from a pressurized habitat for humans. In some embodiments, the pollutant sources <b>120</b> are carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) sites and the pollutant sensors <b>160</b> are placed for leak monitoring and/or air quality monitoring for volatile organic compounds or other pollutants.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">For ease of discussion, the aspects herein are described with methane as a pollutant. Accordingly, the pollutant sources <b>120</b> may include oil and gas industry infrastructure (e.g., equipment and industrial sites for production, processing, transmission, storage, and distribution), as well as agricultural sites, landfills, and abandoned oil and gas fields. Examples of oil and gas infrastructure include pipelines, tank batteries, compressor stations, well pads, their supporting equipment, and the like.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The pollutant sources <b>120</b> are generally spread out over a geographic region or region of interest, such as geographic region <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Each pollutant source <b>120</b> may leak pollutants at varying levels and times. Generally, emissions from different pollutant sources <b>120</b> may have different characteristics when analyzed using time series data. The emissions from pneumatic controllers, chemical injection pumps, and/or from water flashing (e.g., release of methane dissolved in water when released to the atmosphere) may exhibit short term temporal variability, long term variability, and/or diurnal periodicity, in various scenarios. For example, a pollutant source <b>120</b> may emit a constant, low level of methane over time. As another example, where the pollutant source <b>120</b> is a compressor that compresses methane into liquid form, it may have an intermittent, moderate level leak that begins when pressure exceeds a limit of a valve seal. As yet another example, where the pollutant source <b>120</b> is a pipeline that transfers methane gas, it may have a leak that starts after a long period of time without leaks (e.g., beginning to leak after several years in service).

In some aspects, the environmental sensors <b>130</b> provide different measurements at two or more heights (e.g., with multiple readings at different times), for example, at ground level, cloud level, every 50 meters, etc. Moreover, some environmental sensors <b>130</b> may provide data with different temporal resolutions, for example, providing measurements in real-time, five minute intervals, every four hours, daily, monthly, etc. In the aspects described herein with respect to methane as the pollutant, the environmental sensors <b>130</b> may comprise optical gas imaging cameras (forward looking infrared, nondispersive infrared), catalytic detection sensors, satellites, aerial surveys, Internet of Things (IoT) sensor grids, unmanned vehicles (e.g., aerial drones or ground-based vehicles), fixed sensors attached to the pollutant sources <b>120</b>, or other suitable sensors.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Some environmental sensors <b>130</b> may be located within a vicinity of, coupled with, or integral to a pollutant source <b>120</b>.

In some embodiments, the deployment processor <b>116</b> determines one or more of a number of pollutant sensors <b>160</b>, locations of the pollutant sensors <b>160</b>, and/or characteristics of the pollutant sensors <b>160</b>. As one example, the deployment processor <b>116</b> determines a number of pollutant sensors <b>160</b> and locations for their placement to meet a desired level of detectability (e.g., detect leaks greater than 5 kg per hour) at a desired cost (e.g., $100,000 for sensors and installation). As another example, the deployment processor <b>116</b> determines a first number of high sensitivity sensors, a second number of low sensitivity sensors, and their respective locations to meet a desired level of detectability at a desired cost. Example characteristics of the pollutant sensors <b>160</b> may include detection type (e.g., infrared, gas spectrometry, etc.), pollutant detection sensitivities (e.g., 100 parts per million, 500 parts per million, etc.), spatial resolution (50 meters, 1000 meters, etc.), temporal resolution (real-time, 5 minute intervals, 4 hours, daily, monthly), purchase cost, maintenance cost, and/or other suitable characteristics.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Generally, the deployment processor <b>116</b> is configured to determine a sensor configuration (e.g., the number, locations, and/or characteristics of the pollutant sensors <b>160</b>) to detect pollutant leaks or related anomalies. In some scenarios, the deployment processor <b>116</b> determines an optimal sensor configuration for a given set of constraints (e.g., price, detectability of the pollutant, etc.). The deployment processor <b>116</b> may be configurable to determine a sensor configuration based on adjustable criteria, for example, a number of simultaneous leaks that may be detected, a severity of leaks that can be detected (e.g., 1 kg/hr, 100 kg/hr), time until a leak is detected, likelihood of detection for leaks that exceed a safety threshold (e.g., likelihood of detecting a 100 kg/hr leak) within a predetermined time period (e.g., within 2 hours, 3 days, etc.), cost of the pollutant sensors <b>160</b>, installation cost of the pollutant sensors <b>160</b>, whether adjacent equipment (i.e., pollutant sources <b>120</b>) need to be turned off or disabled for installation and/or maintenance of the pollutant sensor <b>160</b>, and/or other suitable criteria. For example, a moderate leak may take several hours to reach detectable levels of a low-cost 1000 part per million (ppm) pollutant sensor <b>160</b>, while a more expensive 100 ppm pollutant sensor <b>160</b> may detect the moderate leak within 10 minutes. Moreover, a large network of inexpensive pollutant sensors <b>160</b> may require a large labor cost for installation and maintenance, while similar performance in detectability may be achieved with fewer, but higher quality pollutant sensors <b>160</b>. The deployment processor <b>116</b> may also select a pollutant sensor <b>160</b> based on its suitability for a particular sub-region in which it will be placed (i.e., an operating environment). For example, optical gas imaging cameras may be less susceptible to sensor poisoning but more sensitive to moisture and are generally more expensive to operate than a catalytic detection sensor, which may be subject to sensor poisoning but be less expensive to purchase and can resist higher humidity.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The deployment processor <b>116</b> may be configured to determine a sensor configuration where a set of leaks to be detected is as disjoint as possible (i.e., spread out over a large area within geographic region <b>200</b>), but where the set of leaks to be detected also contains the biggest leaks that may occur. In some scenarios, the deployment processor <b>116</b> determines a new sensor configuration based on an existing sensor configuration and adds new pollutant sensors <b>160</b>, moves existing pollutant sensors <b>160</b>, and/or replaces existing pollutant sensors <b>160</b> with different models. In some scenarios, there may be a preferred minimum distance between a sensor and equipment the sensor is configured to monitor, for example, to allow for installation, maintenance, and/or replacement of the pollutant sensor <b>160</b> without disrupting operation of the equipment itself (e.g., turning off the equipment to install the pollutant sensor <b>160</b>).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some aspects, the deployment processor <b>116</b> determines flight paths for drones and/or aerial vehicles that carry the pollutant sensors <b>160</b>, orbital paths for satellites that carry the pollutant sensors <b>160</b>, and/or ground paths for wheeled or tracked vehicles that carry the pollutant sensors <b>160</b>.

In other words, the deployment processor <b>116</b> is configured to identify sub-regions having similar dispersion effects for an entire season (i.e., spring, summer, fall, winter, dry season, monsoon season, etc.), or several seasons. In another embodiment, the deployment processor <b>116</b> identifies sub-regions having similar characteristics over a fixed period, such as 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, etc. These approaches provide for improved sensor placement in that a location of a pollutant sensor <b>160</b> will be more relevant for a longer duration of the year, as opposed to extreme weather events, for example, only during or shortly after a rain storm or high wind event.
