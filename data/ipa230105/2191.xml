The invention further relates to an elevator system having such a control device.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Elevators such as passenger or freight elevators are usually equipped with a safety circuit. Such a safety circuit typically comprises a series connection of safety-relevant switches, at least one of which can be opened under certain operating conditions, for example when the elevator is put into inspection mode, a fault is detected or a car door, shaft door, maintenance door or maintenance hatch is opened. If the safety circuit is interrupted, the elevator is brought to a standstill by a drive of the elevator being switched off and a braking device for braking the elevator being activated. For example, as door switches, the switches monitor the closing states of elevator doors, i.e., a car door and a plurality of shaft doors, so that it can be ensured that an elevator car can only be moved when all the elevator doors are closed and assigned door switches are thus actuated.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When the elevator is in inspection mode, for example for repair or maintenance purposes, the safety circuit is usually interrupted, for example because a corresponding switch in the safety circuit was opened by putting the elevator into inspection mode or a shaft door had to be opened so that a technician could enter an elevator shaft through the shaft door. In order to still be able to operate the elevator, open contacts of the safety circuit can be closed via an inspection path. The inspection path can be closed via a multi-button inspection control means. In order to move the elevator in inspection mode, for example, a first operating button for enabling a travel movement and a second operating button for specifying a travel direction must be pressed simultaneously. If one of the operating buttons is released, the inspection path, and thus the safety circuit, is immediately interrupted again, which results in immediate activation of the braking device and relatively abrupt braking of the elevator. As a result, forces which place a heavy load on the load-bearing elements of the elevator can occur. The forces can cause vibrations which affect the maintenance personnel and their processes, such as the precise positioning of the car.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A safety circuit in an elevator system is described in EP 2 493 802 B1. The safety circuit comprises at least one series connection of safety-relevant contacts which are closed during interference-free operation of the elevator system. At least one of the contacts can be bridged by means of semiconductor switches, the semiconductor switches being able to be controlled by means of at least one processor and being able to be monitored for short circuits by means of at least one monitoring circuit. Furthermore, the safety circuit comprises at least one electromechanical relay circuit having relay contacts connected in series with the contacts of the bridgeable series circuit. The relay circuit can be controlled by means of the processor. The bridgeable series circuit can be interrupted by means of the relay contacts in the event of a short circuit in the semiconductor switches.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the invention is that of improving the braking behavior of an elevator when opening a safety circuit of the elevator, in particular during an inspection. The prior art deals with safely interrupting the bridging path because the car is moving into an unsafe condition. The aim of the invention is that of stopping a car movement in inspection mode. There is no urgency here.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The stated object is achieved by way of a control device and an elevator system according to the advantageous embodiments that are defined in the following description.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first aspect of the invention relates to a control device for controlling an elevator system in inspection mode. The elevator system comprises a safety circuit having at least one safety contact, which is open in inspection mode, and an inspection path for bridging the at least one safety contact. The control device comprises a first operating element for operating the elevator system in inspection mode, a second operating element for operating the elevator system in inspection mode, and a first switching unit which has a first contact and a first delay means and is designed to close the first contact in response to an actuation of the first operating element and to open the first contact in response to a release of the first operating element. The first delay means is designed to delay opening of the first contact by a defined first delay time after the release of the first operating element. The control device further comprises a second switching unit which is connected in parallel with the first switching unit, has a second contact and a second delay means and is designed to close the second contact in response to an actuation of the second operating element and to open the second contact in response to a release of the second operating element. The second delay means is designed to delay opening of the second contact by a defined second delay time after the release of the second operating element. The first contact and the second contact are connected in series in the inspection path.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Such a control device makes it possible to activate a braking device of the elevator system with a time delay for releasing at least one of the two operating buttons of the inspection control means. This delay can be used to stop the elevator system in a controlled manner by controlling a drive of the elevator system before the elevator system is braked mechanically by the braking device. As a result, the load on load-bearing elements of the elevator system can be reduced. Wear of brake disks and brake pads of the braking device can also be reduced. A further advantage is the increased comfort for the maintenance personnel, in particular when the maintenance personnel are on a car roof when the elevator system is being moved.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A safety circuit can be understood to mean a circuit of the elevator system that includes a series connection between a plurality of safety-relevant contacts. These safety contacts can be closed during normal mode so that the entire safety circuit is closed and thus, in particular, the elevator car can be moved. Under certain operating conditions, for example in the event of a fault or when the elevator system is put into inspection mode, at least one of the safety switches and thus the entire safety circuit can be opened, causing the elevator system to be shut down. In particular, emergency braking of the elevator system can be initiated when the safety circuit is interrupted.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An inspection path can be understood as a current path parallel to the series connection of the safety contacts. The inspection path can have a series connection between at least two switching contacts. The safety contacts can be bridged by closing all contacts in the inspection path.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">An operating element can generally be understood as a switch which is actuated by being touched or pressed by a finger or a hand and automatically returns to a rest position when the finger or hand is removed or when it is released. For example, the operating element can be a mechanical knob or button or a sensor button, such as a capacitive button or a Hall effect button.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first operating element and the second operating element can each be coupled to a programmable elevator control means of the elevator system. The elevator control means can be configured to detect a current switching state of the operating elements in each case and, depending on the switching state, to actuate a power converter of the elevator system.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, the first operating element can be a switch for enabling a travel movement of the elevator system and the second operating element can be a switch for specifying a direction of the travel movement.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first switching unit and the second switching unit can, for example, be constructed in the same way. The two switching units can comprise electromechanical and/or electronic components. In particular, the two switching units can be implemented entirely in hardware, for example in the form of electromechanical relays. As a result, the amount of testing required before an elevator system equipped with such a control device is put into operation can be reduced. However, it is also possible for at least one of the two switching units to be designed as a programmable electronic module, in particular as a PESSRAL module (PESSRAL=Programmable Electronic System in Safety Related Applications for Lifts), or as a component of such an electronics module.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Each of the contacts of the two switching units can be mechanical contacts or semiconductor contacts.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the simplest case, the two delay means can each be an additional capacitor for storing the electrical energy required to actuate the associated contacts. For example, the capacitor can be connected to the associated contacts in such a way that when the capacitor is discharged, the associated contacts can no longer be actuated either. Alternatively, the delay means can each be a (programmable) hardware or software module coupled to a suitable timer.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The first delay time and the second delay time can be the same or different.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A second aspect of the invention relates to an elevator system which comprises a safety circuit having at least one safety contact which is open when the elevator system is in inspection mode, an inspection path for bridging the at least one safety contact, and a control device as described above and below.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Possible features and advantages of embodiments of the invention can be considered, inter alia and without limiting the invention, to be based upon the concepts and findings described below.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to an embodiment, the elevator system has at least one elevator car, a drive for driving the at least one elevator car, a power converter for controlling a power supply of the drive and a braking device for braking the at least one elevator car, which braking device can be activated by interrupting the safety circuit. The first delay time and the second delay time can each be selected such that the at least one elevator car can be stopped by controlling the power supply to the drive before the braking device is activated.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">For example, the elevator control means can be configured to actuate the power converter as an immediate reaction to the release of at least one of the two operating elements in such a way that the drive is stopped. Accordingly, each of the delay times should not be shorter than the minimum time that the power converter needs to control the drive down to a standstill. Alternatively, the delay times can be selected in such a way that the at least one elevator car is not braked to a standstill, but rather is at least braked to a very low speed before the braking device is activated.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A braking device can be understood to mean a mechanical, for example electrically actuable, machine brake or a brake on the elevator car.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to an embodiment, the first delay time and the second delay time are each greater than 10 ms. The delay times can each also be significantly greater than 10 ms, for example greater than 20 ms, greater than 50 ms, greater than 100 ms, greater than 500 ms, greater than 1 s, greater than 1.5 s and/or up to 2 s.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to an embodiment, the control device can also have a third switching unit which is connected in parallel with the first switching unit and the second switching unit. The third switching unit can have a third contact and a third delay means and can be designed to close the third contact in response to the actuation of the first operating element and/or the second operating element and to open the third contact in response to the release of the first operating element and the second operating element. The third delay means can be designed to delay closing of the third contact by a defined third delay time after the actuation of the first operating element and/or the second operating element. The third contact can be connected in series with the first contact and the second contact in the inspection path.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As a result, the inspection path is always closed with a delay of a certain time, regardless of how small the time interval is between the actuation of the first operating element and the actuation of the second operating element. For example, if the third delay time is longer than the time interval between the actuation of the first operating element and the actuation of the second operating element, the inspection path can remain interrupted for a certain time, although both operating elements have already been actuated. A switch-on delay can thus be carried out.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to an embodiment, the third switching unit can be designed to prevent at least one of the three contacts in the inspection path from closing in the event of a fault in the third switching unit.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">This can prevent the inspection path from being able to be closed without a switch-on delay.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to an embodiment, the first switching unit can have a first control terminal and can be designed to close the first contact when a control signal is present at the first control terminal and to open the first contact when a control signal is not present at the first control terminal. The first operating element can be designed to connect the first control terminal to a signal source for providing the control signal in an actuated position and to disconnect the first control terminal from the signal source in a rest position. Accordingly, the first delay means can be designed to delay drop-out of the control signal at the first control terminal by the first delay time when the first control terminal is disconnected from the signal source.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A control signal can be understood to mean, for example, a current signal or a voltage signal. Accordingly, the signal source can be understood as an electrical energy source in the form of a power source or voltage source.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first control terminal can be, for example, a coil terminal of a relay or a gate or base terminal of a transistor.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to an embodiment, the second switching unit can have a second control terminal and can be designed to close the second contact when a control signal is present at the second control terminal and to open the second contact when a control signal is not present at the second control terminal. The second operating element can be designed to connect the second control terminal to a signal source for providing the control signal in an actuated position and to disconnect the first control terminal from the signal source in a rest position. Accordingly, the second delay means can be designed to delay drop-out of the control signal at the second control terminal by the second delay time when the second control terminal is disconnected from the signal source.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The second control terminal can be, for example, a coil terminal of a relay or a gate or base terminal of a transistor.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to an embodiment, the first switching unit can have a fourth contact and can be designed to open the fourth contact when the control signal is present at the first control terminal and to close the fourth contact when a control signal is not present at the first control terminal. The second switching unit can have a fifth contact and can be designed to open the fifth contact when the control signal is present at the second control terminal and to close the fifth contact when a control signal is not present at the second control terminal. The third switching unit can also have a third control terminal and can be designed to open the third contact when a control signal is present at the third control terminal and to close the third contact when a control signal is not present at the third control terminal. Accordingly, the third delay means can be designed to delay drop-out of the control signal at the third control terminal by the third delay time when the third control terminal is disconnected from a signal source for providing the control signal. The third control terminal can be connected to the signal source via the fourth contact and the fifth contact. The fourth contact and the fifth contact can be connected in series.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, the third delay means can comprise a capacitor which can provide electrical energy for actuating the third contact (or additional contacts) of the third switching unit. The third switching unit can be disconnected from the signal source by opening the fourth contact or the fifth contact so that the third switching unit is only supplied with electrical energy via the capacitor. A capacitance of the capacitor determines the third delay time. The third contact in the inspection path only closes when the capacitor is discharged. In other words, the two operating elements must be held simultaneously in their respective actuation positions for at least the duration of the third delay time in order for the inspection path to close.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to an embodiment, the first switching unit can have a sixth contact and can be designed to close the sixth contact when the control signal is present at the first control terminal and to open the sixth contact when a control signal is not present at the first control terminal. The third switching unit can also have a seventh contact and can be designed to close the seventh contact when the control signal is present at the third control terminal and to open the seventh contact when a control signal is not present at the third control terminal. The sixth contact can be connected between the first operating element and the first control terminal. The seventh contact can be arranged in a bridging path which bridges the sixth contact.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In other words, the first control terminal can only be connected to the signal source via the first operating element if the bridging path is closed. This is the case when the seventh contact is closed by the third switching unit. If the seventh contact cannot be closed for any reason, the first contact, which can be actuated via the first control terminal, can no longer be actuated, i.e., closed, either.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The first contact, the fourth contact and the sixth contact can, for example, be forcibly guided. In this case, the first switching unit can assume exactly two switching states. In a first switching state, the first contact and the sixth contact are open, while the fourth contact is closed. In a second switching state, the first contact and the sixth contact are closed, while the fourth contact is closed.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to an embodiment, the second switching unit can have an eighth contact and can be designed to close the eighth contact when the control signal is present at the second control terminal and to open the eighth contact when a control signal is not present at the second control terminal. The third switching unit can have a ninth contact and can be designed to close the ninth contact when the control signal is present at the second control terminal and to open the ninth contact when a control signal is not present at the third control terminal. The eighth contact can be connected between the second operating element and the second control terminal. The ninth contact can be arranged in a bridging path which bridges the eighth contact.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In other words, the second control terminal can only be connected to the signal source via the second operating element if the bridging path which bridges the eighth contact is closed. This is the case when the ninth contact is closed by the third switching unit. If the ninth contact cannot be closed for any reason, the second contact, which can be actuated via the second control terminal, can no longer be actuated, i.e., closed, either.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The second contact, the fifth contact and the eighth contact can, for example, be forcibly guided. In this case, the second switching unit can assume exactly two switching states. In a first switching state, the second contact and the eighth contact are open, while the fifth contact is closed. In a second switching state, the second contact and the eighth contact are closed, while the fifth contact is open.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Additionally or alternatively, for example, the third contact, the seventh contact and the ninth contact can be forcibly guided. In this case, the third switching unit can assume exactly two switching states. In a first switching state, the third contact is open, while the seventh contact and the ninth contact are closed. In a second switching state, the third contact is closed, while the seventh contact and the ninth contact are open.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to an embodiment, the first switching unit can be designed as a first electromechanical relay. Additionally or alternatively, the second switching unit can be designed as a second electromechanical relay. Additionally or alternatively, the third switching unit can be designed as a third electromechanical relay.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Such a relay can comprise a coil and an actuator electromagnetically coupled to the coil, for example in the form of a hinged armature or tie rod, the actuator being attracted when the coil is switched on and being moved back to a rest position, for example by means of spring force, when the coil is turned off. The actuator can be mechanically coupled to one or more contacts of the relay. If the relay comprises a plurality of contacts, the contacts can be forcibly guided via the actuator. This can prevent an NC contact (normally closed) and an NO contact (normally open) of the relay from being closed or opened at the same time, for example. A high degree of robustness of the control device can be achieved by means of this embodiment. In addition, the control device can be produced with relatively little complexity.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to an embodiment, the first delay means can comprise a capacitor which is connected in parallel with a coil of the first relay. Additionally or alternatively, the second delay means can comprise a capacitor which is connected in parallel with a coil of the second relay. Additionally or alternatively, the third delay means can comprise a capacitor which is connected in parallel with a coil of the third relay.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Each capacitance of the capacitors can be selected depending on the delay time to be achieved in each case. For example, the control device may be designed to connect the capacitor of the first relay to a power source in response to the actuation of the first operating element in order to charge the capacitor, and to disconnect both the capacitor and the coil of the first relay from the power source in response to the release of the first operating element. This ensures that the coil is supplied with electrical energy exclusively via the capacitor as soon as the first operating element is released. This can also apply analogously to the second relay.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Embodiments of the invention will be described below with reference to the attached drawings; neither the drawings nor the description should be interpreted as limiting to the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of an embodiment of an elevator system incorporating the invention.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a control device from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> when switched off.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the control device from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> when switched on.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the control device from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> when a first operating element is actuated.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the control device from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> when a second operating element is actuated.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the control device from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shortly after the first operating element and the second operating element have been actuated.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the control device from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> when the first operating element and the second operating element have been released.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an example of an embodiment of a first switching unit of the control device from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows an example of an embodiment of a second switching unit of the control device from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows an example of an embodiment of a third switching unit of the control device from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The drawings are merely schematic and not to scale.
