The 3GPP may define specifications for next generation mobile networks, systems and devices.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the name given to a project to improve the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile phone or device standard to cope with future requirements.

However, the scope of the present disclosure should not be limited in this regard. At least some aspects of the systems and methods disclosed herein may be utilized in other types of wireless communication systems.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A wireless communication device may be an electronic device used to communicate voice and/or data to a base station, which in turn may communicate with a network of devices (e.g., public switched telephone network (PSTN), the Internet, etc.). In de-scribing systems and methods herein, a wireless communication device may alternatively be referred to as a mobile station, a UE, an access terminal, a subscriber station, a mobile terminal, a remote station, a user terminal, a terminal, a subscriber unit, a mobile device, etc. Examples of wireless communication devices include cellular phones, smart phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), laptop computers, netbooks, e-readers, wireless modems, etc. In 3GPP specifications, a wireless communication device is typically referred to as a UE. However, as the scope of the present disclosure should not be limited to the 3GPP standards, the terms &#x201c;UE&#x201d; and &#x201c;wireless communication device&#x201d; may be used interchangeably herein to mean the more general term &#x201c;wireless communication device.&#x201d; A UE may also be more generally referred to as a terminal device.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In 3GPP specifications, a base station is typically referred to as a Node B, an evolved Node B (eNB), a gNB, a home enhanced or evolved Node B (HeNB) or some other similar terminology. As the scope of the disclosure should not be limited to 3GPP standards, the terms &#x201c;base station,&#x201d; &#x201c;Node B,&#x201d; &#x201c;eNB,&#x201d; &#x201c;gNB&#x201d; and &#x201c;HeNB&#x201d; may be used interchangeably herein to mean the more general term &#x201c;base station.&#x201d; Furthermore, the term &#x201c;base station&#x201d; may be used to denote an access point. An access point may be an electronic device that provides access to a network (e.g., Local Area Network (LAN), the Internet, etc.) for wireless communication devices. The term &#x201c;communication device&#x201d; may be used to denote both a wireless communication device and/or a base station.

It should also be noted that in E-UTRA and E-UTRAN overall description, as used herein, a &#x201c;cell (e.g., serving cell)&#x201d; may be defined as &#x201c;combination of downlink and optionally uplink resources.&#x201d; The linking between the carrier frequency of the downlink resources and the carrier frequency of the uplink resources may be indicated in the system information transmitted on the downlink resources.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The 5th generation communication systems, dubbed NR (New Radio technologies) by 3GPP, envision the use of time/frequency/space resources to allow for services, such as eMBB (enhanced Mobile Broad-Band) transmission, URLLC (Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communication) transmission, and eMTC (massive Machine Type Communication) transmission. And, in NR, transmissions for different services may be specified (e.g., configured) for one or more bandwidth parts (BWPs) in a serving cell and/or for one or more serving cells. A user equipment (UE) may perform a reception(s) of a downlink signal(s) and/or a transmission(s) of an uplink signal(s) in the BWP(s) of the serving cell(s).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In order for the services to use the time, frequency, and/or space resources efficiently, it would be useful to be able to efficiently control downlink and/or uplink transmissions.

Namely, for example, the gNB <b>160</b> may transmit, by using the RRC message, the first information. For example, the first information may be used for selection of a DMRS type to be used for DL (e.g., the PDSCH, the PDSCH transmission). For example, the UE <b>102</b> may assume that the DMRS for the PDSCH being mapped to physical resources (e.g., resource element(s)) based on the first information. Namely, a position(s) of the physical resource to which the DMRS for the PDSCH is mapped (e.g., a position of the DMRS for the PDSCH) may be determined based on the first information. Here, in a case that the first information is not configured (e.g., in a case that a field of the first information is absent (e.g., in a case that the first information is not present)), dmrs-Type=1 may be used (e.g., the UE may use dmrs-Type=1).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0058">Additionally or alternatively, for Table 1, 2, 3, and/or 4, maxLength may be information (e.g., second information) transmitted from the gNB <b>160</b> to the UE <b>102</b> by using the RRC message. Namely, for example, the gNB <b>160</b> may transmit, by using the RRC message, the second information. For example, the second information may be used for configuring (e.g., indicating) the maximum number of OFDM symbols for the DMRS for the PDSCH (e.g., DL front loaded DMRS (e.g., for the PDSCH)). For example, the UE <b>102</b> may determine a position(s) of a time domain of the DMRS for the PDSCH (e.g., duration for the DMRS for the PDSCH) based on the second information. Namely, a position(s) of the DMRS for the PDSCH may be determined based on the second information. Here, in a case that the second information is not configured (e.g., in a case that a field of the second information is absent (e.g., in a case that the second information is not present)), maxLength=1 may be used (e.g., the UE may use maxLength=1).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0059">As described, the number of bits for the DCI used for indicating the antenna ports(s) included in the DCI format 1_1 and/or the DCI format 1_X may be defined (e.g., configured) based on Tables 1, 2, 3, and/or 4. Namely, the number of bits for the DCI used for indicating the antenna port(s) included in the DCI format 1_1 and/or the DCI format 1_X may be determined based on the first information and/or the second information. For example, in a case that the first information (i.e., dmrs-Type)=1 is configured and the second information (i.e., maxLength)=1 is configured, the number of bits for the DCI used for indicating the antenna port(s) included in the DCI format 1_1 and/or the DCI format 1_X may be 4 bits.

For example, as the third information, the gNB <b>160</b> may transmit information used for configuring (e.g., indicating) 0 bit for the number of bits for the DCI used for indicating the antenna port(s) included in the DCI format 1_X. Namely, in a case that the third information (e.g., the information used for configuring 0 bit for the number of bits for the DCI used for indicating the antenna port(s)) is not configured, 4, 5, or 6 bits (e.g., determined based on the first information and the second information, as described above) may be used (e.g., configured, indicated) for the number of bits for the DCI used for indicating the antenna port(s) included in the DCI format 1_X. Additionally or alternatively, as the third information, the gNB <b>160</b> may transmit information used for configuring whether the number of bits for the DCI used for indicating the antenna port(s) included in the DCI format 1_X is 0 bit or more than 0 bit (e.g., 4, 5, or 6 bits). For example, as the third information, the gNB <b>160</b> may transmit the information used for configuring true (i.e., the number of bits for the DCI used for indicating the antenna port(s) included in the DCI format 1_X is 0 bit) or false (i.e., the number of bits for the DCI used for indicating the antenna port(s) included in the DCI format 1_X is more than 0 bit (e.g., 4, 5, or 6 bits)).
