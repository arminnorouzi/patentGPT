Rather than camp in a tent, some campers prefer a space enclosed by hard-sided walls. Potential solutions include large recreational vehicles (RVs) and camper trailers which are towed by a passenger vehicle. Camper trailers are smaller and more versatile than RVs and are easy to maneuver in the woods&#x2014;and through traffic on the way to the woods.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vehicles used to tow a camper trailer have historically been combustion-powered but with the availability of electric vehicles, a lower emission alternative is possible. Like combustion-powered vehicles, electric vehicles require energy replenishment as energy is used to propel the vehicle. As such, the range of an electric vehicle is determined by the capacity of the onboard energy storage.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The disclosure describes a mobile dwelling. The mobile dwelling includes a chassis supported by one or more axles each having a single degree of rotational freedom, a shelter frame mounted to the chassis, a plurality of panels supported on the shelter frame enclose a living space. Removably positioned within the chassis, a plurality of battery modules are operatively isolated from the one or more axles and are adapted to selectively output power for charging a battery pack of an electric tow vehicle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosure also describes a method for charging an electric vehicle. The method includes providing a mobile dwelling. The mobile dwelling has a chassis supported by one or more axles each having a single degree of freedom and a shelter frame mounted to the chassis. A plurality of panels supported on the shelter frame enclose a living space. A plurality of battery modules positioned within the chassis are operatively isolated from the one or more axles. The mobile dwelling is towed with an electric vehicle from a first location to a second location. The electric vehicle is operatively coupled with the battery modules and charged with the battery modules.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The summary above, as well as the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments, is better understood when read in conjunction with the appended drawings.

Although the preferred mode of carrying out the present disclosure has been disclosed, those skilled in the art would recognize that other embodiments for carrying out or practicing the present disclosure are also possible.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It should be noted that the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, and the like, herein do not denote any order, quantity, or importance, but rather are used to distinguish one element from another. Further, the terms &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an&#x201d; herein do not denote a limitation of quantity, but rather denote the presence of at least one of the referenced item.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Disclosed mobile dwellings are aerodynamic and light weight to reduce power drain on the towing electric vehicle yet are sufficiently insulated for four-season camping in temperate climates and, with a hard shell, protect against bears and other intruders. The arrangement of disclosed mobile dwellings allows a family of four to comfortably camp&#x2014;cooking, eating and sleeping in the wilderness.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">With their torque and efficiency, EV's are effective for hauling and towing. However, towing a trailer with an EV will reduce its mileage range. There are no camper trailers able to charge electric vehicles (EVs). Storing sufficient energy in a camper trailer to charge an EV substantially eliminates or at least partially addresses problems in the prior art enabling EV operators to extend their range during towing trips remote from roadside charging stations. For example, the EV range may be extended such that it meets or exceeds its range when not towing.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Additional aspects, advantages, features and objects of the present disclosure will be made apparent from the drawings and the detailed description of the illustrative embodiments construed in conjunction with the appended claims that follow.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It will be appreciated that features of the present disclosure are susceptible to being combined in various combinations without departing from the scope of the present disclosure as defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> illustrate an example energy-storing mobile dwelling <b>100</b>. Mobile dwelling <b>100</b> includes a chassis <b>130</b> supported by one or more axles configured for rotating in response to the mobile dwelling being moved by an external force. For example, the axles and/or any wheels coupled therewith may be configured for passive rotation without being powered directly by a source onboard the chassis.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The one or more axles may each have a single degree of rotational freedom. For example, with wheels <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> fixedly mounted thereto, the axles may be arranged to rotate only about their longitudinal axes and otherwise resist rotation about other axes such that they are not configured to be steered. In another example, the one or more axles may be fixed and have wheels <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> rotatably mounted thereto in which case, the axles have zero degrees of rotational freedom. In an alternative or addition, the one or more axles may be one or more spindles.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A tongue <b>131</b> is provided to or may be a part of chassis <b>130</b>. Mounted to tongue <b>131</b> is a coupler <b>132</b> configured for selective connection with a hitch of a tow vehicle thereby enabling mobile dwelling <b>100</b> to be towed or hauled between locations by the tow vehicle.

Fenders <b>133</b> and <b>135</b> may further include one or more storage compartments <b>134</b> and <b>136</b>. In an example, fender storage compartments <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> are selectively closeable with a hinged or sliding door and are suitable for storing or otherwise containing items such as shoes, propane, a heater, hot water, a shower, a cabin heater or an air conditioner. Mobile dwelling <b>100</b> may further include running boards <b>137</b> and <b>139</b> extending forward from fenders <b>133</b> and <b>135</b> under gullwing doors <b>151</b> and <b>156</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Mobile dwelling <b>100</b> may further include an additional gullwing door selectively enclosing an upper galley <b>175</b> and two bi-fold doors <b>163</b> and <b>165</b> configured to selectively enclose a lower galley <b>177</b> exterior to living space <b>170</b>. Galley <b>175</b> and lower galley <b>177</b> are configured to contain cooking and dining gear with sufficient room for charcoal, fire wood, camp stove, ice cooler, water, spices, french press, plates, etc.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Mobile dwelling <b>100</b> may further include a plurality of ladder rungs <b>162</b> provided at an exterior of one or more of panels <b>152</b> and <b>154</b> to facilitate access to the roof of the mobile dwelling.
