refractive error such as near-sightedness. Specifically, for example, minute spherical convex portions (substrate protruding portions in this specification) with a diameter of about 1 mm are formed on a convex surface, which is the object-side surface of the eyeglass lens. With an eyeglass lens, normally, luminous flux that has entered from the object-side surface is emitted from the eyeball-side surface and thus is focused on the wearer's retina. On the other hand, luminous flux that has passed through the minute convex portions is focused at a position closer to the object (front side) than the wearer's retina is. As a result, the progression of near-sightedness is suppressed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Document 1: US 2017/0131567A</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">If a coating film is formed on a surface (a convex surface, which is the object-side surface), which is provided with the minute convex portions, of the eyeglass lens disclosed in Patent Document 1, the coating film covers the surface that has the minute convex portions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">If the coating film is not provided, the minute convex portions cause luminous flux to converge at a position that is closer to the object than a predetermined position A is. However, if a coating film is formed on a lens substrate, the shape of the outermost surface of the coating film (i.e., an eyeglass lens) in a surrounding region of a minute convex portion, that is, a substrate protruding portion that protrudes from a substrate base portion deviates from the shape of the vicinity of a boundary between the substrate base portion and the substrate protruding portion of the lens substrate (simply referred to as &#x201c;boundary vicinity&#x201d; hereinafter). This deviation causes luminous flux entering the boundary vicinity to become stray light.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An example of the present disclosure aims to provide a technique for suppressing the generation of stray light even when a coating film is provided so as to cover substrate protruding portions on a lens substrate that contribute to the effect of suppressing near-sightedness.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The inventors of the present disclosure conducted intensive studies in order to resolve the above issues. The inventors of the present disclosure focused on a method for forming a coating film. First, the inventors focused on a conventional spin coating method as the method for forming a coating film. If a spin coating method is adopted, the coating film in the vicinity of the boundary between the substrate base portion and the substrate protruding portion has a uniform thickness. The inventors inferred that this uniform thickness would contribute to suppressing stray light. However, with a conventional spin coating method, the generation of stray light was not suppressed (although a spin coating method, which is not a conventional method, can suppress the generation of stray light, this point will be described later).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of this, from a different point of view, the inventors of the present disclosure focused on, as a method for forming a coating film, a dipping method (immersion method) with which it is more difficult to control the thickness of a coating film compared to a spin coating method and the obtained coating film is likely to have a non-uniform thickness. Adopting a dipping method unexpectedly resulted in the suppression of the generation of stray light.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a result of further intensive studies based on this finding, it was found that, on the premise that an eyeglass lens can suppress progression of near-sightedness, the generation of stray light can be suppressed by varying the thickness of the coating film over the surrounding region of each substrate protruding portion, regardless of the method for forming the coating film.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Specifically, an eyeglass lens can suppress the progression of near-sightedness, and thus, even if an eyeglass lens has a portion where the coating film is thick in the surrounding region of each substrate protruding portion, that is, even if an eyeglass lens has a portion whose shape largely deviates from the shape of the vicinity of the boundary between a substrate base portion and the substrate protruding portion, the outermost surface of the eyeglass lens at least has convex portions and concave portions, and the effect of suppressing the progression of near-sightedness due to the substrate protruding portions is exhibited as disclosed in Patent Document 1.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">With the spin coating method that the inventors of the present disclosure first focused on, portions with a large degree of deviation are evenly present over the surrounding regions of the substrate protruding portions. On the other hand, according to an aspect of the present disclosure, portions with a thin coating film are present in surrounding regions of substrate protruding portions, that is, portions whose shape has a small degree of deviation from the shape of the vicinity of the boundary between a substrate base portion and a substrate protruding portion of the lens substrate are present. The eyeglass lens obtained using the spin coating method is significantly different from an eyeglass lens obtained using a conventional spin coating method in that portions with a small degree of deviation are present.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">With an aspect of the present disclosure, portions with a large degree of deviation in the shape of the coating film are present in the vicinities of the boundaries between the substrate base portion and the substrate protruding portions. However, such portions are present only in some of the vicinities thereof. Also, if a dipping method is adopted, for example, a portion with a large degree of deviation has the equivalent degree of deviation of a portion obtained using a conventional spin coating method. Furthermore, according to an aspect of the present disclosure, portions with a small degree of deviation are present at other portions, and thus the generation of stray light is further suppressed, compared to an eyeglass lens obtained using a conventional spin coating method. To be precise, the present disclosure aims to suppress the generation of stray light, compared to a case where a conventional spin coating method is applied to a lens substrate.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">If a dipping method is adopted, when coating film liquid flows down under its own weight, variation in the thickness of the coating film occurs over surrounding regions of the substrate protruding portions, and there are portions where the coating film liquid quickly flows down and portions where the coating film liquid is likely to pool. Accordingly, there is a difference in the magnitude of the degree of deviation from the shape of the boundary vicinity over a surrounding region of a substrate protruding portion. Regardless of the dipping method, even when an aspect of the present disclosure is realized using another method, which will be described later, it is possible to make a difference in the magnitude of the degree of deviation, and thus to further suppress the generation of stray light, compared to an eyeglass lens obtained using the conventional spin coating method.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Also, it was found that, if a dipping method is adopted, the stray light ratio can be significantly reduced even when the thickness of the coating film is made uniform using a dipping method in the same manner as for the spin coating method, contrary to varying the thickness of the coating film. This example will be described near the end of [Description of Embodiments] and in the items in Examples.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present disclosure was made based on the above findings.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A first aspect according to the present disclosure is an eyeglass lens including:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">a lens substrate having a plurality of substrate protruding portions that protrude from a substrate base portion on a surface of the lens substrate; and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">a coating film provided so as to cover the plurality of substrate protruding portions,</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">the outermost surface of the eyeglass lens having a plurality of convex portions and concave portions,</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">in which the eyeglass lens has a stray light ratio of 30% or less.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A second aspect according to the present disclosure is the aspect according to the first aspect,</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">in which the eyeglass lens has a stray light ratio of 15% or less.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A third aspect according to the present disclosure is the aspect according to the first aspect, in which the eyeglass lens has a stray light ratio of 10% or less.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A fourth aspect according to the present disclosure is the aspect according to any one of the first to third aspects,</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">in which the eyeglass lens is able to suppress progression of near-sightedness.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Other aspects according to the present disclosure that can be combined with the above aspects are as follows.

The following description that is based on the drawings is exemplary, and the present disclosure is not limited to the aspects that are described as examples.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">An eyeglass lens according to this specification has an object-side surface and an eyeball-side surface. The &#x201c;object-side surface&#x201d; is the surface that is located on the object side when a wearer wears glasses including the eyeglass lens. The &#x201c;eyeball-side surface&#x201d; is the surface that is located on the opposite side, that is, the eyeball side, when the wearer wears the glasses including the eyeglass lens. This relationship also applies to the lens substrate that is to be the base of an eyeglass lens. That is, the lens substrate includes an object-side surface and an eyeball-side surface.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In this specification, when the eyeglass lens is viewed in a front view, the left-right (horizontal) direction is set as the X-direction, the up-down direction is set as the Y-direction, and the thickness direction of the lens and the direction in which an optical axis extends are set as the Z-direction.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this specification, in a state where the eyeglass lens is worn, out of the top and bottom directions, the top direction is referred to as &#x201c;upward&#x201d; in the Y-direction (the zero-o'clock direction with a rotation angle of 0 degrees when viewed from the center of the eyeglass lens), and the opposite direction is referred to as &#x201c;downward&#x201d; in the Y-direction (the six-o'clock direction with a rotation angle of 180 degrees). The top-bottom direction refers to a direction perpendicular to the direction of an optical axis (Z-direction) of the eyeglass lens when the wearer faces forward, and is also referred to as a &#x201c;vertical direction&#x201d;. The X-direction refers to the horizontal direction, and is perpendicular to the Y-direction and the Z-direction.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Note that the lens center indicates the optical center or the geometric center of the eyeglass lens.

An eyeglass lens according to an aspect of the present disclosure can suppress the progression of near-sightedness. As a result, the lens substrate can suppress the progression of near-sightedness. Similarly to the minute convex portions in Patent Document 1, a plurality of substrate protruding portions according to one aspect of the present disclosure may be formed on at least the object-side surface or the eyeball-side surface of a lens substrate, and this state is referred to as &#x201c;protruding from the substrate base portion on the surface of the lens substrate&#x201d;. In this specification, a case where a plurality of substrate protruding portions are only provided on the object-side surface of the lens substrate will mainly be described.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b></figref>-B in Patent Document 1, the substrate protruding portions may be formed at a center portion of the eyeglass lens, or as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> in Patent Document 1, the substrate protruding portions need not be formed at the center portion of the eyeglass lens.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Note that a case where a plastic lens substrate or a glass lens substrate is used as the lens substrate will mainly be described in this specification. On the other hand, other substances such as a base film may be laminated on the lens substrate. If another substance is laminated on a lens substrate, convex portions and concave portions resulting from the plurality of substrate protruding portions will be present on the lens substrate, and the plurality of substrate protruding portions can provide the effect of suppressing the progression of near-sightedness even when the other substance is laminated onto the lens substrate.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In one aspect according to the present disclosure, a coating film is formed on the lens substrate. The coating film may be formed on at least a plurality of substrate protruding portions, and it is preferable to form the coating film on both sides of the lens substrate because a dipping method is to be adopted.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">With the dipping method in this specification, the lens substrate is immersed in a coating film liquid from the lowermost end thereof and the uppermost end is ultimately immersed therein such that the entire lens substrate is immersed in the coating film liquid, and when the lens substrate is pulled up, the lens substrate is pulled upward in the opposite direction, i.e., in the vertical direction, for example. On the other hand, the lens substrate may be immersed in the coating film liquid in a state where the lens substrate is inclined relative to the up-down direction in the horizontal direction to some extent, and then be pulled up in that state. In either case, the coating film liquid on the lens substrate flows downward along the lens substrate under its own weight.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">There is no limitation on the coating liquid as long as a coating film can be formed by immersing lens substrate in the coating film liquid, pulling up the lens substrate, and drying the coating film liquid on the lens substrate while or after the coating film liquid flows under its own weight.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">If the volatility of the coating film liquid is relatively high, the lens substrate is immersed in the coating film liquid and pulled up, and drying is completed while the coating film liquid is still flowing under its own weight. On the other hand, if the volatility of the coating film liquid is relatively low, drying is not completed while the coating film liquid is still flowing under its own weight. Thus, after the lens substrate is pulled up, the coating film liquid is dried again so as to form a coating film.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Regardless of the volatility of the coating film liquid, the lens substrate is immersed in the coating film liquid and pulled up, and the coating film liquid somewhat flows under its own weight, which means that the coating film liquid flows downward along the lens substrate. As described in [Solution to Problem], the thickness of the coating film can be varied over surrounding regions of the substrate protruding portions due to the flowing of the coating film liquid.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a photograph showing results obtained by examining the flux of a coating film liquid using an optical microscope when a lens substrate provided with only one substrate protruding portion with a diameter of 3 mm was immersed in the coating film liquid and was then pulled up, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a photograph showing results obtained by examining the flux of a coating film liquid using an optical microscope when a lens substrate on which two substrate protruding portions were arranged side-by-side was immersed in the coating film liquid and was then pulled up.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the flux of the coating film liquid is relatively low in an upper portion (the vicinity at a rotation angle of 0 degrees) and a lower portion (the vicinity at a rotation angle of 180 degrees) of a surrounding region of a substrate protruding portion. If the coating film liquid is dried in this state, the coating film will be relatively thin in the upper portion and the lower portion of the surrounding region of the substrate protruding portion.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> as well, the flux of the coating film liquid is relatively large in portions other than the upper portion and the lower portion of the surrounding region of the substrate protruding portion. If the coating film liquid is dried in this state, the coating film will be relatively thick in portions other than the upper portion and the lower portion of the surrounding region of the substrate protruding portion. This trend is also seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> in which two substrate protruding portions are provided.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, even in a case where only one substrate protruding portion is provided, the thickness of the coating film varies over the surrounding region of the substrate protruding portion. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, even in a case where multiple substrate protruding portions are provided, of course, the thickness of the coating film varies as described in the items of the examples described later. These results mean that, by adopting the method according to one aspect of the present disclosure, the thickness of the coating film varies, regardless of the number of substrate protruding portions.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Also, even when the type (plastic, glass) and the shape (the size and number of substrate protruding portions) of the lens substrate, the properties (types, viscosity, concentration, volatility) of the coating film liquid, and various conditions (the temperature of the coating film liquid, and the speed at which the lens substrate is pulled up and the film thickness of the coating film accompanying the speed) for the dipping method are changed, the coating film liquid flows under its own weight and thus the thickness of the coating film varies, as long as the dipping method is adopted for a lens substrate having the substrate protruding portions. This was confirmed through intensive studies conducted by the inventors of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">With the above method for manufacturing an eyeglass lens according to one aspect of the present disclosure, it is possible to suppress the generation of stray light even when a coating film is provided so as to cover substrate protruding portions on a lens substrate that contributes to the effect of suppressing near-sightedness, and productivity is improved.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The lens substrate, the substrate protruding portions, the coating film, the coating film liquid, specific examples (preferably examples) of various conditions for the dipping method, and a method for measuring a stray light ratio will be described below.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">[Lens Substrate]</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">There is no particular limitation on aspects of the sizes and arrangement of multiple substrate protruding portions on the surface of the lens substrate. There is no limitation on the substrate protruding portions as long as the substrate protruding portions mainly function to cause luminous flux that enters from the object-side surface to be emitted from the eyeball-side surface and to converge on the object side (forward) relative to the retina. The substrate protruding portion can be determined from the viewpoint of external visibility of the substrate protruding portion, designability imparted by the substrate protruding portion, adjustment of the refractive power by the substrate protruding portion, and the like, for example.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">There is no limitation on the size of the substrate protruding portions as described above, and the substrate protruding portions have a size or shape such that the thickness of a coating film formed at the base thereof can be varied. As shown in Example 1 described later and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the shape thereof may be circular in a plan view, or spherical as a three-dimensional shape, for example. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the shape thereof may be an elliptical shape in a plan view, or may also be a toric shape as a three-dimensional shape. The same applies to the shape of a coating film convex portion.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> is a diagram of a case where a discrete arrangement in which the centers of the coating film convex portions independently serve as the vertexes of an equilateral triangle in a plan view (the center of each coating film convex portion is located at a vertex of a honeycomb structure) is adopted, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> is a diagram of a case where a structure in which the coating film convex portions are arranged in a row in a plan view is adopted. A dotted line indicates any circular region that is used to measure a stray light ratio (details thereof will be described later).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As described above, there is no limitation on aspects of the arrangement of the substrate protruding portions. As shown in Example 1 described later and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, a discrete arrangement in which the centers of the substrate protruding portions independently serve as the vertexes of an equilateral triangle in a plan view (the center of each substrate protruding portion is located at a vertex of a honeycomb structure) may be adopted.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> below, a structure in which the substrate protruding portions are arranged in a row in a plan view may be adopted. Furthermore, a structure in which substrate protruding portions are arranged in a row and other substrate protruding portions are arranged in a row adjacent to the row may be adopted. At that time, the pitch between substrate protruding portions in one row (the distance between the centers of the substrate protruding portions, the same applies to the following), and the pitch between a substrate protruding portion in a given row and a substrate protruding portion in another row that is adjacent to that substrate protruding portion may be different from each other. Also, the interval between substrate protruding portions in one row may be different from the interval between rows that are adjacent to each other.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The height of a substrate protruding portion may be in a range of 0.1 to 10 &#x3bc;m, for example, or may be in a range of 0.5 to 2 &#x3bc;m (corresponding to a refractive power of 2.50 D to 6.50 D of a substrate protruding portion). The upper limit of the refractive power of the substrate protruding portion may be 5.50 D or 5.00 D, and the lower limit may be 3.00 D. The radius of curvature of the surface of a substrate protruding portion in a plan view (i.e., when the substrate protruding portion is viewed facing the substrate protruding portion in the direction in which an optical axis extends) may be 50 to 250 mmR, for example. Also, the distance between substrate protruding portions that are adjacent to each other (the distance between an end portion of a given substrate protruding portion and an end portion of a substrate protruding portion that is adjacent to this substrate protruding portion) may be substantially the same as the value of the radius of the substrate protruding portion, for example. Also, a plurality of the substrate protruding portions can be arranged substantially uniformly near the lens center, for example.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Various lens substrates that are usually used for an eyeglass lens can be used as the lens substrate. The lens substrate may be a plastic lens substrate or a glass lens substrate, for example. The glass lens substrate may be a lens substrate made of inorganic glass, for example. From the viewpoint of being light in weight and unlikeliness to crack, a plastic lens substrate is preferable as the lens substrate. Examples of the material of the plastic lens substrate include styrene resins such as (meth)acrylic resins, allyl carbonate resins such as polycarbonate resins, allyl resins, and diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate) resin (CR-39), vinyl resins, polyester resins, polyether resins, urethan resins obtained through a reaction between an isocyanate compound and a hydroxy compound such as diethylene glycol, thiourethane resins obtained through a reaction between an isocyanate compound and a polythiol compound, and cured products (generally called transparent resins) obtained by curing a curable composition containing a (thio)epoxy compound having one or more disulfide bonds in the molecule. The curable composition may be referred to as a &#x201c;polymerizable composition&#x201d;. An uncolored lens substrate (colorless lens) or a colored lens substrate (colored lens) may be used as the lens substrate. There is no particular limitation on the thickness and the diameter of the lens substrate. The thickness (central thickness) may be about 1 to 30 mm, and the diameter may be about 50 to 100 mm, for example. The lens substrate may have a refractive index of about 1.60 to 1.75, for example. However, the refractive index of the lens substrate is not limited to the above-mentioned range, and may be within the above-mentioned range, or may be larger or smaller than the above-mentioned range. The refractive index as used in the present disclosure and this specification refers to a refractive index for light at a wavelength of 500 nm. The lens substrate can be molded using a known molding method such as casting polymerization. By molding a lens substrate through casting polymerization using a mold having a molding face provided with a plurality of concave portions, a lens substrate provided with the substrate protruding portions on at least one surface can be obtained, for example.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">[Coating Film]</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">An aspect of a coating film to be provided on the surface of the lens substrate having the substrate protruding portions is a cured film formed by curing a curable composition (the coating film liquid described so far) containing a curable compound. Such a cured film is commonly called a hard coating film, and contributes to improving the durability of the eyeglass lens.

This causes liquid to intentionally pool in the surrounding regions of the substrate convex portions so that the film thickness of the coating film (the above cured film) is varied over the surrounding regions of the substrate protruding portions.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0111">A cured film can be formed using the following method. A coated film is formed, for example, by applying a curable composition prepared by mixing components and optional components such as an organic solvent, a surfactant (leveling agent), and a curing agent as needed, onto the surface of the lens substrate provided with the substrate protruding portions through immersion, or applying it onto the surface of the lens substrate via another film. Curing processing (e.g., heating and/or light irradiation) is performed on this coated film according to the type of curable compound. If curing processing is performed through volatilization, for example, a curing reaction of the curable compound in the coated film may be advanced by placing the lens substrate provided with the coated film made of the curable composition in an environment at an ambient temperature of 50&#xb0; C. to 150&#xb0; C. for about 30 minutes to 3 hours in a state where the lens substrate is inclined while the curable composition has fluidity.

The viscosity as used in the present disclosure and this specification refers to the viscosity at a liquid temperature of 25&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0113">The temperature of the curable composition when the lens substrate is immersed is preferably in a range of 0&#xb0; C. to 30&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0114">The boiling point of a solvent that constitutes the curable composition when the lens substrate is immersed is preferably in a range of 30&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C., and preferably in a range of 60&#xb0; C. to 120&#xb0; C.

Examples of a coating film liquid capable of forming such a coating film include compositions (referred to as &#x201c;dry solidifiable compositions&#x201d; hereinafter) in which a resin component such as a polyurethane resin is dispersed in a solvent (water, an organic solvent, or a mixed solvent thereof). Solidification of such a composition is advanced by removing a solvent through drying. Drying can be performed through a drying process such as air drying or heat drying.

Also, the drying temperature used after pulling up the lens substrate is preferably 20&#xb0; C. to 130&#xb0; C. Furthermore, drying after pulling up the lens substrate is preferably performed for 0 to 90 minutes. A drying time of 0 minutes means that the flowing coating film liquid is dried, and the coating film liquid is solidified through volatilization of a solvent without performing a drying step, and a coating film is formed.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0120">The film thickness of the coating film formed through the above steps may be in a range of 0.1 to 100 &#x3bc;m (preferably, 0.5 to 6.0 &#x3bc;m, and even more preferably 1.0 to 5.0 &#x3bc;m), for example.

A known technique can also be applied to a method for forming these coating films.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0122">[Method for Measuring Stray Light Ratio]</p><p id="p-0125" num="0123">Stray light rays are rays that enter from the object-side surface of the eyeglass lens and are emitted from the eyeball-side surface, and refer to rays that do not pass through the vicinity of the predetermined position A at which rays are converged by the eyeglass lens, and also do not pass through the vicinity of the position B at which rays are converged by the substrate protruding portions and the coating film convex portions. Stray light rays cause blurring of the wearer's visual field. Thus, it is preferable to reduce the ratio of stray light rays (also referred to as &#x201c;stray light ratio&#x201d; hereinafter) relative to rays that enter from the object-side surface of the eyeglass lens and are emitted from the eyeball-side surface.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0124">One of the reasons stray light rays occur is the coating film. If the shape extending from the convex surface, which is the object-side surface serving as the base, changes excessively smoothly at the base of the coating film convex portion, the resulting shape differs from the spherical shape of the substrate protruding portion, and also differs from the convex surface, which is the object-side surface. Accordingly, rays will not be focused on the retina of the wearer (the vicinity of the predetermined position A in this specification), and will not be focused in the vicinity of the position B that is closer to the object.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0125">The &#x201c;base (also referred to as a surrounding region) of a coating film convex portion&#x201d; in this specification refers to the boundary between the base portion on the outermost surface of the eyeglass lens and the coating film convex portion. From the viewpoint of the surface shape of the eyeglass lens, compared to portions other than that at the boundary, the surface shape more significantly changes at the boundary from the center of the coating film convex portion to the coating film base portion. The curvature changes significantly and discontinuously in some cases, for example. A portion where the curvature changes significantly is referred to as the base (boundary) of the coating film convex portion. This definition is also applicable to the substrate protruding portions.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0126">If the base is to be expressed another way, the portion where astigmatism begins to increase rapidly from the center of the coating film convex portion to the coating film base portion may be referred to as the base (boundary). Astigmatism (profile curve) in a cross-sectional view of the eyeglass lens can be measured using a method called coherence correlation interferometry.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0127">Ray tracing calculation is used to set the stray light ratio. A situation in which a large number of rays evenly enter a predetermined range of the object-side surface of the eyeglass lens and pass through the coating film (i.e., a situation in which the eyeglass lens is worn and the wearer is looking at their surroundings) is presumed in this calculation. This &#x201c;predetermined range&#x201d; needs only be an optical region on the object-side surface. This &#x201c;optical region&#x201d; refers to a portion having a curved surface shape that realizes the power set according to the wearer on the object-side surface and the eyeball-side surface that is located opposite thereto.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0128">Here, conditions under which the stray light ratio is determined will be described below.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart showing the flow of a method for inspecting an eyeglass lens according to one aspect of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0130">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, first, in step S<b>101</b>, the shape of the object-side surface (also referred to as &#x201c;convex surface&#x201d; hereinafter) of the actual eyeglass lens is measured, and curved surface data representing the shape of the convex surface is generated (shape measurement step).

The three-dimensional shape of the convex surface is acquired as discrete three-dimensional data (x, y, z), for example.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0131">Then, in step S<b>102</b>, curved surface data is generated from the obtained data indicating the shape of the convex surface of the eyeglass lens (curved surface data generation step).

On the other hand, the inventors of the present disclosure found that, even when a spin coating method is adopted, the thickness of the coating film can be varied. Specifically, the thickness of the coating film can be varied by inclining the lens substrate before completing the spin coating method, and causing the coating film liquid to flow in one direction. More specifically, when the spin coating method was adopted and conditions that are the same as in Example 1 below were used, except for the content described below, the thickness of the coating film can be varied by performing spin coating at 500 rpm for only 3 seconds, then performing spin coating at 1000 rpm for only 3 seconds, inclining the lens substrate in the vertical direction immediately thereafter and leaving the lens substrate for 1 minute, and performing a drying process on the coating film liquid.

Breaking from the spin coating method was a certain trigger for the technical ideas of the present disclosure. However, this is just a trigger, and it is possible to manufacture an eyeglass lens according to the technical ideas of the present disclosure even using the spin coating method as described in the above paragraph. This is also a finding that could only be found by the inventors of the present disclosure. As a result, the present disclosure is not limited to a coating film formation method.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0188">Also, according to one aspect of the present disclosure described above, the thickness of the coating film is varied using a dipping method. On the other hand, even when the thickness of the coating film is made uniform using a dipping method in the same manner as for the spin coating method, the stray light ratio can be significantly reduced (Examples 4 and 5). The stray light ratio can be set to 5% or less as a specific numerical value. A specific method therefor includes usage of a solvent with a low boiling point in a coating film liquid or increasing the ratio of a solvent in the coating film liquid.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0189">The viscosity of the curable composition for forming a coating film on the surface of the lens substrate provided with the substrate protruding portions is set to a range from 1 to 5 mPa&#xb7;s, for example.

Thus, the stray light ratio can be significantly reduced. On the other hand, it is difficult to increase the film thickness because the ratio of the solvent in the coating film liquid is increased and the ratio of raw materials in the coating film is reduced. Therefore, it is appropriate to set the film thickness to 2.0 &#x3bc;m or less.
