No. 63/218,069, entitled &#x201c;Instrument Advancement Device Having a Septum&#x201d;, filed Jul. 2, 2021, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Catheters are commonly used for a variety of infusion therapies. For example, catheters may be used for infusing fluids, such as normal saline solution, various medicaments, and total parenteral nutrition, into a patient. Catheters may also be used for withdrawing blood from the patient.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A common type of catheter device includes a catheter that is over-the-needle. As its name implies, the catheter that is over-the-needle may be mounted over an introducer needle having a sharp distal tip. A catheter assembly may include a catheter adapter, the catheter extending distally from the catheter adapter, and the introducer needle extending through the catheter. The catheter and the introducer needle may be assembled so that the distal tip of the introducer needle extends beyond the distal tip of the catheter with the bevel of the needle facing up away from skin of the patient. The catheter and introducer needle are generally inserted at a shallow angle through the skin into vasculature of the patient.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to verify proper placement of the introducer needle and/or the catheter in the blood vessel, a clinician generally confirms that there is &#x201c;flashback&#x201d; of blood in a flashback chamber of the catheter assembly. Once placement of the needle has been confirmed, the clinician may temporarily occlude flow in the vasculature and remove the needle, leaving the catheter in place for future blood withdrawal or fluid infusion.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Infusion and blood withdrawal using the catheter may be difficult for several reasons, particularly when an indwelling time of the catheter increases. A fibrin sheath or thrombus may form on an internal surface of the catheter assembly, an external surface of the catheter assembly, or within the vasculature near the distal tip of the catheter. The fibrin sheath or thrombus may block or narrow a fluid pathway through the catheter, which may impair infusion and/or collection of a high-quality blood sample.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The subject matter claimed herein is not limited to embodiments that solve any disadvantages or that operate only in environments such as those described above. Rather, this background is only provided to illustrate one example technology area where some implementations described herein may be practiced.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure relates generally to vascular access devices and related systems and methods. In particular, the present disclosure relates to an instrument advancement device that includes a septum to facilitate advancement of an instrument of the instrument advancement device. In some embodiments, the septum may be configured to reduce or eliminate buckling of the instrument during advancement of the instrument. In some embodiments, the septum may facilitate sealing of the septum around the instrument during advancement of the instrument.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the instrument advancement device may be configured to advance the instrument into a catheter assembly. In some embodiments, the instrument may be advanced through a catheter of the catheter assembly to push past any occlusions in the catheter or vasculature (e.g., thrombus or fibrin sheath at a tip of the catheter, vein collapse, or valves) to create a clear pathway for fluid flow. In some embodiments, the instrument may reduce or remove occlusions, improving patency of the catheter for medication and fluid delivery, as well as blood acquisition, during a dwell time of the catheter. In some embodiments, the catheter that may be inserted into vasculature of the patient prior to advancing the instrument in the catheter assembly and may remain in the vasculature when the instrument is advanced via the instrument advancement device. In some embodiments, the catheter may include a peripherally-inserted central catheter, a midline catheter, or a peripheral intravenous catheter.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the instrument advancement device may include a housing, which may include a proximal end, a distal end, and a slot. In some embodiments, the instrument advancement device may include an advancement element, which may extend through the slot and may be configured to move linearly along the slot between a retracted position and an advanced position. In some embodiments, in response to the instrument advancement device being in the retracted position, an entirety of the instrument may be disposed within the housing. In some embodiments, a septum may be disposed within the housing. In some embodiments, the instrument may include a first end and a second end. In some embodiments, in response to movement of the advancement element from the retracted position to the advanced position, the instrument may move through the septum and the second end of the instrument may be advanced beyond the distal end of the housing.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, a distal face of the septum may be flat, which may reduce a compression force to seal the septum within the housing. In some embodiments, the distal face of the septum may face a fluid path within the housing, and blood within the fluid path may help seal an interface between the septum and the instrument extending therethrough.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, a distal face of the septum may be bulging and a proximal face of the septum may be bulging. In further detail, in some embodiments, a bulge of the distal face and a bulge of the proximal face may be aligned and/or aligned with a central axis of the septum. In some embodiments, the bulge of the distal face and the bulge of the proximal face may be aligned with a central axis of the fluid path of the housing. In some embodiments, a maximum width of the septum may be disposed at the bulge of the distal face and the bulge of the proximal face. In some embodiments, the pressure of blood within the fluid path of the housing against the bulge of the distal face may facilitate sealing of the septum during advancement of the instrument. Moreover, in some embodiments, a pressure differential resulting from a blood collection device, such as, for example, a BD VACUTAINER&#xae; blood collection tube available from Becton Dickinson &#x26; Company of Franklin Lakes, N.J., may facilitate sealing of the septum during blood draw.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the distal face of the septum may be concave and the proximal face of the septum may be concave, which may ensure the pressure of blood within the fluid path or the pressure differential resulting from the blood collection device is over the interface between the septum and the instrument.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the housing may include a support wall. In some embodiments, the support wall may include an opening configured to receive the instrument therethrough. In some embodiments, the distal face of the septum may be in contact with the support wall. In some embodiments, the support wall may extend perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the housing. In some embodiments, a center of the septum is aligned with the opening of the support wall. In some embodiments, the septum may include a duckbill valve.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the instrument advancement device may include another septum, which may be disposed within the housing. In some embodiments, the septum may be in contact with a proximal side of the support wall and/or the other septum may be in contact with a distal side of the support wall. In some embodiments, a portion of the septum aligned with opening may include a proximally-facing pocket configured to receive the instrument therethrough. In some embodiments, the instrument advancement device may include a lube disposed within the proximally-facing pocket.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the instrument advancement device may include a wedge. In some embodiments, the wedge may include a distal end and an outwardly-extending mouth portion opposite the distal end. In some embodiments, the distal end of the wedge may be secured within the opening of the support wall. In some embodiments, a proximal face of the septum may be in contact with a distal side of the support wall. In some embodiments, the outwardly-extending mouth portion may include a lube therein.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the lube may be disposed within the housing and configured to facilitate advancement of the instrument through the septum. In some embodiments, another septum may be disposed within the housing, and the lube may fill a volume between the septum and the other septum.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the septum may include a proximally-facing pocket, and a distal end of the wedge may be disposed within the proximally-facing pocket of the septum. In some embodiments, an outwardly-angled mouth of the wedge may include the lube therein. In some embodiments, the outwardly-angled mouth of the wedge may be disposed proximal to the septum.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, a distal face of the septum may be flat and a proximal face of the septum may include a pocket configured to receive the instrument therethrough. In some embodiments, the lube may be disposed within the pocket. In some embodiments, the septum may include a cavity enclosed by a body of the septum, and the lube is disposed within the cavity enclosed by the body of the septum.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the distal face of the septum may include a distally-facing pocket, and the instrument advancement device may include a film or another septum. In some embodiments, the lube may be sealed within the distally-facing pocket by the film or the other septum. In some embodiments, the lube may fill a volume between the septum and the film. In some embodiments, in response to movement of the advancement element from the retracted position to the advanced position, the instrument may be configured to puncture the film or the other septum to release the lube.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the film may be proximal to the septum. In some embodiments, the lube may fill a volume between the septum and the film. In some embodiments, in response to movement of the advancement element from the retracted position to the advanced position, the instrument may be configured to puncture the film to release the lube.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are examples and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed. It should be understood that the various embodiments are not limited to the arrangements and instrumentality illustrated in the drawings.
