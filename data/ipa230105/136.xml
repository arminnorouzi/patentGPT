These products may be referred to as heat-not-burn devices, tobacco heating devices or tobacco heating products. Various different arrangements for volitalizing at least one component of the solid aerosol-generating material are known.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As another example, there are hybrid devices.

The amorphous solid is a solid material that may retain some fluid, such as liquid, within it.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028">As described above, there is provided a method of making an amorphous solid comprising:</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029">(a) forming a slurry comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0030">0.5-60 wt % of a gelling agent; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0031">5-80 wt % of an aerosol forming material;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0032">0-60 wt % of an active constituent and/or flavorant;</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0028" num="0033">wherein these weights are calculated on a dry weight basis;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0034">(b) depositing one or more predetermined quantities of the slurry onto a carrier using a positive displacement pump;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0035">(c) setting the slurry to form a gel; and</p><p id="p-0031" num="0036">(d) drying the gel to form an amorphous solid.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0037">The carrier functions as a support on which the amorphous solid layer forms, easing manufacture. The carrier may provide rigidity to the amorphous solid layer, easing handling. The carrier may be any suitable material which can be used to support an amorphous solid. In some cases, the carrier may be formed from materials selected from metal, suitably metal foil, paper, carbon paper, greaseproof paper, ceramic, carbon allotropes such as graphite and graphene, plastic, cardboard, wood or combinations thereof. In some cases, the carrier itself be a laminate structure comprising layers of materials selected from the preceding lists. In some cases, the carrier may also function as a flavor carrier. For example, the carrier may be impregnated with a flavorant or with tobacco extract.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0038">Suitably, the carrier comprises an aluminum surface on which the slurry is shaped. In some cases, the substrate may comprise, consist essentially of or consist of aluminum. An aluminum carrier can be used to inductively heat the amorphous solid in use.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0039">In some cases, a plurality of predetermined quantities of the slurry are deposited on the carrier.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0040">In some cases, the one or more predetermined quantities of slurry are deposited in a stencil so that the slurry is shaped. This is particularly useful when the slurry viscosity is relatively low, since the stencil can be used to prevent unwanted flow of the slurry prior to setting. In some cases, the method further comprises removing the stencil after (b), (c) or (d), most suitably between (c) and (d) (which provides improved shape retention for the material). In some cases, the surfaces of the stencil which contact the slurry are formed from a non-stick material, such as PTFE or silicone. In some cases, the stencil is formed from such materials. In some cases, the surfaces of the stencil contacting the slurry are coated with a release material, suitably an amphoteric release material such as lecithin. The inventors have found that forming the slurry-contacting surfaces from a non-stick material and/or coating such surfaces with a release material is useful as it ensures that the slurry/gel/amorphous solid does not adhere to the stencil but does adhere to the substrate.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0041">In some cases, a predetermined quantity of slurry generates a predetermined quantity of amorphous solid, and wherein each predetermined quantity of slurry comprises aerosolizable components in amounts such that heating of the resulting predetermined quantity of amorphous solid generates at least one puff of aerosol on heating.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0042">In some cases, the predetermined quantities of slurry are deposited on the carrier so that each forms a discrete section of amorphous solid. Where a stencil is used, the stencil may be shaped to form a plurality of discrete sections of amorphous solid, wherein each section comprises aerosolizable components in amounts such that each part generates at least one puff of aerosol on heating. In other words, each part generates at least one puff of aerosol on heating. In some cases, each part generates one puff on heating. Suitably, the stencil may be shaped to have a plurality of cylindrical wells which are used to shape the slurry.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0043">In some cases, the predetermined quantities of slurry may be deposited on the carrier in a repeating pattern, such as a grid pattern (i.e. in a 2-dimension repeating pattern where the wells are arranged in columns and rows).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0044">Thus, in some cases, the resulting product is a carrier material with a plurality of substantially cylindrical amorphous solid parts disposed thereon. In some cases, the resulting product is an aluminum carrier with a grid-shaped distribution of substantially cylindrical amorphous solid parts disposed thereon.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0045">In some examples, the slurry has a viscosity of from about 10 to about 50 Pa&#xb7;s at 46.5&#xb0; C., suitably from about 10 to about 40 Pa&#xb7;s at 46.5&#xb0; C., from about 10 to about 20 Pa&#xb7;s at 46.5&#xb0; C., or from about 14 to about 16 Pa&#xb7;s at 46.5&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0046">In some cases, setting the slurry comprises adding a setting agent to the slurry. In some cases, the setting agent comprises calcium. In some cases, the setting agent is a calcium source which includes Ca<sup>2+</sup> cations and one or more counterions. The one or more counterions are anionic.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0047">In some cases, the setting agent is applied to the slurry by spraying.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0048">In some cases, the total amount of setting agent added to the slurry may be from 0.5-5 wt %, calculated on a dry weight basis. Suitably, the total amount may be from about 1 wt %, 2.5 wt % or 4 wt % to about 4.8 wt % or 4.5 wt %. The inventors have found that the addition of too little setting agent may result in an amorphous solid which does not stabilize the amorphous solid components and results in these components dropping out of the amorphous solid. The inventors have found that the addition of too much setting agent results in an amorphous solid that is very tacky and consequently has poor handleability.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0049">When the amorphous solid does not contain tobacco, a higher amount of setting agent may need to be applied. In some cases, the total amount of setting agent added may therefore be from 0.5-12 wt % such as 5-10 wt %, calculated on a dry weight basis. Suitably, the total amount may be from about 5 wt %, 6 wt % or 7 wt % to about 12 wt % or 10 wt %. In this case the amorphous solid will not generally contain any tobacco.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0050">In some embodiments, the one or more counterions of the setting agent comprise acetate, formate, carbonate, hydrogen carbonate (also known as bicarbonate), lactate, chloride, citrate, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0051">Suitably, the one or more counterions of the setting agent comprise acetate, formate, hydrogen carbonate (also known as bicarbonate), or a combination thereof. In these embodiments the setting agent may comprise calcium acetate, calcium formate, calcium hydrogen carbonate, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the one or more counterions does not include chloride.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0052">In examples, the setting agent comprises or consists of calcium acetate, calcium formate, calcium carbonate, calcium hydrogen carbonate, calcium chloride, calcium lactate, or a combination thereof. In some examples, the setting agent comprises or consists of calcium formate and/or calcium lactate. In particular examples, the setting agent comprises or consists of calcium formate. The inventors have identified that, typically, employing calcium formate as a setting agent results in an amorphous solid having a greater tensile strength and greater resistance to elongation.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0053">In some embodiments, the setting agent is supplied to the slurry in an aqueous vehicle. For example, the setting agent may be provided in an aqueous setting agent suspension, and/or solution. Preferably, the setting agent has a solubility such that at least some of the setting agent is dissolved in an aqueous solvent.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0054">In some embodiments, the setting agent has an aqueous solubility of greater than or equal to about 1 g/100 mL at 20&#xb0; C. (i.e. 0.1 g/L at 20&#xb0; C.). In some embodiments, the setting agent has an aqueous solubility of greater than or equal to about 5 g/100 mL at 20&#xb0; C., or about 10 g/100 mL at 20&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the setting agent has an aqueous solubility of less than about 80 g/100 mL at 20&#xb0; C., or less than about 50 g/100 mL at 20&#xb0; C. The inventors have identified that using a setting agent having a higher solubility to prepare an amorphous solid may allow for better application of the setting agent to the slurry. On the other hand, using a setting agent with too high a solubility may result in increased or rapid setting activity.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0055">In some cases, the setting agent comprises calcium and is provided in an aqueous solution, and wherein the calcium concentration in the aqueous solution is between about 0.2 and 0.8 mol&#xb7;dm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, suitably between about 0.3 and 0.7 mol&#xb7;dm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, suitably between about 0.4 and 0.6 mol&#xb7;dm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, suitably about 0.5 mol&#xb7;dm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0056">In some cases, the drying may, in some cases, remove from about 50 wt %, 60 wt %, 70 wt %, 80 wt % or 90 wt % to about 80 wt %, 90 wt % or 95 wt % (WWB) of water in the slurry.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0057">In some cases, the resulting amorphous solid comprises from about 1 wt % to about 15 wt % water, calculated on a wet weight basis. Suitably, the resulting amorphous solid comprises from about 5 wt % to about 15 wt % water, calculated on a wet weight basis (WWB). Suitably, the water content of the amorphous solid may be from about 5 wt %, 7 wt % or 9 wt % to about 15 wt %, 13 wt % or 11 wt % (WWB), most suitably about 10 wt %.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0058">The inventors have established that the drying process is important as it controls the final water content of amorphous solid. In particular, if the water content of the amorphous solid is too high, its performance in use is compromised. The high heat capacity of water means that if the water content is too high, more energy is needed to generate an aerosol, reducing operating efficiency. Further, if the water content is too high, the puff profile may be less satisfactory to the consumer due to the generation of hot and humid puffs (a sensation known in the field as &#x201c;hot puff&#x201d;). Moreover, if the water content is too high, microbial growth may occur. Conversely, if the water content is too low, the material may be brittle and difficult to handle. The hygroscopic nature of the aerosol forming material may mean that water is drawn into the material from the atmosphere if the water content is too low, destabilizing the material.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0059">In some cases, the drying results in an amorphous solid which has a thickness that is between about 5% and 20% of the slurry thickness, suitably about 10%. In some cases, the amorphous solid may have a thickness of about 0.015 mm to about 1.0 mm. Suitably, the thickness may be in the range of about 0.05 mm, 0.1 mm or 0.15 mm to about 0.5 mm or 0.3 mm. The inventors have found that a material having a thickness of 0.2 mm is particularly suitable. The amorphous solid may comprise more than one layer, and the thickness described herein refers to the aggregate thickness of those layers.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0060">In some cases, in (b), the slurry forms a layer on the carrier and has a thickness of less than about 4 mm, suitably a thickness in the range of about 1 mm to about 3 mm, suitably about 1.5 mm to about 2.5 mm. In some cases, the thickness of the slurry layer is about 2 mm.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0061">The inventors have found that if the slurry layer is too thick, it can be difficult to dry to form an amorphous solid with the required water content, whilst minimizing cracking of the solid on drying.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0062">The inventors have established that if the aerosol-forming amorphous solid is too thick, then heating efficiency is compromised. This adversely affects the power consumption in use. Conversely, if the aerosol-forming amorphous solid is too thin, it is difficult to manufacture and handle; a very thin material is harder to cast and may be fragile, compromising aerosol formation in use.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0063">The inventors have established that the amorphous solid thicknesses stipulated herein optimize the material properties in view of these competing considerations.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0064">Any thickness stipulated herein is a mean thickness. In some cases, the thickness may vary by no more than 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5% or 1%.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0065">The processes (b), (c) and (d) occur in sequence for each deposit of slurry. However, in some cases where more than one predetermined quantity of slurry is deposited on the carrier, the processes (b), (c) and (d) may occur simultaneously in different regions of the carrier. For example, on a production line where processes (b), (c) and (d) occur in sequence, a carrier of sufficient dimension may simultaneously be in the separate regions where (b), (c) and (d) are occurring. That is, in some regions of the carrier, the slurry may be being deposited on the carrier, whilst in another region, a setting agent may be being sprayed onto pre-deposited slurry, and in another region, gel parts (i.e., set-slurry) may be undergoing drying.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0066">Alginate salts are derivatives of alginic acid and are typically high molecular weight polymers (10-600 kDa). Alginic acid is a copolymer of &#x3b2;-D-mannuronic (M) and &#x3b1;-L-guluronic acid (G) units (blocks) linked together with (1,4)-glycosidic bonds to form a polysaccharide. On addition of calcium cations, the alginate crosslinks to form a gel. The inventors have determined that alginate salts with a high G monomer content more readily form a gel on addition of the calcium source. In some cases therefore, the slurry may comprise an alginate salt in which at least about 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60% or 70% of the monomer units in the alginate copolymer are &#x3b1;-L-guluronic acid (G) units.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0067">As discussed above, a carrier may be used to support the amorphous solid. Suitably, the thickness of the carrier may be in the range of about 10 &#x3bc;m, 15 &#x3bc;m, 17 &#x3bc;m, 20 &#x3bc;m, 23 &#x3bc;m, 25 &#x3bc;m, 50 &#x3bc;m, 75 &#x3bc;m or 0.1 mm to about 2.5 mm, 2.0 mm, 1.5 mm, 1.0 mm or 0.5 mm. The carrier may comprise more than one layer, and the thickness described herein refers to the aggregate thickness of those layers.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0068">In some cases, the carrier may be non-magnetic.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0069">In some cases, the carrier may be magnetic. This functionality may be used to fasten the carrier to the assembly in use, or may be used to generate particular amorphous solid shapes. In some cases, the amorphous solid may comprise one or more magnets which can be used to fasten the solid to an induction heater in use.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0070">In some cases, the carrier may be substantially or wholly impermeable to gas and/or aerosol. This prevents aerosol or gas passage through the carrier layer, thereby controlling the flow and ensuring it is delivered to the user. This can also be used to prevent condensation or other deposition of the gas/aerosol in use on, for example, the surface of a heater provided in a non-combustible aerosol provision system. Thus, consumption efficiency and hygiene can be improved in some cases.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0071">In some cases, the carrier may have a thickness of between about 0.017 mm and about 2.0 mm, suitably from about 0.02 mm, 0.05 mm or 0.1 mm to about 1.5 mm, 1.0 mm, or 0.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0072">In some cases, the slurry may comprise 1-60 wt % of a gelling agent wherein these weights are calculated on a dry weight basis.

The aerosol forming material may act as a plasticizer. For example, the slurry may comprise 10-60 wt %, 15-50 wt % or 20-40 wt % of an aerosol forming material. In some cases, the aerosol forming material comprises one or more compound selected from erythritol, propylene glycol, glycerol, triacetin, sorbitol and xylitol. In some cases, the aerosol forming material comprises, consists essentially of or consists of glycerol. The inventors have established that if the content of the plasticizer is too high, the amorphous solid may absorb water resulting in a material that does not create an appropriate consumption experience in use. The inventors have established that if the plasticizer content is too low, the amorphous solid may be brittle and easily broken. The plasticizer content specified herein provides an amorphous solid with flexibility which allows the amorphous solid sheet to be wound onto a bobbin, which is useful in manufacture of articles used for aerosol generation.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0081">In some embodiments, the aerosol forming material comprises one or more polyhydric alcohols, such as propylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,3-butanediol and glycerin; esters of polyhydric alcohols, such as glycerol mono-, di- or triacetate; and/or aliphatic esters of mono-, di- or polycarboxylic acids, such as dimethyl dodecanedioate and dimethyl tetradecanedioate.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0082">In some cases, the slurry may comprise a flavor.

In one example, the cooling segment <b>107</b> is located adjacent the body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> between the body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> and the filter segment <b>109</b>, such that the cooling segment <b>107</b> is in an abutting relationship with the aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> and the filter segment <b>109</b>. In other examples, there may be a separation between the body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> and the cooling segment <b>107</b> and between the body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> and the filter segment <b>109</b>. The filter segment <b>109</b> is located in between the cooling segment <b>107</b> and the mouth end segment <b>111</b>. The mouth end segment <b>111</b> is located towards the proximal end <b>113</b> of the article <b>101</b>, adjacent the filter segment <b>109</b>. In one example, the filter segment <b>109</b> is in an abutting relationship with the mouth end segment <b>111</b>. In one embodiment, the total length of the filter assembly <b>105</b> is between 37 mm and 45 mm, more preferably, the total length of the filter assembly <b>105</b> is 41 mm.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0127">In one example, the rod of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> is between 34 mm and 50 mm in length, suitably between 38 mm and 46 mm in length, suitably 42 mm in length.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0128">In one example, the total length of the article <b>101</b> is between 71 mm and 95 mm, suitably between 79 mm and 87 mm, suitably 83 mm.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0129">An axial end of the body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> is visible at the distal end <b>115</b> of the article <b>101</b>. However, in other embodiments, the distal end <b>115</b> of the article <b>101</b> may comprise an end member (not shown) covering the axial end of the body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0130">The body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> is joined to the filter assembly <b>105</b> by annular tipping paper (not shown), which is located substantially around the circumference of the filter assembly <b>105</b> to surround the filter assembly <b>105</b> and extends partially along the length of the body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b>. In one example, the tipping paper is made of 58GSM standard tipping base paper. In one example the tipping paper has a length of between 42 mm and 50 mm, suitably of 46 mm.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0131">In one example, the cooling segment <b>107</b> is an annular tube and is located around and defines an air gap within the cooling segment. The air gap provides a chamber for heated volatilized components generated from the body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> to flow. The cooling segment <b>107</b> is hollow to provide a chamber for aerosol accumulation yet rigid enough to withstand axial compressive forces and bending moments that might arise during manufacture and whilst the article <b>101</b> is in use during insertion into the device <b>51</b>. In one example, the thickness of the wall of the cooling segment <b>107</b> is approximately 0.29 mm.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0132">The cooling segment <b>107</b> provides a physical displacement between the aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> and the filter segment <b>109</b>. The physical displacement provided by the cooling segment <b>107</b> will provide a thermal gradient across the length of the cooling segment <b>107</b>. In one example the cooling segment <b>107</b> is configured to provide a temperature differential of at least 40 degrees Celsius between a heated volatilized component entering a first end of the cooling segment <b>107</b> and a heated volatilized component exiting a second end of the cooling segment <b>107</b>. In one example the cooling segment <b>107</b> is configured to provide a temperature differential of at least 60&#xb0; C. between a heated volatilized component entering a first end of the cooling segment <b>107</b> and a heated volatilized component exiting a second end of the cooling segment <b>107</b>. This temperature differential across the length of the cooling element <b>107</b> protects the temperature sensitive filter segment <b>109</b> from the high temperatures of the aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> when it is heated by the device <b>51</b>. If the physical displacement was not provided between the filter segment <b>109</b> and the body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> and the heating elements of the device <b>51</b>, then the temperature sensitive filter segment <b>109</b> may become damaged in use, so it would not perform its required functions as effectively.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0133">In one example the length of the cooling segment <b>107</b> is at least 15 mm. In one example, the length of the cooling segment <b>107</b> is between 20 mm and 30 mm, more particularly 23 mm to 27 mm, more particularly 25 mm to 27 mm, suitably 25 mm.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0134">The cooling segment <b>107</b> is made of paper, which means that it is comprised of a material that does not generate compounds of concern, for example, toxic compounds when in use adjacent to the heater of the device <b>51</b>. In one example, the cooling segment <b>107</b> is manufactured from a spirally wound paper tube which provides a hollow internal chamber yet maintains mechanical rigidity. Spirally wound paper tubes are able to meet the tight dimensional accuracy requirements of high-speed manufacturing processes with respect to tube length, outer diameter, roundness and straightness.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0135">In another example, the cooling segment <b>107</b> is a recess created from stiff plug wrap or tipping paper. The stiff plug wrap or tipping paper is manufactured to have a rigidity that is sufficient to withstand the axial compressive forces and bending moments that might arise during manufacture and whilst the article <b>101</b> is in use during insertion into the device <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0136">The filter segment <b>109</b> may be formed of any filter material sufficient to remove one or more volatilized compounds from heated volatilized components from the aerosol-generating material. In one example the filter segment <b>109</b> is made of a mono-acetate material, such as cellulose acetate. The filter segment <b>109</b> provides cooling and irritation-reduction from the heated volatilized components without depleting the quantity of the heated volatilized components to an unsatisfactory level for a user.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0137">In some embodiments, a capsule (not illustrated) may be provided in filter segment <b>109</b>. It may be disposed substantially centrally in the filter segment <b>109</b>, both across the filter segment <b>109</b> diameter and along the filter segment <b>109</b> length. In other cases, it may be offset in one or more dimension. The capsule may in some cases, where present, contain a volatile component such as a flavorant or aerosol forming material.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0138">The density of the material of the filter segment <b>109</b> controls the pressure drop across the filter segment <b>109</b>, which in turn controls the draw resistance of the article <b>101</b>. Therefore the selection of the material of the filter segment <b>109</b> is important in controlling the resistance to draw of the article <b>101</b>. In addition, the filter segment performs a filtration function in the article <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0139">In one example, the filter segment <b>109</b> is made of an 8Y15 grade of filter tow material, which provides a filtration effect on the heated volatilized material, whilst also reducing the size of condensed aerosol droplets which result from the heated volatilized material.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0140">The presence of the filter segment <b>109</b> provides an insulating effect by providing further cooling to the heated volatilized components that exit the cooling segment <b>107</b>. This further cooling effect reduces the contact temperature of the user's lips on the surface of the filter segment <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0141">In one example, the filter segment <b>109</b> is between 6 mm to 10 mm in length, suitably 8 mm.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0142">The mouth end segment <b>111</b> is an annular tube and is located around and defines an air gap within the mouth end segment <b>111</b>. The air gap provides a chamber for heated volatilized components that flow from the filter segment <b>109</b>. The mouth end segment <b>111</b> is hollow to provide a chamber for aerosol accumulation yet rigid enough to withstand axial compressive forces and bending moments that might arise during manufacture and whilst the article is in use during insertion into the device <b>51</b>. In one example, the thickness of the wall of the mouth end segment <b>111</b> is approximately 0.29 mm. In one example, the length of the mouth end segment <b>111</b> is between 6 mm to 10 mm, suitably 8 mm.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0143">The mouth end segment <b>111</b> may be manufactured from a spirally wound paper tube which provides a hollow internal chamber yet maintains critical mechanical rigidity. Spirally wound paper tubes are able to meet the tight dimensional accuracy requirements of high-speed manufacturing processes with respect to tube length, outer diameter, roundness and straightness.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0144">The mouth end segment <b>111</b> provides the function of preventing any liquid condensate that accumulates at the exit of the filter segment <b>109</b> from coming into direct contact with a user.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0145">It should be appreciated that, in one example, the mouth end segment <b>111</b> and the cooling segment <b>107</b> may be formed of a single tube and the filter segment <b>109</b> is located within that tube separating the mouth end segment <b>111</b> and the cooling segment <b>107</b>.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0146">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, there are shown a partially cut-away section and perspective views of an example of an article <b>301</b>. The reference numerals used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> correspond to the reference numerals used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, incremented by 200.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0147">In the example of the article <b>301</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, a ventilation region <b>317</b> is provided in the article <b>301</b> to enable air to flow into the interior of the article <b>301</b> from the exterior of the article <b>301</b>. In one example the ventilation region <b>317</b> takes the form of one or more ventilation holes <b>317</b> formed through the outer layer of the article <b>301</b>. The ventilation holes may be located in the cooling segment <b>307</b> to aid with the cooling of the article <b>301</b>. In one example, the ventilation region <b>317</b> comprises one or more rows of holes, and preferably, each row of holes is arranged circumferentially around the article <b>301</b> in a cross-section that is substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the article <b>301</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0148">In one example, there are between one to four rows of ventilation holes to provide ventilation for the article <b>301</b>. Each row of ventilation holes may have between 12 to 36 ventilation holes <b>317</b>. The ventilation holes <b>317</b> may, for example, be between 100 &#x3bc;m to 500 &#x3bc;m in diameter. In one example, an axial separation between rows of ventilation holes <b>317</b> is between 0.25 mm and 0.75 mm, suitably 0.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0149">In one example, the ventilation holes <b>317</b> are of uniform size. In another example, the ventilation holes <b>317</b> vary in size. The ventilation holes can be made using any suitable technique, for example, one or more of the following techniques: laser technology, mechanical perforation of the cooling segment <b>307</b> or pre-perforation of the cooling segment <b>307</b> before it is formed into the article <b>301</b>. The ventilation holes <b>317</b> are positioned so as to provide effective cooling to the article <b>301</b>.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0150">In one example, the rows of ventilation holes <b>317</b> are located at least 11 mm from the proximal end <b>313</b> of the article, suitably between 17 mm and 20 mm from the proximal end <b>313</b> of the article <b>301</b>. The location of the ventilation holes <b>317</b> is positioned such that user does not block the ventilation holes <b>317</b> when the article <b>301</b> is in use.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0151">Providing the rows of ventilation holes between 17 mm and 20 mm from the proximal end <b>313</b> of the article <b>301</b> enables the ventilation holes <b>317</b> to be located outside of the device <b>51</b>, when the article <b>301</b> is fully inserted in the device <b>51</b>, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>. By locating the ventilation holes outside of the device, non-heated air is able to enter the article <b>301</b> through the ventilation holes from outside the device <b>51</b> to aid with the cooling of the article <b>301</b>.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0152">The length of the cooling segment <b>307</b> is such that the cooling segment <b>307</b> will be partially inserted into the device <b>51</b>, when the article <b>301</b> is fully inserted into the device <b>51</b>. The length of the cooling segment <b>307</b> provides a first function of providing a physical gap between the heater arrangement of the device <b>51</b> and the heat sensitive filter arrangement <b>309</b>, and a second function of enabling the ventilation holes <b>317</b> to be located in the cooling segment, whilst also being located outside of the device <b>51</b>, when the article <b>301</b> is fully inserted into the device <b>51</b>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the majority of the cooling element <b>307</b> is located within the device <b>51</b>.

The device <b>51</b> is a heating device which releases compounds by heating, but not burning, the aerosol-generating material.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0154">A first end <b>53</b> is sometimes referred to herein as the mouth or proximal end <b>53</b> of the device <b>51</b> and a second end <b>55</b> is sometimes referred to herein as the distal end <b>55</b> of the device <b>51</b>. The device <b>51</b> has an on/off button <b>57</b> to allow the device <b>51</b> as a whole to be switched on and off as desired by a user.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0155">The device <b>51</b> comprises a housing <b>59</b> for locating and protecting various internal components of the device <b>51</b>. In the example shown, the housing <b>59</b> comprises a uni-body sleeve <b>11</b> that encompasses the perimeter of the device <b>51</b>, capped with a top panel <b>17</b> which defines generally the &#x2018;top&#x2019; of the device <b>51</b> and a bottom panel <b>19</b> which defines generally the &#x2018;bottom&#x2019; of the device <b>51</b>. In another example the housing comprises a front panel, a rear panel and a pair of opposite side panels in addition to the top panel <b>17</b> and the bottom panel <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0156">The top panel <b>17</b> and/or the bottom panel <b>19</b> may be removably fixed to the uni-body sleeve <b>11</b>, to permit easy access to the interior of the device <b>51</b>, or may be &#x201c;permanently&#x201d; fixed to the uni-body sleeve <b>11</b>, for example to deter a user from accessing the interior of the device <b>51</b>. In an example, the panels <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> are made of a plastics material, including for example glass-filled nylon formed by injection molding, and the uni-body sleeve <b>11</b> is made of aluminum, though other materials and other manufacturing processes may be used.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0157">The top panel <b>17</b> of the device <b>51</b> has an opening <b>20</b> at the mouth end <b>53</b> of the device <b>51</b> through which, in use, the article <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> including the aerosol-generating material may be inserted into the device <b>51</b> and removed from the device <b>51</b> by a user.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0158">The housing <b>59</b> has located or fixed therein a heater arrangement <b>23</b>, control circuitry <b>25</b> and a power source <b>27</b>. In this example, the heater arrangement <b>23</b>, the control circuitry <b>25</b> and the power source <b>27</b> are laterally adjacent (that is, adjacent when viewed from an end), with the control circuitry <b>25</b> being located generally between the heater arrangement <b>23</b> and the power source <b>27</b>, though other locations are possible.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0159">The control circuitry <b>25</b> may include a controller, such as a microprocessor arrangement, configured and arranged to control the heating of the aerosol-generating material in the article <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> as discussed further below.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0160">The power source <b>27</b> may be for example a battery, which may be a rechargeable battery or a non-rechargeable battery. Examples of suitable batteries include for example a lithium-ion battery, a nickel battery (such as a nickel-cadmium battery), an alkaline battery and/or the like. The battery <b>27</b> is electrically coupled to the heater arrangement <b>23</b> to supply electrical power when required and under control of the control circuitry <b>25</b> to heat the aerosol-generating material in the article (as discussed, to volatilize the aerosol-generating material without causing the aerosol-generating material to burn).</p><p id="p-0153" num="0161">An advantage of locating the power source <b>27</b> laterally adjacent to the heater arrangement <b>23</b> is that a physically large power source <b>27</b> may be used without causing the device <b>51</b> as a whole to be unduly lengthy. As will be understood, in general a physically large power source <b>25</b> has a higher capacity (that is, the total electrical energy that can be supplied, often measured in Amp-hours or the like) and thus the battery life for the device <b>51</b> can be longer.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0162">In one example, the heater arrangement <b>23</b> is generally in the form of a hollow cylindrical tube, having a hollow interior heating chamber (not shown) into which the article <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> comprising the aerosol-generating material is inserted for heating in use. Different arrangements for the heater arrangement <b>23</b> are possible. For example, the heater arrangement <b>23</b> may comprise a single heating element or may be formed of plural heating elements aligned along the longitudinal axis of the heater arrangement <b>23</b>. The or each heating element may be annular or tubular, or at least part-annular or part-tubular around its circumference. In an example, the or each heating element may be a thin film heater. In another example, the or each heating element may be made of a ceramics material. Examples of suitable ceramics materials include alumina and aluminum nitride and silicon nitride ceramics, which may be laminated and sintered. Other heating arrangements are possible, including for example inductive heating, infrared heater elements, which heat by emitting infrared radiation, or resistive heating elements formed by for example a resistive electrical winding.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0163">In one particular example, the heater arrangement <b>23</b> is supported by a stainless steel support tube and comprises a polyimide heating element. The heater arrangement <b>23</b> is dimensioned so that substantially the whole of the body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b>, <b>303</b> of the article <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> is inserted into the heater arrangement <b>23</b> when the article <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> is inserted into the device <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0164">The or each heating element may be arranged so that selected zones of the aerosol-generating material can be independently heated, for example in turn (over time, as discussed above) or together (simultaneously) as desired.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0165">The heater arrangement <b>23</b> in this example is surrounded along at least part of its length by a thermal insulator <b>31</b>. The thermal insulator <b>31</b> helps to reduce heat passing from the heater arrangement <b>23</b> to the exterior of the device <b>51</b>. This helps to keep down the power requirements for the heater arrangement <b>23</b> as it reduces heat losses generally. The thermal insulator <b>31</b> also helps to keep the exterior of the device <b>51</b> cool during operation of the heater arrangement <b>23</b>. In one example, the thermal insulator <b>31</b> may be a double-walled sleeve which provides a low pressure region between the two walls of the sleeve. That is, the thermal insulator <b>31</b> may be for example a &#x201c;vacuum&#x201d; tube, i.e. a tube that has been at least partially evacuated so as to minimize heat transfer by conduction and/or convection. Other arrangements for the thermal insulator <b>31</b> are possible, including using heat insulating materials, including for example a suitable foam-type material, in addition to or instead of a double-walled sleeve.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0166">The housing <b>59</b> may further comprises various internal support structures <b>37</b> for supporting all internal components, as well as the heating arrangement <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0167">The device <b>51</b> further comprises a collar <b>33</b> which extends around and projects from the opening <b>20</b> into the interior of the housing <b>59</b> and a generally tubular chamber <b>35</b> which is located between the collar <b>33</b> and one end of the thermal insulator <b>31</b>.
