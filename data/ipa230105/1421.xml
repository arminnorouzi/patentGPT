Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, a food waste disposer is an apparatus for processing food waste by drying, stirring, and grinding the food waste. The food waste disposer includes a grinding device for stirring and grinding food waste. Also, the food waste disposer includes a heater for applying heat to the grinding device to dry food waste contained in the grinding device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The grinding device includes a grinding case used as a container in which food waste is stored, and a grinder which is rotatable inside the grinding case.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, when the grinder stirs and grinds food waste contained in the grinding case, the food waste tends to move gradually to the inner side wall of the grinding case.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The food waste moved to the inner side wall of the grinding case is clumped together, which may deteriorate the grinding performance of the food waste disposer. Also, the clumped food waste may interfere with rotations of the grinder, which may overload the driving motor of the grinder.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, it is an aspect of the disclosure to provide a food waste disposer having a compact layout.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is another aspect of the disclosure to provide a food waste disposer having a compact size and capable of improving grinding performance of a grinder.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additional aspects of the disclosure will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A food waste disposer according to a concept of the disclosure includes: a housing; a grinder detachably installed inside the housing and configured to grind food waste accommodated therein; and a deodorizer positioned to a side of the grinder, and configured to suck a smell generated from the grinder and discharge the smell to outside of the housing, wherein the grinder includes: a grinding case;
