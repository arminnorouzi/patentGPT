The known drawing device includes a rotatable italic nib pen holder, a holding device of a sheet to be drawn on, and a drive control device that causes relative positions of both the pen holder and the holding device to be displaced in an XY direction. This drawing device detects a movement vector in the XY direction, and controls a drawing angle of the italic nib pen in that direction, and performs control such that a drawing line width becomes a value that is set in advance.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since the drawing line width is a constant pre-set value, the above-described drawing device cannot change the line width at a desired position in the object. Thus, there is a problem in that a power of expression of an appearance of the object is poor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In light of the foregoing problem, an object of the present disclosure is to provide a drawing device that automatically changes a line width of a line segment while drawing a single object.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A drawing device, for drawing an object on a workpiece using a pen, according to the present disclosure includes a holder, a first movement portion, a rotation portion, a processor, and a memory. The holder is configured to hold the pen. The first movement portion is configured to move the holder and the workpiece relative to each other in an X direction and a Y direction. The X direction and the Y direction are mutually orthogonal. The rotation portion is configured to rotate the holder around a rotational axis parallel to a Z direction orthogonal to the X direction and the Y direction. The memory stores drawing data and angle data for each of a plurality of line segments configuring the object. The drawing data relates to a position of the line segment and to a length of the line segment. The angle data relates to a rotation angle of the holder. The rotation angle corresponds to a line width of the line segment. The memory stores computer-readable instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to perform processes. The processes comprising first acquiring, first rotating, first drawing, second acquiring, second rotating, and second drawing. The first acquiring acquires, from the memory, the drawing data and the angle data of a preceding line segment. The first rotating rotates the rotation portion, in accordance with the angle data of the preceding line segment acquired by the first acquiring. The first drawing controls the first movement portion to draw on the workpiece using the pen, in accordance with the drawing data of the preceding line segment acquired by the first acquiring. The second acquiring acquires, from the memory, the drawing data and angle data of a subsequent line segment continuously subsequent to the preceding line segment. The second rotating rotates the rotation portion in accordance with the angle data of the subsequent line segment acquired by the second acquiring. The second drawing controls the first movement portion to draw on the workpiece using the pen, in accordance with the drawing data of the subsequent line segment acquired by the second acquiring.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the above-described drawing device, since the rotation portion rotates the holder in accordance with the angle data of the line segment, the pen held by the holder can perform the rotation per line segment while drawing the single object.
