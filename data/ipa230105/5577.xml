Electronic medical records and computerized provider order entry provide many advantages over prior art paper medical record documentation systems. Moving from paper to electronic records and orders can, for example, increase the efficiency of health care, as well as health and insurance payment systems.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electronic medical records and orders also provide an important advantage because they simplify both the storage and transfer of important medical history data, including prescribed drugs, blood type, allergies, and existing medical conditions, and enable electronic verification and checking of data. Electronic medical records are typically also more complete than the medical records of the past, which often relied on information retrieved directly from the patient. The patient data could be incomplete due to memory failure, or the failure to maintain complete personal records. Computerized medical systems, therefore, are an important improvement over prior art processes and lead to improved diagnosis and treatment decisions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While computerized medical systems and records provide important improvements in patient care and help to reduce health care costs the ease of entry of medical data in computerized systems can also lead to some problems. The online journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, for example, recently published an article evaluating the incidence of duplicate medication orders before and after computerized provider order entry. This study found that the ease of order entry actually increased the number of duplicative order errors at studied hospitals, and that the entry of duplicative orders had more than tripled after the introduction of CPOE&#x2014;increasing from 2.6% to 8.1%. Because duplicate orders can lead to unnecessary and costly duplication of medical procedures, decrease efficiency by tying up resources that could be used elsewhere, and adversely impact inventory procedure in pharmacies and other areas of medical facilities, it is important to minimize duplicate, similar, and overlapping entries.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Existing medical order systems often use pop-up windows to notify the medical practitioner that a duplicate or similar order exists. While these warnings can be effective in some cases, pop-up windows are often easy to disable, and are frequently ignored by computer users, who suffer from &#x201c;fatigue&#x201d; due to over-use of pop-up windows, or who associate pop-up windows with unwanted advertising. These systems, therefore, are often ineffective, and do not minimize duplicative order entry by medical personnel.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention addresses these and other issues.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, the present invention can provide a medical records computer system that includes a processor, a memory coupled to the processor and storing a patient database, a user interface device coupled to the processor, and a display communicatively coupled to the processor and the memory. The display includes an existing order portion displaying at least one existing medical order retrieved from the patient database, and a new order portion adjacent the existing order portion for displaying a new medical order entered by medical personnel using the user interface. The processor is programmed to receive and display the new medical order on the new order portion of the display, compare the new medical order to the existing medical orders in the patient database to determine whether the existing medical order is medically similar to the new medical order, and highlight at least one of the existing medical order and the new medical order on the display when the existing medical order is medically similar to the new medical order. A medical practitioner entering the new order, therefore, is provided with a warning in real time to prevent the entry of a medically similar order, and therefore to minimize the possibility of the entry of medically similar orders for the patient.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The existing order portion of the display can display a plurality of existing medical orders categorized in medical order types. The processor can also be programmed to highlight the medical order type that contains the existing medical order that is medically similar to the new order. Again, the medical practitioner is therefore notified of the existing orders for quick analysis without the need for a pop-up window or display.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The processor can also be programmed to highlight at least one of the existing medical order and the new medical order on the display by changing a font of at least one of the existing medical order and the new medical order, by changing a color of the font, or by applying a color highlight to at least one of the existing medical order and the new medical order on the display. The processor can also or alternatively be programmed to highlight at least one of the existing medical order and the new order on the display by visually enclosing the selected order within a line or box on the display.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The processor can also be programmed to scroll the display to position the existing medical order and the new medical order adjacent one another in the first and second portions of the display, or to sort the existing medical orders to position an identified existing medical order at a position adjacent the medically similar new medical order.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The medical records computer system can also include a database storing a plurality of known medical orders and similar medical orders, and the processor can be programmed to compare the known medical orders to the new medical order to identify a match, retrieve the corresponding similar medical orders from the database, compare the similar medical orders to the existing medical order to determine whether the new medical order is similar to the existing medical order, and highlight the existing medical order when it is similar to the new medical order. The database can also correlate the known medical orders with categories of medical order types, and the existing medical orders can be correlated with corresponding medical order types on the display. The processor can be further programmed to highlight the medical order type corresponding to the new medical order on the existing order portion of the display.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The medical records system can include a memory storing a medical orders database comprising a plurality of known medical orders grouped in a plurality of categories based on a medical order type, and a patient database comprising at least one existing medical order initiated for a selected patient which is also categorized in a medical order type and can compare the new medical order to the orders database to determine a medical order type. The processor can also compare the new medical order to the existing medical orders of the same medical order type in the patient database to determine whether the existing medical order is medically similar to the new medical order, and highlight at least one of the existing medical order type corresponding to the new medical order, the existing medical order that is medically similar to the new medical order, and the new medical order on the display when the existing medical order is medically similar to the new medical order. Again, the medical practitioner entering the new order is provided with a warning in real time to prevent the entry of a medically similar order.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The existing order portion of the display can display a plurality of existing medical orders categorized in medical order types, and the processor can be programmed to highlight at least one of the predetermined medical order types that contains the existing medical order that is medically similar to the new order.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The processor can also be programmed to group the existing medical order with other existing medical orders of the same medical order type on the display, and to highlight the medical order type that corresponds to the new medical order in the existing order portion of the display when a similar or duplicate order is found. In some applications, the processor can also be programmed to scroll the medical order type corresponding to the new medical order to a top portion of the existing order portion of the display to highlight the duplicate or similar entry.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The processor can also be programmed to visually group the existing medical orders corresponding to a medical order type by enclosing the existing medical orders in a box in the existing order portion of the display or to highlight at least one of the existing medical order and the new medical order on the display by scrolling the display to position the existing medical order and the new medical order adjacent one another in the first and second portions of the display, or by sorting the existing medical orders to position the existing medical order at a position adjacent the new medical order, or to highlight existing medical orders of the same medical order type to the new order to allow a medical practitioner to compare the new medical order to existing medical orders.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect, the present invention can comprise a method for minimizing entries of duplicate medical orders by medical personnel in a computerized medical records system. The method comprises the steps of storing at least one existing medical order initiated by medical personnel for a specific patient, and displaying the existing medical order on a first portion of a display screen, receiving a new medical order for the patient through a user interface, and displaying the new medical order on a second portion of a display screen. A processor compares the new medical order to the existing medical order, and highlights at least one of the existing medical order and the new medical order to provide a real time notification that at least one of a similar and a duplicate order has been entered.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">To identify similar orders, the method can also include storing a plurality of known medical orders and similar medical orders in a database for comparison, comparing the known medical orders to the new medical order to identify a match, retrieving the corresponding similar medical orders, comparing the similar medical orders to the existing medical order to determine whether the new medical order is similar to the existing medical order, and highlighting the existing medical order when it is similar to the new medical order.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The method can also include categorizing each of the existing medical orders as a predetermined medical order type, determining the medical order type of the new medical order, and highlighting the corresponding medical order type in the first portion of the display to enable a user to identify a duplicate or similar order. The method can further comprise the steps of comparing the new medical order to a database of known medical orders, and providing a warning to the user when a spelling error is detected. The user can also be provided with one or more alternatives for the user to select when the new medical order does not match any of the known medical orders.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following description.

The medical records computer system <b>10</b>, as shown here, comprises a central computer or server <b>16</b>, and a memory storage device <b>18</b> which stores databases of electronic medical records <b>30</b> (EMR) and medical orders <b>40</b>. The server <b>16</b> can be accessed by medical personnel through terminals or computers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> in communication with the server <b>16</b> at an inpatient facility, such as a hospital, clinic, or rehabilitation center, or at an outpatient facility. During an examination or patient visit, medical personnel access the electronic medical record for the patient by accessing the database <b>30</b> through the computer <b>12</b> or <b>14</b>. The data retrieved includes existing orders for the patient. When a new medical order is initiated by medical personnel, the system compares the new order against existing medical orders and data in the medical orders database <b>40</b>, and provides an indicator to the medical personnel if a medically similar order exists, thereby minimizing occurrences of medically similar orders, as described below. As used herein, the term &#x201c;medically similar&#x201d; means an order that is either duplicative of, therapeutically or diagnostically overlapping of, or therapeutically and/or diagnostically similar to an existing order. Medically similar orders can include, for example, different medications that are commonly ordered as a treatment for the same condition, or to treat the same symptoms, and which may therefore be effective duplicates. Similar medications can be identified as therapeutically or diagnostically similar, for example, based on their current procedural terminology (CPT) codes, including ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding. Here, medications in the same therapeutic class, and orders that are numerically similar in CPT code may overlap in treatment. Also, in some cases, a single lab order includes results that can also be obtained by taking a number of individual lab tests. A complete blood count (CBC), for example, includes a white blood cell (WBC) count. A WBC, therefore, overlaps an existing CBC order, as well as CBC with differential, CBC without differential, and CBC manual differential tests. Imaging procedures which acquire duplicate images of the same sector of the patient can also be duplicative.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, each of the computers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> comprises a user interface <b>22</b> for entry of data by medical personnel, and a display <b>24</b>. The computing devices <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> can comprise any number of known devices that are connectable to a network, and can include, without limitation, personal computing devices, cellular phones, tablets, notebooks, laptops, desktop computers, all-in-one computers, and other types of computer configurations. The computing devices <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> can be connected to the server <b>16</b> through the internet, or through other public or private networks including wide area networks, local area networks, wireless interfaces, cellular communication links, satellite communications, and various other types of communication links which will be known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Although the computer is shown here in a network configuration, stand alone computer devices capable of maintaining or connecting to appropriate databases can also be used without the need for a server or network.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an exemplary computer system <b>12</b> or <b>14</b> is shown. The computers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, as described above, include a display <b>24</b> and a user interface <b>22</b>, which are communicatively coupled to an internal processor <b>20</b>, memory <b>26</b>, and a communications or input/output (I/O) device <b>28</b> which can, as described above, link the computing device <b>12</b> to a server <b>16</b> or other external devices. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the user interface <b>22</b> can be or include a keyboard, mouse, joystick, pen, or other devices capable of providing input to the computer <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the display <b>24</b> can be provided with a touch screen, and the user interface <b>22</b> can be configured as a portion of the display function. The user interface <b>22</b> or the I/O device <b>28</b> can also include cameras and scanning devices, including magnetic, optical, or barcode scanners, and data ports such as universal serial bus (USB), RS-232, or other types of wired and wireless data links. Selective access can be provided to the system using password protection, biometric data, retinal scanners, fingerprint scanners, vascular biometrics analyzing the back of the hand or finger vein scans, RFID readers, encoded digital symbols such as bar codes, and other types of identifiers and reader devices. The computers <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> may also include audio generation systems and speakers, which are not shown.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, an exemplary EMR database <b>30</b> includes electronic medical records for patients, as described above. The database can include a patient identifier <b>32</b>, patient medical data <b>34</b>, medical order types <b>36</b>, and corresponding data related to existing medical orders <b>38</b> that have been entered for the patient. As shown here, the patient identification data can include a name and address of a patient, and may also include alternative identifiers such as social security number, insurance information and/or finger print, retinal scan, or other types of personal identification data or codes. Also as shown here, the patient medical data <b>34</b> can include information that can be used by medical personnel to identify drugs which are not appropriate for a given patient, including information about the patient's allergies (latex, bee venom, and penicillin) and information about medication orders the patient is already taking.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Medical order types <b>36</b> can include for instance, a request from medical personnel for an inpatient or outpatient procedure, a medication, a laboratory test, an evaluation, a treatment, or a nursing task to be performed. As used herein, medical order types can also include, for example, laboratory orders, imaging orders, diet, consults, and other types of orders made by medical personnel for a patient. Medication orders can also include, for example, medications taken at home by a patient including take-home medications, discharge medications, prescriptions, and facility administered medications including persistent facility-administered medications and prescriptions. For purposes of identifying similar or duplicate orders, medication orders can be divided into specified sub-types of Medical Orders <b>36</b> such as, for example, medication order&#x2014;pro re nata (PRN or &#x201c;as needed&#x201d; medication orders), medication order-continuous, and medication order-scheduled pharmaceutical delivery.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, existing medical orders <b>38</b> are correlated with medical order types <b>36</b>, and can be categorized to correspond to one or more medical order type <b>36</b>. In applications where CPT coding is used, for example, medical orders <b>38</b> within a predetermined numerical range of the CPT code assigned to the medical order <b>38</b> can be presumed to be medically similar. In these applications, the medical order type can correspond to a numerical range of CPT codes, and can be provided in the database <b>30</b> corresponding to the medical order <b>38</b> to provide a range for searching for medically similar orders. More generally, a medical order <b>38</b> may require a patient to take a medication prior to a blood test or other laboratory analysis. Here, the medical order <b>38</b> therefore can be appropriately categorized as both a lab order and a medication order for purposes of identifying a medical order type <b>36</b> and medically similar orders. The degree or level of similarity can be used to prioritize medical orders <b>36</b> with the corresponding medical order types <b>38</b> in database <b>30</b> and for comparison purposes.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, when a medical practitioner evaluates the patient to initiate additional orders, new orders for the patient can be entered into a window on display <b>22</b> as described more fully below. The entered data can be evaluated to determine whether the newly initiated order is medically similar to an existing order <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, one method of providing this function is by comparison to a medical orders database <b>40</b>. The medical orders database <b>40</b> can include a listing of known medical orders, including a standardized listing of medical order types <b>42</b>, specific medical orders <b>44</b> that correlate to the medical order type, and also, a list of medically similar orders <b>46</b> that are pre-determined to be sufficiently medically similar to the corresponding order to require a notification to medical personnel that the order may be unnecessary or unduly repetitive. The medical orders database <b>40</b> can be constructed specifically for a hospital, clinic, or other facility, or can be based on standards from public databases. Standard medical data can, for example, be retrieved through the internet or other networks and can be, as described above, CPT coding. Also as described above, the medical orders <b>44</b> can correspond to one or more medical order type <b>42</b>. Again, the corresponding medical order types <b>42</b> can be prioritized, or a degree of similarity to the corresponding medical order types <b>42</b> can be stored in memory with the medical orders <b>44</b>. Also as discussed above, where CPT coding is used, it can be assumed that CPT codes that are within a predetermined numerical range of the CPT code corresponding to the medical order <b>44</b> may be medically similar. Although a specialized medical orders database is shown here, standardized CPT codes and IC-9 and IC-10 databases can be accessed to provide similar types of data,</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an exemplary display screen <b>49</b> for use by a medical practitioner is shown. The display screen <b>49</b> is provided on display <b>22</b> of computer <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and can include a plurality of sections or windows, including an existing order section <b>50</b> for displaying existing orders <b>38</b> for the patient from database <b>30</b>, and a new order entry section <b>52</b> for entering or editing medical orders. A patient data section <b>51</b> can also be included. In one embodiment, as shown here, the patient data section <b>51</b> can be provided along an upper portion of the screen <b>49</b>, and the existing order section <b>50</b> and new order entry section <b>52</b> adjacent one another, where the existing order data can be viewed by a medical practitioner simultaneously with the new order data, as the data is entered into the order entry section <b>52</b> of the screen <b>49</b>. As shown here, the existing order section <b>50</b> and order entry section <b>52</b> can be in two adjacent columns.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the patient data section <b>51</b> displays information from patient database <b>30</b> and can include patient identification data <b>32</b>, such as a name, address, physical description, and a picture of the patient for verification by medical practitioners, and other data drawn from the database <b>30</b>, to allow a medical practitioner easy access to verify identification of the patient. The display screen <b>49</b> can also illustrate patient medical data <b>34</b> derived from database <b>30</b> for use by medical personnel in evaluating whether a specific type of order may be appropriate for the patient. This data can include, as described above, blood type information, patient allergy data, and important medical history data. The patient data can also include a list of identified medical problems for analysis and diagnosis.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the existing medical order section <b>50</b> displays each of the existing orders <b>38</b> that have been previously entered for the patient, which can be retrieved from the database <b>30</b>, along with icons that can be selectively activated by a medical practitioner to modify or discontinue the order. The existing orders are categorized by medical order type <b>36</b>, and all of the existing orders <b>38</b> of a particular type are grouped together on the screen <b>49</b> in the existing order section <b>50</b>. The grouped medical orders can include a visual indicator grouping all of the existing medical orders <b>38</b> of the same medical order type <b>42</b> together, as discussed below.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, after examining the patient, the medical practitioner can enter new medical orders into the order entry section <b>52</b> of the screen <b>49</b>. As shown here, the new order section <b>52</b> can include, for example, a text box section or window <b>54</b> that accepts input from the user interface <b>22</b>. A medical practitioner enters the new medical order into the text box <b>54</b>. As described below, as and after the text is entered into the text box <b>54</b>, the processor <b>20</b> takes a series of steps to evaluate whether medically similar orders have already been entered for the patient, and highlights any identified similar orders to notify the medical practitioner of a potential problem. A sequence diagram illustrating these steps is shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. Generally, the process begins by clearing the old highlights (step <b>69</b>). After new orders are entered (step <b>70</b>), the new orders are highlighted in a sidebar or window, the new order section <b>52</b> (step <b>76</b>). As described more fully below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, corresponding groups of existing medical orders <b>38</b> having the same medical order type <b>36</b> are highlighted (step <b>79</b>) in the existing order section <b>50</b> and then the existing orders <b>36</b> that are medically similar to the new order are highlighted (step <b>82</b>).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, and now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, in the first step of the process, any existing highlighting is cleared (step <b>69</b>). As the new order is entered into text box <b>54</b> (step <b>70</b>), the processor <b>20</b> compares the entered text to known orders <b>44</b> in a medical order database <b>40</b> (step <b>72</b>) until all possible matching orders are identified (step <b>74</b>). The processor <b>20</b> can, for example, parse the entered text string and compare either the entire text string or portions of the text string to known orders <b>44</b>. Rules can be provided specifying the degree of similarity between the text string or text string portion and a known order <b>44</b> to trigger identification as a possible match. The processor <b>20</b> can then display possible matches (step <b>74</b>) to the medical practitioner. Referring now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the matches can be displayed in a pop-up window or screen <b>55</b>. The medical practitioner can use a mouse, arrow keys, or other user input device to highlight and select an entry <b>61</b>. As shown here in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, for example, when a medical practitioner enters the letters TYL (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), a series of orders generated by the rules and including these letters is provided in window <b>55</b> for selection by the user (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Alternatively, the medical practitioner can continue to enter data directly into the text box <b>54</b>, using the window <b>55</b> as a guide, for example. If the practitioner chooses to enter the medical order into the new order entry text box <b>54</b> rather than selecting an order from the window <b>55</b>, and the order is not found, the process can be stopped and, for example, an error notice can be communicated to the medical practitioner on the display <b>22</b>, indicating that the new order entry was not found in the database <b>40</b> (step <b>73</b>). In some applications, a spell check can be performed on the new entry, and alternative choices offered to the medical practitioner.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In either case, the processor <b>20</b> waits (step <b>75</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) until the user selects an order from the list, or completely types the order into the text box <b>54</b>. When the entry is complete, the user can activate a &#x201c;new&#x201d; button, key or icon <b>53</b>, activate the enter key, or use a mouse or other device from user interface <b>22</b> to indicate acceptance of the entry, or otherwise provide an indication to the processor that an order entry has been identified and is ready for review and comparison for medically similar orders (step <b>76</b>).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, when an order is selected, the selected new medical order <b>56</b> is displayed and highlighted in the new order section <b>52</b>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the processor <b>20</b> in computer <b>12</b> takes a series of steps to evaluate the new medical order <b>56</b> to determine whether the new medical order <b>56</b> is medically similar to any of the existing medical orders <b>38</b> for the patient in database <b>30</b>, and to provide an indicator to the medical practitioner when a medically similar order may have been made. After the processor <b>26</b> receives the indicator that the new order <b>56</b> has been selected (step <b>76</b>), the processor <b>20</b> first identifies the medical order type attribute (step <b>77</b>).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The processor <b>20</b> then compares the medical order type or types <b>42</b> identified in database <b>40</b> as corresponding to the new order <b>56</b> to each of the medical order types <b>36</b> corresponding to the existing orders <b>38</b> in the patient database <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>)(step <b>78</b>). As described above, where CPT codes are used, this analysis can include a comparison to medical orders that have a CPT code within a predetermined numerical range of the CPT code corresponding to the new medical order <b>56</b>. If no match is found, no medical orders of the corresponding medical order type have been previously made, and the order can be entered when the medical practitioner indicates entry by, for example, activating the &#x201c;sign&#x201d; button <b>57</b>. (Step <b>80</b>) In some applications, the highlighting of the new medical order <b>56</b> could be changed or adjusted to indicate that no similar orders or duplicates have been found, providing an indicator to the medical practitioner that the order can be completed without overlap or duplication.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">If the database <b>30</b> includes existing medical orders <b>38</b> of the same medical order type <b>36</b> as the new medical order <b>56</b>, the processor <b>20</b> highlights the order type <b>36</b> in the existing order section <b>50</b> of the display <b>22</b> (step <b>79</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the existing orders <b>38</b> of the same or closest medical order type <b>36</b> are scrolled to the top of the existing order section <b>50</b> of the display <b>22</b> and highlighted, drawing the attention of the medical practitioner to the relevant group of existing orders in existing order section <b>50</b>. The processor <b>20</b> compares the new medical order <b>56</b> to the existing medical orders <b>38</b> corresponding to the identified medical order type, initially to determine whether an exact match, or duplicate, exists in the existing order database <b>30</b>. (step <b>81</b>). If a match is found, the processor <b>20</b> can highlight the corresponding medical order type in existing order section <b>50</b> of the screen <b>49</b> (step <b>82</b>) to provide a visual indicator to the medical practitioner that a duplicate exists. The new medical order <b>56</b> can also be highlighted. As shown here, for example, a line or box <b>64</b> can be drawn around the orders corresponding to each of the medication order&#x2014;PRN medical orders, allowing the medical practitioner to easily identify the existing orders of this type.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, if no identical match is found, the processor <b>20</b> retrieves similar orders from the medical orders database (step <b>83</b>) and compares the similar medical orders <b>46</b> corresponding to the new medical order <b>56</b> in database <b>40</b> to the existing orders <b>38</b> of the same medical order type or types in database <b>30</b> (step <b>84</b>). As described above, the similar medical orders <b>46</b> are orders that may be medically similar to the new medical order, rendering the new order unnecessary or repetitive. If a match is found, the processor <b>20</b> can, again, highlight the corresponding existing medical order <b>38</b> in existing order section <b>50</b> of the screen <b>49</b> (step <b>82</b>), and also the new medical order <b>56</b> in order entry section <b>52</b>, to provide a visual indicator to the medical practitioner that further analysis is required before completing the order. Since more than one medical order may be similar to the existing order, this process can be repeated until all of the similar medical orders are identified, and can also be provided after a duplicate medical order is identified. Additionally, the medical order database <b>40</b> can store a probability or confidence factor, indicating a degree of similarity between corresponding similar types of medical orders, and this confidence factor can be used in providing feedback to the medical practitioners initiating the order, as described below.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">If no match is found, the new order <b>56</b> is not medically similar to any existing orders, and the new order <b>56</b> can be entered into the patient database <b>30</b>. (Step <b>80</b>) In one embodiment of the invention, the medical practitioner can save the order entries by activating the &#x201c;save work&#x201d; button <b>58</b>, and sign the order by activating the &#x201c;sign&#x201d; button <b>57</b>. When the new order is saved, and the order is signed, the order is stored in the patient database <b>30</b>, with the corresponding medical order type. If the medical practitioner instead decides not to enter the order, the medical practitioner can activate the &#x201c;remove&#x201d; button <b>59</b>, removing the order from screen. If no match is found, the processor may also perform a spell check to determine if the order was entered correctly, or provide the medical practitioner with a number of alternate entries that the user may have intended to type. Alternatively, the processor <b>20</b> may provide a pop-up window, highlight the entry, or provide another indicator to the medical practitioner that no matches were found, or that the order entry may be incorrect. The user can then delete the order, save the order, or change the order and re-start the process.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, an example of the application of the order entry steps and review process described above can be seen by reference to the display <b>49</b>. As shown here, a medical practitioner has entered a new order <b>56</b> for acetaminophen in the new order section <b>52</b> of the display screen <b>49</b>. In response to this entry, the system <b>10</b> evaluates the new order entry <b>56</b> to determine the corresponding medical order type or types <b>42</b>, as discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. When a match is found, the system can scroll or sort the existing order section <b>50</b> of the display <b>49</b> to align the medical order type <b>36</b> at the existing entry <b>38</b> corresponding to the new entry adjacent the new order entry <b>56</b> at the top of the screen <b>49</b>, thereby allowing medical personnel to easily view the possible medically similar order. In the example shown here, the corresponding entry corresponds to the medication order&#x2014;PRN medical order type <b>42</b>, and this category is scrolled to the top of the existing order section <b>50</b> near the new order entry <b>56</b>. The corresponding medical order type <b>42</b> is visually highlighted on the screen <b>49</b> by, for example, drawing a highlighting line <b>64</b> around the identified order type and each of the corresponding orders in that particular portion of the screen <b>49</b>. A highlight, here shown as cross-hatching, can also be provided on the existing medical order <b>38</b> for acetaminophen which has already been initiated for the patient. The new order entry <b>56</b> in new order entry section <b>52</b> can also be similarly highlighted. The medical practitioner is therefore visually notified that a duplicate order exists in the medical order type selected. Because the duplicate order is scrolled to a location where it can be easily seen, the person entering the order can view the information easily and determine whether to change the existing order, delete the new order, or make a different recommendation, thereby minimizing the possibility of a duplicate or similar entry. Although cross-hatching and dotted lines are shown here for highlighting, changes in color, bold fonts, italics, and other types of highlighting can be used as described more fully below.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, either in addition to the steps described above, or as an alternative to the steps described above, the processor <b>20</b> can also search for medically similar orders <b>46</b> of any medical order type <b>42</b>. Using similar methodology to that described above, the processor <b>20</b> can, for example, search all existing medical orders <b>38</b> for orders that are medically similar to the new medical order <b>56</b>. Here, for example, the new medical order <b>56</b> includes &#x201c;acetaminophen.&#x201d; Acetaminophen level testing has been ordered for the patient as part of the &#x201c;lab&#x201d; medical order type group. Here, the processor identifies the use of the term &#x201c;acetaminophen&#x201d; in the lab type, and flags this order as medically similar. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the &#x201c;labs&#x201d; medical order type containing the medically similar order can be scrolled up on the screen <b>49</b>, and the term &#x201c;acetaminophen&#x201d; highlighted to indicate to the medical practitioner that the acetaminophen level test is a medically similar or overlapping order. The &#x201c;labs&#x201d; medical order type can be highlighted, as described above, or, since this order type does not match the order type attribute of the new medical order <b>56</b>, may be left un-highlighted. Multiple medically similar orders can therefore be highlighted in the existing medical order section <b>50</b> of the display <b>22</b>. A count of the number of medically similar orders can be provided in, for example, a text box <b>60</b> for the medical practitioner. These medically similar orders also can be organized based on degree of similarity. Here, for example, the first highlighted order includes both the same medical order type attribute and a medically similar order. The next group includes a medically similar order, but does not have the same medical order type attribute. Various methods for determining degree of similarity can be used in ordering the display. The degree of similarity can be indicated by order of display, as shown here, by the color of text, or using other variations in the highlighting options.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although a specific method of highlighting duplicate entries has been described, various highlighting methods can be used that would fall under the scope of the invention. For example, in some applications, the duplicate or similar entries could be emphasized by changing the font and displaying either the duplicate entry or both the newly entered and duplicate entries in an emphasized font, such as italics, bold, or underline. Alternatively, the size or color of the font of the entries could be adjusted to emphasize the match. In other alternatives, an icon or other visual indicator could be provided near the duplicate or medically similar entry, near the new medical order, or both.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In another example, a color coded system can also be used to identify various grades of similarity. For example, if a known duplicate order is found, the duplicate orders can be displayed in red, indicating a very likely need to stop and re-evaluate the situation before completing the order. Where a similar order is substantially medically similar to an existing order, such as, for example, where a generic drug is ordered at the same time as a brand name drug, these entries can be highlighted in orange. As discussed above, a confidence factor indicating a likelihood that two orders are similar can also be provided in the medical orders database <b>40</b>, and this data can be used to vary the colors of the highlighting, varying, for example, from yellow to orange, to red, depending on the degree of confidence. Similarly, a &#x201c;green&#x201d; highlight could be used to indicate that no duplicate or similar order has been found, and the entry of the order can proceed. In situations where more than one duplicate or similar order has been identified, the identified existing orders could be color-coded depending on the degree of similarity. Similarly, the size of the font could be varied, with the largest font being used to display the closest similar order, and less similar orders can be displayed using a smaller, but still emphasized, font. The similar orders could also be sorted based on degree of confidence, and displayed in the sorted order, displayed with a numerical ranking, or displayed with a confidence factor rating.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Various other types of visual indicators could also be used. For example, the duplicate orders could be highlighted by causing the corresponding orders to &#x201c;blink&#x201d; on and off. Icons can be used to identify duplicate and similar orders, and can be positioned adjacent the entries for analysis. The icons could also be used to provide selective access to information about the highlighted order, and information about why the highlighted order is considered to be similar to the new order entry. This information could be used by the medical practitioners to make a determination regarding whether to proceed with an order.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition to visual highlighting, an audible warning could be used to indicate that a duplicate or similar entry has been identified. Again, the audible warnings could be varied depending on the degree of confidence that an order needs to be re-evaluated before entry, and range in intensity or volume depending on the correlation factor.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although a specific method and series of steps for identifying duplicate or similar orders has been described above, this method is exemplary. Various other methods can be also be used. For example, in some applications, such as the process described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the processor can identify and highlight all of the orders of the same medical order type in the existing medical order section of the display without searching for an exact duplicate or similar order, and thereby allow the medical practitioner to evaluate all of the corresponding orders. In some applications, all orders having a similar spelling could be highlighted, and preferably sorted to the top of the screen, thereby allowing a medical practitioner to easily review the data for possible errors.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Additionally, although the system is described as providing medical orders categorized in medical order types, the comparison could be made to each medical order rather than the medical order types. Various other methods of evaluating medically similar orders and methods for categorizing medical orders and medical order types can also be used. Further, although the medical practitioner enters the medical order into the system in the method described above, and the system automatically determines the medical order type, in alternate embodiments the medical practitioner could enter both the new medical order type and the new medical order.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some applications, the amount and type of feedback provided to the user can be varied based on, for example, the identity of the medical practitioner accessing the system. For example, selective access can be provided to the system using password protection, biometric data, RFID codes, barcodes, or other types of identification systems, and the amount of feedback provided could be varied based on the identity of the medical practitioner accessing the system. A first user could, for example, request that feedback be provided only when an exact duplicate is found. A second user could request that all similar orders be identified. A third user could request that all orders of the corresponding medical order type be highlighted. In some applications, a facility could implement a policy that various categories of employees be provided with selected types of feedback. For example, a facility could provide a certain level of feedback to all physicians, and a different level of feedback to physician assistants or nurse practitioners.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Furthermore, although the duplicate identification process is described as controlled by processor <b>20</b> of computer <b>12</b>, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the process could be performed by other computer devices in the network as well. Additionally, although data entry is described by keyboard entry through a text box, it will be apparent that data can be entered using a pen-based system, through voice commands, through drop down boxes, by scanning data into the computer, or through other methods known to those of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">It should be understood that the methods and apparatuses described above are only exemplary and do not limit the scope of the invention, and that various modifications could be made by those skilled in the art that would fall under the scope of the invention.
