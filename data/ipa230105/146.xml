Shisha devices may include one outlet, or more than one outlet so that the device may be used by more than one consumer at a time. Use of shisha devices is considered by some to be a leisure activity and a social experience.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, traditional shishas are used in combination with a substrate, sometimes referred to in the art as hookah tobacco, tobacco molasses, or simply as molasses. Traditional shisha substrates are relatively high in sugar (in some cases, up to &#x2dc;50% vs. the &#x2dc;20% typically found in conventional tobacco substrates, such as in combustible cigarettes). The tobacco used in shisha devices may be mixed with other ingredients to, for example, increase the volume of the vapor and smoke produced, to alter flavor, or both.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditional shisha devices employ charcoal, such as charcoal pellets to heat and sometimes combust the tobacco substrate to generate an aerosol for inhalation by a user. Using charcoal to heat the tobacco may cause full or partial combustion of the tobacco or other ingredients. Additionally, charcoal may generate harmful or potentially harmful products, such as carbon monoxide, which may mix with the shisha vapor and pass through the water basin to the outlet.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One way to reduce the production of carbon monoxide and combustion by-products is to employ e-liquids rather than tobacco. Shisha devices that employ e-liquids eliminate combustion by-products but deprive shisha consumers of the traditional tobacco-based experience.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other shisha devices have been proposed that employ electric heaters to heat, but not combust, tobacco. Such electrically heated heat-not-burn shisha devices heat the tobacco substrate to a temperature sufficient to produce an aerosol from the substrate without combusting the substrate, and therefore reduce or eliminate by-products associated with combustion of tobacco.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Shisha devices may employ a cartridge for housing an aerosol-forming substrate. The cartridge may be filled with such aerosol-forming substrate. The aerosol-forming substrate may comprise tobacco, preferably shisha substrate, such as molasses&#x2014;a mixture of tobacco, water, sugar, and other components, such as glycerine, flavors, etc. The heating system of the electrically heated shisha device heats the contents of the cartridge to generate aerosol, which is conveyed through an airflow path to a user.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to facilitate airflow through the cartridge and the flow of the aerosol from the cartridge, a shisha cartridge may have one or more holes through one or more walls. The cartridge may include one or more holes at the top, one or more holes at the bottom, or both one or more holes at the top and one or more holes at the bottom. Alternatively, the top may be open, that is, the top wall may be partially or completely absent. Any holes or openings in the top and bottom walls may be closed by a removable (for example, peelable) sealing layer, such as a film, sticker, or liner, during storage. The removable layer may protect the contents (for example, the molasses) from exposure to air and oxygen. The removable layer may be removed (for example, pulled or peeled off) by a user prior to first use of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The holes or openings in the cartridge, if left unsealed, may lead to loss of freshness (for example, moisture content) or contamination of the substrate, as well as issues with leakage. For one or more reasons, such as in order to maintain freshness, to prevent leakage of the substrate, or to preserve the quality and integrity of the substrate during storage, it is desirable to close or seal the openings or holes of the cartridge prior to use or between uses if the entire contents of the cartridge are not used at once.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, having a user peel or remove seal to expose the openings in the cartridge may result in some of the contents spilling or leaking onto a user's hands. The user may also have contents of the cartridge spill or leak on their hands when removing a used cartridge from the shisha device. In addition, the cartridge may be hot when removed from the shisha device, which may cause some discomfort for a user grasping the cartridge for removal.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Various embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a tray for use with a shisha device and a shisha device or cartridge including such a tray. The cartridge may be placed in the tray, and the user may handle the tray rather than the cartridge for one or more steps associated with use of the cartridge with the shisha device. For example, the tray may be used to place the cartridge in the shisha device, may be used to remove the cartridge from the shisha device, or may be used to place the cartridge in the shisha device and to remove the cartridge from the shisha device. Preferably, the cartridge may be used with the shisha device while the cartridge is received in the tray. That is, the shisha device may preferably be operated to generate aerosol from the aerosol-forming substrate of the cartridge for delivery to a user when the tray with the received cartridge are inserted into a shisha device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The tray may be configured to pierce the cartridge to introduce openings for airflow through the cartridge when the cartridge is used with the shisha device. Accordingly, the user may avoid direct contact with the cartridge when the cartridge is pierced by the tray. Preferably, the cartridge does not include preformed openings covered by a removable seal so that the user may avoid accidental contact with cartridge contents when removing the seal. Rather, the tray may be used to pierce the cartridge to form one or more openings. In addition to preventing accidental contact of the cartridge contents with the user's hands, cartridges without preformed holes tend to have an advantage of longer shelf life relative to cartridges that have preformed holes, even if covered by a removable seal.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The tray may comprise one or more features or elements that aid in proper insertion of cartridge into shisha device, which may provide for a more reliable experience for the user.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The tray may prevent users from directly contacting a hot surface of shisha device or cartridge after heating by the shisha device, which may decrease the change of discomfort due to direct contact with the hot surface. The tray may facilitate disposal of the cartridges after use in the shisha device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another embodiment, a tray for use with a shisha device may comprise a body defining a cavity for receiving a cartridge containing an aerosol forming substrate. The cavity may have an open top end into which the cartridge is insertable and may have a bottom end. The tray may include a piercing element extending into the cavity from the bottom end of the cavity. The piercing element may be positioned to pierce the cartridge at a first surface when the cartridge is inserted into the cavity of the tray and force is applied to the cartridge to cause the first surface of the cartridge to move towards the bottom end of the cavity.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The body of the tray may comprise a sidewall that forms an interior surface of the cavity. The sidewall may be formed from a thermally conductive material. The thermally conductive material may transfer heat from a heating element of the shisha device to the cartridge to heat the aerosol-forming substrate in the cartridge to volatilize one or more constituents of the substrate for delivery in an aerosol to a user.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">At least a portion of the sidewall may taper inwardly in a direction from the open top end of the cavity to the bottom end of the cavity. Such a shape may aid in positioning a similarly shaped cartridge within the cavity. For example, the cartridge may be readily inserted until the bottom portion of cartridge has a section of the tapered sidewall. For example, the cartridge may be frustoconical, and the sidewall may be configured to contact the cartridge along a length of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The tray may comprise a handle extending from the body away from the cavity. The handle may allow the user to manipulate the cartridge without touching the cartridge during the manipulation.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The handle may comprise a thermally insulating material. Thermal insulation may allow the user to grasp the handle without experiencing discomfort that may be associated with grasping a hot cartridge removed from the shisha device soon after the cartridge has been heated by the device.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The tray may comprise a sidewall that forms an interior surface of the cavity and may comprise an exterior wall. A second cavity may be formed between the exterior wall and the sidewall that forms the interior surface of the cavity. The second cavity may be configured to receive a portion of the shisha device. That is, the tray may be disposed about a portion of the shisha device such that the portion of the shisha device is received in the second cavity between the exterior wall and the sidewall that forms the interior surface of the cavity. The exterior wall may be thermally insulated from the sidewall. Thus, heat from a heating element of the shisha may be preferentially transferred through the sidewall of the tray to the cartridge rather than through the exterior wall of the tray.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The tray may comprise a cap for covering the open top end of the cavity. The cap may comprise a cap piercing element extending from a surface configured to face the cavity when the cap covers the open top end of the cavity. The piercing element of the cap may extend into the cavity and may be positioned to pierce the cartridge at a second surface when the cartridge is inserted in the cavity of the tray and force is applied to the cap to cause the cap piercing element to move towards the bottom end of the cavity.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to another embodiment, a tray for use with a shisha device comprises a body defining a cavity for receiving a cartridge containing an aerosol forming substrate.

The cartridge may comprise a body defining a cavity. Aerosol-forming substrate may be disposed in the cavity of the cartridge. The body is preferably formed from one or more heat resistant materials, such as a heat resistant metal or polymer. The body may comprise a thermally conductive material. For example, the body may comprise any of aluminum, copper, zinc, nickel, silver, any alloys thereof, and combinations thereof. Preferably, the body comprises aluminum.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The cartridge may be of any suitable shape. For example, the cartridge may have a shape configured to be received by a tray. The cartridge may have a substantially cuboidal shape, cylindrical shape, frustoconical shape, or any other suitable shape. Preferably, the cartridge has a generally cylindrical shape or a frustoconical shape.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The shisha device is configured to heat the aerosol-forming substrate in the cartridge. Preferably, the shisha device is configured to heat the aerosol-forming substrate in the cartridge while the cartridge is disposed in the tray. The shisha device may be configured to heat the aerosol-forming substrate in the cartridge by conduction. The cartridge and tray are preferably shaped and sized to allow contact with, or minimize distance from, a heating element of the shisha device. Advantageously, this provides efficient heat transfer from the heating element to the aerosol-forming substrate in the cartridge. The heat may be generated by any suitable mechanism, such as by resistive heating or by induction. To facilitate inductive heating, the cartridge may be provided with a susceptor. For example, the cartridge body may be made from or include a material (for example, aluminum) that is capable of acting as a susceptor, or a susceptor material may be provided within the cavity of the cartridge. A susceptor material may be provided within the cavity of the cartridge in any form, for example a powder, a solid block, shreds, etc. In addition, or alternatively, the tray may comprise a susceptor material.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Any suitable aerosol-forming substrate may be provided in the cavity defined by the body of the cartridge.

The heating element may define at least part of a surface of the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The shisha device includes an air inlet in fluid connection with the receptacle. In use, when the substrate inside the cartridge is heated, aerosol former components in the substrate vaporize. Air flowing from the air inlet through the cartridge becomes entrained with aerosol generated from the aerosol former components in the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Some electrically heated shisha devices employ pre-heated air and typically employ an airflow path such that the air travels in the vicinity of the heat source upon puffing. Further, some electrically heated shisha devices employ elements that increase radiation heat transfer by increasing the heated surface area.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The air inlet may be in communication with a channel that may include one or more apertures through the cartridge receptacle such that air from outside the shisha device may flow through the channel and into the cartridge receptacle through the one or more apertures. If a channel includes more than one aperture, the channel may include a manifold to direct air flowing through the channel to each aperture. Preferably, the shisha device includes two or more air inlet channels.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As described above, the cartridge includes one or more openings (such as inlets or outlets) formed in the body, allowing air to flow through the cartridge.

From the aerosol outlet, the air carrying the aerosol enters a vessel of the shisha device.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The shisha device may include any suitable vessel defining an interior volume configured to contain a liquid and defining an outlet in the headspace above a liquid fill level. The vessel may include an optically transparent or opaque housing to allow a consumer to observe contents contained in the vessel. The vessel may include a liquid fill demarcation, such as a liquid fill line. The vessel may be formed of any suitable material. For example, the vessel may include glass or suitable rigid plastic material. Preferably, the vessel is removable from a portion of the shisha assembly comprising the aerosol-generation element to allow a consumer to fill, empty or clean the vessel.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The vessel may be filled to a liquid fill level by a consumer. The liquid preferably includes water, which may optionally be infused with one or more colorants, flavorants, or colorants and flavorants. For example, the water may be infused with one or both of botanical and herbal infusions.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Aerosol entrained in air exiting the aerosol outlet of the receptacle may travel through a conduit positioned in the vessel. The conduit may be coupled to the aerosol outlet of the aerosol-generating element and may have an opening below the liquid fill level of the vessel, such that aerosol flowing through the vessel flows through the opening of the conduit, then through the liquid, into headspace of the vessel and exits through a headspace outlet, for delivery to a consumer.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The headspace outlet may be coupled to a hose comprising a mouthpiece for delivering the aerosol to a consumer. The mouthpiece may include an activation element, such as a switch activatable by a user, a puff sensor arranged to detect a user puffing on the mouthpiece, or both a switch activatable by the user and a puff sensor. The activation element is operably coupled to the control electronics of the shisha device. The activation element may be wirelessly coupled to the control electronics. Activation of the activation element may cause the control electronics to activate the heating element, rather than constantly supplying energy to the heating element. Accordingly, the use of an activation element may serve to save energy relative to devices not employing such elements to provide on-demand heating rather than constant heating.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">For purposes of example, one method for using a shisha device as described herein is provided below in chronological order. The vessel may be detached from other components of the shisha device and filled with water. One or more of natural fruit juices, botanicals, and herbal infusions may be added to the water for flavoring. The amount of liquid added should cover a portion of the conduit but should not exceed a fill level mark that may optionally exist on the vessel. The vessel is then reassembled to the shisha device.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The cartridge may be placed in the tray and the cap may be placed on the tray with application of suitable force to cause upper and lower piercing elements of the tray to form openings in the cartridge. The tray and cartridge may be placed in the receptacle of the shisha device. Alternatively, the tray may be placed in the receptacle of the shisha device, the cartridge may be placed in the tray, and the cap may be placed on the tray.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The device may then be turned on. Turning on the device may initiate a heating profile of a heating element, to heat the aerosol-forming substrate to a temperature at or above a vaporization temperature but below a combustion temperature of the aerosol-forming substrate. The aerosol forming compounds of the aerosol-forming substrate vaporize, generating an aerosol. The user may puff on the mouthpiece as desired. The user may continue using the device as long as desired or until no more aerosol is visible or being delivered. In some embodiments, the device may be arranged to automatically shut off when the cartridge or a compartment of the cartridge is depleted of usable aerosol-forming substrate. The shisha device may be turned off at any time by a consumer by, for example, switching off the device.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The shisha device may have any suitable air management. In one example, puffing action from the user will create a suction effect causing a low pressure inside the device which will cause external air to flow through an air inlet of the device, into the air inlet channel, and into the receptacle. The air may then flow through the cartridge in the receptacle and become entrained with aerosol produced from the aerosol-forming substrate. The air with entrained aerosol then exits the aerosol outlet of the receptacle, flows through the conduit to the liquid inside the vessel. The aerosol will then bubble out of the liquid and into head space in the vessel above the level of the liquid, out the headspace outlet, and through the hose and mouthpiece for delivery to the consumer. The flow of external air and the flow of the aerosol inside the shisha device may be driven by the action of puffing from the user.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">When the aerosol-forming substrate in the cartridge is depleted or the shisha experience has ended, the user may remove the tray from the receptacle, may remove the lid from the tray, and may invert the tray to empty the cartridge into a suitable waste container.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Reference will now be made to the drawings, which depict one or more embodiments described in this disclosure.
