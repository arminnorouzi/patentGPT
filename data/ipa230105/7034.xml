It also relates to a blockchain network implementing said anomaly detection method.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The field of the invention is the field of blockchain networks, in particular the field of detecting an anomaly within a blockchain network.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">STATE OF THE ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Blockchain protocols, whether open or closed, are known for the level of security they guarantee to a network, on the security as well as reactivity level of said blockchain network.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In spite of the high level of security of blockchain protocols, blockchain networks nonetheless remain favorite targets of cyberattacks.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are different techniques for improving the security within a blockchain network, thus enabling a better defense when faced with a possible cyberattack. For example, the cryptography of the private keys can be reinforced, or cold wallets can be used to store such private keys off-line.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">These solutions, provided upstream, make it possible to increase the security of each node of the blockchain network at the security protocol level implemented in the blockchain network, but does not enable an attack in progress on the blockchain network to be detected. There is currently no solution enabling detection of an attack in progress within a blockchain network.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Currently, it is particularly impossible to detect an attack exploiting limitations or constraints related to the security protocol itself. For example, it is impossible to detect an attack seeking to slow the transmission of messages within the network when the security protocol depends on good synchronization of the data within said network.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, it is also currently impossible to detect an eclipse type attack seeking to isolate one or more nodes from the rest of the blockchain network.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One aim of the present invention is to solve at least one of the above-mentioned shortcomings.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another purpose of the present invention is to propose a method of detecting attacks exploiting limitations or constraints related to the security model of a blockchain network.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another purpose of the present invention is to propose a method of detecting eclipse type attacks.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another purpose of the present invention is to propose a detection method easy to implement in a blockchain network.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention makes it possible to achieve at least one of these purposes by a method of detecting anomaly(ies) within a blockchain network comprising a plurality of nodes, said method comprising at least one iteration of the following steps:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">for at least one node, called measured node, of said network, measuring at least one operational parameter of said measured node; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">injecting said at least one measured value of at least one operational parameter into at least one predetermined heuristic model signaling a possible anomaly within said blockchain network based on said at least one measured value.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thus, the invention proposes a method making it possible to detect an anomaly occurring within a blockchain network from a measurement of a value of at least one operational parameter from at least one node of the network. Because the operation of at least one node of the blockchain network is disturbed during a cyberattack, it is possible with the method according to the invention to detect an anomaly symptomatic of a cyberattack by injecting the measured value of an operational parameter into a predetermined heuristic model in order to detect this anomaly.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Thus, the method according to the invention is capable of detecting an attack in progress exploiting limitations or constraints related to the security protocol of a network by measuring at least one of the operational parameters impacted by said attack. For example, by measuring the latency of communications of one node with at least one other node of the network, then by injecting the measured value of this latency into a heuristic model, it is possible to detect an abnormal latency and therefore to detect an attack in progress seeking to slow the transmission of messages within the blockchain network.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Furthermore, it is possible with the method according to the invention to detect an eclipse type attack, for example by measuring the communication topology of at least one node, that is, with which other nodes of the network said node is communicating. In effect, an eclipse attack against a node of the network seeks to isolate that node from the rest of the blockchain network, which involves a communication topology change of that node of the blockchain network.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an entirely non-limiting way, for at least one node, at least one measured operational parameter may for example be:</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">a communication latency of one node with at least another node of the network,</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">a communication topology of a node, that is, with which other nodes of the network the measured node communicates</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">a data from the internal clock of the node,</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">a local representation status of the node,</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">a sending quality, and</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">ownership of the &#x201c;fragments&#x201d; of the blockchain,</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Etc. . . .</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Moreover, the detection method according to the invention is easy to implement in a blockchain network because the method requires measuring one or more operational parameters and injecting said measured value into a predetermined heuristic model in order to detect an anomaly.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Advantageously, at least one measured node can be a real node of the blockchain network.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The term &#x201c;real node&#x201d; is understood as a node of the blockchain network participating in creating new blocks within the blockchain network.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The method according to the invention thus enables monitoring the operation of the blockchain network and detecting possible anomalies, by measuring at least one operational parameter directly at a real node of the blockchain network, that is, a node participating in creating and adding new blocks in the chain of blocks.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Thus, the method according to the invention may be implemented in any active blockchain network.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Alternatively or in addition, at least one measured node can be a decoy node deployed within the blockchain network.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The term &#x201c;decoy node&#x201d; is understood as a node not participating in creating and/or adding new blocks into the chain of blocks.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Such a decoy node not participating in the creation of new blocks of the blockchain may be deployed within any blockchain network in order to measure at least one of its operational parameters. Thus, the method according to the invention enables the monitoring of the operation of a blockchain network and detecting of possible anomalies without intervention on the real nodes forming the blockchain network, that is, on the nodes participating in the blockchain protocol within the blockchain network.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to one embodiment, the measurement of the operational parameter of a measured node may be carried out by said measured node, for example by an application tool deployed within said node. The measurement of the operational parameter may also be carried out by a processor or by an administration tool of said decoy node, or by an operating system of said measured node.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Alternatively, or in addition, the measurement of the at least one operational parameter of at least one measured node may be carried out by device external to said measured node. In this case, said measured node is configured to authorize an external device to carry out this measurement, and in particular to access variables within said measured node, for example variables stored within an internal log of said measured node.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the measured node is a decoy node, said measured node may be configured to record in an internal log a more precise sampling of the operational parameters, compared to a real node of the network. The measurement of at least one operational parameter of such a decoy node may thus be carried out more precisely and improve the precision or sensitivity of the anomaly detection within the blockchain network.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Alternatively or in addition, when the measured node is a decoy node, said decoy node may be configured to record in an internal log other operational parameters, different from those recorded by a real node of the blockchain network. Thus, it is possible to carry out a measurement of operational parameters that cannot be measured within the context of a real node, which enables the detection of a greater variety of anomalies, or of fewer anomalies that could be detected with real nodes.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Advantageously, the injection step may be implemented at a decoy node deployed within the blockchain network.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the measured node is not said decoy node carrying out the injection step, the method according to the invention may comprise a step of transmission from said measured node of at least one measured value to said decoy node. This transmission may be a specific transmission comprising only measured data. In this case, at least one value may be transmitted within a dedicated transaction or a specific one between the measured node and the decoy node.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Alternatively or in addition, at least one measured data may be transmitted jointly to a transaction between the measured node and the node carrying out the injection step. More particularly, the measured node may transmit at least one measured data jointly to each transaction with the node carrying out the injection step.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The implementation of the injection step at a decoy node makes it possible to have greater detection security because it is possible to implement a plurality of decoy nodes in such a way that when one of the decoy nodes is the object of an attack, another decoy node may take the relays. Moreover, the fact of implementing the injection step at a decoy makes it possible not to modify the operation of a real node.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Alternatively, the injection step may be implemented at a module, called central, the method further comprising a step of transmitting at least one measured value to said central module.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Thus, it is possible for the method according to the invention to implement the injection step at a module, which does not constitute a node of the blockchain network in the sense of a real node or a decoy node. This makes it possible to completely dissociate the nodes of the network from the central module responsible for detecting anomalies within the blockchain network.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Advantageously, and as indicated herein above, the measured value of at least one operational parameter of a measured node may be read in an operational log of said measured node.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, this value may be read by the measured node itself, whether a decoy node or a real node.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Alternatively, for a measured node, this value may be read by a central module or a decoy node, other than the measured node, in particular when the injection step is carried out by said decoy node or said central module.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, the value of at least one parameter may be either:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0049">read directly in the measured node by said decoy node or said central module,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0050">or transmitted, alone or with a portion or all of the log, to the central module or to the decoy node.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0050" num="0051">Such a transmission of the measured value or of the log may be done either automatically by the measured node or upon request from the central module or from the decoy node.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0052">Advantageously, at least one, in particular each, communication related to the implementation of the method may be encrypted.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0053">Thus, each transmission of log or of measured value of a parameter, or each request by a decoy node or central module, may be carried out in an encrypted manner.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0054">Thus, the data thus exchanged cannot be easily intercepted and/or manipulated by an entity wishing to carry out a cyberattack.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0055">Alternatively or in addition, the exchanges for the implementation of the method according to the invention may be carried out through dedicated communication channels, in order to secure said exchanges.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0056">Advantageously, at least one heuristic model may be provided in order to compare at least one injected measured value to at least one predefined threshold value.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057">Thus, it is possible to detect an anomaly by comparison of a measured value to a predefined threshold value, in a way that is simple without using complex models.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0058">Alternatively, at least one heuristic model may be, or may comprise, a neuronal network previously trained to detect at least one anomaly from at least one value of an operational parameter that is provided to it.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0059">Thus, the method according to the invention makes it possible to detect attacks for which the symptoms are more complex and depend on the value of several operational parameters. The method according to the invention makes it possible to carry out a more complete detection of anomalies, particularly of anomalies symptomatic of a cyberattack and therefore less susceptible to generating false positives.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0060">Moreover, in order to further improve the anomaly detection precision of the method according to the invention, it is possible to use a neuronal network previously trained to signal a possible anomaly based on a plurality of measured operational parameters:</p><p id="p-0060" num="0061">that are different, and/or</p><p id="p-0061" num="0062">are carried out within different nodes of the network.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0063">Advantageously, the method according to the invention may comprise a step of sending an alert message when the injection step signals an anomaly.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0064">The alert may be sent only to the node concerned by the anomaly.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0065">Alternatively, the alert may be sent to all the nodes of the blockchain network that are not concerned by the anomaly.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0066">According to another alternative, the alert may be sent to all the nodes of the blockchain network.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0067">Thus, each node receiving an alert message may implement defense procedures predefined in the blockchain protocol, such as for example stopping all communication within the network.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0068">Furthermore, when the injection step signals an anomaly, the method according to the invention may comprise an incident response step comprising execution of any combination of at least one of the following measures:</p><p id="p-0068" num="0069">excluding certain nodes that have a Byzantine behavior,</p><p id="p-0069" num="0070">suspending the protocol for the time to make a report and prevent forging corrupt blocks,</p><p id="p-0070" num="0071">updating the protocol via a consensus.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0072">These measures may be predefined in the blockchain protocol.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0073">The incident response step may be carried out at the same time or after the step of sending an alert message.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0074">According to another aspect of the invention, a computer program is proposed comprising computer instructions, which, when they are executed by a computer device, implement the method according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0075">According to another aspect of the invention, a blockchain network is proposed comprising a plurality of nodes, configured to implement the method according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0076">Advantageously, the network may comprise at least one decoy node.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0077">Such a decoy node may be used as measured node and/or may be configured to implement the injection step, as described hereinabove.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0078">Alternatively or in addition, the network may comprise a central module, provided for implementing the injection step. This makes it possible to completely dissociate the nodes of the network from the central module responsible for detecting anomalies within the blockchain network.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES AND EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0078" num="0079">Other benefits and features will become evident upon examining the detailed description of an entirely non-limiting embodiment, and from the enclosed drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0079" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic representation of an entirely non-limiting exemplary embodiment of a method according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0080" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic representation of another entirely non-limiting exemplary embodiment of a method according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0081" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic representation of an entirely non-limiting exemplary embodiment of a blockchain network according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0082" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic representation of another entirely non-limiting exemplary embodiment of a blockchain network according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0083" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic representation of another entirely non-limiting exemplary embodiment of a blockchain network according to the invention; and</p><p id="p-0084" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic representation of another non-limiting exemplary embodiment of a blockchain network according to the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0085" num="0086">It is understood that the embodiments disclosed hereunder are by no means limiting.
