The rotation of the output raceway ring <b>30</b> is output to the output shaft <b>32</b> via the coupling <b>70</b>. When the positions of the input raceway ring <b>14</b> and the first support raceway ring <b>26</b> are changed by the relative position change mechanism <b>60</b>, the change gear ratio Rs is changed.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">The features of the friction transmission device <b>100</b> will be described.

In the drawings and descriptions of another embodiment, the same or equivalent components and members as those of one embodiment will be designated by the same reference numerals. The description that overlaps that of one embodiment will be appropriately omitted, and the configuration different from that of one embodiment will be described intensively. The friction transmission device <b>100</b> of the present embodiment is different from one embodiment in that the shape of the rolling element and the shapes of the contact portions between the rolling element and the respective raceway rings are different, and the other configurations are the same. Therefore, these differences will mainly be described intensively.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a sectional view showing the periphery of the planetary rolling element <b>20</b> of the friction transmission device <b>100</b> of the embodiment. In the description of one embodiment, an example is shown in which the curved surface of the planetary rolling element <b>20</b> has the contour of the involute curve, but in the present embodiment, a contact portion with each raceway ring is an arc in the axial section of the planetary rolling element <b>20</b>. In this example, in the axial section of the planetary rolling element <b>20</b>, the curved surface of a contact portion with each of the raceway rings <b>14</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and the raceway ring <b>30</b> has the contour of an arc curve. In this case, since the contour of a raceway surface of the planetary rolling element <b>20</b> is the arc, it becomes easy to machine the rolling element and measure and manage the contour after the machining become easy, which is advantageous in terms of cost reduction and quality stabilization.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">The positions of the contact points of the rolling element will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. As shown by broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, when the positions of contact points with inner raceway rings and contact points with outer raceway rings in the planetary rolling element <b>20</b> overlap each other, there is a possibility that stress is concentrated on those positions and fatigue is accumulated, and the life of the planetary rolling element <b>20</b> is shortened. Thus, in the present embodiment, the respective contact points of the inner raceway rings and the outer raceway rings, which are disposed at overlapping positions when viewed from the radial direction, with the planetary rolling elements <b>20</b> deviate from each other in the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the input raceway ring <b>14</b> and the second support raceway ring <b>28</b> are disposed at overlapping positions when viewed from the radial direction, and the contact point <b>14</b><i>c </i>between the planetary rolling element <b>20</b> and the input raceway ring <b>14</b> and the contact point <b>28</b><i>c </i>between the planetary rolling element <b>20</b> and the second support raceway ring <b>28</b> deviate from each other in the axial direction. For example, in order to realize this configuration, a configuration may be adopted in which a contact angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b> of the rolling contact surface <b>14</b><i>h </i>(shown by a solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) of the input raceway ring <b>14</b> is different from a contact angle &#x3b8;<b>2</b> of the rolling contact surface <b>28</b><i>h </i>of the second support raceway ring <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">Additionally, the output raceway ring <b>30</b> and the first support raceway ring <b>26</b> are disposed at overlapping positions when viewed from the radial direction, and the contact point <b>30</b><i>c </i>between the planetary rolling element <b>20</b> and the output raceway ring <b>30</b> and the contact point <b>26</b><i>c </i>between the planetary rolling element <b>20</b> and the first support raceway ring <b>26</b> deviate from each other in the axial direction. For example, in order to realize this configuration, the contact angle &#x3b8;<b>3</b> of the rolling contact surface <b>26</b><i>h </i>(shown by the solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) of the first support raceway ring <b>26</b> may be different from the contact angle &#x3b8;<b>4</b> of the rolling contact surface <b>30</b><i>h </i>of the output raceway ring <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">In this way, as the raceway surfaces on the inner ring side and the outer ring side have different contact angle and the contact points of the raceway rings on the inner ring side and the contact points of the raceway rings on the outer ring side are caused to deviate from each other in the axial direction, the stress of the rolling element can be distributed to reduce the accumulation of fatigue and the life can be extended.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">The recessed portion of the rolling element will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The shape and dimensions of the rolling element have manufacturing variations. In a case where the dimensional variation of the planetary rolling element is large and the stiffness of the planetary rolling element is high, it is considered that the contact pressure of the contact portion becomes partially excessive and the life is shortened. Thus, the planetary rolling element <b>20</b> of the present embodiment has a recessed portion <b>22</b> at a central portion. The recessed portion <b>22</b> may be a bottomed hole, but the recessed portion <b>22</b> in this example is a through-hole. By having the recessed portion <b>22</b> at the central portion, the planetary rolling element <b>20</b> can be bent according to the contact load acting on the raceway surface. Thus, the influence of the dimensional variation of the rolling element can be suppressed, and the life can be extended.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b></figref>, the influence of the variation in the diameter of the rolling element on the deviation of the center position of the input shaft <b>12</b> will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing a relationship between raceway rings and rolling elements. In this figure, the raceway rings and the rolling elements are shown in two dimensions for ease of understanding. In this figure, a radially outer raceway ring is shown in a circle as an outer ring, and a radially inner raceway ring is shown in a circle as an inner ring. All rolling elements (rolling elements <b>1</b> to <b>6</b>) are in contact with the outer ring and the inner ring. The diameter of the outer ring is indicated by D<b>1</b>, and the center position of the input shaft <b>12</b> is indicated by P<b>0</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram conceptually showing the influence of an error in the diameter of the rolling element on the center position of the input shaft <b>12</b>. In this figure, a contact point between the rolling element <b>1</b> and the outer ring is indicated by P<b>1</b>, a contact point between the rolling element <b>4</b> on the opposite side of the rolling element <b>1</b> and the outer ring is indicated by P<b>4</b>, and the center position of the input shaft <b>12</b> in a case where the rolling elements <b>1</b> to <b>6</b> all have the same diameter is indicated by P<b>0</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, in a case where the diameter of the rolling element <b>1</b> is larger than that of the other rolling elements <b>2</b> to <b>6</b> by d<b>1</b>, the center position of the input shaft <b>12</b> deviates from P<b>0</b> as shown by P<b>0</b><i>d</i>. That is, the deviation amount of the center position of the input shaft <b>12</b> can be obtained through calculation by a geometric relationship shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram showing a relationship between the number of rolling elements and the deviation amount of the center position of the input shaft <b>12</b>. This figure shows the result obtained by calculating the deviation amount of the center position of the input shaft <b>12</b> from the number of rolling elements using the geometric relationship of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. In this figure, the horizontal axis represents the number of rolling elements, and the vertical axis represents a relative value obtained by dividing the deviation amount of the center position of the input shaft <b>12</b> by a predetermined unit amount. From the study of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, it was found that the deviation amount of the center position of the input shaft <b>12</b> resulting from the variation in the diameter of the rolling element in a case where the number of rolling elements is an odd number is smaller than that in a case where the number of rolling elements is an even number. On the basis of this result, since the present embodiment has a configuration in which an odd number (for example, 7) of planetary rolling elements <b>20</b> are provided, the influence of variation in the diameter of the rolling elements is reduced.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">According to the present embodiment, the same actions and effects as those of one embodiment are exhibited. In addition, the present embodiment is easy to manufacture because the contact portion of the planetary rolling element is the arc. Additionally, in the present embodiment, since the inner and outer contact points deviate from each other in the axial direction, the stress of the rolling element can be distributed. Additionally, since the present embodiment has the recessed portion at the central portion, the influence of dimensional variation of the rolling element can be suppressed. Additionally, since the present embodiment has an odd number of rolling elements, the influence of variation in the diameter of the rolling elements can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">The examples of the embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail above.
