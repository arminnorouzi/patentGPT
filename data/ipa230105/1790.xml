The first surface is a convex cylindrical surface whose axial direction is a first direction, allows light emitted from the display to enter, and allows the light reflected by the reflective member to exit. The second surface is a convex cylindrical surface whose axial direction is a second direction orthogonal to the first direction. The reflective member includes a reflective surface that reflects the light that has entered from the first surface toward the first surface. The reflective surface is a concave cylindrical surface whose axial direction is the second direction.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">With this, since (i) the first surface is a convex cylindrical surface whose axial direction is the first direction and (ii) the reflective surface is a concave cylindrical surface whose axial direction is the second direction orthogonal to the first direction, it is possible to prevent light that has entered from the first surface, has reflected by the reflective surface, and has exited from the first surface from being focused at one point. Accordingly, an increase in the temperature in a focal area can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, the display device may further include a half mirror that reflects the light emitted from the display toward the first surface, and allows the light exited from the first surface to pass through.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">With this, it is possible to increase an optical path length by causing light emitted from the display to enter from the first surface after the light is reflected by the half mirror. Accordingly, a driver, etc. can visually check an image displayed on the display at a greater distance.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, a dimension of the first surface in the first direction may be greater than a dimension of the second surface in the second direction.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">With this, it is possible to readily display a long-shaped image, while reducing an increase in the thickness of the optical element.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition, the optical element may further include (i) a first end face that connects one end of the first surface and one end of the second surface in the second direction and is orthogonal to the second direction, and (ii) a second end face that connects the other end of the first surface and the other end of the second surface in the second direction and is orthogonal to the second direction. Moreover, when viewed from the first direction, a straight line connecting the one end and the other end of the first surface may be sloped relative to the second direction.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">With this, when light emitted from the display is reflected by the first surface, it is possible to readily make (i) a direction toward which the light reflected by the first surface travels, and (ii) a direction toward which light reflected by the reflective surface and then exited from the first surface different. Accordingly, reflections due to the light reflected by the first surface can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition, the display device may further include an infrared light blocking member provided on the first surface side of the optical element.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">With this, it is possible to prevent infrared light included in the sunlight etc. from entering the optical element from the first surface. Accordingly, an increase in the temperature in a focal area can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, the infrared light blocking member may be an infrared light blocking film.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">With this, since the first surface is a convex cylindrical surface, it is possible to readily affix an infrared light blocking member to the first surface. Accordingly, infrared light included in the sunlight etc. can be readily prevented from entering the optical element from the first surface.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition, a position of a focal point at which the light exited from the first surface is focused in the first direction and a position of a focal point at which the light exited from the first surface is focused in the second direction may be mutually different in a third direction orthogonal to the first direction and the second direction.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">With this, it is possible to further prevent light exited from the first surface from being focused at one point. Accordingly, an increase in the temperature in a focal area can be further reduced.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, in the third direction, the position of the focal point at which the light exited from the first surface is focused in the first direction may be further away from the optical element than the position of the focal point at which the light exited from the first surface is focused in the second direction.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">With this, since, in the third direction (direction parallel to the optical axis of the optical element), the position of a focal point at which light exited from the first surface is focused in the first direction is further away from the optical element than the position of a focal point at which light exited from the first surface is focused in the second direction, it is possible to reduce an increase in the dimension of the second surface in the third direction. Accordingly, downsizing of the display device can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition, a radius of curvature at a center of the second surface may be greater than a radius of curvature at a center of the first surface.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">With this, it is possible to reduce an increase in the dimension of the second surface in the third direction (direction parallel to the optical axis of the optical element) which is orthogonal to the first direction and the second direction. Accordingly, a magnification factor (the power of a lens) of the first surface can be sufficiently obtained, while achieving downsizing of the display device.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It should be noted that the embodiments described below each show a specific example of the present disclosure.
