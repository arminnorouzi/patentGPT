The entire contents of the aforementioned application are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to a rubber bushing for railroad trucks used in a truck of a railroad vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">RELATED ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the truck of a railroad vehicle, conventionally, a rubber bushing has been adopted as one of the cushioning means at the connecting portion between the structural members in an axle box support device and a vehicle body support device. The axle box support device connects a wheel set (a member that connects a wheel and an axle) and a truck frame via a cushioning means, and for example, there are a monolink type axle box support device in which the truck frame and the wheel set are connected by a single link (monolink), and an axle beam type axle box support device in which the tip of an axle beam extending from an axle box and integrated with the axle box is connected to a truck frame. The vehicle body support device connects a truck frame to a vehicle body via a cushioning means, and for example, there is a towing device in which a towing frame on the vehicle body side and a truck frame are connected by a towing link in a bolsterless truck.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The truck for railroad vehicle is a traveling device that travels and supports the load of the railroad vehicle body, and is used in a state of being exposed below the railroad vehicle body. Therefore, it is conceivable that when an external fire occurs, for example, flames and heat may be directly applied to the truck from below or from a lateral side.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the truck for railroad vehicle, not only the truck frame but also the wheels, support shafts, axle boxes, brake devices, etc., particularly most of the members constituting the lower part of the truck, are made of metal. Therefore, it was considered that most of the members are not subject to the risk brought by external flames and high heat.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, as shown in Patent Literature 1 (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2015-168397), in recent years, besides a coil spring, a rubber bushing is often adopted as the cushioning means between the wheel set and the truck frame in the above-mentioned axle box support device. Also in the towing device, as shown in Patent Literature 2 (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-249042), both ends of the towing link are connected to the towing frame and the truck frame via the rubber bushing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since such a rubber bushing is generally mounted at a position relatively below the truck for railroad vehicle (below the truck frame), there are concerns that the rubber bushing may burn, smoke, or generate toxic gas when caught on flames and high heat from outside the truck.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of these problems, it was also considered to use a special rubber bushing with high flame retardancy as the rubber material, but it was difficult to achieve both the vibration-proofing and vibration-damping performance required for rubber bushing, and the basic properties such as load-bearing performance and durability performance.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It was also considered to integrally provide a flame-retardant coating layer as the rubber surface layer of the rubber bushing. However, the coating layer that is fixed or integrally formed on the rubber surface may also hinder the free deformation of the rubber surface. Moreover, since the rubber surface is repeatedly elastically deformed by input in the mounted state, there is also a problem that cracks are likely to occur in the coating layer and it is difficult to stably maintain the desired coating effect for a long period of time.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The disclosure provides a rubber bushing for railroad truck which has a new structure and is capable of improving the flame retardancy against flames, etc. applied from the outside without significantly impairing the required basic properties.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Aspects for grasping the disclosure will be described hereinafter, but each of the aspects described below is described in an illustrative manner. Not only the aspects can be adopted in combination with each other as appropriate, but also a plurality of components described in each aspect can be recognized and adopted independently where possible and can also be adopted in combination with any component described in another aspect as appropriate. Therefore, in the disclosure, various other aspects can be realized without being limited to the aspects described below.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first aspect is a rubber bushing for railroad truck used for a truck of a railroad vehicle, in which a shaft-shaped inner side member and an outer side member arranged apart from an outer peripheral side of the inner side member are connected by a rubber elastic body, and at an axial end of the rubber elastic body, a cover part that covers from outside an exposed end surface where the rubber elastic body is exposed to the outside between respective axial ends of the inner side member and the outer side member is provided as a separate member from the rubber elastic body.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the rubber bushing for railroad truck (may be simply referred to as rubber bushing hereinafter) of the present aspect, the exposed end surface of the rubber elastic body is covered by the cover part that is composed of a separate member from the rubber elastic body. Therefore, even if flames are spread from the outside to the truck for railroad vehicle (may be simply referred to as truck hereinafter) mounted with the rubber bushing, direct exposure of the exposed surface of the rubber elastic body to the flames can be reduced or prevented. Moreover, since the cover part is provided as a separate member, the degree of freedom in selecting the material of the rubber elastic body is not limited, and it is also possible to prevent the properties of the rubber elastic body itself from being significantly impaired by the cover part.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the second aspect, in the rubber bushing for railroad truck according to the first aspect, a flange-shaped rubber part having a large diameter is provided at the axial end of the rubber elastic body and the flange-shaped rubber part is sandwiched in an axial direction between the respective axial ends of the inner side member and the outer side member, and an outer peripheral surface of the flange-shaped rubber part is taken as the exposed end surface and is covered by the cover part.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The rubber bushing for railroad truck of the present aspect can be suitably adopted as, for example, a rubber bushing mounted on a portion of the tip of the axle beam attached to the truck frame side in the axle beam type axle box support device. Particularly, while it is possible to obtain a large spring constant and large load-bearing performance in the axial direction in the rubber bushing provided with the flange-shaped rubber part as described in the present aspect, the flange-shaped rubber part is exposed toward the outer peripheral surface of the rubber bushing. Therefore, the flame retardancy against flames from below the truck tends to become a problem. For such a problem, in the present aspect, the exposed surface of the flange-shaped rubber part directed toward the outer peripheral surface is covered, which makes it possible to reduce the risk of external flames while securing the basic spring properties.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the third aspect, in the rubber bushing for railroad truck according to the first aspect, the axial end of the rubber elastic body has an axial exposed surface exposed outward in an axial direction between the respective axial ends of the inner side member and the outer side member, and the axial exposed surface is taken as the exposed end surface and is covered by the cover part.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The rubber bushing for railroad truck of the present aspect can be suitably adopted as, for example, a rubber bushing mounted on a portion of the monolink attached to the truck frame side or the wheel set side in the monolink type axle box support device. Particularly, while it is possible to set a large spring ratio between the axial perpendicular direction and the axial direction in the rubber bushing as described in the present aspect, the axial end of the rubber bushing is exposed outward in the axial direction with a relatively large area. Therefore, the flame retardancy against flames from the lateral side of the truck tends to become a problem. For such a problem, in the present aspect, the exposed surface of the rubber elastic body directed outward in the axial direction is covered, which makes it possible to reduce the risk of external flames while securing the basic spring properties.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the fourth aspect, in the rubber bushing for railroad truck according to any one of the first to third aspects, a gap is provided between the exposed end surface of the rubber elastic body and the cover part.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the rubber bushing for railroad truck of the present aspect, the gap provided between the exposed end surface of the rubber elastic body and the cover part can reduce or prevent the deformation constraint of the cover part on the free surface of the rubber elastic body. In addition, the air layer in the gap makes it possible to suppress heat transfer from the cover part to the rubber elastic body. In addition, it is also possible to reduce or prevent wear and damage due to contact between the exposed end surface which is elastically deformed and the cover part. It is not necessary to provide a gap over the entire area between the exposed end surface of the rubber elastic body and the cover part.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the fifth aspect, in the rubber bushing for railroad truck according to any one of the first to fourth aspects, the cover part is in contact with the exposed end surface of the rubber elastic body in at least a part.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the rubber bushing for railroad truck of the present aspect, the exposed end surface of the rubber elastic body and the cover part are in contact with each other, which makes it easy to maintain the exposed end surface covered with the cover part. Further, by bringing the cover part into contact with the rubber elastic body, it is easy to position the cover part in the mounted state. In addition, by bringing the cover part into close contact with the exposed end surface, the supply of air is blocked at least at the contact portion, which makes it easy to suppress combustion of the rubber elastic body.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the sixth aspect, in the rubber bushing for railroad truck according to any one of the first to fifth aspects, at least a part of the cover part is made of an elastomer.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the rubber bushing for railroad truck of the present aspect, based on the deformable properties of the elastomer, for example, even if the cover part comes into contact with the exposed end surface, the deformation constraining force on the rubber elastic body can be reduced to satisfactorily secure the properties of the rubber elastic body. Further, as in the seventh aspect described later, for example, it is possible to easily keep the cover part in the mounted state and position the cover part by utilizing the elastic properties of the elastomer. Moreover, because of the deformable properties of the elastomer, it is possible to reduce or prevent damage to the members, for example, when the cover part comes into contact with the exposed end surface.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the seventh aspect, in the rubber bushing for railroad truck according to the sixth aspect, the cover part is positioned at a position to cover the exposed end surface of the rubber elastic body from outside by utilizing elasticity of the elastomer.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the rubber bushing for railroad truck of the present aspect, it is possible to simplify the mounting structure of the cover part and improve the stability of the mounted state by skillfully utilizing the properties of the elastomer that constitutes the cover part.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the eighth aspect, in the rubber bushing for railroad truck according to any one of the first to seventh aspects, in a state of being mounted on the truck of the railroad vehicle, the exposed end surface of the rubber elastic body is covered by the cover part in a state where the exposed end surface is not directly visible from outside from any direction.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the rubber bushing for railroad truck of the present aspect, it is possible to impart to the rubber elastic body effective resistance against flames or heat spread not only from a specific direction but also from various directions. Therefore, it is possible to secure flame retardancy in unexpected situations, and it is possible to easily respond while maintaining the flame retardancy even when the mounted state, orientation, position, etc. are changed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the disclosure, a rubber bushing for railroad truck can be realized, which has a new structure and is capable of improving the flame retardancy against flames, etc. applied from the outside without significantly impairing the basic properties required for input vibration and load.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front view showing the rubber bushing for axle box support device as the first embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a left side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along the line III-III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along the line IV-IV of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along the line V-V of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">(a) and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> are single-item views showing the axial external views of the cover ring constituting the rubber bushing for axle box support device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and (b) is a cross-sectional view taken along the line VI-VI of (a).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an explanatory view showing a state in which the rubber bushing for axle box support device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is mounted on the truck for railroad vehicle.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a front view showing the rubber bushing for axle box support device as the second embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a left side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along the line X-X of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">(a) and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> are single-item views showing the axial internal views of the covering cover constituting the rubber bushing for axle box support device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, and (b) is a cross-sectional view taken along the line XI-XI of (a).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is an explanatory view showing a state in which the rubber bushing for axle box support device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is mounted on the truck for railroad vehicle.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Hereinafter, embodiments schematically showing aspects of the implementation level to which the disclosure is applied will be described with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> show a rubber bushing <b>10</b> for axle beam to be mounted on a portion of the axle beam attached to a truck for railroad vehicle, as the first embodiment of a rubber bushing for axle box support device which is a rubber bushing for railroad truck having a structure according to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The rubber bushing <b>10</b> for axle beam of the present embodiment has a substantially cylindrical bushing structure as a whole, and includes an inner member <b>12</b> as the inner side member and an outer member <b>14</b> as the outer side member arranged apart from the outer periphery of the inner member <b>12</b>, and further the inner member <b>12</b> and the outer member <b>14</b> are elastically connected by a rubber elastic body <b>16</b>. In the following description, an axial direction refers to a central axial direction of the rubber bushing <b>10</b> and the inner member <b>12</b>, and an axial perpendicular direction refers to a direction orthogonal to the central axis of the rubber bushing <b>10</b> and the inner member <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">More specifically, the inner member <b>12</b> is a highly rigid member made of metal such as iron or an aluminum alloy, and has a hollow or solid rod shape that extends linearly. In the present embodiment, the inner member <b>12</b> has a hollow substantially cylindrical shape provided with a center hole <b>18</b> that penetrates in the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The central portion of the inner member <b>12</b> in the axial direction is a central rod part <b>20</b> that extends in a constant cylindrical shape. A pair of inner flange-shaped parts <b>22</b> protruding in a flange shape toward the outer periphery are integrally formed at both axial ends of the central rod part <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The axial outer surface of the inner flange-shaped part <b>22</b> is a flat surface that expands in the axial perpendicular direction while the axial inner surface is an inclined surface that rises smoothly so that the inclination angle gradually increases from the outer peripheral surface of the cylinder of the central rod part <b>20</b> outward in the axial direction. As a result, in the inner peripheral portion of the inner flange-shaped part <b>22</b>, the axial thickness dimension gradually changes to be smaller toward the outer periphery.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, both end portions of the inner member <b>12</b> in the axial direction are inner shaft ends <b>24</b> having a substantially polygonal outer peripheral surface shape and protruding outward in the axial direction. Through holes <b>26</b> for attaching are formed in the inner shaft ends <b>24</b> to penetrate in the axial perpendicular direction.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In contrast, the above-mentioned outer member <b>14</b> is composed of a pair of outer split bodies <b>28</b>. Each outer split body <b>28</b> has a central plate-shaped part <b>30</b> that has an arcuate curved plate shape extending in the circumferential direction with a length less than half a circumference (about &#xbc; circumference in the present embodiment). Further, outer flange-shaped parts <b>32</b> whose diameter expands outward in the axial direction as if the outer flange-shaped parts <b>32</b> are bent toward the outer peripheral side are integrally formed at both axial ends of the central plate-shaped part <b>30</b>. The outer split body <b>28</b> constituting the outer member <b>14</b> of the present embodiment can be manufactured by, for example, pressing a metal plate.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Then, the pair of outer split bodies <b>28</b> are arranged to be separated from each other on the outer peripheral side of the central rod part <b>20</b> of the inner member <b>12</b>, sandwich the inner member <b>12</b> in one axial perpendicular direction, and face each other. Under such an arrangement state, the central rod part <b>20</b> of the inner member <b>12</b> and the central plate-shaped parts <b>30</b> of the outer split bodies <b>28</b> face each other in the axial perpendicular direction with a substantially constant distance between the facing surfaces, the inner flange-shaped parts <b>22</b> of the inner member <b>12</b> and the outer flange-shaped parts <b>32</b> of the outer split bodies <b>28</b> face each other in an axial inclination direction with a substantially constant distance between the facing surfaces. However, the shapes and dimensions of the inner member <b>12</b>, the outer split bodies <b>28</b>, and the rubber elastic body <b>16</b> are appropriately set according to the required properties and are not limited. For example, the thickness of a flange-shaped rubber part <b>36</b>, which will be described later, may be tapered between the facing surfaces of the inner flange-shaped part <b>22</b> and the outer flange-shaped part <b>32</b>, the inclination angle of the flange-shaped rubber part <b>36</b> may be changed and set, the circumferential length of the outer split body <b>28</b> may be changed and set, and the axial length of the outer split body <b>28</b> and the rubber elastic body <b>16</b> may be changed and set, making it possible to appropriately meet the required properties.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Furthermore, the above-mentioned rubber elastic body <b>16</b> has a substantially cylindrical shape with a thick wall as a whole.

The central tubular part <b>34</b> and the pair of flange-shaped rubber parts <b>36</b> are continuous with a substantially constant thickness dimension. As described above, the thickness dimension and the inclination angle of the flange-shaped rubber part <b>36</b> can be appropriately changed in design and the central tubular part <b>34</b> and the flange-shaped rubber parts <b>36</b> can be separate members, and for example, the central tubular part <b>34</b> and the flange-shaped rubber parts <b>36</b> can be set to have different materials. In the inner member <b>12</b> and the outer member <b>14</b>, the inner flange-shaped part <b>22</b> and the outer flange-shaped part <b>32</b> can be assembled as separate members.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Then, the central tubular part <b>34</b> is arranged on the outer peripheral surface of the central rod part <b>20</b> of the inner member <b>12</b>, and the flange-shaped rubber parts <b>36</b> are arranged on the axial inner surfaces of the inner flange-shaped parts <b>22</b> of the inner member <b>12</b>.

The inner member <b>12</b> that covers the inner peripheral surface of the rubber elastic body <b>16</b> does not need to be continuous on the entire surface. For example, as described above, when the central tubular part <b>34</b> and the flange-shaped rubber parts <b>36</b> of the rubber elastic body <b>16</b> are separate members, the surfaces to be fixed to the inner member <b>12</b> may be separated. For example, when a hollow portion (such as a recess part) is partially provided in the rubber elastic body for the purpose of adjusting the spring properties, an inner peripheral surface not covered by the inner member <b>12</b> may be present on the rubber elastic body <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition, the pair of outer split bodies <b>28</b> are overlapped on the outer peripheral surface of the rubber elastic body <b>16</b> at portions facing each other in one radial direction (vertical direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>).

As a result, the area of the free surface is secured in the flange-shaped rubber part <b>36</b> in which the deformation of the surface is constrained by the inner flange-shaped part <b>22</b> and the outer flange-shaped part <b>32</b>, and the tensile stress on the outer peripheral exposed surface <b>44</b> when an external force is applied is reduced, and the durability performance and the load-bearing performance are improved accordingly.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As described above, the rubber bushing <b>10</b> for axle beam of the present embodiment has a bushing body <b>46</b> configured by elastically connecting the inner member <b>12</b> and the outer member <b>14</b> by the rubber elastic body <b>16</b>.

The shape of the outer peripheral side of the cover ring <b>48</b> is not particularly limited, but is, for example, a simple cylindrical shape as shown in the figure. The shape of the inner peripheral side of the cover ring <b>48</b> has a substantially arcuate cross-sectional shape that is convex toward the inner peripheral side, substantially corresponding to the shape of the outer peripheral exposed surface <b>44</b> formed on the bushing body <b>46</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the present embodiment, the cross-sectional shape of the cover ring <b>48</b> is also substantially constant over the entire circumference corresponding to that the outer peripheral exposed surface <b>44</b> of the bushing body <b>46</b> has a substantially constant cross-sectional shape over the entire circumference.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Moreover, the cover ring <b>48</b> is made of a flame-retardant rubber elastic body or an elastic material (elastomer) such as silicone.

Further, the cover ring <b>48</b> is a separate member from the bushing body <b>46</b> and the material thereof does not directly affect the basic properties of the rubber elastic body <b>16</b>, and it is unlikely for the cover ring <b>48</b> to be deformed as much as the rubber elastic body <b>16</b> due to the input load. Therefore, by adopting chlorosulphonized polyethylene (CSM) and ethylene propylene diene rubber (EPDM) with flame-retardant formulation, for example, the flame retardancy required for the material of the cover ring <b>48</b> can be achieved. Besides, by providing a flame-retardant coating layer on the surface of the cover ring <b>48</b>, for example, the required flame retardancy can also be achieved.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The elastic cover ring <b>48</b> is assembled to the outer peripheral exposed surface <b>44</b> of the bushing body <b>46</b> in a state where the cover ring <b>48</b> is expanded in diameter and deformed by elasticity, so that the inner peripheral portion of the cover ring <b>48</b> is fitted into the groove shape of the outer peripheral exposed surface <b>44</b>, and the cover ring <b>48</b> can be assembled in a state of being prevented from coming out in the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Particularly, in the present embodiment, a center point <b>50</b> of the cover ring <b>48</b> in the radial direction is located on the inner peripheral side with respect to the outer diameters of the inner flange-shaped part <b>22</b> and the outer flange-shaped part <b>32</b> constituting both axial side walls of the groove-shaped outer peripheral exposed surface <b>44</b>, and the cover ring <b>48</b> is deeply fitted into the groove-shaped part of the outer peripheral exposed surface <b>44</b>.

Therefore, the contact of the covering cover <b>94</b> with the rubber elastic body <b>76</b> or the outer member <b>74</b> has almost no adverse effect on the dynamic properties of the rubber bushing <b>70</b> for monolink.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Particularly, the covering cover <b>94</b> of the present embodiment has a substantially L-shaped cross-sectional shape, and is assembled in a state of facing the axial exposed surface <b>92</b> of the rubber elastic body <b>76</b>, which is formed with a concave groove-shaped cross-sectional shape that opens outward in the axial direction, with a sufficient gap <b>103</b> in the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The rubber bushing <b>70</b> for monolink of the present embodiment which has the above-mentioned structure is used for a monolink type axle box support device for connecting a wheel set to a truck frame in a truck for railroad vehicle.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Generally, as illustrated as a model in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the monolink type axle box support device <b>104</b> includes the axle box <b>108</b> that is movably cushioned and supported in the vertical direction of the vehicle by a coil spring with respect to the truck frame <b>106</b> for rotatably supporting the axle of the wheel set, and the axle box <b>108</b> and the truck frame <b>106</b> are connected by a monolink <b>110</b> that extends in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. Then, the rubber bushing <b>70</b> for monolink is mounted on each attached portion of the axle box <b>108</b> and the truck frame <b>106</b> at both axial ends of the monolink <b>110</b>, and both axial ends of the monolink <b>110</b> are connected to the axle box <b>108</b> and the truck frame <b>106</b> in a cushioned manner.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">More specifically, an arm eye (mounting hole) penetrating in the lateral direction of the vehicle is formed at the axial end of the monolink <b>110</b>, and the outer member <b>74</b> of the rubber bushing <b>70</b> for monolink is press-fitted and fixed to the arm eye. In contrast, the inner member <b>72</b> of the rubber bushing <b>70</b> for monolink is fixed and attached to the axle box <b>108</b> or the truck frame <b>106</b> by a fixture <b>112</b> such as a bolt inserted into the through holes <b>84</b> formed in the inner shaft ends <b>82</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Under such a mounted state, the rubber bushing <b>70</b> for monolink is positioned below the truck frame <b>106</b>, and the axial exposed surfaces <b>92</b> of the rubber elastic body <b>76</b> that are not covered by the inner member <b>72</b> and the outer member <b>74</b> are not covered and are exposed to the outside in the lateral direction of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Here, in the rubber bushing <b>70</b> for monolink of the present embodiment, the axial exposed surfaces <b>92</b> are covered with the covering covers <b>94</b> on both side portions of the bushing body <b>93</b> in the axial direction. Therefore, similar to the rubber bushing for axle beam of the first embodiment, for example, even if flames due to an external fire are spread to the rubber bushing <b>70</b> for monolink, it is possible to prevent the rubber elastic body <b>76</b> from being directly exposed to the flames. In addition, the same technical effects as the first embodiment can be effectively exhibited.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Although the embodiments of the disclosure have been described above with reference to specific examples, the disclosure should not be interpreted as being limited to the above specific description. For example, it is also possible to form a portion of the cover part that may be particularly exposed to high temperature with metal which has higher heat resistance than elastomer. Specifically, in the rubber bushing <b>70</b> for monolink of the second embodiment, it is also possible to form one of the annular plate part <b>96</b> and the cylindrical part <b>98</b> with metal, or to form the annular plate part <b>96</b> and the cylindrical part <b>98</b> partially with metal.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Furthermore, in the rubber bushing <b>10</b> for axle beam of the first embodiment, the inner peripheral portion of the cover ring <b>48</b> fitted into the groove-shaped outer peripheral exposed surface <b>44</b> can be partially formed in the circumferential direction to an extent that can position the cover ring <b>48</b> with respect to the bushing body <b>46</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In addition, the shape, material, etc. of the cover part adopted in the disclosure can be appropriately changed as required as long as the cover part achieves the heat resistance and flame resistance required for the rubber bushing for axle box support device in a railroad vehicle truck.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">For example, in the bushing bodies <b>46</b> and <b>93</b>, the cover part does not necessarily cover the entire surface of the exposed end surface exposed to the outside in the state where the bushing bodies <b>46</b> and <b>93</b> are mounted on the truck for railroad vehicle, and it is also possible to specify and set a surface of the exposed end surface to be covered with the cover part in consideration of the expected direction of the flames. Further, the entire cover part can be made of a hard material if the cover part has no interference or contact with other members under the expected vibration input conditions or if the cover part causes no problem. Moreover, in the second embodiment, the cover part is supported by the inner side member, but the cover part can also be supported by the outer side member, or be supported by the axle beam or the monolink, and it is not necessary to support the cover part with other members as long as the cover part can be held in the mounted state.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Furthermore, although the above embodiments illustrate examples of applying the disclosure to a rubber bushing for railroad truck to be used in a monolink type axle box support device and an axle beam type axle box support device, the application of the disclosure is not limited thereto. For example, the disclosure is also applicable to a rubber bushing used for a towing device of a bolsterless truck, a rubber bushing mounted on a portion connected to the bolster of a bolster anchor or the truck frame in a truck with a bolster, or rubber bushings used in various types of axle box support devices.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In addition, although not listed one by one, the disclosure can be implemented in aspects with various changes, modifications, improvements, etc. added based on the knowledge of those skilled in the art, and needless to say, all such aspects are included in the scope of the disclosure as long as these aspects do not deviate from the gist of the disclosure.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
