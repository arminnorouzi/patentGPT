Within recent history many advances have been made with regard to the fabrication of textile products such as with regard to the automated fabrication of textiles. In addition, new types of textile materials such as synthetic materials, synthetic/natural blends and new automated weaving technologies have been developed. The apparel manufacturing, retailing and fitting industries include a diverse range of parties, such as designers, fabric manufacturers, apparel cutting and sewing workers, retailers, tailors, etc. The apparel manufacturing industry relies upon various resources, processes, and equipment to produce finished garments, accessories, footwear, etc. Generally, a process to manufacture a garment includes garment design, fabric production and/or printing, and panel cutting and sewing. Many aspects of apparel manufacturing processes are relatively time consuming and require the coordination of many different geographically dislocated suppliers, vendors, manufacturers and retailers.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In spite of advances in manufacturing technology in the textile and garment industry, the vast majority of the work of fabricating garments has involved large amounts of tedious human labor. Although garments are cut and sewn with the assistance of machines, the process is nevertheless labor-intensive and includes the manual movement of patterns, sewn garments, and operation of sewing machines and other kinds of equipment. For this reason, much of the fabrication of garments has been limited to regions with access to inexpensive labor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Part of the reason for this lack of automation and labor intensiveness results from the unique attributes of textiles and garments in general. Garments and textile products in general have unique properties that make them difficult to fabric in an automated fashion. For example, fabrics by nature have a soft, flexible, amorphous, and often stretchy nature that makes them difficult to manipulate in a predictable, reliable manner in an automated system.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there remains a need for improved automation in the garment industry which can allow garments and other textile products to be efficiently, reliably manufactured without the need for labor intensive human interaction.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The disclosed embodiments provide a system for fabricating non-rigid items. The system includes a robotic carrier configured to carry workpiece items between multiple workstations, at least one of the workstations comprising a weigh station. A loading mechanism is provided for loading one or more workpiece items onto the robotic carrier. The weigh station includes a scale configured to weigh the robotic carrier and one or more workpiece items loaded onto the robotic carrier, the scale having a scale base and a plurality of weight sensors connected with the scale base. The weigh station also includes memory for storing an expected weight range of an individual workpiece. In addition, the weigh station includes circuitry that is configured to receive a signal from the plurality of weight sensors and to determine a weight of the one or more workpieces loaded onto the robotic carrier based on the weight of the one or more workpieces and the expected weight range of the individual workpiece.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The circuitry can be functional to transmit data regarding the discrete number of workpieces to a central control unit, the central control unit being functional to control movement of the robotic carrier and to control manufacturing operations at the multiple workstations.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the weight sensors can be load cells. Alternatively, the weight sensors can be piezoelectric sensors. The circuitry can be functional to transmit the discrete number of workpieces to a user interface.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment the expected weight range of an individual workpiece can be based on a standard deviation of a sample set of similar workpieces. With the manufacture of workpiece items such as apparels the deviation between various garments can be large. This can be, for example, as a result of the large number of various materials that can be used to manufacture or assemble a workpiece item such as a garment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the robotic carrier can include a camera and can move from one station to another by using the camera to follow a visible line and by detecting a series of visible checkpoints such as QR codes.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present embodiment can provide a method for determining a discrete number of non-rigid workpiece items. The method includes loading one or more workpiece items onto a robotic carrier and moving the carrier onto a weigh station. The weight of the one or more workpieces can then be determined and this weight can be compared with a weight range of a single workpiece item to determine the number of workpiece items loaded onto the robotic carrier.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The items can be loaded onto the robotic carrier before the robotic carrier has been moved onto the weigh station, or, alternatively, the items can be moved onto the robotic carrier after the robotic carrier has been moved onto the workstation. The robotic carrier and the one or more workpiece items can be weighed together and the weight of the robotic carrier subtracted from the total weight. Alternatively, the robotic carrier can be moved onto the weigh station, the weight set to zero and then the workpieces loaded onto the robotic carrier.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The information regarding the number of loaded workpieces can be sent to a central control unit. In one embodiment, the information regarding the number of loaded workpieces can be transmitted wirelessly to the central control unit. The central control unit can be functional to control manufacturing operations at multiple workstations and can be functional to control movement of the robotic carrier across the multiple workstations.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Some embodiments can also provide a method for correcting for error in movement of a robotic carrier. The method can include moving a robotic carrier onto a weigh station, the weigh station being functional to detect a center of gravity of the robotic carrier on the weigh station. The center of gravity of the robotic carrier can be compared with a predetermined intended center of gravity to determine a variation in the location of the robotic carrier, and then instructions can be provided to correct the travel of the robotic carrier if the center of gravity is different from the predetermined center of gravity.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The instruction to correct the path of travel of the robotic carrier can include one or more of speed of the robotic carrier and direction of travel of the robotic carrier. The weigh station can include a scale having at least three evenly spaced weight sensors and may include a scale having four weight sensors located at opposite corners of the scale.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another disclosed embodiment can provide a system for manufacturing articles. The system can include at least one weight sensor functional to generate a signal indicative of a weight of one or more items of manufacture. The system can also include an amplifier configured to receive the signal from the weight sensor, wherein the amplifier can be configured to generate an amplified analog signal. The system can also include an analog to digital converter configured to convert the amplified analog signal to a digital signal. The system can also include a microcontroller configured to receive the digital signals and to determine a discrete number of items of manufacture based on the digital signal, and a control unit configured to control one or more manufacturing operations based on the discrete number of items of manufacture.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment, the control unit can control movement of a robotic carrier. The robotic carrier can be configured to transport the one or more items of manufacture. In one embodiment, the microcontroller can be configured to send information regarding the discrete number of items of manufacture wirelessly to the control unit. In another embodiment, the microcontroller is configured to send information regarding the discrete number of items of manufacture to a transmitter, wherein the transmitter can be configured to transmit information regarding the discrete number of items of manufacture to the control unit. In another embodiment, the microcontroller can be wired to the control unit in order to deliver information regarding the discrete number of items of manufacture to the control units. In another embodiment, the microcontroller can be functional to determine a location of a robotic carrier along an intended travel path, and in another embodiment, the control unit can be functional to correct a path of travel of the robotic carrier based on the location of the robotic carrier as determined by the microcontroller.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">These and other features and advantages will be apparent to one of skill in the art upon reading of the following detailed description of the embodiments in conjunction with the figures.

The system <b>100</b> can be specifically configured to process or manufacture items having an amorphous or non-rigid nature such as garments or textile products. The system <b>100</b> includes a plurality of workstations <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>in which various manufacturing processes can be performed on one or more workpieces. Workpieces <b>104</b> can be carried from one workstation to another <b>102</b> by a robotic carrier <b>106</b>, which will be described in greater detail herein below. The robotic carrier can optionally be controlled by a central control station <b>108</b> that can wirelessly direct the path of the robotic carrier <b>104</b> using various control circuitry within or without the control station <b>108</b>. The central control station can also directly or indirectly control or affect manufacturing operations at the various workstations <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The robotic carrier <b>106</b> moves from one station to the next carrying one or more workpieces either on top of the robotic carrier <b>106</b> or in some other manner. In one embodiment, the robotic carrier can be configured to track a visible line <b>110</b> painted or otherwise formed on a workshop floor to thereby follow a desired predetermined path along the workshop floor. Progress along the line <b>110</b> can be monitored by checkpoint locations <b>112</b>. These checkpoint locations can be, for example, QR codes which can be read by the robotic carrier <b>106</b>. The robotic carrier can have a camera <b>114</b> mounted one or within it near its bottom surface. The camera <b>114</b> can allow the robotic carrier <b>106</b> to both follow the visible line <b>110</b> and read the various checkpoints <b>112</b> (such as QR codes) to facilitate its movement long the desired path and to stop at various workstations <b>102</b> as desired. The camera <b>114</b> may be connected with, coupled to or in communication with various circuitry (not shown) configured to facilitate following the visual line <b>110</b> and to read the various QR codes <b>112</b> and also, optionally, to communicate this information wirelessly with the central controller <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a side view of a portion of an automated system such as the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, illustrating a system <b>200</b> for determining a quantity of soft, flexible non-rigid workpiece items can be determined during a manufacturing process. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a first workpiece loading station <b>202</b> is configured to store a plurality (e.g. stack) of workpiece items <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A loading mechanism <b>206</b> is configured to select a desired number of workpiece items <b>204</b><i>a </i>from the workpiece loading station <b>202</b> and load them onto the robotic carrier <b>106</b>. The loading mechanism <b>206</b> can be, for example, an automated arm capable of grasping a single workpiece item, or another desired quantity of workpiece items <b>204</b><i>a</i>. However, this is by way of example as the loading mechanism could be some other type of device.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">With most automated manufacturing systems wherein items manufactured include solid, rigid workpieces, the selection of a single workpiece or a select number of workpieces is a relatively straightforward process and can be accurately carried out at the point of selection of the workpiece (i.e. at the loading station <b>202</b>). However, the manufacture of flexible, amorphous items such as garments or textile products presents unique challenges. While the loading mechanism can be configured as best as possible to select only a single workpiece item or a predetermined number of workpiece items <b>204</b><i>a</i>, there is a chance that the loading mechanism can inadvertently pick up unwanted additional workpiece items <b>204</b> or less than the desired number of items <b>204</b>. In addition, items such as garments can have a large variance in weight for a single garment item. Whereas items such as bolts, nuts or mechanical parts can have nearly identical and predictable weights from one single item to another, garments can be constructed of various pieces such as fabric pieces, accessories, zippers, buttons each of which can have a weight variation. This makes the determination of a discrete number of garment items based on weight more challenging. This can be overcome by determining an acceptable weight range for a single item. In some embodiments this weight range for garment items can be wider than would be necessary with other types of items.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In order to accurately ensure that the correct number of workpiece items <b>204</b><i>a </i>have been loaded onto the robotic carrier <b>106</b>, the system <b>200</b> incorporates a highly accurate weigh station <b>208</b>. This weigh station <b>208</b> can be included as one of the workstations <b>102</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The weigh station <b>208</b> can include a scale <b>210</b>, which will be described in greater detail herein below. Like other of the workstations <b>102</b>, the scale <b>210</b> can have a marker such as a QR code <b>212</b> located at a desired location on its surface. The marker or QR code <b>212</b> can be read by the camera <b>114</b> in the robotic carrier <b>106</b> to indicate a location at which the robotic carrier <b>106</b> should stop on the scale <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The weigh station <b>208</b> can also include circuitry <b>214</b> that can be connected with the scale. The circuitry <b>214</b> can be functional to determine the weight of the workpiece item or items <b>204</b><i>a </i>located on the robotic carrier <b>206</b>. This information about the weight of the item or items on the robotic carrier <b>106</b> can be used to calculate the number of such items located on the robotic carrier <b>106</b>. Optionally, the circuitry <b>214</b> can be configured to transmit this information to the control center <b>108</b>, either wired or wirelessly. In addition, information about the weight and quantity of items <b>204</b><i>a </i>on the carrier <b>106</b> can be sent to a user interface <b>216</b>, such as a computer monitor, a printer or a personal electronic device such as a cell phone, a personal computer, a laptop, a notebook, etc.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a top-down enlarged schematic view of a weigh station <b>208</b> according to an embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a side, cross-sectional view of the weigh station <b>208</b> as seen from line <b>3</b>B-<b>3</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. As mentioned above, the weigh station <b>208</b> can include a scale <b>210</b>. The scale <b>210</b> can include a scale base <b>302</b> and a plurality of weight sensors <b>304</b>. The scale base <b>302</b> can have a square or rectangular base, however, other shapes are possible as well, such as round or triangular. The weight sensors <b>304</b> are preferably located near outer corners of the scale base <b>302</b>, and if the scale base <b>302</b> has a rectangular or square shape, the scale <b>210</b> preferably has four such weight sensors <b>304</b> located at or near the four outer corners of the scale base <b>302</b>.

This can more easily facilitate the travel of the robotic carrier <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>) onto the scale <b>210</b>. Signals from each of the weight sensors <b>304</b> can be sent to circuitry <b>214</b> such as previously described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The circuitry <b>214</b> can be functional to determine the weight of the workpiece item loaded on the robotic carrier <b>106</b> and functional to calculate the location of the robotic carrier <b>106</b> on the scale <b>210</b> (as will be discussed in greater detail herein below). In other embodiments the scale <b>210</b> can be suspended, such as from a ceiling or other structure, rather than being formed into a recess in a workshop floor as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In order to determine the weight of the individual work piece item or items <b>204</b><i>a</i>, the weight of the unloaded robotic carrier <b>106</b> can first be determined (e.g. weighed). This can then be compared with the weight of the loaded robotic carrier <b>106</b> to determine the weight of the loaded workpiece items <b>204</b><i>a</i>. Alternatively, the circuitry <b>214</b> can be configured to zero out the weight measurement after the robotic carrier has moved onto the scale <b>210</b> and before loading the workpiece item <b>204</b><i>a </i>has been loaded onto the scale <b>210</b>. Then, when the workpiece item <b>204</b><i>a </i>has been loaded, the weight of only the workpiece will be measured. In yet another embodiment, the weight of robotic carrier <b>106</b> can be previously known and recorded, and this weight can be subtracted from the total weight by the circuitry <b>214</b> to arrive at the weight of the workpiece (or workpieces) <b>204</b><i>a </i>alone.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition to determining the weight of the loaded workpiece or workpieces <b>204</b><i>a</i>, the circuitry <b>214</b> is also functional to use this weight calculation to determine the exact number of workpiece items <b>204</b><i>a </i>loaded on the robotic carrier <b>106</b>. Of course, this would also include a determination that no workplace items have been placed on the robotic carrier, in the situation where the loader <b>206</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) failed to successfully load the desired number of workpieces onto the robotic carrier <b>106</b>. In order to determine the exact number of loaded workpiece items <b>204</b><i>a</i>, the anticipated weight of a workpiece item can be stored in memory within or separately from the circuitry <b>214</b>. This weight value can preferably be changed based on the workpiece item being loaded, as the system can be adaptable to accommodate different workpiece items. This weight value is preferably a weight value range and can be determined based on a standard deviation of a sample set of similar workpiece items. Alternatively, the stored workpiece weight range can be determined by some other statistical methodology.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As previously discussed, a garment workpiece could be made of different materials. In some embodiments, two different workpieces would not be alike and would have significantly different weight, since they can be made of different materials. Because of this, the standard deviation of the weight of a garment workpiece would be large compared with other types of items such as nuts, bolts and other mechanical pieces which would have a much more consistent weight between items.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The determination of the number of garments can be performed with an assumption that each garment has a normal weight distribution, resulting in a gaussian mixture problem when multiple garments are picked up. By calculating the threshold to this gaussian mixture problem, the number of loaded garments can be determined. This can be more clearly understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, graph <b>802</b> shows the weight distribution <b>804</b> of a single garment. As can be seen, the weight distribution for garments is relatively wide. If one were to measure the weight distribution of other mechanical items such as bolts, the weight distribution would be more like a stepwise spike, since all measured items would have the same predictable weight. Graph <b>806</b> shows the weight distribution for a single garment and multiple garments. The large spike at location &#x3bc;<sub>1 </sub>shows the probability density for a single garment, whereas locations 2&#x3bc;<sub>1</sub>, 3&#x3bc;<sub>1</sub>, 4&#x3bc;<sub>1</sub>, show the probability density for 2, 3 and 4 garments.

The central controller can then determine whether the loader <b>206</b> needs to be engaged to either remove or add another workpiece item <b>204</b>.

The piezoelectric sensor <b>402</b> includes a housing <b>404</b> and a pair of pressure plates <b>406</b> each having a threaded mounting hole <b>408</b> formed therein. A Piezoelectric element <b>410</b> formed of a piezoelectric material such as quartz is sandwiched between the pressure plates <b>406</b>. A piezoelectric material is a material that generates an electrical current when placed under a mechanical strain.

The collection plate <b>414</b> can deliver this electrical potential to an amplifier <b>418</b>.

This calculation can include an expected weight range of an individual item. The expected weight range of such a weighed item can be stored in computer storage and retrieved for calculation of a discrete number of weighed items. Once the discrete number of weighed items has been calculated, this value can be delivered to a user interface <b>610</b>. This value can also be delivered to a transmitter <b>612</b>, where it can be delivered wirelessly to a central control unit <b>614</b> and/or to a robotic carrier <b>616</b>.

As discussed above, for example with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the path of the robotic carrier <b>106</b> can be controlled by following a visual line <b>110</b> formed on a workshop floor and by the use of checkpoints <b>112</b> that can be in the form or QR codes displayed on the workshop form. Movement of the robotic carrier can be assisted and controlled by a central control unit <b>108</b>. However, there may be times when these systems do not perfectly control the motion of the robotic carrier along the desired path. Alternatively, the malfunction of one or more robot components, imbalance between robot components, uneven workspace floor may result in similar deviations from the desired path by a robot.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a top-down view of a robotic carrier <b>106</b> as it moves in an X/Y plane across a workplace floor. The robotic rover is shown stationed on top of the weigh station <b>210</b>. Ideally, the center of gravity of the robotic carrier <b>106</b> would travel along a desired path indicated by dashed line <b>702</b> and would stop at a desired location marked by X <b>704</b>. Instead, certain deviation or variation from the intended stopping location may occur as a result of an incorrect speed of the robotic carrier <b>106</b> or inaccuracy in following the line <b>702</b> or other reasons as described above. While these variations may be small initially, they may cumulate as the robotic carrier moves through many stations leading to larger inaccuracy in the intended location of the robotic carrier <b>106</b> at each station <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).

The circuitry <b>712</b> can then determine a variation in the X direction <b>708</b> and a variation in the Y direction. This information can then be sent or transmitted to the central control unit <b>108</b> which can send or transmit commands to the robotic carrier correct or compensate the speed or direction of travel of the robotic carrier <b>106</b> to maintain correct location and travel of the robotic rover at subsequent stations <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), such as by adjusting the speed or direction of travel of the robotic carrier <b>106</b>. The weigh station can be used as a robots' checkpoint by determining the speed and acceleration vectors of the robots. Those data e.g. velocity vector, acceleration vector can be used to calculate the motion status of robots such that the central unit is able to monitor the status of the production line and make necessary compensation. The data provided by the weigh station can also be used as the feedback of the robotics motion which can calibrate the robotics motion measurement collected by the robot itself, such that the robotics controller can provide more accurate control output. The possibility of a malfunctional robot in the production line will be reduced. This determination of the location of the robotic carrier <b>106</b> based on the location of its center of gravity as the robotic carrier <b>106</b> positions itself on the scale can be used to detect the operation of a malfunctioning robotic carrier <b>106</b>, and to adjust process flow to compensate for malfunctioning, delayed or deviated robotic carriers <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only and not limitation.
