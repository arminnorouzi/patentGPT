It should be noted that the embodiments are merely examples to implement this disclosure and not to limit the technical scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The aforementioned conventional hydrogen gas sensor applies light and a magnetic field to the sensing element to detect change of the gas sensing layer in the sensing element with light. The change of the gas sensing layer is caused by exposure of the surface of the sensing element to the atmosphere to be examined. The above-described structure has the light source and the photodetector on the atmosphere side and therefore, a mechanism to hold these components is required. The laminate film of the sensing element is extremely thin, which is approximately 200 nm (0.200 &#x3bc;m) even if the thicknesses of all layers are summed up. The thickness of the glass substrate to hold the laminate film thereon is approximately 0.5 mm (500 &#x3bc;m) and therefore, the sensing element is thin and small. However, the sensing element is located deep when seen from the atmosphere side because the light source, the photodetector, and the structure to hold these components are provided in front of the sensing element.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Accordingly, in an exemplary case where this gas sensor is used to detect hydrogen gas leakage, the atmosphere has to be guided to behind the components disposed over the gas sensing element in order to expose the surface of the gas sensing element to the atmosphere. The structure becomes complicated and the restriction for installation increases.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The described hereinafter are embodiments of a gas sensing apparatus. One of the features of the gas sensing apparatus described herein is disposition of components. The specific disposition of the components provides open space in front of the sensing face (surface) of the gas sensing element, which reduces the restriction for installing the gas sensing apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically illustrates a configuration example of a gas sensing apparatus <b>1</b> in an embodiment.

On the optical path <b>50</b> from the light source <b>11</b> to the photodetector <b>17</b>, the first polarizer <b>12</b> and the first mirror <b>13</b> are disposed between the light source <b>11</b> and the gas sensing element <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the configuration example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first polarizer <b>12</b> is disposed between the light source <b>11</b> and the first mirror <b>13</b> on the optical path <b>50</b>.

The light source <b>11</b> can be a semiconductor laser or a light-emitting diode. The light from the light source <b>11</b> includes a specific wavelength suitable for gas detection with the laminate film <b>142</b>; an example of the light is monochromatic light having the specific wavelength. The first polarizer <b>12</b> transmits light oscillating in a specific direction (linearly polarized light) out of the incoming light and attenuates light oscillating in the other directions. In other words, the first polarizer <b>12</b> generates linearly polarized light from the light of the light source <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although this configuration example generates linearly polarized light with the light source <b>11</b> and the first polarizer <b>12</b>, another configuration example can employ a light source that outputs linearly polarized light like a semiconductor laser including a polarizer therein to omit the first polarizer <b>12</b>. Unlike the configuration example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first polarizer <b>12</b> can be disposed between the first mirror <b>13</b> and the gas sensing element <b>14</b> on the optical path <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The first mirror <b>13</b> reflects light transmitted through the first polarizer <b>12</b> to bend the optical path <b>50</b>. The linearly polarized light reflected by the first mirror <b>13</b> hits the laminate film <b>142</b> of the gas sensing element <b>14</b>. The magnetic field applicator <b>18</b> applies a magnetic field to the laminate film <b>142</b>. The direction of the magnetic field is parallel to or perpendicular to the surface of the laminate film <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the laminate film <b>142</b> with a magnetic field being applied reflects incoming light, the characteristics (such as polarization angle and intensity) of the reflected light are changed by the magneto-optic effect of the laminate film <b>142</b> to be different from the characteristics of the incoming light. Meanwhile, the characteristics of the reflected light vary depending on whether the target gas exists or not and further, the density of the target gas. The reflected light hits the second mirror <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The light reflected by the second mirror <b>15</b> enters the second polarizer <b>16</b>. The second polarizer <b>16</b> transmits light oscillating in a specific direction (linearly polarized light) out of the incoming light and attenuates light oscillating in the other directions. The second polarizer <b>16</b> enables the characteristics change caused by the magneto-optic effect of the laminate film <b>142</b> to be detected from the reflected light. Specifically, under the configuration such that the characteristics change in the reflected light is observed as change in polarization angle like polar Kerr effect or longitudinal Kerr effect, the second polarizer <b>16</b> transforms the characteristics change in the reflected light into a change in light intensity. The light transmitted through the second polarizer <b>16</b> enters the photodetector <b>17</b>. The photodetector <b>17</b> measures the intensity of the incoming light. More optical elements can be added to the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; for example, a wavelength filter to transmit light having a specific wavelength as the light emitted from the light source <b>11</b> can be provided between the second mirror <b>15</b> and the photodetector <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of the laminate structure of the gas sensing element <b>14</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an example of a hydrogen gas sensing element. A laminate film <b>142</b> is provided on a substrate <b>141</b>. The laminate structure (such as the material of each layer, the number of layers, the order of layers, and the thickness of each layer) of the laminate film <b>142</b> is selected appropriately to adjust the detectable density range for the target gas or detect a gas other than hydrogen gas.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The substrate <b>141</b> can be a glass substrate having a thickness of approximately 0.5 mm (500 &#x3bc;m). The laminate film <b>142</b> is formed by laminating a reflective metal layer <b>424</b>, a dielectric optical interference layer <b>423</b>, a magnetic metal layer <b>422</b>, a gas sensing layer <b>421</b> in order from the bottom to the top. Another dielectric optical interference layer can be interposed between the magnetic metal layer <b>422</b> and the gas sensing layer <b>421</b>. As will be described later, the thicknesses of the individual layers are determined appropriately so that the light that has entered the laminate film <b>142</b> will be multiply reflected within the laminate film <b>142</b>. For example, the thicknesses of the layers are approximately several-tens nanometers. The laminate film <b>142</b> can have a different configuration that causes effects described later, instead of the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The gas sensing layer <b>421</b> changes in optical characteristics such as refractive index and absorption coefficient because of reaction to hydrogen gas.

The gas sensing layer <b>421</b> can be made of any material that changes in optical characteristics such as refractive index and absorption coefficient because of reaction to hydrogen gas.

The illuminating light (incoming light) is reflected multiple times within the laminate film <b>142</b> to receive significant magneto-optic effect and as a result, the reflected light goes out with a polarization angle much different from that of the incoming light.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the gas sensing layer <b>421</b> is in contact with hydrogen gas, an optical characteristic such as refractive index or absorption coefficient changes in the gas sensing layer <b>421</b>. For this reason, the optical interference condition in the laminate film <b>142</b> changes, so that the effect of multiple reflection diminishes. When this action occurs under the condition where a magnetic field is being applied, the frequency of the change in polarization angle caused by the magneto-optic effect occurring in the magnetic metal layer <b>422</b> decreases and as a result, the change in polarization angle of the outgoing light relative to the polarization angle of the linearly polarized incoming light becomes small, compared to the case where hydrogen gas does not exist.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The polarization angle of the light reflected off the laminate film <b>142</b> varies depending on the orientation of magnetization of the magnetic metal layer <b>422</b> of the laminate film <b>142</b>. The gas sensing apparatus <b>1</b> applies a magnetic field cyclically changing its direction to opposite to the laminate film <b>142</b> with the magnetic field applicator <b>18</b> and detects the change of the polarization angle in the light reflected off the laminate film <b>142</b> to detect hydrogen gas with high accuracy.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Since the second polarizer <b>16</b> transmits only the light (component) polarized linearly in a specific direction, the intensity of the light transmitted through the second polarizer <b>16</b> out of the reflected light off the laminate film <b>142</b> changes depending on the polarization angle of the reflected light off the laminate film <b>142</b>. The photodetector <b>17</b> detects the change in polarization angle in the form of change in the intensity of light.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The gas sensing apparatus <b>1</b> can measure the change in magneto-optic effect of the laminate film <b>142</b> caused by hydrogen gas in a different way. For example, detecting the polarization angle with a photodetector like differential detection using a polarized beam splitter can be employed. In that case, the second polarizer <b>16</b> can be eliminated. In another example, the gas sensing apparatus <b>1</b> can apply a fixed (non-alternating) magnetic field to the laminate film <b>142</b> in detecting the target gas. The gas sensing apparatus <b>1</b> can also utilize transversal Kerr effect. The transversal Kerr effect occurs when the direction of the applied magnetic field is within the plane of the laminate film <b>142</b> and perpendicular to the projection of the incoming light and the reflected light on the reflection surface. The change of the transversal Kerr effect is observed not in polarization angle but in reflectance (the intensity of the reflected light).
