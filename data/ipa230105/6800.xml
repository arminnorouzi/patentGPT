These systems may be capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (e.g., time, frequency, and power). Examples of such multiple-access systems include fourth generation (4G) systems such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems, LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) systems, or LTE-A Pro systems, and fifth generation (5G) systems which may be referred to as New Radio (NR) systems. These systems may employ technologies such as code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), or discrete Fourier transform-spread-OFDM (DFT-S-OFDM). A wireless multiple-access communications system may include a number of base stations or network access nodes, each simultaneously supporting communication for multiple communication devices, which may be otherwise known as user equipment (UE).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The described techniques relate to improved methods, systems, devices, or apparatuses that support options for controlling multiplexing of a reference signal on an uplink shared channel (UL-SCH). In some cases, the UE may time division multiplex (TDM) a demodulation reference signal (DMRS) with other signaling, such as uplink control information (UCI) or UL-SCH data, in different symbol periods. The UE may map the DMRS to resource elements of one or more symbol periods within one or more resource blocks allocated to the UE for an uplink transmission (e.g., as part of an uplink grant). The UE may then map UCI to one or more symbol periods different than the symbol periods of the DMRS mapping. In some cases, the DMRS, UCI, or both may be frequency interleaved with UL-SCH data for the resource blocks. In other cases, a base station may generate a message indicating whether a UE is to frequency division multiplex (FDM) a DMRS within a symbol period of a resource block allocated to the UE for an uplink transmission. The message may include a single bit or an index that jointly signals a set of parameters, and may be control information transmitted to the UE via a control channel (e.g., downlink control information (DCI) in a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH)) or via radio resource control (RRC) signaling.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The UE may determine the multiplexing operation based on a type of waveform to be used for the uplink transmission. The type of waveform used for the uplink transmission may include a discrete Fourier transport spread orthogonal frequency division multiples (DFT-S-OFDM) waveform or a cyclic prefix orthogonal frequency division multiplex (CP-OFDM) waveform. Based on the message and the waveform type, the UE may TDM or FDM DMRS with UCI and/or UL-SCH data within the resource block allocated for uplink transmission. The UE may therefore efficiently utilize PUSCH resources and transmit a waveform of the uplink transmission having desired properties.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method of wireless communication is described. The method may include receiving, by a UE, a grant allocating a resource block of an uplink shared channel for an uplink transmission, determining, by the UE, a mapping for the resource block that includes time division multiplexing a demodulation reference signal and uplink control information to different symbol periods of the resource block, and transmitting an uplink waveform within the resource block based on the mapping.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An apparatus for wireless communication is described. The apparatus may include a processor, memory in electronic communication with the processor, and instructions stored in the memory.

description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The described techniques relate to improved methods, systems, devices, or apparatuses that support options for controlling multiplexing of a reference signal on an uplink shared channel (UL-SCH), such as a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH). In an example, a user equipment (UE) may determine a mapping for allocating signaling to time and frequency resources of an uplink shared channel (e.g., a PUSCH). The time and frequency resources may correspond to one or more resource blocks included in a grant for uplink transmission, and each resource block may include a set of tones (subcarriers) and OFDM symbol periods.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some cases, the UE may time division multiplex (TDM) a demodulation reference signal (DMRS) with other signaling, such as uplink control information (UCI) or UL-SCH data, in different symbol periods. The UE may map the DMRS to resource elements of one or more symbol periods within the resource block. The UE may then map UCI to one or more symbol periods different than the symbol periods of the DMRS mapping. In some cases, the DMRS, UCI, or both may be frequency interleaved with UL-SCH data for the resource block.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In other cases, a base station may transmit downlink signaling, including the grant, to the UE for an uplink transmission (e.g., for a PUSCH transmission). The base station may also generate a message indicating whether the UE is to frequency divisional multiplex (FDM) a DMRS within a symbol period of the allocated resource block. The message may be a single bit or an index that jointly signals a set of parameters, and may be control information transmitted to the UE over a control channel (e.g., downlink control information (DCI) in a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH)) or via radio resource control (RRC) signaling.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">A UE may receive and process the message to determine a multiplexing operation of the DMRS, including whether to FDM the DMRS with other signaling in a same symbol period, or instead to TDM the DMRS with the other signaling in a different symbol periods. In some examples, the other signaling may be UL-SCH data and/or UCI. In some cases, UCI may only be time division multiplexed with DMRS, regardless of waveform type used for the uplink transmission. For example, for UCI that is piggybacked on PUSCH that includes UL-SCH data, the UCI may only be time division multiplexed (and not frequency division multiplexed) with DMRS, regardless of waveform. One benefit of this technique is that the UE may apply a unified mapping pattern for mapping UCI to resource elements of a PUSCH transmission that is independent of the type of waveform used to generate the PUSCH transmission.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some cases, the type of multiplexing may be waveform dependent. For example, if PUSCH is based on a discrete Fourier transform-spread-OFDM (DFT-S-OFDM) waveform, UCI and/or UL-SCH data may only be time division multiplexed with DMRS, and may not be frequency division multiplexed with UCI. If PUSCH is based on a cyclic prefix orthogonal frequency division multiplex (CP-OFDM) waveform, UCI and/or UL-SCH data may or may not be frequency division multiplexed, and the base station may use DCI and/or RRC signaling for controlling whether to FDM DMRS with UCI and/or UL-SCH data.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some examples, the UE may determine the multiplexing operation based on a type of waveform to be used for the uplink transmission. Based on the message and the waveform type, the UE may TDM or FDM DMRS with UCI and/or UL-SCH data within a resource block allocated to the UE for an uplink transmission.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some cases, the UE may FDM DMRS with UCI and/or UL-SCH data by alternating tones in a particular symbol period to transport DMRS and one of UCI or UL-SCH data. In other cases, the UE may alternate tones that transport DMRS with empty tones in a particular symbol period.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The controlling of whether to FDM DMRS may provide efficient PUSCH resource allocation based on a waveform type used for the uplink transmission. In an example, the UE may TDM DMRS with UCI and/or UL-SCI data to enable the UE to generate a waveform having single-carrier waveform properties, such as a DFT-S-OFDM waveform. In other examples, the UE may FDM DMRS with UCI and/or UL-SCI data and generate a cyclic prefix (CP)-OFDM waveform that more efficiently utilizes resources of the PUSCH as compared to a DFT-S-OFDM waveform. The UE may therefore efficiently utilize PUSCH resources and transmit a waveform of the uplink transmission having desired properties.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Aspects of the disclosure are initially described in the context of a wireless communications system. The wireless communications system may piggyback UCI and UL-SCH data on resources of an uplink shared channel, and transmit in combination with DMRS over the uplink shared channel. Aspects of the disclosure are illustrated by and described with reference to apparatus diagrams, system diagrams, and flowcharts that relate to multiplexing DMRS on a uplink shared channel when piggybacking UCI on PUSCH.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a wireless communications system <b>100</b> that supports controlling multiplexing of a reference signal on an uplink shared channel in accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure.

In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may also refer to a wireless local loop (WLL) station, an Internet of Things (IoT) device, an Internet of Everything (IoE) device, or an MTC device, or the like, which may be implemented in various articles such as appliances, vehicles, meters, or the like.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Base stations <b>105</b> may communicate with the core network <b>130</b> and with one another. For example, base stations <b>105</b> may interface with the core network <b>130</b> through backhaul links <b>132</b> (e.g., via an S1 or other interface). Base stations <b>105</b> may communicate with one another over backhaul links <b>134</b> (e.g., via an X2 or other interface) either directly (e.g., directly between base stations <b>105</b>) or indirectly (e.g., via core network <b>130</b>).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The core network <b>130</b> may provide user authentication, access authorization, tracking, Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity, and other access, routing, or mobility functions. The core network <b>130</b> may be an evolved packet core (EPC), which may include at least one mobility management entity (MME), at least one serving gateway (S-GW), and at least one Packet Data Network (PDN) gateway (P-GW). The MME may manage non-access stratum (e.g., control plane) functions such as mobility, authentication, and bearer management for UEs <b>115</b> served by base stations <b>105</b> associated with the EPC. User IP packets may be transferred through the S-GW, which itself may be coupled with the P-GW. The P-GW may provide IP address allocation as well as other functions. The P-GW may be coupled with the network operators IP services. The operators IP services may include access to the Internet, Intranet(s), an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), or a Packet-Switched (PS) Streaming Service.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">At least some of the network devices, such as a base station <b>105</b>, may include subcomponents such as an access network entity, which may be an example of an access node controller (ANC). Each access network entity may communicate with UEs <b>115</b> through a number of other access network transmission entities, which may be referred to as a radio head, a smart radio head, or a transmission/reception point (TRP). In some examples, various functions of each access network entity or base station <b>105</b> may be distributed across various network devices (e.g., radio heads and access network controllers) or consolidated into a single network device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may operate using one or more frequency bands, including in the range of 300 MHz to 300 GHz. The region from 300 MHz to 3 GHz may be known as the ultra-high frequency (UHF) region or decimeter band, since the wavelengths range from approximately one decimeter to one meter in length. UHF waves may be blocked or redirected by buildings and environmental features. However, the waves may penetrate structures sufficiently for a macro cell to provide service to UEs <b>115</b> located indoors. Transmission of UHF waves may be associated with smaller antennas and shorter range (e.g., less than 100 km) compared to transmission using the smaller frequencies and longer waves of the high frequency (<b>1</b>F) or very high frequency (VHF) portion of the spectrum below 300 MHz.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may also operate in a super high frequency (SHF) region using frequency bands from 3 GHz to 30 GHz, also known as the centimeter band. The SHF region includes bands such as the 5 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands, which may be used opportunistically by devices that can tolerate interference from other users.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may also operate in an extremely high frequency (EHF) region of the spectrum (e.g., from 30 GHz to 300 GHz), also known as the millimeter band. In some examples, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support millimeter wave (mmW) communications between UEs <b>115</b> and base stations <b>105</b>, and EHF antennas of the respective devices may be even smaller and more closely spaced than UHF antennas. In some cases, this may facilitate use of antenna arrays within a UE <b>115</b>. However, the propagation of EHF transmissions may be subject to even greater atmospheric attenuation and shorter range than SHF or UHF transmissions. Techniques disclosed herein may be employed across transmissions that use one or more different frequency regions, and designated use of bands across these frequency regions may differ by country or regulating body.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some cases, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may utilize both licensed and unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands. For example, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may employ License Assisted Access (LAA), LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) radio access technology, or NR technology in an unlicensed band such as the 5 GHz ISM band. When operating in unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands, wireless devices such as base stations <b>105</b> and UEs <b>115</b> may employ listen-before-talk (LBT) procedures to ensure a frequency channel is clear before transmitting data. In some cases, operations in unlicensed bands may be based on a CA configuration in conjunction with CCs operating in a licensed band (e.g., LAA). Operations in unlicensed spectrum may include downlink transmissions, uplink transmissions, peer-to-peer transmissions, or a combination of these. Duplexing in unlicensed spectrum may be based on frequency division duplexing (FDD), time division duplexing (TDD), or a combination of both.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some examples, base station <b>105</b> or UE <b>115</b> may be equipped with multiple antennas, which may be used to employ techniques such as transmit diversity, receive diversity, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, or beamforming. For example, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may use a transmission scheme between a transmitting device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>) and a receiving device (e.g., a UE <b>115</b>), where the transmitting device is equipped with multiple antennas and the receiving devices are equipped with one or more antennas. MIMO communications may employ multipath signal propagation to increase the spectral efficiency by transmitting or receiving multiple signals via different spatial layers, which may be referred to as spatial multiplexing. The multiple signals may, for example, be transmitted by the transmitting device via different antennas or different combinations of antennas. Likewise, the multiple signals may be received by the receiving device via different antennas or different combinations of antennas. Each of the multiple signals may be referred to as a separate spatial stream, and may carry bits associated with the same data stream (e.g., the same codeword) or different data streams. Different spatial layers may be associated with different antenna ports used for channel measurement and reporting. MIMO techniques include single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) where multiple spatial layers are transmitted to the same receiving device, and multiple-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) where multiple spatial layers are transmitted to multiple devices.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Beamforming, which may also be referred to as spatial filtering, directional transmission, or directional reception, is a signal processing technique that may be used at a transmitting device or a receiving device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b>) to shape or steer an antenna beam (e.g., a transmit beam or receive beam) along a spatial path between the transmitting device and the receiving device. Beamforming may be achieved by combining the signals communicated via antenna elements of an antenna array such that signals propagating at particular orientations with respect to an antenna array experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. The adjustment of signals communicated via the antenna elements may include a transmitting device or a receiving device applying some amplitude and phase offsets to signals carried via each of the antenna elements associated with the device. The adjustments associated with each of the antenna elements may be defined by a beamforming weight set associated with a particular orientation (e.g., with respect to the antenna array of the transmitting device or receiving device, or with respect to some other orientation).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In one example, a base station <b>105</b> may use multiple antennas or antenna arrays to conduct beamforming operations for directional communications with a UE <b>115</b>. For instance, some signals (e.g. synchronization signals, reference signals, beam selection signals, or other control signals) may be transmitted by a base station <b>105</b> multiple times in different directions, which may include a signal being transmitted according to different beamforming weight sets associated with different directions of transmission. Transmissions in different beam directions may be used to identify (e.g., by the base station <b>105</b> or a receiving device, such as a UE <b>115</b>) a beam direction for subsequent transmission and/or reception by the base station <b>105</b>. Some signals, such as data signals associated with a particular receiving device, may be transmitted by a base station <b>105</b> in a single beam direction (e.g., a direction associated with the receiving device, such as a UE <b>115</b>). In some examples, the beam direction associated with transmissions along a single beam direction may be determined based at least in in part on a signal that was transmitted in different beam directions. For example, a UE <b>115</b> may receive one or more of the signals transmitted by the base station <b>105</b> in different directions, and the UE <b>115</b> may report to the base station <b>105</b> an indication of the received signal with a highest signal quality, or an otherwise acceptable signal quality. Although these techniques are described with reference to signals transmitted in one or more directions by a base station <b>105</b>, a UE <b>115</b> may employ similar techniques for transmitting signals multiple times in different directions (e.g., for identifying a beam direction for subsequent transmission or reception by the UE <b>115</b>), or transmitting a signal in a single direction (e.g., for transmitting data to a receiving device).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">A receiving device (e.g., a UE <b>115</b>, which may be an example of a mmW receiving device) may try multiple receive beams when receiving various signals from the base station <b>105</b>, such as synchronization signals, reference signals, beam selection signals, or other control signals. For example, a receiving device may try multiple receive directions by receiving via different antenna subarrays, by processing received signals according to different antenna subarrays, by receiving according to different receive beamforming weight sets applied to signals received at a plurality of antenna elements of an antenna array, or by processing received signals according to different receive beamforming weight sets applied to signals received at a plurality of antenna elements of an antenna array, any of which may be referred to as &#x201c;listening&#x201d; according to different receive beams or receive directions. In some examples a receiving device may use a single receive beam to receive along a single beam direction (e.g., when receiving a data signal). The single receive beam may be aligned in a beam direction determined based at least in part on listening according to different receive beam directions (e.g., a beam direction determined to have a highest signal strength, highest signal-to-noise ratio, or otherwise acceptable signal quality based at least in part on listening according to multiple beam directions).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some cases, the antennas of a base station <b>105</b> or UE <b>115</b> may be located within one or more antenna arrays, which may support MIMO operations, or transmit or receive beamforming. For example, one or more base station antennas or antenna arrays may be co-located at an antenna assembly, such as an antenna tower. In some cases, antennas or antenna arrays associated with a base station <b>105</b> may be located in diverse geographic locations. A base station <b>105</b> may have an antenna array with a number of rows and columns of antenna ports that the base station <b>105</b> may use to support beamforming of communications with a UE <b>115</b>. Likewise, a UE <b>115</b> may have one or more antenna arrays that may support various MIMO or beamforming operations.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In some cases, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be a packet-based network that operate according to a layered protocol stack. In the user plane, communications at the bearer or Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer may be IP-based. A Radio Link Control (RLC) layer may in some cases perform packet segmentation and reassembly to communicate over logical channels. A Medium Access Control (MAC) layer may perform priority handling and multiplexing of logical channels into transport channels. The MAC layer may also use hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) to provide retransmission at the MAC layer to improve link efficiency. In the control plane, the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol layer may provide establishment, configuration, and maintenance of an RRC connection between a UE <b>115</b> and a base station <b>105</b> or core network <b>130</b> supporting radio bearers for user plane data. At the Physical (PHY) layer, transport channels may be mapped to physical channels.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some cases, UEs <b>115</b> and base stations <b>105</b> may support retransmissions of data to increase the likelihood that data is received successfully. HARQ feedback is one technique of increasing the likelihood that data is received correctly over a communication link <b>125</b>. HARQ may include a combination of error detection (e.g., using a cyclic redundancy check (CRC)), forward error correction (FEC), and retransmission (e.g., automatic repeat request (ARQ)). HARQ may improve throughput at the MAC layer in poor radio conditions (e.g., signal-to-noise conditions). In some cases, a wireless device may support same-slot HARQ feedback, where the device may provide HARQ feedback in a specific slot for data received in a previous symbol in the slot. In other cases, the device may provide HARQ feedback in a subsequent slot, or according to some other time interval.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Time intervals in LTE or NR may be expressed in multiples of a basic time unit, which may, for example, refer to a sampling period of T<sub>s</sub>= 1/30,720,000 seconds. Time intervals of a communications resource may be organized according to radio frames each having a duration of 10 milliseconds (ms), where the frame period may be expressed as T<sub>f</sub>=307,200 T<sub>s</sub>. The radio frames may be identified by a system frame number (SFN) ranging from 0 to 1023. Each frame may include 10 subframes numbered from 0 to 9, and each subframe may have a duration of 1 ms. A subframe may be divided into 2 slots each having a duration of 0.5 ms, and each slot may contain 6 or 7 modulation symbol periods (e.g., depending on the length of the cyclic prefix prepended to each symbol period). Excluding the cyclic prefix, each symbol period may contain 2048 sampling periods. In some cases a subframe may be the smallest scheduling unit of the wireless communications system <b>100</b>, and may be referred to as a transmission time interval (TTI). In other cases, a smallest scheduling unit of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be shorter than a subframe or may be dynamically selected (e.g., in bursts of shortened TTIs (sTTIs) or in selected component carriers using sTTIs).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some wireless communications systems, a slot may be divided into multiple mini-slots containing one or more symbols. In some instances, a symbol of a mini-slot or a mini-slot may be the smallest unit of scheduling. Each symbol may vary in duration depending on the subcarrier spacing or frequency band of operation, for example. Additionally, some wireless communications systems may implement slot aggregation in which multiple slots or mini-slots are aggregated together and used for communication between a UE <b>115</b> and a base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The term &#x201c;carrier&#x201d; refers to a set of radio frequency spectrum resources having a defined physical layer structure for supporting communications over a communication link <b>125</b>. For example, a carrier of a communication link <b>125</b> may include a portion of a radio frequency spectrum band that is operated according to physical layer channels for a given radio access technology. Each physical layer channel may carry user data, control information, or other signaling. A carrier may be associated with a pre-defined frequency channel (e.g., an E-UTRA absolute radio frequency channel number (EARFCN)), and may be positioned according to a channel raster for discovery by UEs <b>115</b>. Carriers may be downlink or uplink (e.g., in an FDD mode), or be configured to carry downlink and uplink communications (e.g., in a TDD mode). In some examples, signal waveforms transmitted over a carrier may be made up of multiple sub-carriers (e.g., using multi-carrier modulation (MCM) techniques such as OFDM or DFT-s-OFDM).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The organizational structure of the carriers may be different for different radio access technologies (e.g., LTE, LTE-A, LTE-A Pro, NR, etc.). For example, communications over a carrier may be organized according to TTIs or slots, each of which may include user data as well as control information or signaling to support decoding the user data. A carrier may also include dedicated acquisition signaling (e.g., synchronization signals or system information, etc.) and control signaling that coordinates operation for the carrier. In some examples (e.g., in a carrier aggregation configuration), a carrier may also have acquisition signaling or control signaling that coordinates operations for other carriers.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Physical channels may be multiplexed on a carrier according to various techniques. A physical control channel and a physical data channel may be multiplexed on a downlink carrier, for example, using time division multiplexing (TDM) techniques, frequency division multiplexing (FDM) techniques, or hybrid TDM-FDM techniques. In some examples, control information transmitted in a physical control channel may be distributed between different control regions in a cascaded manner (e.g., between a common control region or common search space and one or more UE-specific control regions or UE-specific search spaces).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">A carrier may be associated with a particular bandwidth of the radio frequency spectrum, and in some examples the carrier bandwidth may be referred to as a &#x201c;system bandwidth&#x201d; of the carrier or the wireless communications system <b>100</b>. For example, the carrier bandwidth may be one of a number of predetermined bandwidths for carriers of a particular radio access technology (e.g., 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, or 80 MHz). In some examples, each served UE <b>115</b> may be configured for operating over portions or all of the carrier bandwidth. In other examples, some UEs <b>115</b> may be configured for operation using a narrowband protocol type that is associated with a predefined portion or range (e.g., set of subcarriers or RBs) within a carrier (e.g., &#x201c;in-band&#x201d; deployment of a narrowband protocol type).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support communication with a UE <b>115</b> on multiple cells or carriers, a feature which may be referred to as carrier aggregation (CA) or multi-carrier operation. A UE <b>115</b> may be configured with multiple downlink CCs and one or more uplink CCs according to a carrier aggregation configuration. Carrier aggregation may be used with both FDD and TDD component carriers.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In some cases, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may utilize enhanced component carriers (eCCs). An eCC may be characterized by one or more features including wider carrier or frequency channel bandwidth, shorter symbol duration, shorter TTI duration, or modified control channel configuration. In some cases, an eCC may be associated with a carrier aggregation configuration or a dual connectivity configuration (e.g., when multiple serving cells have a sub-optimal or non-ideal backhaul link). An eCC may also be configured for use in unlicensed spectrum or shared spectrum (e.g., where more than one operator is allowed to use the spectrum). An eCC characterized by wide carrier bandwidth may include one or more segments that may be utilized by UEs <b>115</b> that are not capable of monitoring the whole carrier bandwidth or are otherwise configured to use a limited carrier bandwidth (e.g., to conserve power). In some cases, an eCC may utilize a different symbol duration than other CCs, which may include use of a reduced symbol duration as compared with symbol durations of the other CCs. A shorter symbol duration may be associated with increased spacing between adjacent subcarriers. A device, such as a UE <b>115</b> or base station <b>105</b>, utilizing eCCs may transmit wideband signals (e.g., according to frequency channel or carrier bandwidths of 20, 40, 60, 80 MHz, etc.) at reduced symbol durations (e.g., 16.67 microseconds). A TTI in eCC may contain one or multiple symbol periods. In some cases, the TTI duration (that is, the number of symbol periods in a TTI) may be variable.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA), like Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), divides transmission bandwidth into multiple parallel subcarriers. Parallel subcarriers may allow each respective subcarrier to be individually modulated while maintaining a lower symbol rate for transmission, therefore improving robustness. In some cases, frequency-selective channels may insert a guard period (e.g., a cyclic prefix (CP)) into the timing at the beginning of each data symbol, as a means to sustain orthogonality between the maintained subcarriers. Implementation of a CP within the transmission may be referred to as CP-OFDM, and aid in improving resilience to multipath delays and spread causal to inter-symbol interference.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In LTE/LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) systems, UEs may provide uplink signaling to a base station using single-carrier waveforms such as DFT-S-OFDM, or spectral efficient waveforms such as CP-OFDM that may be well localized in the time domain. The selected uplink signaling waveform configuration may be in contrast to multicarrier transmission schemes (e.g., orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)) implemented for downlink. This is because a UE's power amplifier may not be sufficient for the large power variations coincident with OFDMA transmissions. By transmitting using DFT-S-OFDM, CP-OFDM, or the like, the UE <b>115</b> may mitigate variation to signal power at the transmitter of the UE <b>115</b>, and may reduce distortion to the output waveform (i.e., distortion to the time-domain waveform may distort the frequency-domain power spectrum).</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">A UE <b>115</b> may transmit uplink shared channel (UL-SCH) data and signaling from the medium access control (MAC) layer on physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) resources. In new radio (NR) systems, PUSCH may support two waveforms: CP-OFDM or DFT-S-OFDM. UCI may be carried on the physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) resources designated for control signaling, or multiplexed with data on the PUSCH. Transmitting control information, such as CSI, in an uplink shared channel (e.g., within a PUSCH) may be referred to herein as piggybacking. UCI is control signaling that may include any combination of (1) hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) ACKnowledgement/Negative ACKnowledgement (ACK/NAK) information for one or more component carriers, (2) periodic channel state information (CSI) aperiodic CSI feedback for one or more component carriers, (3) a scheduling request (SR), (4) a buffer status report (BSR), or the like.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In conventional systems, UCI is transmitted via PUCCH resources, and data is sent signaling over PUSCH resources. However, in the case of limited or no present UL-SCH data for uplink transmission, PUSCH resources of the uplink grant may be empty or underutilized. As a result, resources within the uplink channel may be sub-optimally allocated. Techniques of the present disclosure include efficiently allocating available time and frequency resources of an uplink grant for UCI transmission.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">A base station <b>105</b> may generate a message indicating whether a UE <b>115</b> is to FDM DMRS within a symbol period of a resource block allocated to the UE <b>115</b> for an uplink transmission by an uplink grant. The message may be provided via DCI signaling, and may include a single bit indication or an index that jointly signals a set of parameters to the UE <b>115</b>. The base station <b>105</b> may transmit the message over PDCCH, for subsequent reception at the UE <b>115</b>. The UE <b>115</b> may receive and process the message, and determine a multiplexing operation for resource allocation. The resource allocation may include multiplexing DMRS relative to UCI on allocated resources of PUSCH and, in some cases, UL-SCH data. The UE <b>115</b> may then generate an uplink waveform in accordance with the multiplexing operation and transmit the waveform over PUSCH. The described examples herein describe methods for piggybacking UCI on allocated PUSCH resources. The multiplexing operations may utilize configured waveform properties and improve resource allocation efficiency.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of a transmitter <b>200</b> of a UE <b>115</b> that supports controlling multiplexing of a reference signal on an uplink shared channel, in accordance with one or more aspects of the present disclosure.

Each resource element may correspond to a single subcarrier (e.g., a tone) and a single OFDM symbol. The grant may indicate one or more resource blocks and corresponding subcarriers, for control channel (e.g., PUCCH) and/or data channel (e.g., PUSCH) signaling. Transmitter <b>200</b> may identify UCI for piggybacking on resources of the data channel (e.g., PUSCH).

The DFT spreading block may perform a DFT operation. The sequence multiplier block may multiply the input symbols by a sequence having some frequency characteristics sufficient to generate spread of the input symbols.
