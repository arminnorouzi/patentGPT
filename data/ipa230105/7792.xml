In practical application, in consideration of the related technologies and still further reducing costs, a glass substrate may be selected.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Arrangement modes of the output pads of the chip arranged on the rigid substrate body are not limited, and are determined according to actual situations. The output pads (<b>130</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) of a source channel of a conventional COG (Chip On Glass) integrated circuit are generally arranged in three rows or four rows as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. This chip packaging unit may be applied to a display device which is not very high in resolution requirements. However, if the above chip packaging unit is applied to a display device having a very high resolution, such as a WQ-level (resolution of 1600*2560) display device, the above arrangement mode of four-row output pads cannot meet actual requirements. Reference is made by taking an example where the above chip packaging unit is applied to the WQ-level display device, because the resolution is 1600*2560, a total of 1600*3=4800 source channels are required. That is, 4,800 output pads need to be provided for the integrated circuit. If the output pads are arranged in four rows, 1,200 pads need to be arranged in each row. Calculated based on a fact that a pad pitch (distance between centers of two adjacent pads) is 30 &#x3bc;m, a width occupied by one row of pads is 1200*30 &#x3bc;m=36,000 &#x3bc;m. However, a maximum width of an existing conventional single integrated circuit is about 33 mm. As can be seen, the pad pitch in the arrangement mode of four-row output pads has exceeded the maximum width of the existing single integrated circuit. In this case, the four-row arrangement mode needs to be changed to a five-row arrangement mode as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. If the output pads are arranged in five rows as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, 4800/5=960 output pads need to be arranged in each row. Calculated based on a fact that the pad pitch is 34 &#x3bc;m and a mark width on one side is 80 &#x3bc;m, a width occupied by one row of output pads is 960*34 &#x3bc;m+80 &#x3bc;m*2=32,800 &#x3bc;m=32.80 mm&#x3c;33 mm. That is, the width occupied by one row of output pads does not exceed the maximum width of the existing single integrated circuit. In this case, the width of each output pad may be 12 &#x3bc;m, and a length of each output pad may be 100 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The embodiments of the present disclosure provide a chip packaging structure, which is applied to a display device.

In another aspect, compared with a scheme where the chip is arranged on the flexible substrate body, the scheme where the chip is arranged on the rigid substrate body is greatly reduced in both difficulty and costs.

The input pads in the inner row and the output pads in the inner row are connected in one-to-one correspondence through the third traces, and the input pads in the outer row and the output pads in the outer row are connected in one-to-one correspondence through the second traces.

This connection mode is simple and easy for implementation.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">At present, generally there are three specifications for the width of a chip on film in the industry: 35 mm, 48 mm, and 70 mm. An effective width of the 70 mm chip on film is 63.5 mm, and a single-layer chip on film is mostly used. Arrangement of the input and output pads is the single-row arrangement as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, which may be applied to a display device not very high in resolution requirements. However, if the display device has a very high resolution, for example, if the display device is a WQ-level (resolution of 1600*2560) display device, the above single-row arrangement of the input and output pads cannot meet actual requirements. Taking a WQ-level panel and a 70 mm chip on film as an example, the number of source channels required for the WQ panel is 1600*3=4,800, plus about 100 Gout pins for connecting the display panel. That is, a total of about 4,900 source channels are required. If a single-layer chip-on-film single-row pad structure is adopted, even if the smallest chip-on-film pitch available in the industry is 18 &#x3bc;m, the width occupied by each row of pads is 18 &#x3bc;m*4900=88.2 mm, which is far more than the effective width 63.5 mm. In this case, it is necessary to adopt a double-layer chip-on-film double-row pad structure. In the double-layer chip-on-film double-row pad structure, the number of pads in each row is 4900/2=2450. Calculated according to a bonding pitch of 25 &#x3bc;m in the industry, the width occupied by each row of pads is 25 &#x3bc;m*2450=61.25 mm, plus the width (approximately 1.8 mm) of an alignment mark, the total width is 61.25 mm+1.8 mm=63.05 mm&#x3c;63.5 mm, which does not exceed the effective width of the chip on film.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">That is, the first type of flexible substrate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> provided by the embodiments of the present disclosure is more suitable for display devices with lower resolution. If this flexible substrate is to be applied to display devices with very high resolution (for example, WQ-level display devices), a plurality of chip packaging structures need to be cascaded together to meet the requirements. For example, if this flexible substrate is applied to a tablet computer display device of about 10.5-11.6 inches, two chip packaging units need to be provided, wherein each chip packaging unit includes the structure of the first type of flexible substrate described above. The second type of flexible substrate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> provided by the embodiments of the present disclosure may be applied to display devices with a very high resolution (for example, WQ-level display devices). In this case, the chip packaging unit may be as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. That is, two chip packaging units are incorporated into one large chip packaging unit.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In related technologies, in a regular-sized mobile phone, one chip-on-film integrated circuit is employed to drive sub-pixels to display through an LTPS multiplexer scheme. However, as the size of the display panel continues to increase and the resolution thereof continues to improve, for example, if a WQ-level (resolution 2560*1600) tablet personal computer (TPC) product adopts this LTPS multiplexer scheme, a risk of insufficient charging may be caused. Furthermore, the chip-on-film integrated circuit is limited by the process limit of a trace width and pitch of the chip on film, the number of channels of one chip-on-film integrated circuit cannot meet the resolution requirements. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, it is necessary to use two cascaded chip-on-film integrated circuits <b>111</b> to support WQ-level display. Costs will be undoubtedly further increased if the original chip-on-film structure is still adopted, which is greatly disadvantageous to low-cost market demands and sustainable development of subsequent products. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the chip-on-film structure <b>110</b> also includes a flexible substrate body <b>112</b>.

That is, two chips are bonded to the same rigid substrate body, such that synchronization signal lines of the two chips may be directly connected on the rigid substrate body instead of being connected on the drive printed circuit board. In this way, the number of bonding pads (also known as bonding pins) of the drive printed circuit board is reduced, which can shorten the overall width of the drive printed circuit board and save space for the whole structure. For example, if the chip adopts an arrangement mode of four-row pads, the number of the synchronization signal lines of the two chips is about 16. In this case, the number of bonding pads of the drive printed circuit board can be reduced by 16*4=64, thereby reducing the width of the drive printed circuit board in the horizontal direction (X direction).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The structure of the flexible substrate of each chip packaging unit may be as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, and the pads of the chip on the rigid substrate may be arranged in three rows or four rows.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the third structure, the chip packaging structure includes one chip packaging unit <b>1</b>, wherein this chip packaging unit <b>1</b> incorporates two chip packaging units, and thus is much larger than the chip packaging unit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.
