A user's gaze may be determined based on analysis of one or more body parts of the user. For example, a user's gaze may be determined based on visual analysis of the location/orientation of the user's eyes, the user's iris, the user's nose, the user's head, and/or other parts of the user's head. The determination of user's gaze may be facilitated through use of other information about the user, such as information on the user's body pose (e.g., the user extending a hand/finger in a particular direction), information on the user's vocal cues about locations of interest (e.g., the user stating whether the location of interest is in front, to the left, to the right, behind, above, or below the user), and/or other information.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The images/video frames captured by the selfie-image sensor may be used to track the user's gaze and automatically determine a punch-out of the images/video frames captured by the front-facing image sensor.

Facial classification of visual content may include detection of face(s) depicted within the visual content and classification of the detected face(s). Classification of a face may include categorization and/or labeling of the face based on one or more features of the face. Features of the face may include distinctive attributes and/or aspects of the face.

Based on the classification of the faces, non-spherical visual content (two-dimensional visual content of a video edit) of the sporting event may be generated to simultaneous include punch-outs of the player and the crowd reaction. Based on the classification of the faces, non-spherical visual content (two-dimensional visual content of a video edit) of the sporting event may be generated to include a punch-outs of the player, and no punch-out of the crowd.

For example, based on the gaze of the user (as determined from the gaze detection <b>812</b>), the depiction of interest may be determined to be located within the capture extent <b>824</b>. Alternatively, based on the gaze of the user (as determined from the gaze detection <b>812</b>), visual analysis and/or computer vision techniques may be performed one or more extents of the visual content B <b>804</b>. For example, visual analysis/computer vision may be performed within an extent of the visual content B <b>804</b> that is larger than and includes the capture extent <b>824</b>. The visual analysis/computer vision may be performed to identify depiction(s) of interest. For example, based on the visual analysis/computer vision, the depiction of interest may be identified as being located within the capture extent <b>824</b>. In other words, the gaze of the user may be used to identify which portions of the visual content may be analyzed for depiction of interest identification. Such localization of the visual analysis/computer vision within the visual content may provide for resource savings (e.g., computing power, time, memory, power consumption) compared to performing visual analysis/computer vision over the entirety of the visual content (e.g., entire spherical visual content).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">When the image capture device is operating in the non-spherical capture mode, the image capture device may utilize visual content captured by one of the image sensors <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B to control the other the image sensor and/or the optical element corresponding to the other optical image sensor.

That is, because the multiple visual content are captured by multiple image sensors of a single image capture device (e.g., the image sensors <b>606</b>A, <b>606</b>B of the image capture device <b>602</b>), the multiple visual content may already be time-synchronized and there may not be any need to synchronize timing of the multiple visual content. For example, the image capture device <b>602</b> may capture one set of images/video frames using the image sensor A <b>606</b>A and another set of images/video frames using the image sensors B <b>606</b>B. The two sets of images/video frames may be captured during the same capture duration and may be associated with same capture times. Thus, the two sets of images/video frames are already time-synchronized, and the two sets of images/video frames may provide two feeds of visual content that are time-synchronized with each other.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In some implementations, portions of multiple visual content may be spatially arranged within the non-spherical visual content for simultaneous presentation.

For example, front and back images/video frames captured by a single spherical image capture device (e.g., 360-degree camera) may be combined into non-spherical visual content. For instance, the front-facing image sensor and the front-facing optical element may be used to capture a center-weighted, stabilized, standard front image (e.g., <b>1080</b>P, <b>1440</b>P, other resolution). The front image may include visual content captured through the entire field of view of the front-facing optical element or the visual content capture through a portion of the field of view of the front-facing optical element. The front image may be displayed on a display screen of the image capture device, which may allow the user to frame the front-shot as if a non-spherical image capture device were being used.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Multiple visual content captured by the spherical image capture device may be processed individually. Additionally, multiple visual content captured by the spherical image capture device may be provided for presentation and/or generation of non-spherical visual content without stitching, thereby requiring consumption of less resource than when the spherical image capture device is used to capture and generate spherical visual content.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The back-facing image sensor and the back-facing optical element may be used to capture a back image including a depiction of the user. The back image may include visual content captured through the entire field of view of the back-facing optical element or the visual content capture through a portion of the field of view of the back-facing optical element. For example, the back image may include the visual content captured through a portion of the field of view that includes the user. Face and/or person tracking may be used to determine how the user is depicted within the back image (user framing). User framing may be maintained within the back image regardless of how the image capture device is being held by the user. That is, the portion of the visual content included in the back image may be determined to include a particular shot of the user. Such a generation of back image may provide an automatic selfie image of the user. Thus, a user would not have to manually position themselves for a selfie-shot and may concentrate on composing the shot for the front image. The back image may be placed in a picture-in-picture arrangement with the front picture, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The arrangement of visual content within a presentation may be changed. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, the visual content included within the outer picture area and the inner picture area may be changed. For example, a user may interact with one or more options presented on a user interface to manually set which visual content (which image/video feed) is presented in the different positions. The placement of the visual content may depend on inclusion of depiction of interest within the visual content. For example, based on a depiction of interest occurring within the visual content A <b>902</b>, the presentation of inner and outer picture areas may be changed so that depiction of interest is presented within the outer (larger) picture area. The placement of the visual content may depend on audio associated with the visual content. For example, based on audio recorded with the visual content indicating that a depiction of interest is occurring within the visual content A <b>902</b>, presentation of inner and outer picture areas may be changed so that depiction of interest is presented within the outer (larger) picture area.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">As another example, the extent of area taken up by the inner picture area and/or the outer picture may change. For example, the size and/or the shape of the inner picture area may change based on the depiction of interest within the visual content A <b>902</b>. For instance, based on the visual content A <b>902</b> including a depiction of interest (e.g., the inner picture area showing a depiction of interest or about to show a depiction of interest), the size of the inner picture area may be increased. Based on a depiction of interest within the visual content A <b>902</b> spanning a large lateral area (compared to the vertical area of the depiction of interest), the shape of the inner picture area may be changed to accommodate the large lateral area. For instance, the shape of the inner picture area may change from a square to a rectangle, such as the left side of the square moving to the left to extend the width of the rectangle.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In some implementations, different visual content may capture content of different types. For example, visual content captured by front-facing image sensor may include primary content while visual content captured back-facing image sensor may include supplemental content. Primary content may refer to content of greater importance than supplemental content. Primary content may include content that is directly relevant to the subject of visual content capture. Supplemental content may refer to content of less importance than primary content. Supplemental content may include content that is indirectly relevant to the subject of visual content capture. Supplemental content may enhance the primary content.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">For example, the image capture device may be used to capture visual content of an activity. Primary content may include depiction of the activity, and supplemental content may include depiction of things related to and/or associated with the activity. For instance, the activity may include a sporting activity, and the primary content may include depiction of players engaged in the sporting activity while the supplemental content may include depiction of crowds at the sporting activity.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The primary content and the supplemental content may be used to generate non-spherical visual content. The non-spherical visual content may be a video edit of the visual content. A video edit may refer to an arrangement and/or manipulation of one or more portions of visual content for playback. A video edit may define which portions of the visual content are included for playback and the order in which the portions are to be presented on playback. For example, referring to the example of the sporting activity, a video edit generated from the primary content and the supplemental content may include video footage/images of the players of the sporting activity (primary content) and video footage/images of the spectators of the activity (supplemental content). The supplemental content may be superimposed into the primary content, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, and/or presented with the primary content, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In some implementations, one of the primary content and/or the supplemental content may be used to identify when other content should be combined within the non-spherical visual content. The primary content may be used to identify supplemental content for integration within the non-spherical visual content (e.g., video edit). For example, a depiction of interest within the primary content may be used to identify the corresponding supplemental content. For instance, a depiction of interest within the primary content may include a spectacular move by a player during a sporting event. The moment and/or the location in which the spectacular move occur within the primary content may be used to identify the moment and/or the location of the corresponding reaction from the crowd within the supplemental content for inclusion in the non-spherical visual content.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The supplemental content may be used to identify primary content for inclusion in the non-spherical visual content (e.g., video edit). For example, the presence/occurring of depiction of interest (a moment of interest) within the primary content may be identified based on analysis of the supplemental content. For instance, an interesting event may be determined to happen within the activity captured in the primary content based on reactions of crowd captured in the supplemental content. The supplemental content may be used to edit and/or trim the primary content into the non-spherical visual content. For example, a &#x201c;best&#x201d; scenes video edit may be generated from a five-minute footage of primary content by editing/trimming down footage of the primary content to a thirty-second video edit. The footage of primary content may be edited/trimmed based on reactions (e.g., cheering, positive, cool reactions) found in the supplemental content.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In some implementations, portions of multiple visual content may be temporally arranged within the non-spherical visual content for sequential presentation. For example, images/video frames and/or portions of images/video frames captured by different image sensors may be arranged in a sequence so that they are presented in a particular order.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>C and <b>9</b>D</figref> illustrate example timing arrangements of visual content. In the timing arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, visual content A <b>922</b> may be presented first in the non-spherical visual content. Visual content B <b>924</b> may be presented after the presentation of the visual content A <b>922</b>. In the timing arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref>, a portion of visual content A <b>922</b> may be presented first in the non-spherical visual content. Visual content B <b>924</b> may be presented after the presentation of the portion of the visual content A <b>922</b>. Another portion of the visual content A <b>922</b> may be presented after the presentation of the visual content B <b>934</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In some implementations, portions of multiple visual content may be temporally arranged for sequential presentation based on audio associated with one or both of the visual content. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref>, based on audio recorded with the visual content A <b>933</b> indicating that a depiction of interest is occurring within the visual content B <b>934</b>, presentation of the visual content A <b>932</b> may change to the presentation of the visual content B <b>934</b>. When the depiction of interest is over, the presentation may change back to the visual content A <b>932</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In some implementations, portions of the multiple visual content may be temporally arranged for sequential presentation based on identification of one or more depictions of interest within the portions of the multiple visual content. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, a depiction of interest may be identified within the visual content A <b>922</b> and another depiction of interest may be identified within the visual content B <b>924</b>. The depiction of interest within the visual content A <b>922</b> may occur earlier than the depiction of interest within the visual content B <b>924</b>. Based on the sequence of occurrence of depictions of interest, the portions of multiple visual content may be temporally arranged for sequential presentation as such in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, such that the visual content A <b>922</b> is presented first to include the presentation of the depiction of interest within the visual content A <b>922</b>, and the visual content B <b>924</b> is presented second to include the presentation of the depiction of interest within the visual content B <b>924</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In some implementations, a sequential presentation of portions of multiple visual content may include a panning transition from a depiction of interest within one visual content to a depiction of interest within another visual content. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref> illustrates an example panning between depictions of interest. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>, a portion of visual content A <b>942</b> may include a depiction of interest A <b>952</b>, and a portion of visual content B <b>944</b> may include a depiction of interest B <b>964</b>. A sequence presentation of the portions of the visual content A <b>942</b> and the visual content B <b>944</b> may include a presentation of the depiction of interest A <b>952</b> followed by a presentation of the depiction of interest B <b>954</b>. The presentation of the depiction of interest A <b>952</b> may change to the presentation of the depiction of interest B <b>954</b> by using a panning <b>956</b>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The panning <b>956</b> may include a viewing window (punch-out) of the visual content moving from being centered on the depiction of interest A <b>952</b> to being centered on the depiction of interest B <b>954</b>. While the viewing window (punch-out) is entirely within the visual content A <b>942</b> or the visual content B <b>944</b>, the presentation of the corresponding portion of the visual content <b>942</b>, <b>944</b> do not require stitching of the visual content <b>942</b>, <b>944</b>. When the viewing window (punch-out) includes both the visual content A <b>942</b> and the visual content B <b>944</b> (the viewing window/punch-out is moving across the boundary of the visual content A <b>942</b> and the visual content B <b>944</b>), the visual content <b>942</b>, <b>944</b> (or portions of the visual content <b>942</b>, <b>944</b> within the viewing window/punch-out) may need to be stitched. Limiting stitching of the visual content <b>942</b>, <b>944</b> to those instances in which portions of both visual content <b>942</b>, <b>944</b> are being presented may provide for resource savings (e.g., computing power, time, memory, power consumption) compared to stitching visual content <b>942</b>, <b>944</b> for the entire duration of the presentation.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In some implementations, stitching of the visual content <b>942</b>, <b>944</b> may be further limited based on the speed of the panning <b>956</b> and/or the types of depictions within the visual content <b>942</b>, <b>944</b>. For example, if the panning <b>956</b> is performed at high speed, then lower quality stitching may be performed for the visual content <b>942</b>, <b>944</b> than if the panning <b>956</b> is performed at low speed. As another example, if the depictions of the visual content <b>942</b>, <b>944</b> at the boundary across which the viewing window/punch-out moves includes non-distinctive features (e.g., sky, ocean, sand), lower quality stitching may be performed while if the depictions of the visual content <b>942</b>, <b>944</b> at the boundary across which the viewing window/punch-out moves includes distinctive features (e.g., face, persons), higher quality stitching may be performed.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Non-spherical visual content may be generated as encoded visual content and/or instructions for rendering visual content. For example, non-spherical visual content including multiple portions of visual content captured by different image sensors may be encoded for streaming and/or playback. As another example, non-spherical visual content including multiple portions of visual content captured by different image sensors may be stored as instructions that identify which portions of the visual content should be presented and the order in which the portions are to be presented. For example, different visual content captured by different image sensors may be stored separately, and the instructions may be used to render the presentation of non-spherical visual content from the separately stored visual content. Such generation of non-spherical visual content may enable later alteration of the non-spherical visual content from the separately stored visual content.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The switch component <b>106</b> may be configured to switch the operation of the image capture device between the spherical capture mode and the non-spherical capture mode. Thus, the image capture device may be used to create both spherical visual content and non-spherical visual content, depending on the mode in which it is operating. The switch component <b>106</b> may switch the operation of the image capture device between different modes manually and/or automatically. For instance, the switch component <b>106</b> may manually switch the operation of the image capture device between different modes based on reception of input(s) from a user to switch between different modes.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The switch component <b>106</b> may automatically switch the operation of the image capture device between different modes based on detection of conditions for which operation under one of the modes is desirable. For example, the switch component <b>106</b> may manually switch the operation of the image capture device between different modes based on visual information of one or more of the image sensors <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B. For instance, the visual information of one or more of the image sensors <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B may be analyzed to determine whether the image capture device should operate in the spherical capture mode, the non-spherical capture mode, and/or other modes, or to change from one mode to another. For example, an image generated through the image sensor B <b>15</b>B may be dark/black (e.g., based on the optical element B <b>14</b>B being covered) and the switch component <b>106</b> may switch the operation of the image capture device to non-spherical capture mode and/or operate the image capture device in the non-spherical capture mode to capture reduced visual content using the optical element A <b>14</b>A and the image sensor A <b>15</b>A.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Such setting of operation mode for the image capture device may enable a user to change between spherical capture mode and non-spherical capture mode by simply uncovering/covering one of the optical elements <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B, rather than by manually setting the operation of the image capture device in a particular mode by interacting with interfaces (e.g., physical/virtual buttons) of the image capture device.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">As another example, visual information of the image sensors <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B may be compared to determine whether similar or different depiction of things are being captured within the visual content. For instance, based on the image sensors <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B being used to capture similar visual content (e.g., depiction of an activity, depiction of a scenery), the switch component <b>106</b> may switch the operation of the image capture device to spherical capture mode and/or operate the image capture device in the spherical capture mode to capture spherical visual content using the optical elements <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B and the image sensors <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B. Based on the image sensors <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B being used to capture different visual content (e.g., depiction of a particular person (user of the image capture device) in one visual content, depiction of other thing in the other visual content), the switch component <b>106</b> may switch the operation of the image capture device to non-spherical capture mode and/or operate the image capture device in the non-spherical capture mode.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Such setting of operation mode for the image capture device may enable a user to change between spherical capture mode and non-spherical capture mode based on the context in which the image capture device is used. For example, the image capture device being held/carried by a user may result in the image capture device operating in the non-spherical capture mode to provide a selfie and third-person views of the captured content, while the image capture device being placed in the middle of an activity may result in the image capture device operating in the spherical capture mode to provide a spherical video of the activity. Other conditions for switching the operation of the image capture device between the spherical capture mode and the non-spherical capture mode are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Implementations of the disclosure may be made in hardware, firmware, software, or any suitable combination thereof.
