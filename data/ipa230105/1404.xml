The disclosed device provides improved sample volume control, reduces potential contamination in the working environment, and improves safety for healthcare workers.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the healthcare arena, it is often necessary to collect a biological sample, and demand is increasing for easier collection methods to be used at the point of care or at the subject's home. In some instances, the sample is mixed with buffer and tested directly. In other instances, these may need to be transported to a testing environment. In most cases, it can be necessary to provide a controlled release of the collected sample onto a target device or other testing substrate. Some examples use dropper devices that are intended to be squeezed and allocate the sample, drop-by-drop, out of a nozzle or outlet. Such dropper devices can cause more than one drop to exit at a time, creating a flooding situation of the target device or other testing substrate. Drops of sample can also cause contamination and safety concerns if they are released accidentally or if the target is missed, and these risks increase with inexperienced, non-clinical users outside of traditional lab environments. Accordingly, improved sample preparation devices are desirable.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a squeezable sample device that functions as a biological sample preparation device. The device has a liquid tube that delivers a collected liquid sample contained in the compartment through a filter and then into a porous wick for capillary delivery to a target device or other testing substrate. The porous wick may be secured to the liquid tube via a tip assembly that secures the filter and porous wick in place. The tip assembly may define a liquid flow channel therethrough, with two openings (one opening end of the tip assembly secures to the liquid tube and the other opening end secures/attaches a porous wick). The tip assembly may also have at least one filter positioned in the liquid flow channel, which can help filter out any particulates from the biological sample before it is absorbed into the porous wick. The liquid tube generally has an upper opening that receives the tip assembly.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one example, there is provided a sample preparation device, comprising: a liquid tube; and a tip assembly cooperable with the liquid tube, the tip assembly supporting a filter and a porous wick, wherein the porous wick is secured at a tip end opening of the tip assembly, and at least one air vent channel positioned along sides of the porous wick.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In any of the above or subsequent examples, the device may further comprise an air gap between the filter and the porous wick.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In any of the above or subsequent examples, the filter may comprise sintered porous plastics, glass fibers, cellulose filters, synthetic fibers, reverse phase porous membrane, or any combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In any of the above or subsequent examples, the porous wick may comprise sintered porous media, bonded porous fiber media, open cell foams, or any combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In any of the above or subsequent examples, the tip body of the device may have at least one air vent channel which may comprise three equidistant vent channels.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In any of the above or subsequent examples, the liquid tube and the tip assembly cooperate via threaded connection, snap fit connection, or friction fit connection.

The device <b>10</b> is made up of a squeezable liquid tube <b>12</b> and a tip assembly <b>14</b>. The tip assembly <b>14</b> is made up of a tip body <b>54</b> which supports a filter <b>16</b> and a porous wick <b>18</b>. The tip assembly <b>14</b> also defines an air gap <b>20</b> between the filter <b>16</b> and the wick <b>18</b> and at least one air vent channel <b>22</b>. As described in more detail below, it is also possible to provide a cap <b>50</b> that fits over the tip assembly <b>14</b> in order to protect the porous wick <b>18</b> during shipping, prevent drying out of the components and/or the collected sample, and to assist end-user placement of the tip assembly <b>14</b> onto the liquid tube <b>12</b> after sample collection without damaging the porous wick <b>18</b>.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Liquid Tube</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0038">Exemplary liquid tubes are illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>11</b>, and <b>12</b></figref>. The liquid tube <b>12</b> is generally sized and configured to contain a biological sample. The liquid tube <b>12</b> may also contain any other type of liquid necessary for testing, including but not limited to a buffer, an aqueous solution, an organic solution, any other appropriate solution, or any combination thereof. The liquid tube <b>12</b> may be provided with one open end <b>24</b> and one closed end <b>26</b>. The open end <b>24</b> receives the open end <b>34</b> of tip assembly <b>14</b>. In one example, one or more threads may be positioned around the open end <b>24</b> which can receive corresponding threads of the tip assembly <b>14</b>. Alternatively, it is possible for the tip assembly <b>14</b> to snap fit onto the open end <b>24</b> of the liquid tube <b>12</b>. Alternatively, it is possible for the tip assembly <b>14</b> to friction fit onto the open end <b>24</b> of the liquid tube <b>12</b>. Side walls <b>30</b> of the liquid tube <b>12</b> may be flexible, such that a user can squeeze the side walls <b>30</b> and force solution contained within the liquid tube out through the open end <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0039">These liquid tube <b>12</b> may be provided pre-sealed (e.g., with a foil seal or other type of sealing mechanism <b>42</b>) with solution <b>28</b>, such as a buffer solution, dilution solution, a reagent solution or any other appropriate biological sample preservation solution. Examples of pre-sealed tubes are illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>. In other embodiments, the practitioner may mix a biological sample with buffer and that entire solution may be inserted into the liquid tube.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0040">In some examples, the liquid tube <b>12</b> may have one or more volume marks (not shown) along its side walls <b>30</b>, indicating to a user how much sample has been collected (or needs to be collected). In some embodiments, the liquid tube <b>12</b> may be provided with a venting hole in the closed end containing a one-way valve to allow the tube to re-fill with outside pressure after compressing, and/or a hydrophobic venting design allowing pressure equalization but not solution egress. It is possible for the liquid tube <b>12</b> to have one or more ribs <b>32</b> along either an interior surface and/or along an exterior surface in order to prevent nesting of empty tubes before their use, which would hinder automated sorting into assembly equipment.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Tip Assembly</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref> illustrate one embodiment of an exemplary tip assembly <b>14</b>. This embodiment includes a single air vent channel <b>22</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>11</b></figref> illustrate an alternate embodiment of an exemplary tip assembly <b>14</b>. This embodiment includes three air vent channels <b>22</b> and a covering cap <b>50</b>. The tip body <b>54</b> of the tip assembly <b>14</b> is shown as having two ends. A first open end <b>34</b> is configured to cooperate with the open end <b>24</b> of the buffer compartment <b>12</b>. This cooperation may be via a threaded connection, via a snap fit connection, via a friction fit connection, or any other appropriate connection. A second tip end <b>36</b> supports a porous wick <b>18</b>. The porous wick <b>18</b> is generally press fit snugly into opening <b>38</b> at second tip end <b>36</b>. It should be understood however, that other securement options between the porous wick <b>18</b> and the tip body <b>54</b> are possible and considered within the scope of this disclosure. For example, a ribbed/slot groove option may be used, or any other appropriate connection. The connection end of the wick <b>18</b> is generally shaped to correspond to the opening shape <b>38</b>. This may be a circular shape, a flat shape, a wedge shape, an angular shape, or any other appropriate shape option.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0042">Further features of the porous wick <b>18</b>, including various wick shapes and cross section options, are described in more detail below, but in general, the porous wick <b>18</b> is provided in order to control the liquid delivery flow, speed, and volume. The tip assembly <b>14</b> may also contain a filter <b>16</b>, features of which are also described in more detail below. In general, the filter <b>16</b> is provided in order to filter any particulates from the sample solution before it moves to and into the porous wick <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0043">In one specific embodiment, the tip assembly <b>14</b> comprises at least one air vent channel <b>22</b> along the side of the porous wick <b>18</b>. This is illustrated by the top plan view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In an alternate embodiment, the tip assembly comprises more than one air vent channel <b>22</b> along the side of the porous wick <b>18</b>. This is illustrated by the top plan view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows three air vent channels <b>22</b>, but it should be understood that fewer or more channels <b>22</b> may be used, depending upon the size of the device, the viscosity of the sample, or other parameters. After the squeezing action, the air vent channel(s) <b>22</b> allows return air to pass around the porous wick <b>18</b> and reach the liquid tube <b>12</b>, while the porous wick <b>18</b> remains saturated with liquid. The location of the air vent channel(s) <b>22</b> along only the porous wick section <b>18</b> as shown prohibits bypass of the filter(s) <b>16</b> during squeezing pressurization. Squeezing the liquid tube <b>12</b> after attaching a tip assembly <b>14</b> and inverting creates pressure and pushes the sample through the filter and across air gap <b>20</b> to saturate the porous wick <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0044">It is possible for the air vent channel(s) <b>22</b> to have a circular or semicircular shape. It is possible for the air vent channel <b>22</b> to have a leaf-like or lobed shape as shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. This version has been found useful because if one of the vents becomes occluded with fluid or is otherwise inoperable, there is still an air path available. It is possible for the air vent channel(s) <b>22</b> to be equally spaced around the porous wick <b>18</b> as shown. In alternate embodiments, they may be unevenly spaced. The general goal of the air vent channel(s) <b>22</b> is to provide a way to release pressure from the liquid tube and enable incoming/return air to flow around the porous wick <b>18</b> without fluid flowing back in to the liquid tube from the saturated porous wick <b>18</b>. This allows the user to handle the device after wick saturation without applying constant pressure.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Filter</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0045">The tip body <b>54</b> of tip assembly <b>14</b> also supports a filter <b>16</b>. The filter <b>16</b> is generally a porous material that can help remove particulates from the collected biological sample. Exemplary filters that may be used in connection with this disclosure include but are not limited to sintered porous plastics, glass fibers, cellulose filters, synthetic fibers, reverse phase porous membrane, or any combinations thereof. In a specific example, the filter <b>16</b> is a bonded nonwoven fiber material. The filter <b>16</b> may generally function as a traditional filter, removing particles that may be contained in the solution in the liquid tube and preventing them from passing into the porous wick <b>18</b>. The filter may function as affinity filters to remove interference materials for the down-stream assays. The interference materials could be, but are not be limited to, colorants, cells, polysaccharides, lipids, DNA or RNA fragments or proteins, or any combinations thereof. The filter may be received at the open end <b>34</b> of the tip assembly <b>14</b>. In a specific example, the filter is shaped as a disc. The filter <b>16</b> may be friction fit into place, fit into a groove, or positioned via any other securement method.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Porous Wick</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0046">The tip assembly <b>14</b> also supports a porous wick <b>18</b>. Exemplary porous wicks that may be used in connection with the present disclosure include but are not limited to sintered porous media, bonded porous fiber media, open cell foams, or any combinations thereof. In a specific example, the porous wick <b>18</b> is a bonded nonwoven fiber material. Sintered porous media could be the sintered porous media described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,141,717; porous fiber wicks could be the porous fiber media described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,101,181; 6,840,692; and/or 7,729,668. Open cell foams could be polyurethane foams. Any combinations of these materials or other appropriate materials are possible. It is also possible to provide a device with a plurality of different types of porous wicks. For example, the squeezable sample preparation device may be provided as a kit with different wick options for the practitioner to consider based on factors such as sample type and quantity.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0047">The porous wick may have any appropriate cross-sectional shape. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> illustrates various non-limiting options for the wick cross-section. As shown, the wick cross section may be circular, oval, square, rectangular, triangular, star-shaped, pentagon-shaped, hexagonal, or have any other appropriate number of sides or perimeter shapes. If the wick's cross-section is circular, the vents can be part of the molded tip body <b>54</b> structure, such that the tip open end <b>38</b> has a tri-lobed shape, as illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. If the wick's cross-sectional shape is not circular, the tip open end <b>38</b> may be formed as circular, and venting channels <b>22</b> may be formed between the wick <b>18</b> and the tip body <b>54</b>. The general goal is to allow venting between the liquid tube <b>12</b> and the porous wick <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> illustrates various non-limiting options for the wick longitudinal shape. As shown, the wick may be rod-shaped with a blunt end. Alternatively, the wick may have an angular cut at its end. This angled shape may help ease usage for the user. It should also be understood that is possible for the wick to have a rounded end (not shown) or any other appropriate end shape.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0049">The porous wicks in present disclosure may optionally further comprise a color changing indicating zone <b>56</b>. The color changing zone <b>56</b> may be used to indicate sufficiency of liquid amount. The wick may incorporate color-changing properties described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,187,534 and/or 9,330,580.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0050">In one arrangement, the porous wick <b>18</b> may be in physical and direct contact with the filter <b>16</b> in the tip assembly. Alternatively, the wick <b>18</b> and filter <b>16</b> may be separated by a spacer or have a designed air gap <b>20</b>. The spacer or gap can prevent the back flow of liquid from the wick <b>18</b> to the filter <b>16</b> by capillary draw or from any vacuum created when squeezing action stops, the flexible side walls <b>30</b> decompress, and or the liquid tube <b>12</b> repressurizes. This air gap <b>20</b> can work in tandem with the air venting channel <b>22</b>. In one specific example, they tip assembly <b>14</b> may be provided with one or more ledges on which the porous wick <b>18</b> will sit/fit in order to preserve an air gap <b>20</b> therebetween.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0051">As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b></figref>, it is also possible to provide a cover cap <b>50</b> to protect the wick <b>18</b>. In the example shown, the cap <b>50</b> is provided with a knurled surface <b>52</b> which can help the practitioner remove the cap <b>50</b> and expose the porous wick <b>18</b>. The cap <b>50</b> may fit over the tip body <b>54</b> via a threaded connection, a snap fit connection, via a friction fit connection, or any other appropriate securement system.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Sample Options</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0052">The disclosed device <b>10</b> could be used for both solid and liquid samples, as long as the targeted materials are soluble in the liquid solution contained or provided in the liquid tube. This device is particularly suitable for biological samples, such as blood, saliva, nasal, urea or stool which may contain infective materials, such as viruses or bacteria.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Method of Use</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0053">In use of the device <b>10</b>, a biological sample will be collected in the liquid tube <b>12</b>. It is generally envisioned that the liquid tube <b>12</b> will be provided with buffer, reagent, or some other type of solution contained therein, which is intended to be mixed with the collected sample. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand various types of buffers or solutions that may be used in connection with this disclosure. The tip assembly <b>14</b> is then assembled onto the liquid tube <b>12</b>. At this point, it is possible to shake the device in order to mix the sample and buffer together. The sides of the liquid tube may be squeezed in order to dispense solution out through the filter <b>16</b> and into the porous wick <b>18</b> of the tip assembly <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054">The present disclosure also provides a method of delivering a liquid sample to a target device comprising the process of squeezing the liquid tube, pushing the collected sample/liquid/buffer solution in the liquid tube through the filter(s) <b>16</b>, saturating the porous wick <b>18</b> with the liquid from the liquid tube, and applying the liquid in the porous wick to a down-stream analysis device via capillary draw. In use, a practitioner may remove the tip assembly <b>14</b> and put a biological sample into the liquid tube. If the liquid tube <b>12</b> is provided with a buffer or other reagent solution, the sealing mechanism <b>42</b> would be removed and sample added, causing the sample to dissolve and transfer analytes from the collected sample into the liquid contained in the liquid tube <b>12</b>. In an alternate embodiment, the practitioner may have already mixed the biological sample with a solution and may pour the entire sample/buffer solution mix into the liquid tube <b>12</b>. The tip assembly <b>14</b> may be already placed over the liquid tube <b>12</b> when initially provided to the user, or the two may be provided as separate components to combine in final use. Presence of the filter <b>16</b> can help filter out any solid particles that may be present in the biological sample. Then, pressure from the liquid tube forces the sample through the filter <b>16</b> and into and through the porous wick <b>18</b>. The practitioner may deliver a sample from the saturated wick <b>18</b> by direct physical contact and capillary draw onto the assay, sample receptacle area, or whatever end product is being used to further test the sample. Presence of the porous wick <b>18</b> allows for direct delivery of sample by an unbroken fluid path rather than by dropping sample through the air. Sample volume and delivery speed are controlled by the porosity characteristics of the wick and the receiving component.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0055">In currently available products, there is not a wick provided, instead, practitioner simply squeezes the sample out through a tip as droplets. However, this can cause liquid to come out too quickly, preventing an appropriate sample size from being delivered. Also, drops can miss the targeted receptacle due to user error and can require high dexterity, resulting in possible contamination and safety risks from potentially hazardous biological samples. Additionally or alternatively, when pressure is released from the liquid tube, this can cause the sample to be sucked back into the prior art devices. By contrast, providing the porous wick <b>18</b> of the present disclosure combined with the air gap <b>20</b> and air vent channels <b>22</b> helps to hold the liquid and prevent it from leaking or shooting out, or otherwise exiting the liquid tube too quickly. It also prevents the sample and/or air from being suctioned backed into the device <b>10</b> when pressure is released.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0056">Use of the disclosed porous wicks <b>18</b> with device <b>10</b> can help prevent liquid sample spillage caused by over-squeezing the liquid tube. The porous wicks <b>18</b> can also provide an easy operation for the operators with different physical strength or dexterity and provide more consistent results. The device design controls sample delivery rate and quantity and does not require the user to physically observe and control any instructed quantity of sample droplets which are difficult to create and see.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">One-Way Valve</heading><p id="p-0053" num="0057">Another embodiment of present disclosure provides a biological sample preparation device that further includes a one-way valve in the middle of the liquid flow channel in the tip assembly. As described above, the tip assembly <b>14</b> can comprise an air vent channel <b>22</b>, which allows the air to pass around the porous wick <b>18</b> and into the liquid tube after the squeezing action. Use of a one-way valve may help manage a biological sample that has particulates or solids contained therein. The one-way valve may be an elastic component, a disk, or any other appropriate configuration. Exemplary options are illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. It may have a concave surface on one side and a convex surface on the other side. It may have a cross (or other cut out shape) that allows fluid to move in one direction when there is a pressure drop in one direction, but not in the opposite direction. The concave surface typically faces the closed end of the liquid tube and the convex surface faces the wick. Liquid can only flow from the concave to the convex direction when a pressure is applied. When using the one-way mechanical valve, the porous wick may function both as the filter and the wick by delivering the liquid and removing the solid composition in the liquid samples. Using a one-way valve also allows for the device to not include a filter, and still allow shaking of the sample for mixing after the tip assembly is attached to the liquid tube containing sample.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0058">The present disclosure also provides a method of delivering a liquid sample to the target device comprising the process of squeezing the compartment, pushing the liquid in the squeezing compartment through the one-way valve, saturating the porous wick with the liquid in the liquid tube and applying the liquid in the porous wick to a down-stream analysis device.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0059">The subject matter of certain embodiments of this disclosure is described with specificity to meet statutory requirements, but this description is not necessarily intended to limit the scope of the claims.
