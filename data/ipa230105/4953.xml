A digital wallet permits transactions between two entities by exchanging digital currency for goods and services. Funds may be deposited into a digital wallet using a payment instrument (e.g., a credit card, cash). In some examples, a digital wallet may be linked to a user's bank account. The digital wallet is capable of storing any amount of value. The amount of value can correspond to currency or points that may be redeemed or exchanged for currency, goods, or services.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some examples, an individual may initiate a transaction for a subscription service. The subscription service provides the user with a series of medical treatments over a period of time. The individual may use a digital wallet system to generate a digital wallet for payment of the subscription service. The individual may use their credit card to periodically deposit funds from their credit card (or any other payment instrument) to a wallet item within the digital wallet. The digital wallet system generates the wallet item and designates it for payment of the subscription service. An individual may have multiple wallet items within their digital wallet. Some wallet items may be designated for a specific use, and some may not have any specific designation.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Once an individual processes a transaction for their subscription service (e.g., when the individual receives a medical treatment from the subscription service), the digital wallet system transfers funds from the digital wallet to the subscription service provider. The funds may be transferred exclusively from one wallet item that is designated for payment of the subscription service, or a combination of wallet items. Once the funds from any particular wallet item are exhausted, the digital wallet system removes the wallet item from the digital wallet.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some examples, an individual may wish to request a refund of one or more previously processed transactions. The digital wallet system validates the refund request based on a set of transaction rules that determine whether the individual qualifies for a refund and transfers funds back to the individual's digital wallet. For example, the digital wallet system may generate an additional wallet item that stores the refunded amount of value. Further details of the digital wallet system are described below.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The digital wallet system improves functionality of a computer system by efficiently storing and tracking transaction data. For example, a wallet item may be generated by the digital wallet system that is designated for a specific use. Wallet items may be deleted once funds associated with the wallet item are deleted. The digital wallet system is thus an improvement over traditional physical wallets because it allows a user to efficiently track and compartmentalize storage of transaction data associated with various subscription items without requiring multiple different physical payment instruments.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram showing an example point of sale system for conducting transactions over a network. The point-of-sale system includes multiple instances of a client device <b>104</b>, each of which hosts a number of applications, including a digital wallet client <b>120</b> and other applications <b>122</b>. Each digital wallet client <b>120</b> is communicatively coupled to other instances of the digital wallet client <b>120</b> (e.g., hosted on respective other client devices <b>104</b>), a point-of-sale server system <b>102</b> and third-party servers <b>106</b> via a network <b>108</b> (e.g., the Internet). A digital wallet client <b>120</b> can also communicate with locally-hosted applications <b>122</b> using Applications Program Interfaces (APIs).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A digital wallet client <b>120</b> is able to communicate and exchange data with other digital wallet client <b>120</b> and with the point-of-sale server system <b>102</b> via the network <b>108</b>. The data exchanged between digital wallet clients <b>120</b>, and between a digital wallet client <b>120</b> and the point-of-sale server system <b>102</b>, includes functions (e.g., commands to invoke functions) as well as payload data (e.g., sensitive data items, text, multimedia data, or transaction data).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The point-of-sale server system <b>102</b> provides server-side functionality via the network <b>108</b> to a particular digital wallet client <b>120</b>. While certain functions of the point-of-sale system are described herein as being performed by either a digital wallet client <b>120</b> or by the point of sale server system <b>102</b>, the location of certain functionality either within the digital wallet client <b>120</b> or the point of sale server system <b>102</b> may be a design choice. For example, it may be technically preferable to initially deploy certain technology and functionality within the point-of-sale server system <b>102</b> but to later migrate this technology and functionality to the digital wallet client <b>120</b> where a client device <b>104</b> has sufficient processing capacity.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The point-of-sale server system <b>102</b> supports various services and operations that are provided to the digital wallet client <b>120</b>. Such operations include transmitting data to, receiving data from, and processing data generated by the digital wallet client <b>120</b>. This data may include transaction data, user data, subscription data and provider data, as examples. Data exchanges within the point-of-sale server system <b>102</b> are invoked and controlled through functions available via user interfaces (UIs) of the digital wallet client <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Turning now specifically to the point-of-sale server system <b>102</b>, an Application Program Interface (API) server <b>110</b> is coupled to, and provides a programmatic interface to, application servers <b>114</b>. The application servers <b>114</b> are communicatively coupled to a database server <b>124</b>, which facilitates access to a database <b>126</b> that stores data associated with the transactions processed by the application servers <b>114</b>. Similarly, a web server <b>112</b> is coupled to the application servers <b>114</b> and provides web-based interfaces to the application servers <b>114</b>. To this end, the web server <b>112</b> processes incoming network requests over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and several other related protocols.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The API server <b>110</b> receives and transmits transaction data (e.g., commands and transaction data) between the client device <b>104</b> and the application servers <b>114</b>. Specifically, the API server <b>110</b> provides a set of interfaces (e.g., routines and protocols) that can be called or queried by the digital wallet client <b>120</b> in order to invoke functionality of the application servers <b>114</b>. The API server <b>110</b> exposes various functions supported by the application servers <b>114</b>, including account registration, subscription creations and management, the processing of transactions, via the application servers <b>114</b>, from a particular digital wallet client <b>120</b> to another digital wallet client <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The application servers <b>114</b> host a number of server applications and subsystems, including for example a subscription server <b>116</b>, and a digital wallet server <b>118</b>. The subscription server <b>116</b> implements functionalities for creating and managing subscriptions between multiple client devices <b>104</b>. The digital wallet server <b>118</b> provides functionalities for creating a digital wallet and managing funds associated with the digital wallet. Further details regarding the digital wallet server <b>118</b> are provided below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of a digital wallet server <b>118</b>, according to some example embodiments. The digital wallet server <b>118</b> is shown to include a wallet creation subsystem <b>202</b>, a wallet funding subsystem <b>204</b>, a user interface (UI) module <b>206</b> and a wallet transaction ledger <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The wallet creation subsystem <b>202</b> facilitates the creation of a digital wallet. In some embodiments, the wallet creation subsystem <b>202</b> creates a digital wallet based on an indication received from the subscription server <b>116</b>. The wallet creation subsystem <b>202</b> generates wallet items for inclusion into the digital wallet. The wallet items are associated with payment instruments for one or more goods or services.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The wallet funding subsystem <b>204</b> facilitates management of funds being deposited and removed from the digital wallet. The wallet funding subsystem <b>204</b> receives sensitive data from a client device <b>104</b>. The sensitive data includes payment information (e.g., bank account numbers, credit card numbers, online payment account information, amount of value, etc.) associated with one or more goods or services purchased by a user. The wallet funding subsystem <b>204</b> associates the received sensitive data with one or more wallet items created by the wallet creation subsystem <b>202</b>. The wallet funding subsystem <b>204</b> withdraws funds from the digital wallet in response to one or more requests from the point-of-sale server system <b>102</b>. The requests may be in the form of an API request (e.g., by an API server <b>110</b>), an HTTP request (via the network <b>108</b>) or any suitable computer request protocol. The wallet funding subsystem <b>204</b> processes the requests by causing a transfer of funds from the digital wallet to an external entity (e.g., a third-party bank account located at one or more third-party servers <b>106</b>).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The wallet funding subsystem <b>204</b> stores information about the funds being deposited and removed from the digital wallet into a database <b>126</b>. In some examples, the database <b>126</b> is a wallet transaction ledger <b>208</b>. The wallet transaction ledger <b>208</b> monitors the creation and removal of wallet items from the digital wallet. The wallet transaction ledger <b>208</b> further monitors the designation associated with each wallet item and an associated subscription service.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A user may access and manage a digital wallet using a UI Module <b>206</b>. The UI Module <b>206</b> causes presentation of a virtual representation of the digital wallet on a client device <b>104</b>. The UI Module <b>206</b> further includes selectable user interface elements (e.g., buttons, check boxes, scrollbar, text boxes, etc.) that are used to create a digital wallet, create a wallet item, add funds to the digital wallet, and remove funds from the digital wallet.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Although the described flow diagram below can show operations as a sequential process, many of the operations can be performed in parallel or concurrently. In addition, the order of the operations may be re-arranged. A process is terminated when its operations are completed. A process may correspond to a method, a procedure, an algorithm, etc. The operations of methods may be performed in whole or in part, may be performed in conjunction with some or all of the operations in other methods, and may be performed by any number of different systems, such as the systems described herein, or any portion thereof, such as a processor included in any of the systems.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a method <b>300</b> for generating a digital wallet, according to example embodiments. In one example, the processor in a digital wallet server <b>118</b>, the processor in the client device <b>104</b>, the processor in the point-of-sale server system <b>102</b> or any combination thereof, can perform the operations in the method <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">At operation <b>302</b>, the digital wallet server <b>118</b> identifies, using a processor, a first request to initiate a first transaction. The first request may be an API request (by the API server <b>110</b>), an HTTP request (via the network <b>108</b>), or any other suitable computer request protocol. In some examples, the first request may be a combination of an API request and an HTTP request. The first transaction is a transaction for a good or service. The first transaction may be associated with a subscription item generated by the subscription server <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">At operation <b>304</b>, the digital wallet server <b>118</b> receives first sensitive data corresponding to the first transaction. The first sensitive data includes information regarding a payment corresponding to the first transaction. The first sensitive data may include a payment instrument (e.g., credit card transaction data), an amount of value associated with the first transaction and user data associated with the first transaction. The amount of value can correspond to currency or points that may be redeemed or exchanged for currency, goods, or services.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">At operation <b>306</b>, the digital wallet server <b>118</b> initiates a digital wallet based on the first sensitive data. The digital wallet server <b>118</b> initiates the digital wallet by generating a first wallet item. The first wallet item is designated for completing the first transaction. In some examples, the first wallet item may be designated to complete transactions including but not limited to the first transaction.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The first wallet item includes an amount of value received by the one or more payment instruments. In some examples the digital wallet server <b>118</b> transfers the amount of value received by the one or more payment instruments from a first account linked to the first sensitive data to the digital wallet. The digital wallet server <b>118</b> stores the amount of value in association with the first wallet item.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">At operation <b>308</b>, the digital wallet server <b>118</b> stores the first wallet item in association with the generated digital wallet. At operation <b>310</b>, the digital wallet server <b>118</b> stores the digital wallet.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples, the digital wallet includes multiple wallet items. For example, the digital wallet server <b>118</b> may receive second sensitive data corresponding to a second transaction. The digital wallet server <b>118</b> generates a second wallet item designated for completing the second transaction and stores the second wallet item in association with the digital wallet.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The digital wallet server <b>118</b> further causes display of a graphical user interface (GUI) on a client device (e.g., client device <b>104</b>). The, GUI includes a first portion and a second portion. The first portion comprises a visual representation of the digital wallet, and the second portion comprises first transaction data associated with the first transaction.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The digital wallet server <b>118</b> may receive input indicative of a selection of a first selectable user interface element. The first selectable user interface element may be associated with the first wallet item. In response to receiving the input, the digital wallet server <b>118</b> modifies the graphical user interface by updating the first transaction data and updating the visual representation of the digital wallet.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some examples, the digital wallet server <b>118</b> updates the first transaction data by generating an updated transaction value. The first transaction data may include a total value (e.g., a cost of a good or service associated with the first transaction). The digital wallet server <b>118</b> generates an updated transaction value based on subtracting the amount of value associated with the first wallet item from a total value associated with the first transaction data. The digital wallet server <b>118</b> causes display of the updated transaction value within the second portion of the graphical user interface.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some examples, the digital wallet server <b>118</b> updates the visual representation of the digital wallet by deleting the first wallet item from the digital wallet. For example, the display of the virtual representation of the digital wallet includes a visual representation of the first wallet item. After all of the funds from the first wallet item has been applied to the first transaction, the digital wallet server <b>118</b> deletes the first wallet item from the digital wallet and removes display of the virtual representation of the first wallet item from the first portion of the GUI.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The digital wallet server <b>118</b> receives a second request (e.g., API request, HTTP request, etc.) to process the first transaction and in response to receiving the second request, processes the first transaction. In some examples, receiving the second request causes the digital wallet server <b>118</b> to transfer the amount of value from the digital wallet to a third account linked with a third entity.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some examples, the digital wallet server <b>118</b> processes refunds for previously made transactions. The digital wallet server <b>118</b> may receive the refund request (e.g., a third request) as a request to modify the processed transaction (e.g., the first transaction). In respond to receiving the refund request, the digital wallet server <b>118</b> validates the refund request based on a set of transaction rules associated with the previously made transaction. The set of transaction rules may be based on one or more of user data associated with the transaction, the sensitive data associated with the transaction and the type of good or service associated with the transaction. In response to validating the refund request, the digital wallet server <b>118</b> determines modified transaction data. The modified transaction data includes a second amount of value associated with the refund.
