num="0003">Neonatal jaundice is a phenomenon in which a bilirubin concentration in blood increases due to abnormal bilirubin metabolism in the body, resulting in yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes and sclera. About 80% of full-term infants and the vast majority of premature infants have transiently elevated bilirubin concentrations, most of which are physiological jaundice and a small portion of which are pathological jaundice. Severe pathological jaundice will cause hyperbilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus), damage brain nerves of newborns (such as hyperactivity of hands and feet, loss of hearing, sluggish eyes, etc.), and even endanger lives of the newborns. Therefore, the real-time detection of bilirubin concentration in the bodies of the newborns is of great significance in the prevention and treatment of kernicterus.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It should be noted that the information disclosed in the Background section above is only for enhancing the understanding of the background of the present disclosure, and thus may include information that does not constitute prior art known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a system for diagnosing and treating jaundice and a computer-readable storage medium.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a system for diagnosing and treating jaundice, including:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">a control circuit;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">a bilirubin detection component, communicatively coupled with the control circuit, and configured to detect a bilirubin concentration of a newborn and transmit the detected bilirubin concentration to the control circuit, so that detection data is generated by the control circuit according to the detected bilirubin concentration;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">a risk evaluation circuit, communicatively coupled with the control circuit, and configured to acquire the detection data from the control circuit, and evaluate a risk level of pathological jaundice according to the detection data;
