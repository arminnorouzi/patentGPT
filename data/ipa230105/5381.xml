Therefore, in the present specification, it is disclosed that the algorithm for acquiring the comparison information of the target user should be understood as a comprehensive meaning including all types of algorithms for acquiring comparison information using the input data of the target user.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the neural network model for acquiring the comparison information of the target user according to the present embodiment may be configured to receive training data and output the data.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Here, the training data may include score information of any users (for example, user i, user j). Specifically, the score information of any users may be information on an education system different from the education system of the learning ability information of the target user to be calculated. For example, the learning ability score of the target user to be calculated may be information related to the first education system (for example, scholastic aptitude test (SAT)). On the other hand, the training data used to train the neural network model may be information related to a second education system (for example, test of English for international communication (TOEIC)) different from the first educational system (for example, SAT). According to the present embodiment, it is possible to acquire the learning ability information of the target user for the second education system based on the training data of the users for the first education system. In particular, even when there is only the search information of the target user for the second education system, the learning ability information of the target user in the second education system may be calculated based on the training data of the user for the first education system.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">In addition, the training data may include response information and/or correct or incorrect answer information of any users (for example, user i, user j). Specifically, the training data may include response comparison information between any users. The response comparison information may include information related to the number of questions (TT) solved by both user i and user j, the number of questions (TF) solved only by user i, the number of questions (FT) solved only by user j, and the number of questions (FF) for which both user i and user j answered incorrectly. However, the response comparison information may include response comparison information for questions having similarity within a preset range as well as response comparison information for the completely identical question. For example, when the user i solved the first question and the user j solved the second question, but it is determined that the first question and the second question have similarity within a preset range and are similar in difficulty or type, this may be regarded as solving the same question and reflected in the response comparison information.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">The neural network model according to the present embodiment is configured to receive training data through an input layer and output the data through an output layer. In this case, the neural network model may be trained by repeatedly performing an operation of adjusting parameters of at least one node included in the neural network model so that output data and label information are minimized. Here, the label information may be information indicating the relative skill between users. As an example, the label information indicating the relative skill of the user i may be information related to the number of questions (TT) that both user i and user j answered correctly/(the number of questions (TT) that both user i and user j answered correctly+the number of questions (FT) that only user j answered correctly). For example, suppose that the number of questions that both the user i and user j answered correctly is 90, the number of questions that only the user i answered correctly is 10, the number of questions that only the user j answered correctly is 110, and the number of questions that both the user i and user j answered incorrectly is 40. Here, it can be seen that the user i correctly answered 45% ({(90/(90+110)}*100) of 200 questions that the user j answered correctly, and the user j correctly answered 90% ((90/(90+10)}*100) of 100 questions that the user i answered correctly. That is, it may mean that the knowledge of the user j includes the knowledge of the user i, and as a result, through the label information, relative skill information indicating that user j has a relatively higher skill than user i may be acquired.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">Through the above-described learning process, the neural network model may be trained so that the output data output through the output layer approaches the label information based on the training data.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an aspect of acquiring comparison information and a learning ability score of a target user through a neural network model trained according to an embodiment of the present application. The device <b>2000</b> for evaluating learning ability may acquire input data from the second matrix. Here, the input data may be in a form similar to the response comparison information between the target user and any users described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. In more detail, the input data may be acquired based on the search information of the target user and search information of a search database. As described above, the target user (or a plurality of users) is highly likely to be unaware of the question (for example, a question with A allocated as a feature value) retrieved among the questions included in the learning set information, so input data may be acquired by corresponding to the number of questions answered incorrectly in the response comparison information. On the other hand, the target user (or a plurality of users) is highly likely to be aware of the question (for example, a question with B allocated as a feature value) not searched among the questions included in the learning set information, and thus input data may be acquired by corresponding to the number of questions answered correctly in the response comparison information.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Meanwhile, the plurality of users included in the input data may be users with questions overlapping with the target user relatively a lot. For example, the plurality of users included in the input data may be at least one of a target user and a clustered user on the second matrix.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">The device <b>2000</b> for evaluating learning ability may input data into a trained neural network model and acquire comparison information output through the trained neural network model. Since the neural network model has been trained to output a value close to the label information through the output layer, the trained neural network model may output the comparison information related to the relative ability of the target user with respect to a plurality of users. Therefore, the device <b>2000</b> for evaluating learning ability according to the present embodiment may acquire the comparison information through the trained neural network model. In addition, since the comparison information is an index of the relative learning ability of the target user and any user, the device <b>2000</b> for evaluating learning ability acquires the comparison information between the target user and at least one user to quantify the relative skill of the target user with the learning ability score.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">In the calculating of the learning ability score of the target user based on the comparison information (S<b>3720</b>), the device <b>2000</b> for evaluating learning ability may calculate the learning ability score of the target user based on the comparison information acquired through the trained neural network model. Here, the learning ability score of the target user may mean encompassing any type of numerical value that may represent the relative ability of the target user with respect to a plurality of users, including scores or the like related to official tests.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">On the other hand, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> to <b>14</b></figref>, the contents of training the neural network model to output the comparison information based on the training data were mainly described. However, this is only an example, and the second neural network model may be trained to output the learning ability score of the target user. For example, the second neural network model may receive a user j score and response comparison information, and use a user i score as label information so that the output data may be trained to approximate the label information. In this case, the device <b>2000</b> for evaluating learning ability may be implemented to acquire the learning ability score of the target user through the trained second neural network model.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">The device <b>1000</b> for recommending educational content (or device <b>2000</b> for evaluating learning ability) according to the embodiment of the present application may quantify the learning ability information of the user based on the search information of the user.
