Thus, the free ends <b>82</b> of the chain <b>81</b> and <b>84</b> of the traction spring <b>83</b> form the first and second free ends of the elongate element <b>8</b>. Thus, the elongate element <b>8</b> is at least partly resiliently deformable as a result of the presence of the traction spring <b>83</b>.

Once the resiliently deformable part of the elongate element <b>8</b>, in this case the traction spring <b>83</b>, is in place, tension is applied to it. This tension makes it possible to retain the two profiled panels <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>d </i>adjacent in pairs against one another simply, when the structure <b>5</b>, and thus the electronic display device <b>1</b> of the kakemono type according to the invention, is in the configuration of use.
