SARS-CoV-2, the highly infectious agent responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is a novel coronavirus that utilizes a glycosylated spike protein to enter human cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The lung is a primary site of entry for SARS-CoV-2, as evidenced by massive pulmonary inflammation and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Saxena, S K., et al., <i>Coronavirus Dis.; </i>2019:1 (2020)). ARDS is a serious inflammatory lung condition responsible for the highest rate of medical complications and mortality among critically ill patients (Gan, T., et al., <i>Front Microbiol, </i>21; 9:3174 (2018)). In the case of viral respiratory infections, symptoms are usually mild, self-limiting, and confined to the upper airways. However, in more severe respiratory cases, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, the infection can affect the lower airways, causing ARDS, increased pulmonary vascular permeability, hypoxemia, increased coagulation, fibrinolysis factors, endothelial and epithelial damages (Ferguson, N D., et al., <i>Intensive Care Med, </i>38(10):1573 (2019); Spadaro, S., et al., <i>J Inflamm </i>(<i>London</i>), 15; 16:1 (2019)). In patients with severe COVID-19, the transition to ARDS condition is mainly due to the occurrence of a cytokine storm and hyperinflammatory responses, including massive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1&#x3b2;, as well as infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes into the lung tissue (Spadaro, S., et al., <i>J Inflamm </i>(<i>London</i>), 15; 16:1 (2019); Ghadimi-Moghadam, A., et al., <i>J Biomed Phys Eng, </i>10(2):241 (2020); Ye., Q., et al., <i>J Infect, </i>pii: S0163-4453(20)30165 (2020)). The cytokine storm contributes to diffuse alveolar damage, alveolar capillary leakage, severe hypoxaemia, intense pulmonary oedema and pulmonary fibrosis (Villar, J., et al., <i>Chest, </i>155:587)2019). Currently, other than supportive measures there is no definitive cure for ARDS (Shen, C., et al., <i>JAMA, March </i>27 (2020); Chaari, L., et al., <i>EPMA J, </i>25:1-6 (2020)), illustrating the urgent need for creative and effective therapeutic modalities to treat this complex condition. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has deepened the understanding of ARDS pathophysiology, definitive therapy for ARDS continues to elude the medical and scientific community. If initiated early, combinatorial therapies such as corticosteroid and IL-6 inhibitor have shown beneficial effects in the management of ARDS (Harahwa, T A., et al., <i>Acta Biomed., </i>91(4): e2020122,4 (2020); Hough, C L., et al., <i>Clin Chest Med. </i>35(4):781-795 (2014)). However, there remains a need to develop alternative novel therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of ARDS persists.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Cannabinoids are naturally occurring compounds in <i>Cannabis </i>plants. Numerous studies suggest beneficial effects of cannabinoids in clinical settings. Of over 100 known cannabinoids, four, including tetrahydrocannabinol (&#x394;<sup>9</sup>-THC), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), and cannabichromene (CBC), have attracted the most attention due to supporting evidence of their potential as therapeutic targets. Despite their structural differences, both CBD and CBC are non-psychoactive compounds with potential immunomodulatory effects and several other health benefits. More recently, in a set of preclinical studies we showed for the first time that CBD could ameliorate the symptoms of ARDS. Importantly, unlike THC and CBD, CBC is not categorized as a scheduled compound by U S Enforcement Agency (DEA), which may facilitate the use and assessment of CBC in clinical settings.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Numerous studies report that cannabinoids may function as immune modulators, limiting the adverse effects of inflammatory diseases (Pini, A., et al., <i>Curr Drug Targets, </i>13(7):984 (2012)). Endocannabinoids are produced in the respiratory system and cannabinoids-induced bronchodialation suggest a significant therapeutic potential for cannabinoids in the treatment of respiratory diseases, including ARDS in case of patients with severe form of COVID-19 (Bozkurt, T E., <i>Molecules, </i>24(24). pii: E4626 (2019)). Further, several reports suggest that CBC may act through the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1 (TRPA1) as well as transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) with less affinity, likely affecting tissue homeostasis and immune balance as well as endocannabinoid cellular reuptake, and modulating the inflammatory responses. CBC has also been reported to be an agonist to the CB2 receptor, activation of which may further modulate inflammatory responses.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Apelin, an endogenous, multi-functional ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor, APJ, also serves as a second catalytic substrate for ACE2 (Chen L J, et al., <i>Int J Hypertens. </i>2015: 5-10 (2015)). Apelin is generated from a 77-amino acid precursor and undergoes proteolytic cleavage to generate biological active fragments, including apelin-36, apelin-19 and apelin-13. An endogenous protective role was postulated for activation of the apelin/APJ axis (Apelinergic system) after lung injury, via proposed mechanisms including suppression of the immune activating transcription factor, NF-&#x3ba;B and inhibition of innate immune infiltration/activation via attenuated expression of CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL7 and TNF-&#x3b1; (&#x25cf;Huang, S. et al., <i>Clin Chim Acta. </i>456: 81-88 (2016)). Of interest, both apelin and APJ are widely expressed throughout the lung, heart, liver, gut, kidney and central nervous system (8Kawamata. Y. et al., <i>Biochim Biophys Acta. </i>1538(2-3): 162-171 (2001)), spatially overlapping expression of the endocannabinoid system while interaction between the endocannabinoid system and apelin limits liver fibrosis (Melgar-Lesmes. P. et al., <i>Cells. </i>8: 1311 (2019)).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Considering limited number of target-specific antiviral treatment and vaccination for COVID-19, it is absolutely exigent to have effective therapeutic modalities to reduce hospitalization and mortality rate as well as to improve COVID-19-infected patient outcomes. Specifically, it is of interest to find therapeutic modalities that are able to reverse the symptoms of ARDS towards a normal level.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide compositions and methods of treating or reducing Acute respiratory distress syndrome and other inflammatory conditions associated with COVID-19.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Disclosed herein are cannabinoid based compositions and methods of their use to treat or reduce symptoms associated with viral infections including but not limited to coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19. Exemplary cannabinoid based compositions that can be used in the disclosed methods include, but are not limited to, tetrahydrocannabinols (THC), preferably delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabidivarin (CBDV) and cannabichromene (CBC), cannabicyclol (CBL), cannabichromevarin (CBCV), cannabigerovarin (CBGV) and cannabigerol monomethyl ether (CBGM), arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), 2-arachidonyl glyceryl ether (noladin ether), N-arachidonoyl dopamine (NADA), virodhamine (OAE) lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI), nabilone, rimonabant, JWH-073, CP-55940, dimethylheptylpyran, HU-210, HU-331, SR144528, WIN 55,212-2, JWH-133, levonantradol, and AM-2201 and combinations thereof.

Of note, among the elevated inflammatory mediators, the blood IL-6 level is highly correlated with the disease mortality when COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors are compared, suggesting that fatal COVID-19 is characterized as a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that is induced by a cytokine storm with high mortality (Shintaro Hojyo, et al., Inflamm Regen. 2020; 40: 37). The inflammatory cytokines can be circulating cytokines or pulmonary cytokines.

Cannabichromene as a Therapeutic Modality for COVID-19</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047">With a limited number of effective antivirals, the pandemic of COVID-19 remains the most significant challenge to the healthcare system in decades. There is an urgent need for definitive therapeutic intervention. Clinical reports indicate the cytokine storm associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality in severe cases of COVID-19. Disclosed herein are cannabichromene (CBC) compositions and methods of their use as a therapeutic modality for COVID-19.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A. Cannabinoid Compositions</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The term &#x201c;cannabinoid&#x201d; as used herein may encompass a chemical compound that activates any mammalian cannabinoid receptor, for example human CB<sub>1 </sub>receptor or human CB<b>2</b>receptor. The cannabinoids may be naturally occurring (such as, for example, endocannabinoids or phytocannabinoids) or they may be synthetic. Synthetic cannabinoids may include, for example, the classical cannabinoids structurally related to THC, the non-classical cannabinoids (cannabimimetics) including the aminoalkyindoles, 1,5-diarylpyrazoles, quinolines and arylsulphonoamides, and eicosanoids related to the endocannabinoids. When a cannabinoid salt is used, it may be employed in the form of a solution. The one or more cannabinoids is preferably selected from the classical cannabinoids, more preferably selected from tetrahydrocannabinols (THC), preferably delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabidivarin (CBDV) and cannabichromene (CBC), cannabicyclol (CBL), cannabichromevarin (CBCV), cannabigerovarin (CBGV and cannabigerol monomethyl ether (CBGM). CBC is a preferred cannabinoid.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Cannabichromene (CBC) is a non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid that offers several of the benefits that THC does while not having such pronounced effects. Studies have shown that CBC does not interact significantly with CB<b>1</b> receptors in the body, but that it does have some interactions with the CB2 receptors. This fact may be why it does not produce much of a psychoactive effect. Early reports showed that CBC prolonged hexobarbital hypnosis in mice (Hatoum et al., 1981) exerted anti-inflammatory effects and modest analgesic activity in rodents (Wirth et al., 1980; Turner and Elsohly, 1981; Davis and Hatoum, 1983), while showing no &#x2018;Cannabis like&#x2019; activity in the Rheseus monkey (Mechoulam et al., 1970) and in human smoking experiments (Turner et al., 1980). In more recent years, it has been shown that CBC exerts antimicrobial (Appendino et al., 2008), anti-inflammatory (DeLong et al., 2010; Tubaro et al., 2010), analgesic (Maione et al., 2011) and antidepressant-like activity in rodents (El-Alfy et al., 2010). Pharmacodynamic studies have shown that CBC, like other plant natural products (Gertsch et al., 2010), is an inhibitor of endocannabinoid cellular reuptake (Ligresti et al., 2006) and a weak inhibitor of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) (De Petrocellis et al., 2011), but is also a potent activator of transient receptor potential (TRP) ankyrin 1-type (TRPA1) channels (De Petrocellis et al., 2008; 2011).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Other cannabinoids suitable for use in the present invention are endocannabinoids, substances that naturally occur in the mammalian body and which activate one or more cannabinoid receptor. Preferably endocannabinoids are selected from arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), 2-arachidonyl glyceryl ether (noladin ether), N-arachidonoyl dopamine (NADA), virodhamine (OAE) and lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Synthetic cannabinoids suitable for use in the present invention include nabilone, rimonabant, JWH-073, CP-55940, dimethylheptylpyran, HU-210, HU-331, SR144528, WIN 55,212-2, JWH-133, levonantradol, and AM-2201.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In recent years, cannabinoids have been investigated extensively due to their potential effects on the human body. Among all cannabinoids, Cannabichromene (CBC)has demonstrated a potent anti-inflammatory effect in a variety of inflammatory conditions. In one embodiment, CBC is used to contain the cytokine storm and treat the cytokine release syndrome associated with COVID-19 and other inflammatory viral conditions.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In another embodiment, the administration of CBC downregulates the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ameliorates the clinical symptoms of COVID-19. One embodiment provides a therapeutic role for CBC in the treatment of COVID-19 by reducing the cytokine storm, containing the damage, and re-establishing homeostasis.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">B. Intranasal Compositions</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, the cannabichromene compositions are formulated to allow intranasal administration. Intranasal compositions may comprise an inhalable dry powder pharmaceutical formulation comprising a therapeutic agent, wherein the therapeutic agent is present as a freebase or as a mixture of a salt and a freebase. Pharmaceutical formulations disclosed herein can be formulated as suitable for airway administration, for example, nasal, intranasal, sinusoidal, peroral, and/or pulmonary administration. Typically, formulations are produced such that they have an appropriate particle size for the route, or target, of airway administration. As such, the formulations disclosed herein can be produced so as to be of defined particle size distribution.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">For example, the particle size distribution for a salt form of a therapeutic agent for intranasal administration can be between about 5 &#x3bc;m and about 350 &#x3bc;m. More particularly, the salt form of the therapeutic agent can have a particle size distribution for intranasal administration between about 5&#x3bc; to about 250 &#x3bc;m, about 10 &#x3bc;m to about 200 &#x3bc;m, about 15 &#x3bc;m to about 150 &#x3bc;m, about 20 &#x3bc;m to about 100 &#x3bc;m, about 38 &#x3bc;m to about 100 &#x3bc;m, about 53 &#x3bc;m to about 100, about 53 &#x3bc;m to about 150 &#x3bc;m, or about 20 &#x3bc;m to about 53 &#x3bc;m. The salt form of the therapeutic agent in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can a particle size distribution range for intranasal administration that is less than about 200 &#x3bc;m. In other embodiments, the salt form of the therapeutic agent in the pharmaceutical compositions has a particle size distribution that is less than about 150 &#x3bc;m, less than about 100 &#x3bc;m, less than about 53 &#x3bc;m, less than about 38 &#x3bc;m, less than about 20 &#x3bc;m, less than about 10 &#x3bc;m, or less than about 5 &#x3bc;m. The salt form of the therapeutic agent in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can have a particle size distribution range for intranasal administration that is greater than about 5 &#x3bc;m, greater than about 10 &#x3bc;m, greater than about 15 &#x3bc;m, greater than about 20 &#x3bc;m, greater than about 38 &#x3bc;m, less than about 53 &#x3bc;m, less than about 70 &#x3bc;m, greater than about 100 &#x3bc;m, or greater than about 150 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Additionally, the salt form of the therapeutic agent in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can have a particle size distribution range for pulmonary administration between about 1 &#x3bc;m and about 10 &#x3bc;m. In other embodiments for pulmonary administration, particle size distribution range is between about 1 &#x3bc;m and about 5 &#x3bc;m, or about 2 &#x3bc;m and about 5 &#x3bc;m. In other embodiments, the salt form of the therapeutic agent has a mean particle size of at least 1 &#x3bc;m, at least 2 &#x3bc;m, at least 3 &#x3bc;m, at least 4 &#x3bc;m, at least 5 &#x3bc;m, at least 10 &#x3bc;m, at least 20 &#x3bc;m, at least 25 &#x3bc;m, at least 30 &#x3bc;m, at least 40 &#x3bc;m, at least 50 &#x3bc;m, at least 60 &#x3bc;m, at least 70 &#x3bc;m, at least 80 &#x3bc;m, at least 90 &#x3bc;m, or at least 100 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments the disclosed cannabinoid compositions include one or more cannabinoids or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives or salts thereof, a propellant, an alcohol, and a glycol and/or glycol ether. The alcohol may be a monohydric alcohol or a polyhydric alcohol, and is preferably a monohydric alcohol. Monohydric alcohol has a lower viscosity than a glycol or glycol ether. Accordingly, the composition is able to form droplets of a smaller diameter in comparison to compositions in which the monohydric alcohol is not present. The present inventors have surprisingly found that a specific ratio of monohydric alcohol to glycol or glycol ether results in a composition with a desired combination of both long term stability (for example the composition remains as a single phase for at least a week at a temperature of 2-40&#xb0; C.) and small droplet size.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">C. Pulmonary Compositions</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">One embodiment provides a formulation and method for treating ARDS in the pulmonary system by inhalation or pulmonary administration. The diffusion characteristics of the particular drug formulation through the pulmonary tissues are chosen to obtain an efficacious concentration and an efficacious residence time in the tissue to be treated. Doses may be escalated or reduced or given more or less frequently to achieve selected blood levels. Additionally, the timing of administration and amount of the formulation is preferably controlled to optimize the therapeutic effects of the administered formulation on the tissue to be treated and/or titrate to a specific blood level.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Diffusion through the pulmonary tissues can additionally be modified by various excipients that can be added to the formulation to slow or accelerate the absorption of drugs into the pulmonary tissues. For example, the drug may be combined with surfactants such as the phospholipids, dimyristoylphosphatidyl choline, and dimyristoylphosphatidyl glycerol. The drugs may also be used in conjunction with bronchodilators that can relax the bronchial airways and allow easier entry of the antineoplastic drug to the lung. Albuterol is an example of the latter with many others known in the art. Further, the drug may be complexed with biocompatible polymers, micelle forming structures or cyclodextrins.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Particle size for the aerosolized drug used in the present examples was measured at about 1.0-5.0 &#x3bc;m with a GSD less than about 2.0 for deposition within the central and peripheral compartments of the lung. As noted elsewhere herein particle sizes are selected depending on the site of desired deposition of the drug particles within the respiratory tract.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Aerosols useful in the invention include aqueous vehicles such as water or saline with or without ethanol and may contain preservatives or antimicrobial agents such as benzalkonium chloride, paraben, and the like, and/or stabilizing agents such as polyethyleneglycol.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Powders useful in the invention include formulations of the neat drug or formulations of the drug combined with excipients or carriers such as mannitol, lactose, or other sugars. The powders used herein are effectively suspended in a carrier gas for administration. Alternatively, the powder may be dispersed in a chamber containing a gas or gas mixture which is then inhaled by the patient.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">III. Apelin</heading><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Apelin, an endogenous, multi-functional ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor, APJ, also serves as a second catalytic substrate for ACE2 (Chen. L J, et al., <i>Int J Hypertens. </i>2015:5 (2015)). Apelin is generated from a 77-amino acid precursor and undergoes proteolytic cleavage to generate biological active fragments, including apelin-36, apelin-19 and apelin-13. An endogenous protective role was postulated for activation of the apelin/APJ axis (Apelinergic system) after lung injury, via proposed mechanisms including suppression of the immune activating transcription factor, NF-&#x3ba;B and inhibition of innate immune infiltration/activation via attenuated expression of CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL7 and TNF-&#x3b1; (Huang, S., et al., <i>Clin Chim Acta., </i>456:81 (2016)). Of interest, both apelin and APJ are widely expressed throughout the lung, heart, liver, gut, kidney and central nervous system (Kawamata, Y., et al., <i>Biochim Biophys Acta., </i>1538(2-3):162 (2001)), spatially overlapping expression of the endocannabinoid system while interaction between the endocannabinoid system and apelin limits liver fibrosis (Melgar-Lesmes, P., et al., <i>Cells, </i>8:1311 (2019)). In one embodiment the regulation of the apelinergic system by CBC limits excessive pulmonary inflammation after ARDS.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">IV. Administration</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Inhalation is a convenient administration route for therapeutic agents that overcomes many of the drawbacks of oral administration, such as slow drug onset and first-pass metabolism plus it can be used with patients that suffer from pulmonary conditions.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">A. Intranasal Administration</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one embodiment, the CBC compositions are delivered through intranasal administration. As described herein, intranasal administration or nose administration comprise the described compositions being administered into the mammal nostril and reaching nasal meatus or nasal cavity. For example, the compositions can be administered with nasal spray, insufflation, nasal drop, aerosol, propellant, pressurized dispersion body, aqueous aerosol, propellant, nose suspension, instillation, nasal gel, nose is with ointment and nose ointment, by means of any new or old type equipment of administration.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Current studies strongly suggest that intranasal administration of high dose Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)) in a murine model maybe a reliable working and practical model to investigate and help better understanding of mechanisms responsible for COVID-19 symptoms. Induction of hypo-oxygenation, lymphopenia, cytokine storm (marked production of proinflammatory cytokines) as well as impairment and destruction of lung architecture are all examples of cardinal clinical symptoms of severe COVID-19 and ARDS. In addition, being a synthetic analog of double stranded RNA, not only can Poly(I:C) provide a very robust foundation to study the immunopathology and physiology of COVID-19, but when compared to many viral agents, it is considerably safer and cheaper alternative for research on SARS-Cov-2 and other virus-induced infections.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Present findings propose a potential immunotherapeutic role for CBC in the treatment of severe respiratory viral infections and ARDS. The current data support the notion that anti-inflammatory function of CBC may be a crucial modulator of cytokine storm and hyperinflammation. There are reports suggesting that the interaction between immune system and COVID-19 is a two-phased process. The first stage is the activation of immune system to decimate the viruses and contain the progression of infection. The second stage is characterized by a regulatory mechanism to curtail the cytokine storm and prevent the cytokine-induced sepsis. The vast distribution of endocannabinoid system in the body is well documented and mounting evidence support anti-inflammatory effects for cannabinoids. Therefore, altogether, it maybe plausible to propose CBC as a potential immunomodulator in the treatment of COVID-19 and ARDS. In conclusion, these new findings introduce a new angle with a translational perspective to investigate the potentials of cannabinoids in the treatment of viral respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Further studies are required to foster and validate such a complex therapeutic strategy in the treatment of severe viral respiratory infections such as COVID-19.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">One embodiment provides a method of treating COVID-19 symptoms in a subject in need thereof by administering to the subject an effective amount of a composition including cannabichromene.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Another embodiment provides a method of reducing Acute respiratory distress syndrome in a subject in need thereof by administering to the subject an amount of cannabichromene effective to reduce inflammation in the subject. The cannabichromene reduces the level of inflammatory cytokines. The cytokines can be circulating cytokines or lung cytokines. In one embodiment, cannabichromene treatment reduces inflammatory damage to the lungs. In another embodiment, cannabichromene treatment improves the functional capacity of the lungs. Acute respiratory distress syndrome can be caused by COVID-19.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">B. Pulmonary Administration</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In another embodiment, the cannabinoids are delivered through pulmonary administration directly to the lungs where they are efficiently absorbed into the systemic circulation, resulting in a rapid onset of therapeutic action. The rapid onset of therapeutic action achievable through the compositions and methods of the invention offers an advantage over prior cannabinoid delivery methods such as sublingual or suppository delivery, which generally involve slower systemic absorption.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Pulmonary administration by inhalation may be accomplished by means of producing liquid or powdered aerosols, for example, by using any of various devices known in the art.

Various delivery devices are commercially available and can be employed, e.g. Ultravent nebulizer (Mallinckrodt, Inc, St. Louis, Mo.); Acorn II nebulizer (Marquest Medical Products, Englewood, Colo.); Ventolin metered dose inhalers (Glaxo Inc., Research Triangle Park, N.C.); Spinhaler powder inhaler (Fisons Corp., Bedford, Mass.) or Turbohaler (Astra). Such devices typically entail the use of formulations suitable for dispensing from such a device, in which a propellant material may be present. Ultrasonic nebulizers may also be used.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As will be understood by those skilled in the art of delivering pharmaceuticals by the pulmonary route, a major criterion for the selection of a particular device for producing an aerosol is the size of the resultant aerosol particles. Smaller particles are needed if the drug particles are mainly or only intended to be delivered to the peripheral lung, i.e. the alveoli (e.g. 0.1-3 &#x3bc;m), while larger drug particles are needed (e.g. 3-10 &#x3bc;m) if delivery is only or mainly to the central pulmonary system such as the upper bronchi. Impact of particle sizes on the site of deposition within the respiratory tract is generally known to those skilled in the art.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 1.

All animals were housed in pathogen-free conditions at the animal facility of the Augusta University, and all experiments were performed in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Augusta University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. Sham group received PBS while control and treatment groups were administered by Poly(I:C) (Sigma Aldrich, USA) (100 &#x3bc;g in 50 &#x3bc;l sterile PBS) intranasally (I/N) three once-daily doses. CBC (isolate THC free) was delivered intraperitoneally (5 mg/kg), first dose two hours after the second Poly(I:C) treatment and every other day interval, total of 3 doses. Sham and control groups received PBS only. All mice were sacrificed at 8 days after the first Poly(I:C) application. Blood and lung tissues were harvested and subjected to the further analysis.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Measurement of vital signs: Vital signs including temperature, Blood O<sub>2 </sub>saturation were measured prior and post of any treatment. Central body temperature was measured rectally and blood oxygen saturation was determined using portable pulse oximetry through carotid arteries.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Histology and immunohistochemistry: Left lobes of lung tissue were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Samples were processed by routine methods, oriented so as to provide coronal sections and 5 micron mid-coronal sections cut and stained with hematoxylin &#x26; eosin, Trichrome for histology. As for inflammatory indices, immunohistochemistry was performed by incubating the samples with specific antibodies against murine IL-6 (Cat #554402, BD BioSciences Pharmingen) and Neutrophils (Cat #G102, Leinco Technologies). Preparations were counterstained with hematoxylin (catalog no. 7221; Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, Mich., USA) and mounted in Faramount (catalog no.

Briefly, tissue samples were sieved through a 100 &#x3bc;M cell strainer (BD Biosciences, San Diego, Calif.), followed by centrifugation (1,000 rpm, 10 min) to prepare single-cell suspensions. All cells were then stained with fluorescent antibodies to quantify neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes and cytokine expression. Briefly, all cells were stained with anti-Gr1 (Neutrophils), Anti-F4/80 (Macrophages), and anti-CD3/CD4/CD8 (Lymphocytes, all from Biolegend USA). Then cells were fixed and permeabilized and stained intracellularly for cytokines including IL-6, TNF&#x3b1;, IL-2, and IFN&#x3b3; (Proinflammatory cytokines).
