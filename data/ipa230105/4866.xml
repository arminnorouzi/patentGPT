Many different types of communications services exist, and connectivity may potentially be provided over different types of physical channels, such as coaxial cable, fiber optics, phone lines, satellite networks, or cellular networks. However, not all types of connectivity are available at all locations. In addition, even when one type of communication service is available, the upload and download speeds available may vary from one location to another. Often, different locations may have significantly different connectivity options, e.g., using different physical connections and/or service levels as well as through different service providers. As a result, determining which connectivity options would meet the needs at a location can require coordinating communication among many different systems or organizations, which can result in significant delays in selecting and establishing appropriate network service.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some implementations, a system can train and use several types of machine learning models to predict which communication technologies and service providers are appropriate for different locations. In general, the process of identifying and establishing network connectivity (e.g., using technologies such as cable, fiber optics, digital subscriber line (DSL), satellite, cellular, etc.) can be performed more efficiently with different sets of classification models, each trained to provide a different type of classification decision. This provides a powerful approach to select service providers and network technologies for specific locations without relying on service providers to indicate whether service is available. The results from this approach can be provided to remote devices through an application programming interface (API), so that users can obtain estimates of service availability, service quality levels, and other information through a web page, application, or another interface.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Models can be trained using pre-qualification results collected over time for different service providers and network technologies and for different locations. Typically, obtaining pre-qualification data for a specific location involves a request to the service provider and delay while waiting for a response to be received. These delays can be significant, sometimes, hours, days, or a week or more. Further, pre-qualification data is typically desired from multiple service providers, which can extend the delay to receive results. To reduce dependence on the responses of service providers and to avoid these delays, pre-qualification data that is incrementally received for various locations can be stored in a database and used as a training data set to train machine learning models to predict pre-qualification results. For example, by training models based on prequalification results received over the last year, the models can quickly and effectively predict which service providers and communication technologies are available at different locations, and what service levels are available (e.g., different uplink and downlink speeds) without the need to solicit pre-qualification data from service providers.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One or more machine learning models can also be used to select a service provider and communication technology from the options that are predicted to be available. As noted above, some models can be trained using preliminary data, such as pre-qualification results. Other models can be trained from actual installations of communication service, showing what different parties decided was actually available and most suitable given the options. For example, prequalification data typically is not entirely accurate, so some locations prequalified for service may not actually be able to receive service as indicated by the pre-qualification results. The data about actual service installation or actual service provided to a location shows which service providers and communication technologies can be conclusively determined to be available since service was actually provided. The decision which provider to choose also indirectly encompasses other types of information. For example, some service providers may not be selected because of technical incompatibility, inflexible contracts, delays in starting service, poor reputation, high pricing, or other factors that are typically not reflected in pre-qualification data but may deter actual use of the service. With information about the set of service providers and communication technologies were predicted to be available and which service providers and communication technologies were subsequently actually chosen and used, machine learning models can predict which of multiple service provider/communication technology combinations is best for different locations.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The techniques described in this document provide a number of improvements and advantages. For example, the use of the machine learning models to determine service availability and service level availability can drastically reduce latency in obtaining accurate information compared with traditional approaches that involved obtaining prequalification data for each location and from each service provider. The technique reduces reliance on third-party systems that provide unpredictable delays. Further, the approach can reduce network bandwidth, as the system using the trained models does not need to request and receive data from a variety of service providers for each network service decision. Even if service providers made pre-qualification data available online, obtaining the information for multiple service providers would involve several network round trips and transfers to obtain the information that the models can provide without any network connectivity requirement.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, the modeling techniques in the application can provide the ability for robust, accurate predictions with a relatively sparse or imprecise data set. Models for service availability and service level availability can be trained from pre-qualification results and used effectively, even though the pre-qualification results used for training are not fully accurate. The use of a third type of model can ensure greater accuracy by incorporating information learned from actual service installation decisions. As discussed below, the machine learning models do not require exhaustive data sets to provide highly accurate predictions.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, the models can be configured to provide predictions along a continuous geographical region, even though the training data may include few or no training data examples for certain portions of the region. For example, even though there may no training data for certain zip codes, the models can be trained in a way to still generate appropriately accurate predictions for locations in those zip codes. One of the techniques to achieve this involves training the models using geographical coordinates that remove political or other artificial boundaries. This can allow models to interpret relative distances and better interpolate between training examples. Another technique includes indicating locations to models (during training and prediction phases) in multiple levels of granularity, e.g., zip code, city, county, state, etc. This also can help the models make appropriate inferences, since even if there have not been training examples for a particular zip code or city, for example, the models may learn to use results for the same county or state, or for cities or zip codes nearby to generate a useful prediction.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one general aspect, a system includes: one or more computers; a network interface to receive a request from a client device over a network, the request indicating a location and a communication service level; a plurality of first machine learning models including at least one first machine learning model for each of multiple service providers or communication technologies, wherein each first machine learning model is trained to predict whether communication service is available from the service provider or communication technology at a location in response to receiving input indicating the location; a plurality of second machine learning models including at least one second machine learning model for each of the multiple service providers or communication technologies, wherein each second machine learning model is trained to predict a level of communication service that the service provider or communication technology provides at a location in response to receiving input indicating the location; a third machine learning model to receive an indication of a location and a set of service providers or communication technologies as input and provide output including an indication of relative suitability for the location of the service providers or communication technologies in the set; and one or more computer-readable media storing instructions that, when executed by the one or more computers, cause the system to (i) receive an indication of a location and a level of communication service, and (ii) provide output indicating a service provider or communication technology selected using the first machine learning models, the second machine learning models, and the third machine learning model.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Implementations may include one or more of the following features.

Once the client device <b>110</b> requests information about the connectivity options for a location, the computing system <b>120</b> can then generate and provide the information independent of computing systems <b>140</b> for the service providers that potentially could provide service at the location.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The system <b>100</b> uses machine learning techniques to determine which service providers and technologies would be best suited for the communication requirements of a particular site. A site may be identified primarily by geographical location of the site (e.g., latitude and longitude, zip code), and service level requirements can represent desired upload and download speeds, and potentially other customer or site-specific requirements, such as requirement for having a fixed public IP address. Machine learning classification models learn from existing records collected over a period of time, often a year or more. The models can then be used to determine appropriate connectivity options for new sites not described in the previous data, for example, which service providers and technologies would be available for a site, which service levels (e.g., upload and download speeds) are available for a site, and which is the best available service provider and technology combination for a site. The proposed machine learning models may represent geographical locations with latitude and longitude or other geographical coordinates, which allows the models to encode a sense of distance between locations indicated in training data and thus provide accurate predictions for locations for which no previous data exists (e.g., by using patterns and proximity to other locations for which historical data does exist).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The techniques can be used as a Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platform for remote users to obtain service availability predictions for new sites using models that have already been trained on historical data. For example, the client device <b>110</b> can request information and receive predictions through an application programming interface (API), a web page, an application, or other interface on an on-demand basis.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The client device <b>110</b> can be any appropriate device input from and output to a user, for example, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a smartphone, and so on.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The network <b>130</b> can include one or more wired or wireless networks, and can include private and/or public networks, including the Internet. The computing systems <b>140</b> represent server systems for different communication service providers. These systems <b>140</b> can provide information indicating expected and/or actual availability of network service for different locations. This can take the form of prequalification data or responses to queries regarding specific locations. As another example, these computing systems <b>140</b> can provide map data, coordinates, or other data indicating where the respective communication service providers provide service and the type or level of service of provided.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The computing system <b>120</b> can include one or more computers, such as a server system. The computing system <b>120</b> may be implemented as a group of computers or processors that are in one location or are distributed in multiple locations.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The computing system <b>120</b> is in communication with one or more data storage devices <b>122</b>, which store a database of information about network service availability. This information can include pre-qualification data <b>124</b>, e.g., the accumulated results of responses from the various computing systems <b>140</b> in response to service availability queries over time. The stored information can also include installation data <b>126</b>, such as records of which technology and service provider combination was actually installed for various locations.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The computing system <b>120</b> uses three different types of machine models to generate information about the availability of communication service options: multiple first machine learning models <b>150</b>, multiple second machine learning models <b>160</b>, and one or more third machine learning models <b>170</b>. The first models <b>150</b> and second models <b>160</b> are trained using preliminary indications of service availability from service providers, while the third machine learning model <b>170</b> is trained using information about actual service installations.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The first models <b>150</b> can be service availability models, used to predict whether service is offered for different service providers and communication technologies. The first models <b>150</b> can include a different model for each combination of service providers and communication technologies that are potentially available. For example if there are four service providers considered and each service provider offers four different communication technologies for network access (e.g., cable, fiber optics, DSL, and cellular), then there may be twenty first models <b>150</b>. For example, the models <b>150</b> can include one model representing the first provider providing service using cable network connection, another model for the first provider providing service using a fiber optic connection, another model for a second provider providing service with a cable connection, and so on. Of course, different service providers may offer service with differing numbers and types of communication technologies. The specific service provider and communication technology combinations used can be combinations identified in records in the database represented by storage devices <b>122</b>, such as combinations determined to occur in pre-qualification data <b>124</b> and/or actual installation data <b>126</b> at least a minimum number of times.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The first models <b>150</b> are respectively trained to predict whether communication service is available from the different service provider/communication technology combinations. In training of each first model <b>150</b>, examples from the prequalification data corresponding to the appropriate provider/technology combination are extracted, and the system determines, for each example, the location for the pre-qualification request and the result from the service provider (e.g., whether service is provided or is not provided). The examples are then used to train the model for that combination to predict whether service is available based on location. In the example, each first model <b>150</b> corresponds to a specific service provider/communication technology combination, and is trained to make classification decisions whether different locations are likely to have service available with the combination. Each first model <b>150</b> can be configured to receive inputs indicating locations, and to provide for each indicated location a probability, score, or other data indicating how likely service is to be available at the locations in response to the location input. In some implementations, each first model <b>150</b> is configured to receive an input indicating a location, and in response, to generate a confidence score indicating a likelihood that service is available at the indicated location using the particular communication technology and service provider combination corresponding to the model.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The second models <b>160</b> can be service level models, used to predict the level of service (e.g., available bandwidth, reliability, or other measure of the capabilities of communication service) provided by different service providers and communication technologies. The second models <b>160</b> can include a different model for each combination of service providers and communication technologies that are potentially available. For example, there may be the same number of second models <b>160</b> as there are first models <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The second models <b>160</b> can be trained based on the pre-qualification data <b>124</b> to predict the highest level of service provided at different locations. In some implementations, a discrete set of service levels is defined. For example, five service levels may be defined, each corresponding to a different set of uplink and downlink bandwidths, e.g., with levels corresponding to download/upload speeds of least: 0.5 Mb/0.1 Mb; 5.0 Mb/2.0 Mb; 15 Mb/5 Mb; 30 Mb/15 Mb; and 50 Mb/25 Mb or greater. More or fewer levels and levels with different performance criteria may be defined. The various second models <b>160</b> can each be trained to indicate, for each location indicated at the input to the model <b>160</b>, a likelihood score for each of the different service levels. For example, for a given model receiving a location input, a first output score in an output vector may indicate a likelihood or confidence that the provider/technology combination corresponding to the model will provide the first level of service at the location; a second output score in the output vector may indicate the likelihood or confidence that the same combination will provide the second level of service at the location; and so on.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">During training of each of the second models <b>160</b>, the computer system extracts from the pre-qualification data <b>124</b> examples of the highest service levels for the service provider and technology combination corresponding to the model <b>160</b>. For example, instances of pre-qualification reports for a specific service provider/communication technology combination are extracted, with each example having a location and information about the level of service that a service provider has claimed to be available at the location. The service levels indicated in the pre-qualification data <b>124</b> are mapped to one of the discrete service level labels. The model <b>160</b> is then trained using the examples to learn the distribution of service levels present across various graphical areas. After training, each model <b>160</b> is capable of receiving data indicating a location and in response predicting a level of communication service that the particular service provider/communication technology combination likely provides at the location.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As noted above, the output of each second model <b>160</b> can be a vector, e.g., a set of scores including a separate score for each of the multiple discrete service levels. Each score can indicate a likelihood that, for a corresponding service level is available at a location specified by input to the model <b>160</b>. For example, using the example of five service levels discussed above, each second model <b>160</b> may output five scores for each location input. One of the scores provides a likelihood that the first service level would be provided, another giving a likelihood that the second service level would be provided, and so on. As an example, the set of scores output by one of the models <b>160</b> may be [<b>0</b>.<b>99</b>, <b>0</b>.<b>98</b>, <b>0</b>.<b>92</b>, <b>0</b>.<b>7</b>, <b>0</b>.<b>6</b>] for a location. The initial score of &#x201c;0.99&#x201d; shows a very high confidence that the first service level (e.g., at least 0.5 Mb download/0.1 Mb upload in the example above) can be provided at the location by the provider/technology combination for the model, but the other scores show progressively lower confidence that the combination can provide the higher bandwidth of the other service levels at the location. As another example, the second models <b>160</b> may indicate binary scores indicating whether the service levels are provided by the various combinations, e.g., [1, 1, 1, 0, 0] to indicate that the first three service levels are expected to be provided but the last two service levels are not.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The first models <b>150</b> and second models <b>160</b> can split the function of predicting whether service is available and predicting which service levels are available. This separation may be reflected in the second models <b>160</b> being conditional on there already being an indication that service is available. In other words, the predictions of the second model can be, in essence, a prediction made given that service has been determined to be available at a location.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The third machine learning model <b>170</b> can be a suitability model used to rank or compare various provider/technology combinations. In particular, the third model <b>170</b> can be used to select the most suitable combination for a location, from among multiple provider/technology combinations that have been determined to be (i) sufficiently likely to have service provided at the location, according to output of the first models <b>150</b>, and (ii) sufficiently likely to provide a level of service that meets the needs at the location, according to output of the second models <b>160</b>. In other words, after the first models <b>150</b> and second models <b>160</b> are used to identify a subset of provider/technology combinations that are likely to provide service that meets the performance requirements of a location, the third model <b>170</b> is used to be able to evaluate the relative merits of the combinations in the set. For example, the model <b>170</b> may provide scores, such as a probability distribution over the set of provider/technology combinations, that can be used to rank the combinations. The combination having the score representing the greatest likelihood can represent the best option for network service.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The use of the third model <b>170</b> can indirectly incorporate information about many advantages and disadvantages of service options, including technological and non-technological factors can lead users to select certain provider/technology combinations over others. By training the model <b>170</b> with data indicating which provider/technology combinations were actually installed (e.g., the actual install data <b>126</b>), the third model <b>170</b> may learn the trends and patterns of choices that have been made by different parties, allowing the third model <b>170</b> to offer predictions that align with those trends. Thus, output of the third model <b>170</b> may implicitly follow the preferences and analysis that led to the installation choices indicated in the actual installation data <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The third model <b>170</b> also provide a type of quality assurance to the output of the system <b>120</b>. The first models <b>150</b> and second models <b>160</b> are trained based on pre-qualification data, which are estimates of service availability and capabilities that are not always accurate. The third model <b>170</b>, on the other hand, is trained using actual installation data <b>126</b>, so the records provide examples where service is verified to actually be available. In effect, the output of the third model <b>170</b> can help filter out predictions of the first models <b>150</b> and second models <b>160</b> that are not accurate, whether the inaccuracy is due to modelling error, changes in offerings of service providers, inaccuracy of the underlying prequalification data used for training, or other reasons. This allows the first models <b>150</b> and second models <b>160</b> to be trained with data that is approximate or not entirely accurate, since the output of the third model <b>170</b> can be used to correct or filter out provider/technology combinations incorrectly indicated to be available by the other models.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The processing of the third model <b>170</b> can reflect constraints and information not used in training the models <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>. For example, the third model <b>170</b> can be trained based on actual install information <b>126</b>, reflecting actually installations of service where service is known to occur, not the prequalification data <b>124</b> which may often represent a tentative or unverified assertion by the service provider. Further, the actual installation data <b>126</b> reflects the actual installation choices made by users or organizations for various locations, which may be based on other factors such as network capabilities beyond those indicated in the service level, such as pricing, contract terms, quality of customer support, lead time to establish service, and so on. The scores of the third model <b>170</b> thus can provide scores to rank the different provider/technology combinations for a location, with the scores being based on statistical measures of how others have selected service in nearby areas.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The input to the third model <b>170</b> can include a variety of information about the network service needed, for example, data indicating the location for service, an indication of the service level desired, and data indicating the provider/technology combinations determined to likely to provide the desired level of service. The output of the third model <b>170</b> can include a score for each of the different provider/technology combinations that the computing system <b>120</b> considers. For example, the output scores can indicate likelihoods that the different provider/technology combinations would be installed given the input of the location, the service level requirement, and the set of estimated or pre-qualified provide/technology combination options.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an example of using the computing system <b>120</b> to determine service providers and communication technologies is provided. Initially, a user of a client device <b>110</b> access is an interface to request information about availability of network service. Using the interface, the user enters a list of geographical locations <b>112</b> where network service is desired. The user also enters service level requirements <b>114</b> that specify the required capabilities of the network service. These service level requirements <b>114</b> may include uplink and downlink bandwidth requirements. The service level requirements <b>114</b> may additionally or alternatively specify other constraints, such as a static IP address, a data cap minimum or unlimited data capability, wireless or wired access, and so on.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The client device <b>110</b> sends data indicating the geographical locations <b>112</b> and the service level requirements <b>114</b> to the computing system <b>120</b> over the network <b>130</b>. The computing system <b>120</b> then uses the machine learning models <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>170</b> to determine which service providers and communication technologies would most likely provide service that meets the requirements of the user at the locations specified by the user. As discussed above, the determination can be made rapidly, and without contacting the communication service providers <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">When the user has specified multiple locations <b>112</b>, the computing system makes a determination for each location individually. Then, the results for each individual location are prepared and combined to determine, if possible, one or more service provider/communication technology combinations that would meet the needs at all of the locations or at least various groups of the locations.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">To determine the options for a location, the computing system <b>120</b> provides input indicating the location to each of the first models <b>150</b>. In response, each of the first models <b>150</b> provides output indicating whether the provider/technology combination corresponding to that model is likely to provide service at the location. From those outputs, the computing system <b>120</b> selects a first subset <b>152</b> of provider/technology combinations. For example, the computing system <b>120</b> can apply a predetermined threshold to the model output, for example, to select provider/technology combinations for which the model output indicates a confidence score of 50% or greater.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The computing system <b>120</b> evaluates, for each of the provider/technology combinations in the first subset <b>152</b>, whether those combinations would meet the service level requirements <b>114</b>. To do this, the computing system <b>120</b> provides data indicating the location of interest to each of the second models <b>160</b> for the combinations in the first subset <b>152</b>. Each of those second models <b>160</b> then provides output indicating whether each of multiple service levels are likely to be provided by the provider/technology combination corresponding to the model. For example, each of the second models <b>160</b> that is used can provide a score with respect to each of multiple predetermined service levels.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">With the outputs of the second models <b>160</b>, the computing system <b>120</b> narrows down the first subset <b>152</b> to a second subset <b>162</b>. This involves comparing the outputs of the second models <b>160</b> with a service level threshold, for example 50% confidence level indicated by the model outputs. Combinations from the first subset <b>152</b> are included in the second subset <b>162</b> if the corresponding output has at least one service level score that satisfies the service level threshold and meets the service level requirements <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The computing system <b>120</b> provides input to the third model <b>170</b> based on the combinations in the second subset <b>162</b>. The input can include: data indicating the location; data indicating the service levels that would satisfy the user's service level requirements <b>114</b>; and data indicating the provider/technology combinations in the second subset <b>162</b>. Based on these inputs, the third model <b>170</b> provides output that allow the computing system <b>120</b> to determine which provider/technology combinations are expected to be suitable for the location. For example, the third model <b>170</b> may provide a likelihood score or confidence score for each provider/technology combination that the third model <b>170</b> is trained to evaluate. The computing system <b>120</b> can then apply a suitability threshold to the scores and select the combinations that have scores satisfying the threshold.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The computing system <b>120</b> repeat this process using the first models <b>150</b>, the second models <b>160</b>, and the third model <b>170</b> for each of the locations <b>112</b>. After a set of provider/technology combinations is selected for each of the locations <b>112</b>, the computing system <b>120</b> evaluates the different sets to determine overlap and determine if there are provider/technology combinations that would satisfy the needs of all the locations <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The computing system <b>120</b> generates and sends a response to the client device <b>110</b> indicating the selected provider/technology combinations. The data can indicate, for example, the combinations that are predicted to meet the needs at all locations, or those that meet the needs of certain groups of the locations <b>112</b>. The data can also include the selected set <b>172</b> of combinations for each individual location. The client device <b>110</b> receives and presents the information to the user.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating the use of the models <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>170</b> in greater detail. The example shows the processing for a single geographical location, and the functions shown can be repeated for various locations to generate a response to a request.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The input to each of the first models <b>150</b> is location data <b>205</b>. In some implementations, the location of interest is expressed in multiple different forms in the location data <b>205</b>. For example, the computing system <b>120</b> can take a street address for location and determine the ZIP Code or other postal code for the location. Other expressions for the location differing levels of granularity can also be determined and used. For example, GPS coordinates for the location, city, county, state, country, and/or other forms of expressing location can also be used. The GPS location used can be general GPS location, such as a central GPS location for the ZIP Code in which the location of interest is located. By providing location data <b>205</b> in multiple forms having different levels of precision during training and when making predictions, the machine learning models <b>150</b> (and models <b>160</b> and <b>170</b>) can implicitly learn spatial relationships to a degree. This can compensate for gaps in the examples used for training the models. For example, even if training data does not include examples for a particular ZIP Code, the training data may include examples for the city or county that includes the ZIP Code, allowing the model to generalize and at least in some cases rely on observed characteristics of broader geographical areas that do match or are near the location of interest.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, there is a first model <b>150</b> for each combination of service provider and communication technology being considered. Each of the models <b>150</b> generates an output score <b>210</b>, which indicates a probability or confidence measure of how likely the corresponding combination is to provide service at the location indicated by the location data <b>205</b>. A predetermined service availability threshold <b>215</b> is used to evaluate the output scores <b>210</b>. In the example, output scores <b>210</b> that have a value greater than 0.45 are accepted as likely providing service. The actual value of the threshold <b>215</b> may vary depending on the set of models <b>150</b> used and Can be empirically determined to meet accuracy standards, e.g., to limit the number of false positives or false negatives. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, three of the output scores <b>210</b> meet the threshold <b>215</b>, and the provider/technology combinations for those scores would be included in the first subset <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Next, the computing system <b>120</b> uses the models <b>160</b> to assess which provider/technology combinations are likely to meet the service level requirements <b>114</b> that the user has specified. The computing system <b>120</b> provides the location data <b>205</b> as input to each of the second models <b>160</b> corresponding to combinations with output scores <b>210</b> that satisfied the threshold <b>215</b>. In response, the models <b>160</b> each output a set of scores <b>220</b>. Multiple predetermined service levels are defined in advance, before or during training of the models <b>160</b>. The second models <b>160</b> have been trained to predict whether service at locations specified by input would likely provide those different levels of service. In the example, there are five different levels of service, corresponding to different uplink and down link speeds and potential representing other types of requirements. Each second model <b>160</b> that receives the location data <b>205</b> generates a set of output scores <b>220</b> indicating the probability or confidence level that the corresponding provider/technology combination would provide that service level.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The computing system also applies a service level threshold <b>225</b> to identify service levels that have a sufficiently high likelihood of being provided. In the example, the service level threshold <b>225</b> is 0.6, so that scores <b>220</b> above this threshold are considered to be likely provided at the location indicated by the location data <b>205</b>. The computing system <b>120</b> then evaluates the provider/technology combinations to determine which ones are predicted to provide at least one service level that meets the service level requirements <b>114</b> that the user has specified. In the example, the user has specified a need for at least the third level of the five possible levels defined.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some implementations, the service levels are defined so that higher levels encompass the requirements of lower levels, so that, for example, providing service at level four also satisfies the requirements of each of service levels one through three. In other implementations, different scores <b>220</b> may be provided for different types of requirements, for example, with some scores <b>220</b> representing the availability of a static IP address, and some scores representing different bandwidth requirements, and so on. The computing system may consider individual scores <b>220</b> and/or combinations of multiple scores <b>220</b> for any given provider/technology combination to determine if that provider/technology combination satisfies the requirements <b>114</b>. In the example, each of the provider/technology combinations predicted to be available at the location of interest are predicted to provide the needed service level, e.g., service level three or higher.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The computing system <b>120</b> uses the third model <b>170</b> to evaluate the provider/technology combinations further. As input, the third model <b>170</b> receives the location data <b>205</b>, service level requirement data <b>230</b> indicating which service levels meet the service level requirement <b>114</b>, and prediction data <b>235</b> indicating the provider/technology combinations predicted to be available and to have an appropriate service level available, e.g., as determined based on evaluation of the scores <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The service level requirement data <b>230</b> can include a value for each of the predetermined service levels that would meet the service level requirement <b>114</b>. Similarly, the prediction data <b>235</b> can include a value for each of the provider/technology combination the computing system <b>120</b> is configured to consider. If the computing system <b>120</b> is considering twenty different combinations (and so uses twenty first models <b>150</b> and twenty second models <b>160</b>) there would be twenty values for this portion of the input. Each of the values can indicate whether the corresponding provider/technology combination is predicted to be available (based on outputs <b>210</b> of the first models <b>150</b>) at a location and is predicted to have a service level that meets the minimum requirements at the location (based on outputs <b>220</b> of the second models <b>160</b>). The values may be binary to indicate whether a provider/technology combination meets the criteria. As another example, the scores may be non-binary, for example, to indicate a likelihood or confidence that a combination meets the needed criteria, for example, determined as a function of the scores <b>210</b> and <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The third model <b>170</b> can provide output scores <b>240</b>, such as a set of values that indicate the relative suitability of the various provider/technology combinations. The output sores <b>240</b> can include a score for each provider/technology combination representing how likely that combination is to be suitable for the location of interest.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The computing system <b>120</b> evaluates the output scores <b>240</b> using a suitability threshold <b>250</b> to determine which provider/technology combinations have an output score <b>240</b> that meets the threshold <b>250</b>. Combinations that do have scores <b>240</b> meeting the threshold <b>250</b> are selected as the set recommended to the user for the location of interest, e.g., as the selected set <b>172</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some implementations, when the third model <b>170</b> is trained, the prediction data <b>235</b> used in the training process is the set of provider/technology combinations that prequalification data <b>124</b> indicated to be available options. Thus, the examples used in training can show which combination was actually installed (e.g., from the actual installation data <b>126</b>) from among the options available when the choice was made (e.g., determined from the prequalification results indicated by the prequalification data <b>124</b>).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As noted above, the format of the location data <b>205</b> can provide robustness to the predictions of the system. For example, the nature of the latitude and longitude measure automatically encodes a sense of distance thus the model is able to provide results for locations for which no historical prequalification data exists by automatically determining best possible results from nearby locations for which prequalification results do already exist. This is better than using a rule based approach, because the rules might have to be different for different areas and would need to be manually determined. The techniques discussed in this document allow the machine learning modes to automatically learn the possible non-linearities in the data, thus making it more robust and accurate than a na&#xef;ve rule-based approach. For new locations that exist in a zip code for which no prequalification information is available the prequalification success percentage is set to be the same as the prequalification success percentage of the city in which the zip code exists; similarly if the data does not exist for the city, the value for the county is used; and so on to the next larger geographical unit.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">During training of the models <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>170</b>, each model can have its own data set extracted from the data stored in the storage devices <b>122</b>. In particular, each of the models <b>150</b>, <b>160</b> will have a training data set representing prequalification results for the specific provider/technology combination that corresponds to those models.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some implementations, the models <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>170</b> may be trained based on aggregated data for geographical areas rather than training based on each prequalification record individually. For example, from the training data set for a provider/technology combination, the computing system <b>120</b> may aggregate data for certain geographical areas, such as ZIP Codes. For each geographical area (e.g., ZIP Code), the computing system determines a rate at which prequalifications have been successful. This rate for the area may be a ratio of (i) a number of prequalification requests for the provider/technology combination that resulted in an indication that service is available in the ZIP Code, and (ii) a total number prequalification requests for the provider/technology combination that were made for the ZIP Code. Success rates determined in this manner can be used as the training target for the models <b>150</b>. For example, for the models <b>150</b> can be trained so that, given a location input in a particular ZIP code, the models <b>150</b> output a score indicative of the rate of prequalification success (e.g., indication that service is available) that corresponds to the provider/technology combination for the model <b>150</b>. In a similar manner, the models <b>160</b> can be trained to use success rates for prequalification for availability of different service levels.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In general, the training data sets are each broken into multiple train-test split and K-fold cross-validation technique is used to avoid overfitting to the training data.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Each machine learning model <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>170</b> can be a model such as a random forest model, an XG boost tree, a logistic regression model, a deep neural network, a support vector machine (SVM), a maximum entropy classifier, or another type of model. Although models are discussed individually, each model may actually comprise multiple models, e.g., as an ensemble model. For example, to make the predictions more robust, each of the models <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>170</b> may include multiple machine learning models, including models of different types or models trained with different data sets or parameters. The output of multiple component models can be combined as a stacked ensemble to provide the smallest prediction error on test data. In the case of the models <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, the predictions made during training are then compared against previously known prequalification results for that geographical area (such as the county city in which the site is located) to determine if the results are consistent with the historically available data. Evaluating the prediction with respect to currently known results may be used as an initial indicator of the correctness of predictions.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">To determine the accuracy of the machine learning models, the machine learning predictions as well as new prequalification results from the computing systems <b>140</b> are obtained for new sites not represented in the training data. The results from the actual prequalification process are compared with the results determined using the machine learning models. The new prequalification results may be continuously added to the training dataset used for the machine learning models, thus making them better and better over time. Once the accuracy of the machine learning models exceeds an acceptable threshold, then the machine learning models can potentially replace the prequalification process. Instead of doing prequalification for every site, the prequalifications are done only periodically and for just enough sites spread nationwide to keep the training data current. The term accuracy is not used here to represent just a single measure (i.e. what fraction of machine learning predictions matched the actual prequalification results) but is used in a more general sense of how well the model predictions reflect actual availability of service. As with any classification model, the true positive rate, false positive rate, true negative rate, and false negative rate can all be assessed to determine the effectiveness of a model.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a user interface <b>300</b> that indicates service availability for a geographical area. The user interface <b>300</b> includes controls <b>310</b> that allow a user to narrow the set of service providers and/or communication technologies considered. For example, on the left of the user interface <b>300</b> there are controls <b>310</b> that allow the user to select one of multiple different communication technologies (e.g., 4G wireless, cable, fiber optics, etc.) or an aggregate of multiple technologies (e.g., to show the best available option among multiple technologies.) On the right side, there is a control <b>320</b> to select individual service providers or combinations of service providers.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Based on the providers and technologies the user selects, the user interface is updated to show, on a map <b>330</b>, the rate that prequalification determinations show service availability for different regions. The rates indicated on the map <b>330</b> can be based on actual success rates of prequalification requests made to, and answered by, the service providers. In some implementations, the user interface indicates predicted likelihoods of successful availability based on the outputs of the machine learning models <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>170</b>. For example, rather than indicating actual prequalification results from the service provider, the map data can indicate likelihoods or confidence scores determined by models <b>150</b> for the different areas, or may indicate the likelihoods or confidence scores determined by the model <b>170</b> for the areas.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram showing a user interface <b>400</b> for requesting and viewing results of service availability predictions. The interface includes controls <b>410</b> to upload a list of locations of interest. The client device <b>110</b>, on receiving such a list, queries the computing system <b>120</b> to obtain service availability predictions for the locations in the list. On the right-hand half of the user interface <b>400</b>, the locations in the list are displayed. The items in the list <b>420</b> are selectable, allowing a user to select any of the items to show a map <b>430</b> of the location and information <b>440</b> about predicted service availability at the location. This information can include, for example, a list of provider/technology combinations that are predicted to have availability for the location and predicted rates of prequalification success.
