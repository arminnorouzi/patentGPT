The present disclosure is not limited to the following embodiment.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A camera on a display chassis is typically directed to a user, and the user may feel uneasy because the camera may capture images of them contrary to their intention even when the camera does not operate. When the camera is exposed, this may degrade the design integrity with the frame. As one means of covering the camera, a manually slidable mechanical shutter including a shield cover can be used.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Recently, electronic apparatuses have been required to have a frame, which surrounds the display, as narrow as possible for thinner and lighter in weight. Further miniaturization also is required for the mechanism for sliding of the shield cover, which may reduce the click feeling to the user.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In view of the above, it would be desirable to provide an electronic apparatus and a slide mechanism that are easy to assemble, provide a stable click feeling, and achieve a long lifespan.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an electronic apparatus <b>10</b> according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. The electronic apparatus <b>10</b> includes a slide mechanism <b>12</b> according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. The electronic apparatus <b>10</b> is a laptop PC. The electronic apparatus according to the present disclosure is not limited to a laptop PC, which may be a desktop PC, a mobile tablet terminal, or a multifunctional mobile phone.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The electronic apparatus <b>10</b> includes a body chassis <b>14</b> and a display chassis <b>16</b> that is openable/closable relative to the body chassis <b>14</b> via hinges <b>18</b>. The laptop PC with the display chassis <b>16</b> closed is compact and is suitable for mobile use. The upper face of the body chassis <b>14</b> comes with a keyboard <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The following may refer to the left-right direction of the display chassis <b>16</b> as X direction, the upper-lower direction as Y direction, and the thickness direction of a display <b>22</b> as Z direction. For the display chassis <b>16</b>, lower refers to the side connecting to the body chassis <b>14</b> via the hinges <b>18</b>, and upper refers to the opposite side. X direction is the moving direction of a slider <b>36</b> described later. Y direction is the direction orthogonal to the moving direction of the slider <b>36</b> described later and the front-rear direction. For Z direction, the front refers to the direction where the front face of the display <b>22</b> faces, and the rear refers to the opposite. That is, Z direction is the front-rear direction.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The display chassis <b>16</b> includes the display <b>22</b> on the front face, i.e., on the display face, a frame (chassis) <b>24</b> surrounding the display <b>22</b>, and a rear cover (chassis) <b>26</b>. The frame <b>24</b> and the rear cover <b>26</b> make up a part of the chassis. The rear cover <b>26</b> and the frame <b>24</b> are made of resin materials. The rear cover <b>26</b> has a slightly larger area than the display <b>22</b> and covers the rear face of the display <b>22</b>. The display <b>22</b> is a rectangular thin color liquid crystal display, and occupies a major part of the front face of the display chassis <b>16</b>. The frame <b>24</b> is narrow, which may be called a narrow bezel.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional perspective view of an upper portion of the display chassis <b>16</b> including a groove <b>31</b><i>a</i>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, a camera (optical device) <b>28</b> and a camera lamp (optical device) <b>29</b> are placed above the rear cover <b>26</b> in a position behind an upper frame <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the frame <b>24</b> so that the camera <b>28</b> and the camera lamp <b>29</b> face forward.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The display chassis <b>16</b> has a glass <b>34</b> on the front face. The glass <b>34</b> covers the front portion of the display <b>22</b> and of the upper frame <b>24</b><i>a</i>. The portion of the glass <b>34</b> that covers the upper frame <b>24</b><i>a </i>is colored in black so that the structure of the upper frame <b>24</b><i>a </i>is invisible. The portion of the glass <b>34</b> that is located in front of the camera <b>28</b> and the camera lamp <b>29</b> has no color and serves a transparent window to expose these devices. The camera <b>28</b> and the camera lamp <b>29</b> may be shielded by a first shield cover <b>46</b><i>a </i>and a second shield cover <b>46</b><i>b </i>described later. The camera <b>28</b> is placed at a substantially center position of the upper frame <b>24</b><i>a </i>in the left-right direction. A microphone and an infrared port may be disposed at the upper frame <b>24</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A narrow edge wall <b>30</b> surrounds the circumference of the rear cover <b>26</b>. A narrow circumferential wall <b>31</b> surrounds almost the entire circumference of the frame <b>24</b>. The circumferential wall <b>31</b> is substantially in contact with the inner circumference of the edge wall <b>30</b>. The circumferential wall <b>31</b> protrudes slightly from the front edge of the edge wall <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The circumferential wall <b>31</b> has a groove <b>31</b><i>a </i>at a substantially center of the upper frame <b>24</b><i>a</i>. The groove <b>31</b><i>a </i>comes with an operation knob <b>32</b>. The operation knob <b>32</b> is narrower in X direction than the groove <b>31</b><i>a</i>. The operation knob <b>32</b> and the circumferential wall <b>31</b> have the same width in the Y direction. The operation knob <b>32</b> protrudes forward from between the edge wall <b>30</b> and the glass to the same extent as the circumferential wall <b>31</b> protrudes. The operation knob <b>32</b> is small enough to fit within the width of the circumferential wall <b>31</b> in Y direction and Z direction and be less conspicuous, and is favorable in appearance.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The operation knob <b>32</b> is a part of the slider <b>36</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) described later, and slides in X direction together with the slider <b>36</b>. In other words, the slider <b>36</b> is movable in X direction relative to the display chassis <b>16</b> between a first position and a second position. The operation knob <b>32</b> is slidable between the first position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) and the second position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) within the width of the groove <b>31</b><i>a</i>. The operation knob <b>32</b> has a cutout <b>32</b><i>a</i>, which allows the user to operate the operation knob <b>32</b> easily with a finger or a nail. The cutout <b>32</b><i>a </i>is located just above the camera <b>28</b> when the slider <b>36</b> is in the first position, which enables the user to operate the operation knob <b>32</b> intuitively to cover the camera <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an enlarged front view of the upper frame <b>24</b><i>a </i>in the display chassis <b>16</b> when the slider <b>36</b> is in the first position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> omits the glass <b>34</b> so that the structure of the upper frame <b>24</b><i>a </i>is visible. The same goes for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> described later. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exploded front view of the upper frame <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the slider <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the upper frame <b>24</b><i>a </i>comes with the slider <b>36</b>. The slider <b>36</b> is movable in the direction along the edge wall <b>30</b> (i.e., in X direction). When the slider <b>36</b> moves to the leftmost in the front view, the operation knob <b>32</b> abuts a first contact portion <b>31</b><i>aa </i>at the left end of the groove <b>31</b><i>a </i>to be restricted in movement to the left (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). This position of the slider <b>36</b> is referred to as the first position. When the slider <b>36</b> is displaced to the rightmost in the front view, the operation knob <b>32</b> abuts a second contact portion <b>31</b><i>ab </i>at the right end of the groove <b>31</b><i>a </i>to be restricted in movement to the right (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). This position of the slider <b>36</b> is referred to as the second position.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The slider <b>36</b> includes a metal plate <b>38</b> as the base. The metal plate <b>38</b> is made of a ferrite material. The metal plate <b>38</b> has a substantially rectangular main portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>on the left and an arm <b>38</b><i>b </i>protruding from the lower part of the main portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>to the right.

The fixed magnet <b>56</b>B is magnetized so that the S pole, the N pole and the S pole are disposed from left to right on the lower side. That is, the fixed magnet <b>56</b>B has a three-pole configuration on the lower side.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the slider <b>36</b> is in the first position, the center line <b>54</b>Baa of the movable magnet <b>54</b>B is slightly shifted to the right in X direction from the center line <b>56</b>Baa of the left magnet <b>56</b>Ba in the fixed magnet <b>56</b>B. With this configuration, the movable magnet <b>54</b>A and the magnet <b>56</b>Ba are attracted to each other in Y direction, and the slider <b>36</b> is biased to the left in X direction so that the operation knob <b>32</b> of the slider <b>36</b> is pressed against the first contact portion <b>31</b><i>aa</i>. When the slider <b>36</b> in the slide mechanism <b>12</b>B is in the second position, it acts symmetrically to the first position, which is not illustrated. When the slider <b>36</b> is located between the first position and the second position, the movable magnet <b>54</b>B and the fixed magnet <b>56</b>B repel each other. In this way, the movable magnets <b>54</b> and <b>54</b>B have two fewer poles than the fixed magnets <b>56</b> and <b>56</b>B on the opposite faces. With this configuration, when the slider <b>36</b> is in the first position or in the second position, these magnets attract to each other, and when the slider <b>36</b> is located therebetween, the magnets repel each other.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The slide mechanism <b>12</b>C includes a movable magnet <b>54</b>C and a fixed magnet <b>56</b>C in place of the movable magnet <b>54</b> and the fixed magnet <b>56</b> in the slider <b>36</b> described above. The movable magnet <b>54</b>C is one U-shaped magnet, and has magnetic poles on the upper face. The movable magnet <b>56</b>C includes two U-shaped magnets <b>56</b>Ca and <b>56</b>Cb, which each have magnetic poles on the lower face. The movable magnet <b>54</b>C and the fixed magnet <b>56</b>C have the same arrangement of magnetic poles on the opposing faces as the movable magnet <b>54</b> and the fixed magnet <b>56</b> described above, but have no magnetic poles on the non-opposing face. Such a slide mechanism <b>12</b>C has almost the same action as that of the above slide mechanism <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the above-stated slide mechanisms, the movable magnet and the fixed magnet are relatively displaced. That is, a movable magnet having a smaller number of poles and a fixed magnet having a larger number of poles may be disposed in reverse. In other words, one of the fixed magnet <b>56</b> and the movable magnet <b>54</b> has three or more poles of N pole(s) and S pole(s) in total that are alternately disposed in X direction on the face opposing the other magnet, and the other of the fixed magnet <b>56</b> and the movable magnet <b>54</b> has two fewer poles than the number of magnetic poles of the one magnet that are disposed in the X direction on the face opposing the one magnet. The movable magnet <b>54</b> and the fixed magnet <b>56</b> then may be placed so that different poles face each other when the slider <b>36</b> is in the first position and the second position, and the same poles face each other when the slider <b>36</b> is located between the first position and the second position. Note here that the number of magnetic poles of the movable magnet on the slider <b>36</b>, which is a moving body, may be reduced, which can keep the stroke longer and reduce the weight of the moving body. This improves the dynamic characteristics of the moving body.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The range of application of the above slide mechanism is not limited to the configuration that shields or exposes an optical device with a shield cover.
