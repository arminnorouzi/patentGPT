In such internet live broadcasting, a technology has been proposed in which a distributor appears in a virtual space as a virtual character (an avatar), and an image thereof is distributed as a live content. In such a live content, an image in which the operation of the distributor is synthesized as the operation of the virtual character is distributed by a motion capture technology.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, in Patent Document 1, a configuration is disclosed in which a three-dimensional space image from a free viewpoint including the viewpoint of a third person is generated by allowing an avatar on a virtual space to act the own behavior, and thus, a video is prepared without inconvenience of carrying photographic equipment in the actual space, cumbersomeness of asking the other person to take a photograph, or the like.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, in Patent Document 2, it is proposed that when live performance is performed in the real world, a performer can be even more excited by giving a celebration or flowers to the performer, and according to this, even in a video sharing service, in order to obtain the same effect, a virtual item purchased by a viewer of a content (indicating a &#x201c;broadcasting program&#x201d; in which a video is shared between viewers, such as a live content) is managed in association with the content, and is used as an item for decorating a display screen of the content. As the virtual item, for example, the viewer of the content purchases flowers, letters, logos, and the like as a &#x201c;decoration&#x201d;, and disposes the flowers, the letters, the logos, and the like in any position on the display screen, and thus, decorates the display screen.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p

commitment of a virtual item such as a decoration with respect to a virtual space in the internet live broadcasting or the like using the virtual space, the following serious problems have not been solved yet.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0009">In the case of using the decoration described above as an example, it is considered that a performer or a relevant person of a live content (a singer, a dancer, a player, a lecturer, a director, a stage director, a producer, a sponsor, and the like) wants the live content to be viewed by a wider range of viewers and a virtual item as a symbol of support, compliment, or praise, such as the decoration of the patent document described above, to be displayed on a content screen when the contents are supported.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0010">Further, it is desirable that a symbol item of the support such as the decoration that is displayed with an effort is visually recognized by a wider range of viewers, and the support is more widespread.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0011">However, in the configuration disclosed in Patent Document 2 described above, the viewer capable of performing the commitment of the decoration is only a viewer who has been watching the content voluntarily, and thus, it is difficult to obtain the commitment of the decoration that is the symbol of the support from a wider range of targets.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0012">Similarly, in the configuration disclosed in Patent Document 2 described above, only the viewer who has been watching the live content voluntarily just watches the decoration subjected to the commitment by the other viewer in the live content, and thus, it is not possible to assume that the decoration is visually recognized by a wider range of targets and the circle of support is widespread.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0013">The present invention has been made in consideration of the circumstances described above, and an object thereof is to provide a content distribution system, a content distribution method, and a computer program, in which it is possible to obtain the commitment of a virtual item that is a symbol of support with respect to a live content from a wider range of target people not limited to a viewer of a live content that is a target, it is possible for a wider range of target people not limited to the viewer of the live content to visually recognize the virtual item that is the symbol of the support, and it is possible to make the circle of support with respect to the live content widespread.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0014">In

id="p-0072" num="0065">Hereinafter, an embodiment according to the present disclosure will be described. Note that, this embodiment described below is merely an example, various modifications can be made within a range not departing from the spirit of the present invention, and such modifications are also included in the present invention.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0066">[Configuration of Content Distribution Receiving System <b>1</b>]</p><p id="p-0074" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating the configuration of a content distribution receiving system <b>1</b> according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0068">The content distribution receiving system <b>1</b> includes a content distribution server <b>2</b>, a first distributor terminal <b>11</b>, a first viewer terminal <b>12</b>, a second distributor terminal <b>21</b>, and a second viewer terminal <b>22</b>, and such configurations are connected to each other through an internet communication network <b>3</b> or the other communication network such that data exchange can be performed. The content distribution server <b>2</b> is a server configured such that a general-purpose computer is operated by a dedicated computer program.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0069">The first distributor terminal <b>11</b> is a personal computer that is used in the distribution of a live content using a first virtual space <b>30</b> described below and is used by a distributor staging the live content. The first viewer terminal <b>12</b> is a personal computer that is used by a viewer viewing the live content described above, or may be attained by using various information terminals such as a smart phone or a personal digital assistant (PDA).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0070">The second distributor terminal <b>21</b> is a personal computer that is used in the distribution of a live content using a second virtual space <b>40</b> described below and is used by a distributor staging the live content. The second viewer terminal <b>22</b> is a personal computer that is used by a viewer viewing the live content described above, or may be attained by using various information terminals such as a smart phone or a personal digital assistant (PDA).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0071">The first distributor terminal <b>11</b> and the first viewer terminal <b>12</b> will be collectively referred to as a first content distribution group <b>10</b>, and similarly, the second distributor terminal <b>21</b> and the second viewer terminal <b>22</b> will be collectively referred to as a second content distribution group <b>20</b>. Each of the distribution groups shares each live content distribution stream in each of the groups <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> at a stage where the common distribution of the live content is not implemented yet.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0072">Note that, in order to simplify and clarify the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and the above description, the number of terminals to be configured is limited, but in the implementation, it is obvious that a larger number of distributor terminals, a larger number of viewer terminals, and a larger number of content distribution groups can be included.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0073">[Configuration of Content Distribution Server <b>2</b>]</p><p id="p-0081" num="0074">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the content distribution server <b>2</b> includes an input/output interface <b>2</b><i>a </i>that is a data transmission terminal inside and outside the server, and a control unit <b>2</b><i>b </i>that is a central processing unit (CPU) controlling the operation of each configuration of the server <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0075">Similarly, a motion information storage unit <b>2</b><i>c </i>of the server <b>2</b> stores data relevant to a motion of an avatar (a human substitution display object) that is a virtual item, data of the virtual item such as a commitment item, and the like, to be transmitted from each of the distributor terminals or each of the viewer terminals, and as necessary, transmits the data to a necessary transmission destination.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0076">Specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the motion information storage unit <b>2</b><i>c </i>determines whether to prepare appearance data <b>7</b>-<b>1</b> of the avatar by the viewer terminal or the like described below or to select appearance data that is prepared and provided by the system, by designating a uniform resource locator (URL) of the appearance data disposed on a network. Then, as motion data <b>7</b>-<b>2</b> that is a result of sensing the movement of each part of the body of the viewer or the like, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(B)</figref>, position information and movement information are obtained by using each part of the body as a joint <b>7</b>-<b>2</b><i>a</i>. Information of a ramus <b>7</b>-<b>2</b><i>b </i>connecting the joints <b>7</b>-<b>2</b><i>a </i>may be further generated to clarify a relationship between the joints <b>7</b>-<b>2</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0084" num="0077">A content distribution unit <b>2</b><i>d </i>receives a live content generated in an image by each of the distributor terminals or the like performing a rendering operation, and transmits the live content to each terminal that has requested viewing to be provided to the viewing. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(C)</figref>, in the rendering with respect to the avatar, the position or the movement of each part of the appearance data <b>7</b>-<b>1</b> is obtained from the motion data <b>7</b>-<b>2</b>, and rendering data <b>7</b>-<b>3</b> of the avatar indicating the current position or the current movement of the avatar is generated. Note that, the rendering can be performed by using the appearance data <b>7</b>-<b>1</b> of the avatar that is still image data, and the data of the joint <b>7</b>-<b>2</b><i>a </i>or the ramus <b>7</b>-<b>2</b><i>b</i>, but not a video, and thus, the appearance data <b>7</b>-<b>1</b> is the still image data and has small data capacity, the data of the joint <b>7</b>-<b>2</b><i>a </i>or the ramus <b>7</b>-<b>2</b><i>b </i>is coordinate data or motion vector data of the limited number of points but not image data and has small capacity, and as a result thereof, it is possible to extremely decrease a load on a transmission path or hardware necessary for the transmission, the reception, the storage, or the rendering of the data. Further, insofar as the appearance data <b>7</b>-<b>1</b> of the avatar is designated by a uniform resource locator (URL) but not raw image data, it is possible to perform the transmission or the storage with smaller letter string data. Advantages thereof are to obtain the same effect regardless of which configuration of the system the appearance data or the motion data is generated, transmitted, stored, and rendered with, and are the common effect at the time of rendering the virtual object not limited to a human avatar. Note that, in the attached drawings, a schematic view of the avatar illustrated in each part is simply displayed, and the movement of four extremities are not written, but such illustration indicates the rendering data <b>7</b>-<b>3</b> of the avatar as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(C)</figref>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0078">As described below, a common distribution accepting unit <b>2</b><i>e </i>accepts an application for common distribution of the other live content during the current distribution, from a distributor terminal that is used by a distributor who stages and distributes a certain live content, and generates and transmits information for requesting the common distribution to a terminal of the other distributor staging the other live content.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0079">A program storage unit <b>2</b><i>f </i>stores a program for attaining each execution operation of the server <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0080">A user management unit <b>2</b><i>g </i>retains information of the distributor terminal that is used by the distributor staging each live content described above, the viewer terminal that is used by the viewer viewing the live content, and the distributor terminal that is used by the other distributor performing the common distribution of the live content and the viewer terminal that is used by the viewer thereof, as data such as an internet protocol (IP) address, and thus, it is possible to find which terminal a certain live content is transmitted to by using the information stored in the user management unit <b>2</b><i>g</i>, and therefore, in the this system <b>1</b>, a suitable live content is transmitted to a suitable terminal.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0081">In addition, the user management unit <b>2</b><i>g </i>also records information such as the history of a virtual item subjected to commitment in a virtual space that is used by each of the live contents, and the type of item.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0082">A commitment item accepting unit <b>2</b><i>h </i>accepts the commitment of a virtual item indicating support or praise with respect to the live content, from the terminal viewing the live content, and transmits the information of the virtual item to the distributor terminal staging the live content of the other person performing the commitment.

In addition, a sound production, an oscillation production, an animation production, and the like, associated with the production of such objects, may be added. The sound production, for example, may be the sound of the blasted firework or a sound effect of clinking wine glasses together, or may be a voice such as instrumental interlude or shout used in Kabuki or the like. At this time, in the case of performing a manipulation such as setting the virtual item to be subjected to the commitment to be transparent, it is also possible to perform a production in which only a sound is subjected to the commitment as a virtual item. In addition, similarly, a signal for operating an oscillation function may be transmitted to the distributor terminal and/or the viewer terminal at the time of the commitment of the virtual item, and the oscillation production may be added to the commitment of the virtual item.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0142">Physical calculation may be used in the control of the virtual item, and for example, it is possible to perform a production in which a fallen virtual item rebounds from the other object or the ground, a production in which the virtual item is broken by impact or the like and the hidden other object pops up, a production in which wine glasses subjected to the commitment are piled up to form a wine glass tower, a production in which a falling virtual item collides with a blowing virtual item, and various productions of holding, manipulating, or throwing the virtual item by using the avatar.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0143">In addition, another example of the virtual item is not merely a symbol, but can be a virtual item having a special function or effect, which is used for a specific object. As an example of the function, for example, in a case where the virtual item having a blast function such as a bomb is subjected to the commitment, the function can be a function of blasting the other virtual item, the object, the avatar, and the like after a certain period of time or by a predetermined trigger to be blown off or to disappear, or in a case where a virtual item having a moving function such as a living object or a machine is subjected to the commitment, the function can be a function of pressing the other virtual item, the object, the avatar, and the like or of causing a mutual interaction by the behavior of the virtual item.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0144">In addition, another example of the virtual item may be clothes, a ride, a building, a background, a small space occupying a part of the virtual space, and the like, and by using such virtual items, for example, it is possible to perform a production in which the avatar wears a costume subjected to the commitment as a virtual item, a production in which the avatar enters the building subjected to the commitment, a production in which the background subjected to the commitment is displayed as the background of the virtual space or as a part thereof, or a production in which the background of a special photograph or the like or a decorated small space such as a photographic frame (not limited to a three-dimensional space, but including a plane, a curved surface, and a segment) is subjected to the commitment as a virtual item, and the avatar enters the frame, and thus, the avatar performs image distribution from another field angle cut from another image.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0145">In addition, another example of the virtual item may be a virtual item in which the contents set at the time of the commitment of the commitment person or set in advance are reflected, but not a virtual item in a format set in advance. The set contents, for example, can be the contents of letters described in the virtual item, the color or the pattern of the virtual item, the shape of a part of the virtual item or the entire virtual item, the contents of the movement of a dynamic virtual item, the type of function of a virtual object having a function, the combination contents of single virtual items in a virtual item group in which a plurality of virtual items can be subjected to the commitment as a set, and the like. In addition, such set contents may be changed by the manipulation of the commitment person or a predetermined trigger, and even in a virtual item already subjected to the commitment in the broadcasting program or a virtual item subjected to the commitment in an image of the past, the set contents may be changed by the manipulation of a person having suitable authority or a predetermined condition.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0146">In addition, another example of the virtual item may be a virtual item in which additional information such as various numerical value data items included in information of the commitment person or item data is displayed. The additional information, for example, can be user information of the commitment person of the virtual item, a numerical value of a point necessary for obtaining the virtual item subjected to the commitment, a numerical value of a point that is given to the distributor or the broadcasting program, in accordance with the commitment of the virtual item, evaluation of the other viewer or the distributor with respect to the virtual item subjected to the commitment or the commitment person of the virtual item, and the like. In addition, a display part of the additional information, for example, can be the surface or the vicinity of the virtual item subjected to the commitment, an arbitrary location inside and outside the virtual space, associated with the virtual item subjected to the commitment, another tag, inside another window, and the like. In addition, the various numerical value data items may be a numerical value relevant to the commitment of each of the virtual items, or a numerical value relevant to the commitment of a plurality of virtual items belonging to an arbitrary category (for example, also including a sum, an average, a ranking, and the like).</p><p id="p-0154" num="0147">In addition, another example of the virtual item may be a virtual item having a counting function such as a vote. For example, in broadcasting in which there are a plurality of distributors, a popularity vote between the distributors, performed by the commitment of the virtual item of the viewer with respect to the own favorite distributor may be another example of the virtual item. In such broadcasting, it is possible to obtain a vote result by counting the total number of virtual items subjected to the commitment with respect to each of the distributors, a total value of various numerical value data items that are the additional information of the virtual item, or the like. In addition, a method at the time of designating to which distributor the viewer performs the commitment of the virtual item, for example, may be a method of giving an option to which distributor the commitment of the virtual item is performed at the time of performing the commitment of the virtual item or in advance, or may be a method in which when a dedicated virtual item of each of the distributors can be obtained and the dedicated virtual item is subjected to the commitment, the commitment is converted as the commitment of the virtual item with respect to the corresponding distributor. Further, the method may be a method in which a person performing the commitment of the virtual item may designate a commitment position, a movement direction, a track, or the like of the virtual item, or a method in which the virtual item is moved in the virtual space, in accordance with such designation, and thus, it is determined that a vote with respect to the contact avatar is performed.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0148">In addition, another example of the virtual item may be a virtual item having a function of accepting the obtainment of the virtual item corresponding to an actual product or the purchase of the actual product on the basis of a commitment record.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0149">In addition, as an example of a commitment method of the virtual item, as described above, the method has been described in which the person performing the commitment designates the commitment position, the movement direction, the track, or the like of the virtual item, but the commitment method is not limited thereto, and for example, a position in which the commitment can be performed, a movement method, a track, or the like may be set in advance for each virtual item. For example, a virtual item having required more points to be obtained may be preferentially subjected to the commitment in the center area of the virtual space.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0150">In addition, as an example of the production of the virtual item, the virtual item subjected to the commitment may be changed after a certain period of time or by a predetermined trigger. For example, a production in which the virtual item decreases in 10 seconds after the commitment, a production in which when the virtual items are piled up, the virtual items collapse to be small, a production in which the virtual item gradually becomes transparent and disappears, and a production in which when a certain number of virtual items or more are accumulated, the virtual items are broken into small pieces can be performed. According to such a production, for example, in a case where a volume of virtual items or a large virtual item are subjected to the commitment, the avatar that is manipulated by the distributor is hidden by the virtual item, and thus, it is possible to avoid a situation in which the amusingness of the distribution is reduced.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0151">In addition, an example of the production of the virtual item may be a production in which the virtual item subjected to the commitment is displayed on a part of the distributor terminals and/or the viewer terminals, and is not displayed on the other distributor terminals and/or viewer terminals. For example, the production may be a production in which the virtual item subjected to the commitment is displayed on a terminal of a viewer who performs the commitment of the virtual item, but is not displayed on a terminal of the other viewer, in accordance with the viewer. According to such a production, for example, it is possible to respond to a request of the viewer who wants to check the virtual item subjected to the commitment by the viewer but to avoid a situation in which the avatar of the distributor is not viewed by being buried in the virtual item viewed. In addition, the production may be a production in which the virtual item subjected to the commitment by the viewer is displayed on the distributor terminal, but is not displayed on all of the viewer terminals. According to such a production, for example, it is possible to respond to a request of the viewer who wants to represent the praise with respect to the distributor but to avoid a situation in which an element of the broadcasting program is disrupted by a volume of virtual items. In addition, the setting of such a production may be performed before the broadcasting of the broadcasting program, or may be determined and changed during the broadcasting. In addition, the setting of such a production may be manipulated by the distributor terminal, or may be manipulated by the viewer terminal.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0152">In addition, an example of the control of the virtual item may be control in which the number of virtual items subjected to the commitment is limited. For example, in the broadcasting of one broadcasting program, there may be an upper limit in the number of virtual items capable of being subjected to the commitment. In addition, even after the maximum number of virtual items are subjected to the commitment, the virtual items that can be subjected to the commitment again may be filled after a certain period of time has elapsed or by satisfying a certain condition. According to such control, for example, it is possible to avoid a situation in which only one type of virtual item is unevenly subjected to the commitment with respect to one broadcasting program, and to create an environment in which various virtual items are uniformly subjected to the commitment.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0153">In addition, an example of the control of the virtual item may be control of limiting a time for which the virtual item can be subjected to the commitment or an area in the virtual space in which the commitment can be performed. For example, the control may be control in which when the elapsed time counted from the start of the broadcasting of the broadcasting program is within a predetermined elapsed time, the commitment of the virtual item is inhibited or is partially limited. In addition, for example, the control may be control in which the commitment of the virtual item is temporarily inhibited or is partially limited, on the basis of the manipulation of a person with authority. Further, the control may be control in which with reference to the number of virtual items subjected to the commitment in the broadcasting program, the total area occupied by the virtual item, or other parameter, in a case where it is determined that the parameters are greater than a predetermined threshold value, the commitment of the virtual item is inhibited or is partially limited. In addition, for example, the control may be control in which the virtual space is divided into arbitrary areas, and with reference to the number of virtual items subjected to the commitment for each area, the total area occupied by the virtual item, or the other parameters, in a case where it is determined that the parameters are greater than the predetermined threshold value, the commitment of the virtual item is inhibited or is partially limited in the area. In addition, the control may be control in which when the parameters of the virtual item of the commitment, as described above, through the entire broadcasting program, are greater than the predetermined threshold value, the commitment of the other virtual items is not capable of being performed in a certain area of the virtual space (for example, an area in which the avatar exists), and the commitment of the other virtual items is permitted in the other areas (for example, areas in which the avatar does not exist). According to such control, it is possible to avoid a situation in which an element of the broadcasting program is disrupted by the commitment of a volume of virtual items.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0154">In addition, an example of the control of the virtual item may be control in which the virtual item does not hit the avatar. For example, the virtual item is set such that a physical mutual interaction occurs with respect to the other object, and the virtual item passes through only the avatar (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>(A)</figref>). In addition, for example, there is a transparent wall around the avatar, and the virtual item subjected to the commitment hits the transparent wall and bounces off, and thus, it is possible to perform setting such that the virtual item does not hit the avatar (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>(B)</figref>). According to such control, it is possible to avoid a situation in which an element of the broadcasting program is disrupted by the virtual item hitting the avatar.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0155">In addition, an embodiment in which the measure on the production of the virtual item to be subjected to the commitment is performed will be further described by including respects partially overlapping with the above description.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0156">In consideration of the configuration of performing the commitment of the virtual item in the three-dimensional virtual space in the system <b>1</b> of this example, a method that is implemented by the system is a method for performing moving image broadcasting from the server toward an unspecific viewing terminal through a network by using the three-dimensional virtual space as a target of drawing and transmission, and the method includes a step in which a drawing unit of the server performs drawing such that the commitment of the virtual object is performed in the three-dimensional virtual space, on the basis of a request from the viewing terminal, and the virtual object or the commitment operation of the virtual object has the following characteristics on the production.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0157">(A) A production in which the virtual object to be subjected to the commitment performs a mutual interaction with any virtual object in the three-dimensional virtual space, by imitating a physical action between actual objects in an actual space (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b>(A)</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b>(B)</figref>) . . . . For example, the production is a production in which when the virtual object is a rubber ball, the rubber ball subjected to the commitment in the virtual space hits the ground in the virtual space and bounces off. Alternatively, the production includes a collision between the virtual objects, elastic rebound after the collision, and the modification or the breakage of the virtual object by the collision. The viewer is capable of enjoying a realistic feeling.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0158">(B) A production in which a human avatar object in the three-dimensional virtual space is in contact with the virtual object subjected to the commitment . . . . In the example of the rubber ball described above, the production is a production in which the rubber ball that is a virtual object hits the avatar in the virtual space and bounces off, or the avatar kicks the rubber ball, in which it is also possible to have a realistic feeling.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0159">(C) A production in which the virtual object subjected to the commitment is an image frame in which an image is drawn, and a human avatar in the three-dimensional space is drawn in the image frame (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b>(C)</figref>) . . . . In a case where there is a target performer subjected to the commitment by the viewer, in a photographic frame, the target performer is zoomed in, and thus, there is an effect that both the performer and the viewer performing the commitment are remarkable. A letter may be input into the frame.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0160">(D) A production in which ranking information of the viewer terminal performing the commitment is displayed on the display screen of the viewing terminal . . . . The production is a production in which the viewer who often performs the commitment in the broadcasting program, the performer who often becomes a commitment target, or the like is displayed on a part of a moving image broadcasting screen, and thus, a so-called sense of exaltation of &#x201c;general election&#x201d; and a motivation for performing the commitment are enhanced.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0161">(E) A production in which a new virtual object that is a factor for the other virtual objects already subjected to the commitment to disappear is subjected to the commitment, on the display screen of the moving image broadcasting . . . . The commitment is also a popularity vote, and thus, the commitment may be concentrated on a popular moving image broadcasting program, and a popular section or scene, and a popular performer in the broadcasting program. In this case, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b>(C)</figref>, the moving image broadcasting screen is fully filled with the virtual items subjected to the commitment, and thus, it is not possible to enjoy the original broadcasting screen. Therefore, for example, the production is a production in which a bomb-type virtual item is subjected to the commitment to be blasted, and thus, the other virtual items are cleaned out. There is an element of surprise or an element of battle, and entertainment is appealed.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0162">(F) A production in which the virtual object subjected to the commitment is moved to a direction away from the viewpoint in the three-dimensional virtual space (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b>(A)</figref>) . . . . As described above, the production is a production in which a realistic feeling and a sense of immersion are imparted by using the fact that the virtual space is a three-dimensional space. On the contrary, a configuration is also considered in which the virtual item pops up to the near side from the depth side.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0163">(G) A production in which the virtual object to be subjected to the commitment is associated in advance with each target person in connection with the broadcasting, and display is performed for each target person or the attribute is changed, in accordance with the commitment . . . . For example, the performer is an idol group, commitment items different for each member of the group are prepared, and the viewer selects a dedicated item of the own favorite member. This is a type of popularity vote, and thus, it is possible to enjoy a sense of competition and game feeling. In addition, there is merit that when the commitment item is accompanied by an actual gift, it is possible to distribute the gifts in the members of the group.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0164">(H) A production in which voice display is performed in accordance with the execution of the commitment or the movement of the virtual object after the commitment . . . . In a case where the virtual object is firework, a plosive sound is produced, or when the virtual item hits the ground, a sound is produced. It is also considered that in the case of an animal-type item, a crying sound is produced.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0165">(I) A production in which each of the virtual items capable of being used in the commitment is displayed in advance on the display screen of the broadcasting . . . . There are a plurality types of virtual items, and the virtual items are displayed as a menu on the side of the broadcasting screen to be selected in a menu format. In a case where the type of virtual item is changed for each broadcasting program, is changed daily, or is randomly changed, a game element comes out.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0166">(J) A production in which the virtual item capable of being used in the commitment symbolizes a product, the purchase of the product is established by the commitment . . . . It is considered that the commitment of the virtual item is originally started from the support or the praise with respect to the broadcasting program or the performer (so-called &#x201c;Ohineri (wrapped offering)&#x201d;), and a service of high value is performed by using such a mechanism or system. In this production, as with online shopping, a product is selected on the broadcasting screen, and the commitment of the selected virtual item is performed as the expression of intention of the purchase, but it is not just a purchase but a feeling of participation in the broadcasting program, and the product may be explained in the broadcasting program, and thus, the production can be a business of high value.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0167">(K) A production in which letter information that is designated by the viewer who performs the commitment of the virtual item to be subjected to the commitment is displayed . . . . The posting of the comment with respect to the moving image broadcasting program has been already performed, but in the production, the posting is expanded to a commitment service of the virtual item. Since the letter information is displayed, a game feeling and a participation feeling are further enhanced after the expression of intention of the commitment person is performed.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0168">(L) A production in which the virtual item to be subjected to the commitment has an outer shape of a letter (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b>(D)</figref>) . . . . There is amusingness that a letter itself falls from the top.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0169">(M) A production in which the virtual object capable of being subjected to the commitment is different in accordance with the broadcasting program to be subjected to the moving image broadcasting . . . . The setting of a virtual item based on the contents of the broadcasting program leads to the excitement of the broadcasting program itself.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0170">(O) A production in which the virtual item to be subjected to the commitment is a daily item . . . . The commitment of the item is the support, the praise, or the like, and thus, in general, articles having a gift-giving feeling such as flowers or a trophy are often used, and famous architectural structures, towers of a landmark, or the like, are also often used. In contrast, in a case where daily items such as a washing machine and a refrigerator are used as articles having an element of surprise, which is not used for the above purpose, there is an element of surprise, which leads to excitement or appeal.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0171">(P) A production in which each of the virtual items to be subjected to the commitment has an upper limit number that can be subjected to the commitment . . . . It has been described that the commitment is concentrated on a popular broadcasting program or the like, but in a case where there is an upper limit in the number of times of the commitment, it is possible to prevent an excessive concentration, and it is also possible to maintain a commitment motivation from a rarity feeling.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0172">(Q) A production in which the human avatar object in the three-dimensional virtual space holds the virtual object subjected to the commitment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b>(B)</figref>) . . . . In a case where the avatar is moved by holding the virtual item subjected to the commitment, there is a feeling as if the performer receives &#x201c;Ohineri (wrapped offering)&#x201d;, and thus, a sense of achievement of the commitment can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0173">(R) A production in which the virtual item subjected to the commitment disappears after a predetermined period of time has elapsed from the commitment . . . . As described above, an excessive commitment concentration is prevented, which leads to a motivation for continuously performing the commitment.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0174">(S) A production in which an appearing position of the virtual item subjected to the commitment in the three-dimensional virtual space and/or the performance after the appearance are different in accordance with the attribute of the viewer performing the commitment . . . . There is a business operator dividing members of the video distribution (broadcasting) service into paid members and free members, and in order to treat the paid members or premium members preferentially, items subjected to the commitment by such members appear in front of the virtual space to be remarkable or appear near the performer, or a falling speed of the items is slowed down.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0175">(T) A moving image broadcasting system performing the moving image broadcasting from the server to each of the viewing terminals through a network by using the three-dimensional virtual space as the target of drawing and transmission, the system including a drawing unit performing the commitment and the drawing of a new virtual object in the three-dimensional virtual space, on the basis of a request from the viewer terminal, and a simulation calculation unit simulating a physical mutual interaction in the case of assuming that the existing virtual object already included in the three-dimensional virtual space and a virtual object to be newly subjected to the commitment are the actual object in the actual space, to reflect the result of the simulation in the drawing of the drawing unit . . . . As described above, the commitment virtual item may elastically rebound (bound) due to a collision with respect to the existing virtual item, and any one or both of the items may be described as being modified or broken inelastically. Alternatively, while both of the items are not in contact with each other, the items may rebound each other by the action of a magnetic field or an electric field, and may change the track traveling in the space.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0176">(U) A moving image broadcasting system performing the moving image broadcasting from the server toward each of the viewing terminals through a network by using the three-dimensional virtual space as the target of drawing and transmission, the system including a drawing unit performing the commitment and the drawing of a new virtual object in the three-dimensional virtual space, on the basis of a request from the viewer terminal, and a user interface unit performing manipulation instruction for performing a commitment manipulation used in the viewer terminal and/or information display based on the result of each commitment performed in advance by using each of the viewer terminals, with respect to the virtual object capable of being subjected to the commitment . . . . There is a method in which the virtual items that can be subjected to the commitment by the viewer are displayed in a row on the side of the display screen to be selected, there is also a method for including the commitment by representing information of the type of desired item and a desired time by performing the commitment as the broadcasting program, and insofar the name or an online name of the viewer with the largest number of times of the commitment and the largest number of points is displayed on the side of the screen, as a ranking of the items already subjected to the commitment, it can be an incentive.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0177">(V) A moving image broadcasting system performing the moving image broadcasting from the server toward each of the viewing terminals through a network by using the three-dimensional virtual space as the target of drawing and transmission, the system including a drawing unit performing the commitment and the drawing of a new virtual object in the three-dimensional virtual space, on the basis of a request from the viewer terminal, and an attribute determination unit changing at least any one of the availability of the commitment, a commitment mode, and a display mode after the commitment, in accordance with the attribute imparted in advance to at least any one of the viewing terminal to be used in the commitment, the viewer performing the commitment, and the virtual object to be used in the commitment, to be reflected in the drawing . . . . For example, in the moving image distribution service in which participation is basically free, in a case where only the paid members or the premium members are capable of performing the commitment of the item, a remarkable item different from the item of the free member is subjected to the commitment, or in the display screen of the virtual space, and the commitment can be performed such that the item is displayed in the foremost remarkable position, a motivation for joining the premium member is improved, and thus, it is possible to contribute to a business profit of the video distribution service. Such differentiation may be performed by the account of the video distribution service, or may be performed by a unique number of a registered terminal or the like (a personal computer or a smart phone, and a tablet terminal), and the number of a communication terminal (an IP address or the like). In addition, it may be a method in which for the virtual object, for example, an item that recommends the commitment for each broadcasting program or an item that prohibits the commitment is set, and the progress of the broadcasting program smoothly proceeds. In addition, in the case of performing different control in accordance with the attribute such as the type of viewer, viewer terminal, and virtual item, as described above, a difference in the locations appearing on the screen, a difference in flying modes in the virtual space, a difference in the length of time for appearance and continuation, and the like may be used as the behavior of the item after the commitment, in addition to the availability of the item commitment.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0178">(W) A server including a distribution unit distributing a live content in which the intervention of the viewer is allowed, a storage unit storing information for implementing the intervention of the viewer, a transmitting unit transmitting the information to the terminal of the viewer, a receiving unit receiving an implementation request of the intervention from the terminal, and a display control unit synthetically displaying electronic item on an image of the live content, on the basis of the implementation request in a case where the implementation request of the intervention is received, and in a case where a predetermined condition is satisfied, the display control unit limits the intervention of the viewer . . . . As described above, it is a method of inhibiting the subsequent commitment in a case where the number of times of the commitment of the virtual item reaches a predetermined limit or of limiting a time for the commitment of the virtual item.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0179">Here, a configuration for attaining various productions of the commitment virtual item, as described above, will be described again, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> describing the configuration or the like of the content distribution server <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0180">As described above, each virtual item used in the commitment has a distinctive appearance and performs a distinctive motion.
