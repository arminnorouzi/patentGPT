In JP-A-2018-200539 (Patent Literature 1), a task is divided into a plurality of scenes and partial operations performed in the scenes are specified based on a result of a learning content analysis performed in a learning initial stage. An operation allowable range is learned for each of the partial operations. Thereafter, the partial operations classified and learned for each of the scenes are combined and, then, learning for optimally performing a start to an end of an operation is performed. Since the operation allowable range is learned in advance, thereafter, it is possible to perform learning while avoiding performing an operation deviating from allowance requirements. As a result, it is possible to efficiently perform learning.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the technique of Patent Literature 1, all of predetermined operations are performed in the learning of the operation allowable range.

However, a force detector may detect only a force in a force controlling direction and only torque around an axis in the direction. It is also possible to adopt an aspect in which the force detector detects the torque of a joint of a robot, for example, based on a measurement value of an electric current of a servomotor rather than directly detecting a force and torque. That is, the force detector only has to be able to detect a force and torque in a direction for controlling a control point.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0160">(7) In the embodiments explained above, the adjustment of the force control parameters is performed by the setting device <b>600</b> connected to the robot control device <b>200</b> by radio or wire (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). However, the adjustment of the force control parameters may be performed by the robot control device <b>200</b> that causes the robot <b>100</b> to perform operation according to feedback control.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0161">(8) In the third embodiment explained above, the processing in steps S<b>300</b> to S<b>800</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is executed three times at most.

However, the optimization processing may be performed by another method such as Bayesian optimization, a grid search, a random search, or a Nelder-Mead method.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0163">(10) In the embodiments, the overshoot amount and the average operation speed are adopted as the indicator used for the determination in step S<b>440</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. However, the indicator used for the determination of the processing end condition can also be other indicators such as values obtained based on an operation time and a force measurement value.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0164">(11) In step S<b>500</b> in the first embodiment explained above, the penalty is calculated by multiplying the number of unexecuted evaluation motions among the N evaluation motions by the predetermined coefficient in the detection processing in step S<b>400</b>. However, the penalty may be calculated by another method. For example, the penalty may be calculated by multiplying a difference between an overshoot amount exceeding the constraint threshold and the constraint threshold by a predetermined coefficient in the detection processing in step S<b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0165">(12) In step S<b>600</b> in the first embodiment explained above, the objective function is the average operation speed and the evaluation value is calculated as follows.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>[Evaluation value]=[average operation speed]&#x2212;[penalty]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0200" num="0166">However, when the objective function is a function that is preferably small such as an operation time, the penalty is preferably added.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0167">(13) In the processing in step S<b>800</b> in the first embodiment explained above, the highlighting I<b>829</b> surrounded by the broken line is shown about the evaluation motion M<b>4</b> having the influence degree lower than the predetermined influence degree threshold (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).
