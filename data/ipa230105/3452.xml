However, the baked item does not absorb all of the generated heat. Further, many ovens are used to bake various types of items, which require varying baking conditions, and as such need to cool between bakes. Through conventional techniques, excess heat (i.e. heat not absorbed by the baked item) is wasted during the cool down process. For example, energy is generated to heat a product, and once the product is finished baking said energy dissipates without being applied to further uses. Additionally, conventional ovens fail to utilize renewable energy sources available via their environment.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various embodiments described herein can comprise systems, apparatuses, and/or methods that can utilize renewable energy sources to power one or more ovens and/or facilitate converting excess heat generated by an oven into electricity. Also, one or more embodiments described herein can comprise computer-implemented methods, systems, and/or computer program products to facilitate managing the conversion process and/or the use of renewable energy.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following presents a summary to provide a basic understanding of one or more embodiments of the invention.

For example, one or more embodiments described herein can control a cooling process facilitated by the oven system <b>100</b>.

The embodiments described herein can be implemented in conjunction with a cloud computer environment. However, it is to be understood that the embodiments described herein are also capable of being implemented in conjunction with any other type of computing environment.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Cloud computing can serve as a convenient and reliable technology for providing an entity with access to a shared pool of computer resources. For example, cloud computing technology can enable an entity to access various networks, servers, computerized devices, software applications, storage, and services comprising the cloud environment. Further, access to the computer resources in the cloud environment can be managed via minimal interaction between the entity and a service provider. In various embodiments, a cloud environment can comprise multiple characteristics, service models, and/or deployment models.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Example characteristics of a cloud environment can include, but are not limited to: on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and/or measured service. On-demand self-service can enable an entity to unilaterally provision computer resources (e.g., server time and network storage) as need automatically and with or without requiring human interaction with a provider of the computer resources. Cloud computing can provide broad network access over one or more networks via standard mechanisms that are compatible with various client platforms (e.g., mobile devise, computers, and/or personal digital assistants (PDAs).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In various cloud computing embodiments, a service provider's computing resources can be pooled to facilitate serving multiple entities simultaneously and/or sequentially. Different physical and/or virtual resources can be dynamically assigned and/or reassigned to meet the entity's demands. As such, entities utilizing the cloud environment generally have no control or knowledge over the exact location of the pooled resources but may identify a location with a high level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, and/or datacenter).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Additionally, cloud computing capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned. For example, said capabilities can be automatically provisioned to quickly scale out and rapidly scale in. For an entity consuming the services of the cloud environment, capabilities for provisioning can appear to appear vast and available in any desired quantity at any desired time. Cloud computing systems can also automatically control and optimize the use of computer resources by leveraging a metering capability at a level of abstraction in accordance with the type of service provided by the cloud environment (e.g., storage, processing, and/or bandwidth). Computer resources comprising the cloud environment can be monitored, controlled, and/or reported to provide transparency and/or accountability for a consuming entity and/or a provider of the cloud's services.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Example service models of cloud computing can include, but are not limited to: software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and/or infrastructure as a service (IaaS). In SaaS models, a service provider can enable an entity to use one or more applications (e.g., created by the provider) operating in a cloud infrastructure. Further, an entity can access an application on the cloud environment via one or more client interfaces such as a web browser. In other words, an entity utilizing the application can readily access the application through multiple platforms without having to maintain the cloud infrastructure.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In PaaS models, an entity can deploy their own applications on a cloud environment using programming tools supplied and/or supported by the provider of the cloud infrastructure. In IaaS models, the cloud environment provisions computer resources (e.g., processing, networks, and/or storage) for an entity to utilize when operating arbitrary software such as operating systems and applications. Thus, in the PaaS and/or IaaS models, the entity does not have control over the underlying cloud structure, but can control subject applications (e.g., the operating system) and configurations (e.g., networks and firewalls).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Example deployment models of cloud computing can include, by are not limited to: private clouds, community clouds, public clouds, and/or hybrid clouds. A private cloud model can be operated for a specific entity while denying access/services to alternate parties. The cloud can be managed by the specific entity or a third party and can be located on the entity's premises or off the entity's premises. A community cloud can be operated for a plurality of organizations that share a common interest and/or concern (e.g., common mission, common security requirements, common policy, and/or common compliance considerations). Like the private cloud, the community cloud can be managed by one or more of the plurality of organizations and/or a third party.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">A public cloud can be operated for the general public and/or a large group of entities (e.g., an industry). Further, public clouds can be owned by an organization that sells cloud services. A hybrid cloud can be a cloud infrastructure comprising two or more different deployment models (e.g., a private cloud and a community cloud). The various deployment models in the hybrid cloud structure can remain unique entities but be bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that can facilitate data and/or application portability (e.g., cloud bursting).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">A cloud computer environment can comprise one or more nodes, wherein each node can be a computerized device (e.g., a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a mobile device, a tablet, an automobile system, and/or the like) used by a consumer of cloud services. The nodes can be connected via one or more networks in order to facilitate communication between the nodes and access to the cloud environment. Further, the nodes can be physically and/or virtually grouped in one or more networks to enable one or more deployment models. One of the advantages of cloud computing is the ability to provide services to a consumer via a multitude of platforms without requiring the consumer to sustain and/or maintain computer resources on a specific device.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of an example, non-limiting system <b>800</b> that can facilitate management of the oven system <b>100</b>.
