One of the main intracellular proteolytic pathways involves the proteasome, which is responsible for the degradation of misfolded, oxidatively damaged and redundant proteins. In contrast to the 26S proteasome, which is primarily involved in ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), such a &#x3b1;-synuclein, and oxidatively damaged proteins are mainly targeted by the 20S proteasome for degradation. Disordered proteins are naturally short-lived, however basal levels are secured by forming proteolytically stable structured complexes with &#x201c;nannies&#x201d;, chaperones or other protein complexes. However, mutations, overexpression, or proteasome dysfunction induce the process of accumulation of these non-soluble species. When accumulation of intrinsically disordered proteins exceeds proper clearance in neurons, imbalanced pathway signaling or aggregation occurs, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Proteasome enhancers may offer a potential strategy to reduce the build-up of toxic proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies have illustrated the enormous potential of proteasome activation as a novel treatment strategy, but very few molecules have been identified as direct or indirect enhancers of the proteasome-degradation pathway. Described herein are various are compounds that enhance 20S proteolytic activity. While not wishing to be bound by any specific theory, it is believed that the compounds described herein enhance 20S proteolytic activity via a ligand-20S proteasome interaction, which induces the selective degradation of disordered protein, &#x3b1;-synuclein over structured proteins in vitro. To that end, the disclosure generally relates to compounds (e.g., compounds of the formulae (d) and (II)) that are believed to act as proteasome enhancers or activators and can be used to treat disorders resulting from the accumulation of intrinsically disordered proteins that cannot be properly cleared.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosure also relates to compound of the formula (I):</p><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="26.67mm" wi="57.07mm" file="US20230002335A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0008" num="0000">or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, polymorph, prodrug, solvate or clathrate thereof;<br/>wherein:<br/>X is halo;<br/>X<sup>1 </sup>is O, S or NR<sup>3</sup>, wherein R<sup>3 </sup>is alkyl or arylalkyl;<br/>R<sup>1 </sup>is H, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted aryloxy or halo;<br/>R<sup>2 </sup>is H, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted aryloxy or halo;<br/>A is alkylenyl, arylenyl, alkenylenyl or alkynylenyl, each of which can be substituted or unsubstituted;

A &#x201c;pharmaceutical composition&#x201d; refers to a chemical or biological composition suitable for administration to a subject (e.g., mammal). Such compositions can be specifically formulated for administration via one or more of a number of routes, including but not limited to buccal, cutaneous, epicutaneous, epidural, infusion, inhalation, intraarterial, intracardial, intracerebroventricular, intradermal, intramuscular, intranasal, intraocular, intraperitoneal, intraspinal, intrathecal, intravenous, oral, parenteral, pulmonary, rectally via an enema or suppository, subcutaneous, subdermal, sublingual, transdermal, and transmucosal. In addition, administration can by means of capsule, drops, foams, gel, gum, injection, liquid, patch, pill, porous pouch, powder, tablet, or other suitable means of administration.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0028">A &#x201c;pharmaceutical excipient&#x201d; or a &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable excipient&#x201d; comprises a carrier, sometimes a liquid, in which an active therapeutic agent is formulated. The excipient generally does not provide any pharmacological activity to the formulation, though it may provide chemical and/or biological stability, and release characteristics. Examples of suitable formulations can be found, for example, in Remington, The Science And Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition, (Gennaro, A. R., Chief Editor), Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, 2000, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0029">As used herein &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&#x201d; or &#x201c;excipient&#x201d; includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents that are physiologically compatible. The carrier is suitable for, among other applications, parenteral administration. Alternatively, the carrier can be suitable for intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, sublingual, or oral administration. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the pharmaceutical compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0030">Pharmaceutical compositions can be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0031">In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin. Moreover, the compounds described herein can be formulated in a time release formulation, for example in a composition that includes a slow release polymer. The active compounds can be prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, polylactic acid and polylactic, polyglycolic copolymers (PLG). Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0032">Oral forms of administration are also contemplated herein. The pharmaceutical compositions can be orally administered as a capsule (hard or soft), tablet (film coated, enteric coated or uncoated), powder or granules (coated or uncoated) or liquid (solution or suspension). The formulations can be conveniently prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art. The pharmaceutical compositions can include one or more suitable production aids or excipients including fillers, binders, disintegrants, lubricants, diluents, flow agents, buffering agents, moistening agents, preservatives, colorants, sweeteners, flavors, and pharmaceutically compatible carriers.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0033">The compounds can be administered by a variety of dosage forms as known in the art. Any biologically-acceptable dosage form known to persons of ordinary skill in the art, and combinations thereof, are contemplated. Examples of such dosage forms include, without limitation, chewable tablets, quick dissolve tablets, effervescent tablets, reconstitutable powders, elixirs, liquids, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, tablets, multi-layer tablets, bi-layer tablets, capsules, soft gelatin capsules, hard gelatin capsules, caplets, lozenges, chewable lozenges, beads, powders, gum, granules, particles, microparticles, dispersible granules, cachets, douches, suppositories, creams, topicals, inhalants, aerosol inhalants, patches, particle inhalants, implants, depot implants, ingestibles, injectables (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, and intradermal), infusions, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0034">Other compounds which can be included by admixture are, for example, medically inert ingredients (e.g., solid and liquid diluent), such as lactose, dextrosesaccharose, cellulose, starch or calcium phosphate for tablets or capsules, olive oil or ethyl oleate for soft capsules and water or vegetable oil for suspensions or emulsions; lubricating agents such as silica, talc, stearic acid, magnesium or calcium stearate and/or polyethylene glycols; gelling agents such as colloidal clays; thickening agents such as gum tragacanth or sodium alginate, binding agents such as starches, arabic gums, gelatin, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose or polyvinylpyrrolidone; disintegrating agents such as starch, alginic acid, alginates or sodium starch glycolate; effervescing mixtures; dyestuff; sweeteners; wetting agents such as lecithin, polysorbates or laurylsulphates; and other therapeutically acceptable accessory ingredients, such as humectants, preservatives, buffers and antioxidants, which are known additives for such formulations.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0035">Liquid dispersions for oral administration can be syrups, emulsions, solutions, or suspensions. The syrups can contain as a carrier, for example, saccharose or saccharose with glycerol and/or mannitol and/or sorbitol. The suspensions and the emulsions can contain a carrier, for example a natural gum, agar, sodium alginate, pectin, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, or polyvinyl alcohol.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0036">The amount of active compound in a therapeutic composition can vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, gender, weight, patient history, risk factors, predisposition to disease, administration route, pre-existing treatment regime (e.g., possible interactions with other medications), and weight of the individual. Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, a single bolus can be administered, several divided doses can be administered over time, or the dose can be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of therapeutic situation.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0037">&#x201c;Dosage unit form,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms are dictated by and can be directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals. In therapeutic use for treatment of conditions in mammals (e.g., humans) for which the compounds disclosed herein or an appropriate pharmaceutical composition thereof are effective, the compounds disclosed herein can be administered in an effective amount. The dosages as suitable for this disclosure can be a composition, a pharmaceutical composition or any other compositions described herein.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0038">The dosage can be administered once, twice, or thrice a day, although more frequent dosing intervals are possible. The dosage can be administered every day, every 2 days, every 3 days, every 4 days, every 5 days, every 6 days, and/or every 7 days (once a week). The dosage can be administered daily for up to and including 30 days, preferably between 7-10 days. Or the dosage can be administered twice a day for 10 days. If the patient requires treatment for a chronic disease or condition, the dosage can be administered for as long as signs and/or symptoms persist. The patient may require &#x201c;maintenance treatment&#x201d; where the patient is receiving dosages every day for months, years, or the remainder of their lives. In addition, the composition can effect prophylaxis of recurring symptoms. For example, the dosage can be administered once or twice a day to prevent the onset of symptoms in patients at risk, especially for asymptomatic patients.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0039">The compositions described herein can be administered in any of the following routes: buccal, epicutaneous, epidural, infusion, inhalation, intraarterial, intracardial, intracerebroventricular, intradermal, intramuscular, intranasal, intraocular, intraperitoneal, intraspinal, intrathecal, intravenous, oral, parenteral, pulmonary, rectally via an enema or suppository, subcutaneous, subdermal, sublingual, transdermal, and transmucosal. The preferred routes of administration are buccal and oral. The administration can be local, where the composition is administered directly, close to, in the locality, near, at, about, or in the vicinity of, the site(s) of disease, e.g., inflammation, or systemic, wherein the composition is given to the patient and passes through the body widely, thereby reaching the site(s) of disease. Local administration can be administration to the cell, tissue, organ, and/or organ system, which encompasses and/or is affected by the disease, and/or where the disease signs and/or symptoms are active or are likely to occur. Administration can be topical with a local effect, composition is applied directly where its action is desired. Administration can be enteral wherein the desired effect is systemic (non-local), composition is given via the digestive tract. Administration can be parenteral, where the desired effect is systemic, composition is given by other routes than the digestive tract.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0040">Also contemplated herein are compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds that are useful in a method for reducing the accumulation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), including &#x3b1;-synuclein, tau, SOD1, polyQ, oxidatively damaged proteins, c-Fos, c-Myc, and the BCL-2 family of disordered proteins, in a subject, the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds of the formula (I) and/or (II) to a patient in need thereof.
