An observation target in a subject is subjected to treatment, such as administration of a photosensitive substance, such as 5-aminolevulinic acid (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;5-ALA&#x201d;). An operating surgeon, such as a medical doctor, may let a subject, such as a patient, take a solution of 5-ALA. The substance, 5-ALA, is a natural amino acid naturally included in living organisms, such as animals and plants. This substance, 5-ALA, is taken into cells after administration into the body, and is formed into protoporphyrin by biosynthesis in mitochondria. This protoporphyrin accumulates excessively in cancer cells. Furthermore, protoporphyrin excessively accumulated in cancer cells are photoactive. Therefore, when excited by excitation light (for example, the blue visible light of the wavelength band of 375 nm to 445 nm), protoporphyrin emits fluorescence (for example, red fluorescence of a wavelength band of 600 nm to 740 nm). The PDD observation is thus observation where photodynamic diagnosis is used.
