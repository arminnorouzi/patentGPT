A typical OLED comprises an anode, a hole transport layer HTL, an emission layer EML, an electron transport layer ETL, and a cathode, which are sequentially stacked on a substrate. In this regard, the HTL, the EML, and the ETL are thin films formed from organic compounds.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When a voltage is applied to the anode and the cathode, holes injected from the anode move to the EML, via the HTL, and electrons injected from the cathode move to the EML, via the ETL. The holes and electrons recombine in the EML to generate excitons. When the excitons drop from an excited state to a ground state, light is emitted. The injection and flow of holes and electrons should be balanced, so that an OLED having the above-described structure has excellent efficiency and/or a long lifetime.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Performance of an organic light emitting diode may be affected by characteristics of the semiconductor layer, and among them, may be affected by characteristics of metal complexes which are also contained in the semiconductor layer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There remains a need to improve performance of organic semiconductor materials, semiconductor layers, as well as organic electronic devices thereof, in particular to achieve improved operating voltage stability over time through improving the characteristics of the compounds comprised therein.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0000">Additionally, there is a need to provide compounds with improved thermal properties.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0006">An aspect of the present invention provides an organic electronic device comprising an anode, a cathode, at least one photoactive layer and at least one semiconductor layer, wherein the at least one semiconductor layer is arranged between the anode and the at least one photoactive layer;

Exemplary embodiments of respective layers are described in the following:</p><p id="p-0116" num="0156">Substrate</p><p id="p-0117" num="0157">The substrate may be any substrate that is commonly used in manufacturing of, electronic devices, such as organic light-emitting diodes. If light is to be emitted through the substrate, the substrate shall be a transparent or semitransparent material, for example a glass substrate or a transparent plastic substrate. If light is to be emitted through the top surface, the substrate may be both a transparent as well as a non-transparent material, for example a glass substrate, a plastic substrate, a metal substrate or a silicon substrate.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0158">Anode Electrode</p><p id="p-0119" num="0159">The anode electrode may be formed by depositing or sputtering a material that is used to form the anode electrode. The material used to form the anode electrode may be a high work-function material, so as to facilitate hole injection. The anode material may also be selected from a low work function material (i.e. aluminum). The anode electrode may be a transparent or reflective electrode. Transparent conductive oxides, such as indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), tin-dioxide (SnO2), aluminum zinc oxide (AlZO) and zinc oxide (ZnO), may be used to form the anode electrode. The anode electrode may also be formed using metals, typically silver (Ag), gold (Au), or metal alloys.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0160">Hole Injection Layer</p><p id="p-0121" num="0161">A hole injection layer (HIL) may be formed on the anode electrode by vacuum deposition, spin coating, printing, casting, slot-die coating, Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) deposition, or the like. When the HIL is formed using vacuum deposition, the deposition conditions may vary according to the compound that is used to form the HIL, and the desired structure and thermal properties of the HIL. In general, however, conditions for vacuum deposition may include a deposition temperature of 100&#xb0; C. to 500&#xb0; C., a pressure of 10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>to 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>Torr (1 Torr equals 133.322 Pa), and a deposition rate of 0.1 to 10 nm/sec.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0162">When the HIL is formed using spin coating or printing, coating conditions may vary according to the compound that is used to form the HIL, and the desired structure and thermal properties of the HIL. For example, the coating conditions may include a coating speed of about 2000 rpm to about 5000 rpm, and a thermal treatment temperature of about 80&#xb0; C. to about 200&#xb0; C. Thermal treatment removes a solvent after the coating is performed.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0163">The HIL may be formed of any compound that is commonly used to form a HIL. Examples of compounds that may be used to form the HIL include a phthalocyanine compound, such as copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), 4,4&#x2032;,4&#x2033;-tris (3-methylphenylphenylamino) triphenylamine (m-MTDATA), TDATA, 2T-NATA, polyaniline/dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (Pani/DBSA), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS), polyaniline/camphor sulfonic acid (Pani/CSA), and polyaniline)/poly(4-styrenesulfonate (PANI/PSS).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0164">The HIL may comprise or consist of p-type dopant and the p-type dopant may be selected from tetrafluoro-tetracyanoquinonedimethane (F4TCNQ), 2,2&#x2032;-(perfluoronaphthalen-2,6-diylidene) dimalononitrile or 2,2&#x2032;,2&#x2033;-(cyclopropane-1,2,3-triylidene)tris(2-(p-cyanotetrafluorophenyl)acetonitrile) but not limited hereto. The HIL may be selected from a hole-transporting matrix compound doped with a p-type dopant. Typical examples of known doped hole transport materials are: copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), which HOMO level is approximately &#x2212;5.2 eV, doped with tetrafluoro-tetracyanoquinonedimethane (F4TCNQ), which LUMO level is about &#x2212;5.2 eV; zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) (HOMO=&#x2212;5.2 eV) doped with F4TCNQ; &#x3b1;-NPD (N,N&#x2032;-Bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N&#x2032;-bis(phenyl)-benzidine) doped with F4TCNQ. &#x3b1;-NPD doped with 2,2&#x2032;-(perfluoronaphthalen-2,6-diylidene) dimalononitrile. The p-type dopant concentrations can be selected from 1 to 20 wt.-%, more preferably from 3 wt.-% to 10 wt.-%.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0165">The thickness of the HIL may be in the range from about 1 nm to about 100 nm, and for example, from about 1 nm to about 25 nm. When the thickness of the HIL is within this range, the HIL may have excellent hole injecting characteristics, without a substantial penalty in driving voltage.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Hole Transport Layer</heading><p id="p-0126" num="0166">A hole transport layer (HTL) may be formed on the HIL by vacuum deposition, spin coating, slot-die coating, printing, casting, Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) deposition, or the like. When the HTL is formed by vacuum deposition or spin coating, the conditions for deposition and coating may be similar to those for the formation of the HIL.

The triarylamine compound may have a LUMO level closer to vacuum level than the LUMO level of the hole transport layer.

Thereby, higher efficiency of light emission from a phosphorescent emission layer can be achieved. The triplet control layer is selected from triarylamine compounds with a triplet level above the triplet level of the phosphorescent emitter in the adjacent emission layer.

The VTE source is heated at a constant rate of 15 K/min at a pressure of less than 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>mbar and the temperature inside the source measured with a thermocouple. Evaporation of the compound is detected with a QCM detector which detects deposition of the compound on the quartz crystal of the detector. The deposition rate on the quartz crystal is measured in {acute over (&#x212b;)}ngstrom per second. To determine the rate onset temperature, the deposition rate is plotted against the VTE source temperature. The rate onset is the temperature at which noticeable deposition on the QCM detector occurs. For accurate results, the VTE source is heated and cooled three time and only results from the second and third run are used to determine the rate onset temperature.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0283">To achieve good control over the evaporation rate of an organic compound, the rate onset temperature may be in the range of 200 to 255&#xb0; C. If the rate onset temperature is below 200&#xb0; C. the evaporation may be too rapid and therefore difficult to control. If the rate onset temperature is above 255&#xb0; C. the evaporation rate may be too low which may result in low tact time and decomposition of the organic compound in VTE source may occur due to prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0284">The rate onset temperature is an indirect measure of the volatility of a compound.
