standard, wherein DIN 70121 includes only the DC charging mode, while ISO 15118 includes both AC and DC charging mode.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The ISO 15118 is an international standard for defining the communication between the electric vehicle (<b>100</b>) and the electric vehicle charger (<b>200</b>). In addition, the Plug &#x26; Charge (PnC) defines a technique for automatic authentication of the user for using the charging service. PnC is an automatic authentication technology that automatically processes all processes such as electric vehicle user authentication, charging, and billing.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">EVCC (Electric Vehicle Communication Controller) of the electric vehicle (<b>100</b>) proceeds to slack to find the PLC modem of the electric vehicle charger (<b>200</b>) through the remaining one TCP/IP port.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The electric car charger (<b>200</b>) confirms the customer/user information for the electric vehicle (<b>100</b>) for charging, based on the customer information stored in advance as the slack progresses.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The electric vehicle charger (<b>200</b>) sends and receives messages about the additional services with the electric vehicle (<b>100</b>) once it is confirmed as an existing customer.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Then, the electric vehicle charger (<b>200</b>) informs the back-end server (<b>300</b>) that it is now connected to the customer's car to the back-end server <b>300</b>, confirms if the driver has requested a diagnosis of the vehicle, and bring it in if there is a diagnostic request from the driver.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The diagnostic request includes, but not limited to, a malfunction diagnosis of the vehicle, battery status diagnosis, software version information and the like.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The electric vehicle charger (<b>200</b>) receives a diagnostic request received from the back-end server (<b>300</b>), checks the failure diagnosis, battery status diagnosis, software version information, etc. of the vehicle, and generates a diagnostic log for the relevant diagnostic request.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the electric vehicle charger (<b>200</b>) delivers the diagnostic log generated by itself to the back-end server (<b>300</b>), the back-end server (<b>300</b>) delivers a vehicle status by passing the diagnostic log to the driver terminal (<b>400</b>).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">On the other hand, the electric vehicle charger (<b>200</b>) confirms the software version information, and update the version, by using what was downloaded in the back-end server (<b>300</b>) from the electric vehicle manufacturer (<b>500</b>), or by directly connecting to the vehicle manufacturer server (<b>500</b>) to download and update any software needed for the operation of the electric vehicle.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The electric vehicle manufacturer server (<b>500</b>) provides basic information, such as software, mounted battery information, etc. related to the electric vehicle (<b>100</b>) to the back-end server (<b>300</b>) for managing the electric vehicle charger (<b>200</b>), as described above.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> describes the charging method by the electric vehicle charging system that can provide additional services according to the present invention

the electric vehicle (<b>100</b>) such as the vehicle model, vehicle identification number, battery specifications, manufacturer, etc. to the back-end server (<b>300</b>) through the driver terminal (<b>400</b>).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">First, the driver of the electric vehicle (<b>100</b>) enters the electric vehicle charging station in order to charge the vehicle due to lack of power in the vehicle battery and connects the charging gun of the electric vehicle charger (<b>200</b>) to the charging port of the electric vehicle (<b>100</b>).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">That is, the electric vehicle charger (<b>200</b>) performs the step (S<b>100</b>) of detecting the connection with the electric vehicle (<b>100</b>) through the charging cable according to the charging attempt of the driver.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the electric vehicle charger (<b>200</b>) detects the connection of the electric vehicle (<b>100</b>) in the step S<b>100</b>, it performs the step of
