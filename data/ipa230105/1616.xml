More specifically the disclosure relates to methods of making MOF extrudates which preserve the structural integrity of the MOF material and strengthen the mechanical strength of the MOF extrudate.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Materials displaying a large internal surface area, defined by pores or channels, are of predominant interest for applications in catalysis, for absorption and/or adsorption techniques, ion exchanging, chromatography, storage and/or uptake of substances, among others.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Among the many various strategies to create microporous and/or mesoporous active materials, the formation of metal-organic frameworks (&#x201c;MOFs&#x201d;) using metal ions and molecular organic building blocks is particularly advantageous. MOF materials provide many advantages including: (i) larger pore sizes can be realized than for the zeolites used presently; (ii) the internal surface area is larger than for porous materials used presently; (iii) pore size and/or channel structure can be tailored over a large range; and/or (iv) the organic framework components of the internal surface can be functionalized easily.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">MOFs are hybrid materials composed of metal ions or clusters coordinated to multi-topic organic linkers that self-assemble to form a coordination network. These materials have wide-ranging potential uses in many different applications including gas storage, gas separation, catalysis, sensing, environmental remediation, etc. In many of these applications, shaped particles are often used to avoid large pressure drops in a reactor bed or to ease material handling. Shaping of materials can embody various forms such as extrudates, rings, pellets, spheres, etc. In order to decrease the generation of fines during shipping or during application, shaped particles must have sufficient mechanical strength to withstand compressive force generated by process conditions or by the pressure exerted by the weight of the catalyst bed. However, extrusion of materials comprising MOFs is a relatively unexplored field that is required for the formulation of these novel materials for multiple applications.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">MOFs can be damaged during the extrusion process from the high pressure and temperature and other conditions. Furthermore, binders are often required to improve the mechanical strength of the resulting extrudates, but many binders are incompatible with MOFs, primarily based on a lack of compatible surfaces.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, a need exists for methods of making MOF extrudates without degrading the structural integrity of the MOF materials as well as improve the mechanical strength of the MOF extrudate.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure relates to methods of making metal-organic framework extrudates using one or more extrusion aids to reduce pressure during the extrusion process and preserve the structural integrity of the metal-organic framework.

In certain embodiments, MOF coordination networks of organic ligands and metals (or metalloids) form porous three-dimensional structures.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, the term &#x201c;MOF extrudate&#x201d; refers to the MOF material that has been extruded. The MOF extrudate comprises one or more metal organic-framework materials processed with at least one an extrusion aid, and can also include optional solvents and other additives such as binders, pore formers, lubricants, rheological auxiliaries and other materials (e.g., metal powders) which can contribute to stability.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Generally, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a relatively new class of highly porous materials with potential applications in a wide range of fields including gas storage, gas and liquid separations, isomer separation, waste removal, and catalysis, among others. In contrast to zeolites, which are purely inorganic in character, MOFs utilize organic ligands which can function as &#x201c;struts&#x201d; bridging metal atoms or clusters of metal atoms together. Like zeolites, MOFs are microporous. The pore shape and size of the MOF can be tuned through selection of the organic ligands and metals. Because organic ligands can be modified, MOFs as a whole are structurally diverse which is different than zeolites. Factors that influence the structure of MOFs include, for example, one or more of ligand denticity, size and type of the coordinating group(s), additional substitution remote or proximate to the coordinating group(s), ligand size and geometry, ligand hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity, choice of metal(s) and/or metal salt(s), choice of solvent(s), and reaction conditions such as temperature, concentration, and the like.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">MOFs are synthesized or obtained commercially as loose, unconsolidated microcrystalline powder materials. For many industrial and commercial products, shaping powder-form MOFs into larger, coherent bodies having a defined shape is desirable. Conventional methods of consolidating powder-form MOFs into large bodies, such as pelletizing and extrusion, have often times afforded less than desirable physical and mechanical properties. Specifically, processing of powder-form MOFs through compaction may result in BET surface areas that are considerably lower than those of the powder-form MOF due to pressure sensitivity of the MOF structure and crush strength can be relatively low. Further, the wrong processing conditions can lead to full or partial phase transformation of the initial MOF structure, as evidenced by x-ray powder diffraction and BET surface area analyses. Each of these factors can be problematic for producing MOF extrudates in the form of shaped bodies and/or using these shaped bodies in various applications.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">While it is desirable to consolidate a metal-organic framework (MOF) powder material into a more coherent (shaped) body comprising a metal-organic framework material (&#x201c;MOF material&#x201d;), the properties of MOF materials, specifically their weakness against pressure and shear, may lead to various issues such as the intense pressures (e.g., about 100 psi to several thousand psi) and shear used to consolidate powder-form MOFs, particularly during extrusion, may collapse at least a portion of the pores within the MOF structure and lead to an undesirable and oftentimes significant decrease in BET surface area. Conditions used for consolidating powder-form MOFs into a shaped body can lead to at least partial and sometimes full conversion of the MOF structure into another material, such as another crystalline phase. Consolidated. MOFs (such as MOF extrudates) having poor crush strength can be problematic. For example, poor crush strength values can lead to production of fines, which may be detrimental to certain applications</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Therefore, the present disclosure provides methods of making MOF extrudates with decreased MOF deformation, increased MOF surface area and increased crush strength. The present methods combine one or more extrusion aids with the MOF material to produce the MOF extrudate. Extrusions aids useful in the present methods include one or more of a liquid extrusion aid, solid extrusion aid and/or polymeric extrusion aid.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Methods for producing the MOF extrudates of the present disclosure can involve agitating a mixture of a pre-crystallized MOF powder material (MOF material) and the extrusion aid to form a dough or paste that is suitable for extrusive processing. Agitation may occur by mulling in some instances. Mulling can be distinguished from milling in that mulling to does not apply a constant pressure and is gentler in terms of a lesser amount of force (energy) being applied during mixing. Mulling typically does not impart sufficient energy to the MOF to promote complete conversion of the MOF structure into another crystalline phase. Some MOFs are unstable toward input of even modest amounts of energy, and formation of a minor new crystalline phase can still occur even under the gentle mulling conditions disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The MOF materials disclosed herein may be characterized in terms of their porosity. The MOF materials may include micropores, mesopores, macropores and any combination thereof. Micropores are defined herein as having a pore size of about 2 nm or below, and mesopores are defined herein as having a pore size from about 2 nm to about 50 nm. Interparticle textural porosity may be present in some instances.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Desirably, MOF extrudates formed according to the disclosure herein retain at least a substantial majority of the BET surface area of the pre-crystallized metal-organic framework powder material from which they are formed. Specifically, the metal-organic framework material within the MOF extrudates may feature a BET&#x2032; surface area of about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or greater relative to the BET surface area of the pre-crystallized metal-organic framework powder material. Advantageously and surprisingly in some instances, the BET surface area of the metal-organic framework consolidated material within the extrudates may even be greater than the BET surface area of the pre-crystallized metal-organic framework powder material. Pelletized samples may feature similar BET surface areas of the metal-organic framework consolidated material.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As described herein, the MOF can be ZIFs (or Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks), MILs (or Mat&#xe9;riaux de l'Institut Lavoisier), and IRMOFs (or IsoReticular Metal Organic Frameworks), alone or combination with other MOFs. In certain embodiments, the MOF is selected from: HKUST-1, MOF-74, MIL-100, ZIF-7, ZIF-8, ZIF-90, UiO-66, UiO-67, MOF-808 or MOF-274.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The MOF can be prepared via combination of an organic ligand, or one or a combination of two or more organic ligands, and a metal or metalloid as described below. For example, MOF-274 is a combination of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup> or combinations thereof with 4,4&#x2032;-dihydroxy-(1,1&#x2032;-biphenyl)-3,3&#x2032;-dicarboxylic acid.

The present methods also include the step of extruding the extrudate mixture to form the MOF extrudate. The present methods of making MOF extrudates include production of granules, or shaped-bodies. As such, in certain embodiments, the MOF extrudate is formed and shaped or granulated to form granules or shaped-bodies.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">The present methods can further include the step of washing the extrudate with an optional solvent and can include the steps of drying and/or calcining the MOF extrudate. The optional solvent can include water, alcohols, ketones, amides, esters, ethers, nitriles, aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and combination(s) thereof. In certain embodiments, the optional solvent is selected from the group consisting of water, methanol, ethanol, dimethylformamide, acetone, diethylether, acetonitrile, and combination(s) thereof. In certain embodiments, the optional solvent is water. In certain embodiments, the optional solvent is a mixture of two or more solvents. The optional solvent can be used to wash the MOF material and/or MOF extrudate during different stages of the process.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">The step of mixing can be performed in any suitable manner including, such as dry blending the individual components and subsequently melt mixing in a mixer, or mixing the components together directly in a mixer, such as, for example, a Banbury mixer, a Haake mixer, a Brabender internal mixer, high shear mixer, drum mixer, or a single or twin-screw extruder, which can include a compounding extruder and a side-arm extruder used directly downstream of a polymerization process, which can include blending powders or pellets of the MOF material at the hopper of the extruder. In certain embodiments, the steps of mixing and extruding are simultaneous, such as when the MOF material and the extrusion aid are mixed in the extruder and extruded. Alternatively, the MOF material and the extrusion aid are mixed with the optional solvent before extrusion.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">The MOF material and the extrusion aid can be premixed as dry materials. The order of addition of the components (MOF material, extrusion aid, optional solvent) will be a function of the targeted material. It is possible either to add the extrusion aid, the MOF material, and optional solvent in any order, the most suitable order is determined by the type of mixers employed.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">As described herein, the step of mixing can be accomplished by methods of materials processing and unit operations. If the mixing occurs in the liquid phase, stirring can be used, if the mass to be mixed is paste-like, kneading and/or extruding can be used. Solid components and powders can be combined in mixers. The use of atomizers, sprayers, diffusers or nebulizers is conceivable as well, if the state of the components to be used allows the use thereof. For MOF materials that are paste-like or powder-like the use of static mixers, planetary mixers, mixers with rotating containers, pan mixers, pug mills, shearing-disk mixers, centrifugal mixers, sand mills, trough kneaders, internal mixers, internal mixers and continuous kneaders can be desired. The mixing step can be sufficient to achieve the molding or extruding, such as when mixing and extruding coincide.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">Further, the step of mixing can be continuous or batch processed. In the case where mixing is batch processed, the present methodologies can be carried out in a mixer equipped with Z arms, or with cams, or in another type of mixer, such as a planetary mixer. The step of mixing can provide a homogenous mixture of the pulverulent constituents. Mixing can take place for a duration of 5 to 60 min, such as 10 to 50 min and the maximum mixing time should be no longer than 60 minutes. The speed of rotation of the mixer arms can be 10 to 75 rpm, such as 25 to 50 rpm.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">The MOF extrudate mixture can include from 1 wt % to 99 wt %, such as from 5 wt % to 99 wt %, from 7 wt % to 99 wt %, or from 10 wt % to 95 wt % of the MOF material; from 1 wt % to 99 wt %, such as from 1 wt % to 90 wt %, from 1 wt % to 50 wt %, or from 1 wt % to 20 wt % of the extrusion aid (including optional additives), and optionally from 0 wt % to 20 wt %, such as from 1 wt % to 15 wt %, from 1 wt % to 10 wt %, or from 1 wt % to 7 wt % of the optional solvent. The percentages by weight being expressed with respect to the total quantity of compounds and/or powders in the mixture and the sum of the quantities of each of the compounds and the powders in the mixture being equal to 100%. In certain embodiments, the MOF extrudate mixture includes from about 20 wt % to about 70 wt % solids, based on the total weight of the MOF extrudate mixture.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">For the present methods, the step of extruding (the extrusion step) can take place in a single or twin-screw ram extruder. In the case where preparation of the MOF material is carried out continuously with extrusion, the mixing can be couple with extrusion in one or more pieces of equipment. According to this implementation, the extrusion of the MOF extrudate mixture, also called &#x201c;kneaded paste&#x201d;, can be carried out either by extruding directly at the end of a continuous mixer of the twin-screw type for example, or by connecting one or more batch mixers to an extruder. The geometry of the die, which gives the extrudates their shape, can be selected from any suitable die, such as cylindrical, multilobed, grooved shape, or slitted.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">Extrusion can be affected by the quantity of the extrusion aid together with any optional solvent added, and can be adjusted to obtain a mixture or a paste that does not flow and is not overly dry, so as to allow its extrusion under suitable conditions of pressure dependent on the extrusion equipment used. In certain embodiments, the extrusion is carried out at an extrusion pressure of about 0.1 MPa or more, such as from about 0.1 MPa to about 20 MPa, from about 2 MPa to about 15 MPa, or from about 3 MPa to about 10 MPa.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">The MOF extrudate can include be pelletized and the product be in the form of the MOF extrudate or MOF extrudate pellets. However, it is not excluded that the MOF materials obtained are then, for example, introduced into equipment for rounding their surface, such as a tumbler or any other equipment for spheronization.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">MOF extrudates can have a diameter from about 1 to about 10 mm, such as from about 1.5 to about 5 mm. In certain embodiments, the mixture is extruded through a die with a diameter of from about 0.01 mm to about 50 mm, such as from about 0.05 mm to about 40 mm, from about 0.1 mm to about 20 mm, from about 0.2 mm to about 10 mm, or from about 0.5 mm to about 7 mm. Such extrusion apparatuses are described, for example, in Ullmann's Enzylop&#xe4;ddie der Technischen Chemie, 4th Edition, Vol. 2, p. 295 et seq., 1972. In addition to the use of an extruder, an extrusion press can also be used.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">MOF extrudates can also optionally undergo maturation, such as drying or setting the MOF extrudate. The maturation can include temperatures of about 0&#xb0; C. to about 300&#xb0; C., about 20&#xb0; C. to about 200&#xb0; C., or about 20&#xb0; C. to about 150&#xb0; C. The maturation can take place for a duration of about 1 min to about 72 h, such as about 30 min to about 72 h, about 1 h to about 48 h, or about 1 h to about 24 h. In certain embodiments, the maturation can be carried out in air or humidified air with a relative humidity of 20% to 100%, such as 70% to 100%. The treatment with humidified gas can allow for hydration of the material, which can be beneficial to setting certain extrusion aids. In certain embodiments, the maturation can be carried out in air or inert gas that is dehumidified, such as air with a relative humidity of 0% to 10%, or of 0% to 5%.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">The MOF extrudate or matured MOF extrudate can also optionally undergo activation. Activation can take place at temperatures of about 50&#xb0; C. to about 500&#xb0; C., such as about 100&#xb0; C. to about 300&#xb0; C. Activation can take place for a duration of about 1 hour (&#x201c;h&#x201d;) to about 6 h, such as about 1 h to about 4 h. Activation can aid in removal of solvent used for facilitating the extruding of the mixture. The activation can take place in air, inert gas, or a mixture containing oxygen. Additionally, activation can take place at reduced or increased pressure, such as in vacuo or pressures greater than atmospheric pressure. In certain embodiments, the extrudates are calcined under dry air or air with different levels of humidity or they are heat-treated in the presence of a gas mixture including an inert gas, such as nitrogen and/or oxygen. In certain embodiments, the gas mixture used can include 5 vol % or more, such as 10 vol % or more oxygen. In alternative embodiments, the gas mixture is free of or substantially free of oxygen and include only inert gases. The calcination temperature can be from about 50&#xb0; C. to about the degradation temperature of the MOF material.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Properties of MOF Extrudates</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0085">MOF extrudate prepared with the present methods can have a bulk crush strength of from about 0.2 lb-force to about 80 lb-force, such as about 0.4 lb-force to about 50 lb-force, from about 1 lb-force to about 20 lb-force, or from about 4 lb-force to about 15 lb-force.

In the case of an application in the areas of catalysis and separation, the expected value of ACS is greater than 0.9 daN/mm, such as greater than 1 daN/mm. Therefore, the MOF extrudates described have sufficient mechanical strength to be used in areas of catalysis and separation.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">The MOF extrudates can be used in processes where a porous body or a body with channels provides an advantage over solid bodies or powders. In particular, such applications include: catalysts, support for catalysts, sorption, storage of fluids, desiccants, ion exchanger materials, molecular sieves (separators), materials for chromatography, materials for the selective release and/or uptaking of molecules, molecular recognition, nanotubes, nano-reactors.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">In certain embodiments of applications, the MOF extrudates are used as catalysts in fixed bed/packed bed reactors. In principle, the MOF extrudates can be used in gas phase reactions or in liquid phase reactions, in which case the solid shaped bodies are suspended in a slurry. Additionally, the MOF extrudates can be used to catalyze various reactions where the presence of channels and/or pores incorporated therein are known or believed to increase the activity and/or selectivity and/or yield of the reaction.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">Another application is the storage of compounds, especially of gaseous compounds.

Samples were extruded through the 1/16&#x2033; cylinder die on the HTME hand press. The 2% graphite sample did not reduce the pressure of the extrusion process and retained most of the HKUST-1 surface area. The inclusion of 20% graphite substantially reduced the pressure. Also, this is significantly lower than the pressure required for the same solids content without graphite (GJM-2016-33396, MTK-017). Furthermore, the surface area of 1327 m2/g, when weighted to account for the graphite, exhibits 94% retention of surface area, indicating that the graphite is not blocking the pores of the HKUST-1 material. It appears that 20 wt. % or less of graphite can reduce pressure in the extruder while retaining the properties of the metal-organic framework in the extrudate.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0102">Another extrusion aid tested was polyvinyl alcohol, or PVA. PVA was used as the polymeric extrusion aid in the extrusion of both ZIF-8 and HKUST-1. By adding small percentages of polyvinyl alcohol with polyvinyl acetate as a binder, the crush strength was shown to improve. For example, the crush strength of HKUST-1 was improved from 53 to 213 lb/in with the addition of 2 wt % polyvinyl alcohol, yielding an important retention of surface area as well compared with the same extrusion without polyvinyl alcohol. Table 4 immediately below shows crush strength and BET surface area of these two metal-organic frameworks (PVA: polyvinyl alcohol, PVAc/DI: polyvinyl acetate/deionized water (w/w)). The crush strength of the MOF extrudates were measured in accordance with ASTM D7084 on a Varian VK200. BET surface was measured in accordance with ASTM D3663.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 4</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Crush Strength and BET Surface Area of ZIF-8 and HKUST-1</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>BET</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>PVAc/DI</entry><entry>PVA</entry><entry>Crush Strength</entry><entry>Surface Area</entry></row><row><entry>MOF</entry><entry>Ratio</entry><entry>(wt %)</entry><entry>(lb<sub>force</sub>/in)</entry><entry>(m<sup>2</sup>/g)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>ZIF- 8</entry><entry>50/50</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>53</entry><entry>978</entry></row><row><entry>ZIF- 8</entry><entry>25/75</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>134</entry><entry>1190</entry></row><row><entry>HKUST-1</entry><entry>25/75</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>105</entry><entry>626</entry></row><row><entry>HKUST-1</entry><entry>25/75</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>53</entry><entry>660</entry></row><row><entry>HKUST-1</entry><entry>25/75</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>213</entry><entry>905</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0108" num="0103">Extrusions with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) demonstrate significantly higher crush strength than those without PVA. PVA as an extrusion aid can help improve crush strength while simultaneously allowing for improved mechanical stability. Additionally, the inclusion of extrusion aids does not negatively affect the crystallinity or the surface area of the MOF material, as demonstrated with a variety of extrusion aids and a variety of MOF materials having different metal nodes, pore sizes, and crystalline structures. Different types of extrusion aids for MOF materials are provided in this disclosure. The common thread between them is that each extrusion aid enables extrusion of MOF materials by maintaining the quality and porosity of the MOF material while also producing MOF extrudates having sufficient quality for use in industrial applications. For certain MOFs, extrusion with a mixture of water and ethanol is required to mitigate heat of adsorption induced degradation of the MOF upon exposure to liquid water. As described above, ethanol was replaced with longer chain alcohols, which offer similar benefits to ethanol but also reduce pressure buildup during the extrusion. Pressure reduction is crucial to maintaining the MOF crystallinity and porosity during exposure to high pressures in extrusion of MOF materials. Furthermore, pressure limits on the larger screw extruders that are used to manufacture catalyst extrudates at scale require reduced pressure during extrusion.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0104">As noted above, extrusion of metal-organic frameworks is a relatively unexplored field, but one that is required to formulate these new materials for use in various applications. Due to their lack of rigidity, MOFs can be damaged from the high pressure and temperature experienced in the conditions in which the MOF is exposed to during the extrusion process. Furthermore, binders are often required to improve the mechanical strength of the resulting extrudates. However, many binders are incompatible with MOFs, primarily based on a lack of compatible surfaces. Therefore, we provide herein methods to make the MOF extrudates with different extrusion aids that reduce pressure during extrusion to preserve the structural integrity of the MOF material as well as improve the mechanical strength of the MOF extrudates. Interestingly, improvements in pressure reduction can be achieved both through the use of solvents that do not remain in the final extrudate, as well as solid extrusion aids that do remain in the final extrudate. Use of the extrusion aid provides a novel approach not previously been addressed.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
