The parallel link mechanism includes a fixed part mounted to a distal part of the arm mechanism, and a movable part that is mounted to the fixed part via multiple parallel links and is movable with respect to the fixed part. The end effector is mounted to the movable part. The detector is provided for detecting a position or orientation of a control point. The control device controls the arm mechanism and the parallel link mechanism. The control device performs a first operation of setting a posture of the control point to a first posture by moving the arm mechanism, the first posture being prescribed, and a second operation of setting the posture of the control point to a task posture in which the end effector performs a task by moving the parallel link mechanism based on a detection result of the detector after the first operation. Between the first operation and the second operation, the control device performs calculation processing of calculating a displacement amount of the posture of the control point to the task posture based on the detection result of the detector, and determination processing of determining whether or not the displacement amount is within a range of movement of the movable part. When the displacement amount exceeds the range of movement, the control device performs the second operation after causing the posture of the control point to approach the task posture by moving the arm mechanism.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Exemplary embodiments will now be described with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The drawings are schematic or conceptual; and the relationships between the thickness and width of portions, the proportional coefficients of sizes among portions, etc., are not necessarily the same as the actual values thereof. In the specification of the application and the drawings, components similar to those described in regard to a drawing thereinabove are marked with like reference numerals, and a detailed description is omitted as appropriate.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating a robot system according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the robot system <b>1</b> according to the embodiment includes an arm mechanism <b>100</b>, a parallel link mechanism <b>200</b>, an end effector <b>300</b>, a detector <b>400</b>, and a control device <b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The arm mechanism <b>100</b> includes multiple links <b>110</b> and multiple rotary shafts <b>120</b>. One end of each link <b>110</b> is linked by the rotary shaft <b>120</b> to the other one ends. One link <b>110</b> rotates with respect to the other links <b>110</b> when the rotary shaft <b>120</b> is driven by a motor.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The parallel link mechanism <b>200</b> is mounted to the distal part of the arm mechanism <b>100</b>. Specifically, among the multiple links <b>110</b>, the parallel link mechanism <b>200</b> is mounted to any part of the links <b>110</b> at one end. Among the multiple links <b>110</b>, the links <b>110</b> at the other end are linked to a base <b>130</b>. The base <b>130</b> is fixed to an installation location such as a floor, a wall, another mechanism, etc.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The parallel link mechanism <b>200</b> includes a fixed part <b>210</b>, a movable part <b>220</b>, a link <b>230</b>, and multiple actuators <b>240</b>. The fixed part <b>210</b> is mounted to the distal part of the arm mechanism <b>100</b>. The movable part <b>220</b> is mounted to the fixed part <b>210</b> via the multiple links <b>230</b>. The multiple links <b>230</b> are located in parallel between the fixed part <b>210</b> and the movable part <b>220</b>. The multiple links <b>230</b> are linked respectively to the multiple actuators <b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, the multiple actuators <b>240</b> are motors and are mounted to the fixed part <b>210</b>. When the multiple actuators <b>240</b> respectively drive the multiple links <b>230</b>, the driving force is transferred to the movable part <b>220</b>, and the movable part <b>220</b> moves with respect to the fixed part <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The posture of the fixed part <b>210</b> corresponds to the posture of the distal part of the arm mechanism <b>100</b> and is determined by the movement of the arm mechanism <b>100</b>. Here, the posture means the position and the orientation. The posture is determined by the positions in three mutually-orthogonal directions (an X-direction, a Y-direction, and a Z-direction) and the angles (rolling, pitting, and yawing) around each direction. The posture of the movable part <b>220</b> is changeable with respect to the posture of the fixed part <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is favorable for the arm mechanism <b>100</b> to have not less than four degrees of freedom. For example, the arm mechanism <b>100</b> is a vertical articulated robot and has six degrees of freedom. In other words, the arm mechanism <b>100</b> can control the position of the distal end of the arm mechanism <b>100</b> in each of the three directions and the angle of the distal end around each of the three directions.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Similarly, it is favorable for the parallel link mechanism <b>200</b> to have not less than four degrees of freedom. For example, the parallel link mechanism <b>200</b> has six degrees of freedom. In other words, the parallel link mechanism <b>200</b> can control the position of the movable part <b>220</b> in each of the three directions and the angle of the movable part <b>220</b> around each of the three directions.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The end effector <b>300</b> is mounted to the movable part <b>220</b>. In other words, the end effector <b>300</b> is mounted to the arm mechanism <b>100</b> via the parallel link mechanism <b>200</b>. The posture of the end effector <b>300</b> is determined by the movement of the arm mechanism <b>100</b> and the movement of the parallel link mechanism <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The detector <b>400</b> detects the position or orientation of the control point. The control device <b>500</b> adjusts the posture of the control point by controlling the arm mechanism <b>100</b> and the parallel link mechanism <b>200</b>. A control point is a point for which the position and the orientation are controlled by the control device <b>500</b>. For example, a control point is set to any one point of the movable part <b>220</b>. Or, the control point may be set to any one point of the end effector <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The detector <b>400</b> includes, for example, at least one of a distance sensor, an optical position sensor, or a camera. The position or the orientation detected by the detector <b>400</b> may be absolute or may be relative. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the detector <b>400</b> is mounted to the movable part <b>220</b>. The end effector <b>300</b> and the detector <b>400</b> are fixed with respect to the movable part <b>220</b>. Therefore, the posture of the detector <b>400</b> corresponds to the posture of the control point.
