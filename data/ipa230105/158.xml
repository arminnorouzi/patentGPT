In particular, the invention is directed to aerosol generating devices comprising a convection heating element.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Aerosol generating devices commonly employ convection heaters which heat air that is used to heat an aerosol generating substrate to generate an aerosol or vapor. However, current convection heater configurations have several drawbacks. If the convection heater is configured as a heating plate, the heating plate only affords a small contact surface for air to be heated and thus results in an inhomogeneous and weak heating performance. Other configurations employ a heating element combined with a heat diffuser which either distributes the heat generated by the heating element or diffuses the air heated by the heater to achieve a more homogeneous heating of an aerosol generating substrate. It further can serve the purpose of assisting in allowing the heating element itself to heat up in a more homogeneous manner, to possibly avoid thermal runaways. However, since the heat diffuser is not an active heating element, heating performance is lacking.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Therefore, it is an objective of the present disclosure to provide a convection heater which affords improved heating performance and/or more homogeneous heating of the heater.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above objective is achieved by the invention as defined by the features of the independent claims. Advantageous preferred embodiments thereof are defined by the features of the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a first aspect, the invention provides an aerosol generating device, comprising a chamber configured to at least partially receive an aerosol generating substrate, an air flow path extending through the chamber, a convection heater positioned upstream of the chamber in a flow direction through the air flow path, and a heating element comprising a porous structure, configured such that air that is to flow through the air flow path is caused to pass the heating element to reach the chamber. The porous structure of the heating element provides a higher heating surface to volume ratio in contrast to a heating element in the shape of a plate or rod. This allows air passing through the porous structure to be effectively and uniformly heated.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a first preferred embodiment according to the first aspect of the invention, the heating element consists of or comprises a sintered metallic material. Using a sintered metallic material is advantageous because the sintering process already affords a porous structure without the need for machining steps when, for example, attempting to create a porous structure from a solid piece of metallic material.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a second preferred embodiment according to any one of the preceding embodiments of the invention, the heating element comprises a metallic material having a low temperature coefficient of resistance &#x3b1;. Having a lower temperature coefficient of resistance means that even when the metallic material heats up, the electric resistance of the metallic materials is barely changed. This is advantageous because it suppresses occurrence of hot spots in the heating elements, and thus reduces the probability of a thermal runaway that could result in catastrophic failure of the heater and/or heating damage to the aerosol generating device and potentially to a user of the aerosol generating device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a third preferred embodiment according to any one of the preceding embodiments of the invention, the temperature coefficient of resistance &#x3b1; is between 0.0000 and 0.001, preferably between 0.0000 and 0.0009, more preferably between 0.0000 and 0.0008, even more preferably between 0.0000 and 0.0007, even more preferably between 0.0000 and 0.0006, even more preferably between 0.0000 and 0.0005, even more preferably between 0.0000 and 0.0004, even more preferably between 0.0000 and 0.0003, even more preferably between 0.0000 and 0.00025, even more preferably between 0.0000 and 0.0002, even more preferably between 0.0000 and 0.00015.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a fourth preferred embodiment according to any one of the first to third preferred embodiments of the invention, the metallic material comprises stainless steel, NiCr, CuNi, NiCrAl and/or SiCrN, preferably NiCr.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a fifth preferred embodiment according to any one of the preceding embodiments of the invention, the aerosol generating device comprises a conduction heater component configured to heat at least parts of the aerosol generating substrate. By having an additional conduction heater, the aerosol generating device is capable of generating aerosol from aerosol generating substrates that require or prefer conduction heating such as, for example, tobacco based aerosol generating substrates.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a sixth preferred embodiment according to any one of the preceding embodiments of the invention, the heating element is provided with a first electrode that is a bias plate and a second electrode that is a grounding plate. By providing a bias contact and grounding contact in the shape of a plate, a more uniform heating of the heating element may be achieved due to a more spatially homogeneous current flow through the heating element. As an example, voltage larger than 3 V, preferably larger than 4 V, more preferably larger than 5 V, most preferably larger than 6 V may be applied to the bias plate.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a seventh preferred embodiment according to the sixth preferred embodiment of the invention, the heating element is disposed between the bias plate and the grounding plate. This further affords a more homogeneous heating of the heating element due to a more homogenous electric field due of such an arrangement.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an eighth preferred embodiment according to any one of the sixth to the seventh preferred embodiments of the invention, at least one of the bias plate and the grounding plate comprises pores configured to allow air to flow through the bias plate and/or grounding plate. By providing pores in the bias plate and/or the grounding plate, air may pass through the heating element from sides where the bias plate and/or the grounding plates are provided, thus increasing the air flow rate through the heating element.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a ninth preferred embodiment according to the preceding embodiments, the porosity of the bias plate and/or the grounding plate is larger than the porosity of the porous structure of the heating element, and in a tenth preferred embodiment according to any one of the eighth or ninth preferred embodiments of the invention, the average pore size of the bias plate and/or the grounding plate is larger than the average pore size of the porous structure of the heating element. These two embodiments are advantageous because they allow the heating element to be the rate limiting factor for the air flow rate through the heating element and not the bias plate and/or the grounding plate, thus ensuring an ample supply of air to pass through the heating element.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an eleventh preferred embodiment according to any one of the seventh to tenth preferred embodiments of the invention, the bias plate is provided with a bias connection arranged substantially in the center of the bias plate.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a twelfth preferred embodiment according to any one of the seventh to eleventh preferred embodiments of the invention, the grounding plate is provided with one or more grounding connections that ground the grounding plate, wherein the one or more grounding connections are arranged at one or more positions along the circumference of the grounding plate. The grounding connections may assist in providing an improved or steadier ground connection for the grounding plate.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a thirteenth preferred embodiment according to the fourteenth embodiment, the grounding plate is provided with one or more ballast resistors arranged at positions corresponding to the one or more grounding connections. Ballast resistors provided with the grounding connections improve the reliability and longevity of the heating element as the ballast resistors balance out current differences at each grounding connection and thus ensure a more homogenous spatial current flow through the heating element and thus a more homogenous spatial heating of the heating element.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a fourteenth preferred embodiment according to any of the preceding embodiments of the invention, the porous structure is a microporous structure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a fifteenth preferred embodiment according to the fourteenth preferred embodiment of the invention, the average pore size of the porous structure of the heating element is in the range of 0.025 mm&#xb1;0.02 mm, preferably 0.025 mm&#xb1;0.01 mm, more preferably 0.025 mm &#xb1;0.005 mm, most preferably 0.025 mm&#xb1;0.0025 mm.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a sixteenth preferred embodiment according to any one of the tenth to thirteenth preferred embodiments of the invention, the average pore size of the grounding plate and/or the bias plate is between 100-400 &#x3bc;m, preferably between 150-350 &#x3bc;m, more preferably between 175-325 &#x3bc;m, even more preferably between 200-300 &#x3bc;m, even more preferably between 225-275 &#x3bc;m, and most preferably between 240-260 &#x3bc;m.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a schematic cross-section of an aerosol generating device with a convection heater according to embodiments of the invention;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a schematic perspective view of a convection heater according to embodiments of the invention;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C and <b>2</b>D</figref> illustrate schematic top views of a bias plate, a grounding plate and a heating element, respectively, according to embodiments of the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferred embodiments of the present invention are described herein after and in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an aerosol generating device <b>100</b> may comprise a housing <b>110</b>.
