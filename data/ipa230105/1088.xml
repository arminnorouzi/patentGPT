description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A conventional medicament delivery device may deliver medicament at basal dosages and/or bolus dosages. The basal dosages are delivered on an-ongoing basis and aim to address a substantial portion of the need for the medicament on an on-going basis. The bolus dosages are delivered when requested by a user or when the control system for the medicament delivery device concludes based on information regarding the user that there is a need to deliver the bolus dosage. In some instances, the basal dosages are delivered automatically by the medicament delivery device to the user. The control system is generally responsible for determining the timing and the dosages for such medicament deliveries.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One example of a conventional medicament delivery device is an insulin delivery device, such as an insulin pump or patch. The conventional insulin delivery device may calculate a basal dosage based on total daily insulin (TDI). TDI represents the aggregate amount of insulin needed by the user for a day. TDI is typically calculated based on the weight of the user. A commonly used formula is that TDI equals user weight in pounds divided by 4. Thus, the TDI for a 200-pound man is 200 divided by 4 or 50 units of insulin. The basal dosage is conventionally determined to be one half of TDI.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Insulin boluses are typically delivered in response to meals by the user. The meals will increase the user's blood glucose concentration. The magnitude of the increase in blood glucose concentration is related to the quantity of carbohydrates ingested. Thus, a conventional insulin delivery device may determine what dosage of insulin will compensate for the quantity of carbohydrates ingested. In order to determine the amount of insulin needed and hence the bolus dosage, the conventional insulin delivery system may multiply the carbohydrates ingested by the insulin to carbohydrates ratio (ICR). The ICR conventionally may be set as a value typically selected from the range of 4 to 50. For example, a value of 4 for the ICR implies that 1 unit of insulin is to be delivered for every 4 grams of carbohydrates ingested. The conventional insulin delivery system may also look at the current blood glucose concentration and the insulin on board (IOB) for the user, which represents the quantity of insulin delivered to user that still has insulin action remaining.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with an inventive aspect of an embodiment, a method is performed by a processor in an electronic device. The method includes receiving information regarding a menstrual cycle of a user and based on the received information regarding a menstrual cycle of a user, adjusting a medicament dosage to be delivered by an automated medicament delivery device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The received information may be a current phase of a menstrual cycle of the user. The received information may be received from a machine learning model. The received information may be information from which a current phase of the menstrual cycle is determined. The received information may include information from one or more sensors secured to the user. The medicament may be one of insulin, glucagon or a glucagon peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist. The adjusting may include adjusting an insulin dosage to be delivered by the automated medicament delivery device based on an insulin sensitivity of the user for a current phase of the menstrual cycle of the user.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with another inventive feature of an embodiment, a method is performed by a processor in an electronic device. The method includes receiving input from a sensor. Based at least in part on the received input, a phase of a menstrual cycle of a user is determined with the processor. The method also includes determining insulin sensitivity of the user with the processor based on the determined phase of the menstrual cycle and adjusting the insulin delivered by a delivery device based on the determined insulin sensitivity.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The sensor may sense skin temperature, heart rate, skin conductance, or activity level. The method may further include receiving additional inputs from multiple sensors and using the additional inputs in the determining of the phase of the menstrual cycle of the user. The additional inputs from the multiple sensors may include a blood glucose concentration value for the user from one of the sensors that is a glucose monitor. The adjusting may adjust a size of a dosage of basal insulin to be delivered by the delivery device. The adjusting may adjust a size of dosage of an insulin bolus to be delivered by the delivery device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with an additional aspect of an embodiment, a method is performed by a processor in an electronic device. Per the method, patterns of medicament sensitivity of a user based on a phase of a menstrual cycle of a user are learned by a machine learning model executing on the processor. Delivery of medicament to the user are adjusted by the processor based on the learned patterns to be delivered by a medicament delivery device to the user.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The method may further include receiving input from at least one sensor that senses information regarding the user and processing the input to determine a current phase of the menstrual cycle of the user. The input may include heart rate and skin temperature. The input may include blood glucose concentration and an indication of activity level. The learning may include training on a data set derived from women other than the user and subsequent to the training on the data set, training on data from the user to customize the machine learning model to the user. The medicament may be one of insulin, glucagon or a glucagon peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist, for example.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The true medicament dosage needs of a user may vary from user to user. Moreover, the true medicament needs of a given user may vary over ranges of days or weeks and may vary even during a single day. Unfortunately, conventional medicament delivery devices do not account for many of these variations in medicament dosage needs. For example, a user's medicament dosage needs may vary based on the menstrual cycle of the user. One instance of this variation is that insulin sensitivity of a user may vary over the course of the menstrual cycle. Conventional insulin delivery devices do not account for this variation in insulin sensitivity due to the menstrual cycle phase of the user. This can be problematic in that the insulin needs of the user change over the course of the menstrual cycle of the user, but the conventional insulin delivery devices do not adjust for the change. As a result, the user may be at greater risk of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Exemplary embodiments described herein account for the differing needs of the user over the menstrual cycle of the user to better control the blood glucose concentration of the user. The exemplary embodiments may be realized in control systems for medicament delivery devices that deliver medicaments, such as medicaments that regulate blood glucose concentration levels. Examples of such medicaments that regulate blood glucose concentration levels include insulin, glucagon, and glucagon peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists. The exemplary embodiments are able to better tailor the dosages of the medicament delivered to the user with the medicament delivery device to reduce the risk of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia and help reduce blood glucose concentration excursions.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Some exemplary embodiments may use sensors, such as sensors of heart rate, skin temperature, skin conductance, and blood glucose concentration. The sensed values obtained from these sensors may be used to automatically determine a current phase of a menstrual cycle of the user. Once the current phase of the menstrual cycle is known the basal dosages and/or the bolus dosages automatically may be adjusted to account for changes associated with the phase. The adjustments may be made over time as new phases of the menstrual cycle are reached.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The exemplary embodiments may use a machine learning system to identify the phase of the menstrual cycle of the user from values obtained from the sensors. The machine learning system may learn the normal duration of each phase of the menstrual cycle as well as the normal length of a menstrual cycle for the user. The machine learning system may also learn how medicament sensitivity (such as insulin sensitivity) of the user varies over the course of the menstrual cycle for the user. In particular, the patterns of variance in magnitude and time may be learned.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some exemplary embodiments, the machine learning system may rely upon a machine learning model that may utilize logistic regressors, random forests, deep learning networks, etc. The machine learning model may be trained on a data set derived from a large population of women and then may be customized to the user. Alternatively, the machine learning model may be trained solely on data derived from the user. The trained machine learning model may be used to identify the current phase of the menstrual cycle of the user.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some exemplary embodiments no machine learning system is used. Instead, conventional logic may be used to identify the current phase of the menstrual cycle of the user. In other exemplary embodiments, a user identifies when the user's menstrual cycle began, and may also identify how long her menstrual cycle typically lasts, and that information from the user is used by the control system to adjust the medicament dosages.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts an illustrative medicament delivery system <b>100</b> that is suitable for delivering a medicament to a user <b>108</b> in accordance with exemplary embodiments. The medicament delivery system <b>100</b> includes a medicament delivery device <b>102</b>. The medicament delivery device <b>102</b> may be a wearable device that is worn on the body of the user <b>108</b> or carried by the user and having an infusion site. The medicament delivery device <b>102</b> may be directly coupled to a user (e.g., directly attached to a body part and/or skin of the user <b>108</b> via an adhesive or the like) or carried by the user (e.g., on a belt or in a pocket) with tubing connecting the medicament delivery device <b>102</b> to an infusion site where the medicament is injected.

In addition, the controller <b>110</b> may be operable to receive data or information. The storage <b>114</b> may include both primary memory and secondary memory. The storage may include random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), optical storage, magnetic storage, removable storage media, solid state storage or the like.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The medicament delivery device <b>102</b> may include one or more housings for housing its various components including a pump <b>113</b>, a power source, and a reservoir <b>112</b> for storing a medicament for delivery to the user <b>108</b> as warranted. A fluid path to the user <b>108</b> may be provided, and the medicament delivery device <b>102</b> may expel the medicament from the reservoir <b>112</b> to deliver the medicament to the user <b>108</b> using the pump <b>113</b> via the fluid path. The fluid path may, for example, include tubing coupling the medicament delivery device <b>102</b> to the user <b>108</b> (e.g., tubing coupling a cannula to the reservoir <b>112</b>), and may include tubing to a separate infusion site.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">There may be one or more communications links with one or more devices physically separated from the medicament delivery device <b>102</b> including, for example, a management device <b>104</b> of the user and/or a caregiver of the user and/or a sensor <b>106</b>. The communication links may include any wired or wireless communication links operating according to any known communications protocol or standard, such as Bluetooth&#xae;, Wi-Fi, a near-field communication standard, a cellular standard, or any other wireless protocol. The medicament delivery device <b>102</b> may also include a user interface <b>117</b>, such as an integrated display device for displaying information to the user <b>108</b> and in some embodiments, receiving information from the user <b>108</b>. The user interface <b>117</b> may include a touchscreen and/or one or more input devices, such as buttons, knobs, or a keyboard.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The medicament delivery device <b>102</b> may interface with a network <b>122</b>. The network <b>122</b> may include a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN) or a combination therein. A computing device <b>126</b> may be interfaced with the network, and the computing device may communicate with the medicament delivery device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The medicament delivery system <b>100</b> may include sensors <b>106</b> for sensing the levels of one or more analytes. The sensors <b>106</b> may be coupled to the user <b>108</b> by, for example, adhesive or the like and may provide information or data on one or more medical conditions and/or physical attributes of the user <b>108</b>. The sensors <b>106</b> may be physically separate from the medicament delivery device <b>102</b> or may be an integrated component thereof.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The medicament delivery system <b>100</b> may or may not also include a management device <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, a management device is not needed as medicament delivery device <b>102</b> may manage itself. The management device <b>104</b> may be a special purpose device, such as a dedicated personal diabetes manager (PDM) device. The management device <b>104</b> may be a programmed general-purpose device, such as any portable electronic device including, for example, a dedicated controller, such as processor, a micro-controller, or the like.

The medicament delivery device <b>102</b> may provide data from the sensors <b>106</b> and other data to the management device <b>104</b>. The data may be stored in the storage <b>118</b>. The processor <b>119</b> may also be operable to execute programming code stored in the storage <b>118</b>. For example, the storage may be operable to store one or more control applications <b>120</b> for execution by the processor <b>119</b>. The one or more control applications <b>120</b> may be responsible for controlling the medicament delivery device <b>102</b>, such as by controlling the AID delivery of insulin to the user <b>108</b>.

The user interface <b>123</b> may include a display, such as a touchscreen, for displaying information. The touchscreen may also be used to receive input when it is a touch screen. The user interface <b>123</b> may also include input elements, such as a keyboard, button, knobs, or the like.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The management device <b>104</b> may interface with a network <b>124</b>, such as a LAN or WAN or combination of such networks. The management device <b>104</b> may communicate over network <b>124</b> with one or more servers or cloud services <b>128</b>. In some exemplary embodiment, the model <b>115</b> and the data used by the model may be stored on the storage <b>131</b> for the cloud services/server(s) <b>128</b>. The computational needs and the storage needs of the model <b>115</b> may be large, and the cloud services/server(s) <b>128</b> may be a suitable match for those needs.

These devices may communicate with the medicament delivery device <b>102</b> to receive information and/or issue commands to the medicament delivery device <b>102</b>. These devices <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> may execute computer programming instructions to perform some of the control functions otherwise performed by controller <b>110</b> or processor <b>119</b>.

The medicament may be insulin for treating diabetes. The medicament may be glucagon for raising a user's blood glucose level. The medicament may also be a glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonists for lowering blood glucose or slowing gastric emptying, thereby delaying spikes in blood glucose after a meal.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows a block diagram <b>138</b> of examples of some sensors <b>106</b> that may be used in exemplary embodiments. The sensors <b>106</b> may gather information from the user <b>108</b> that help the model <b>115</b> to determine the current phase of the menstrual cycle of the user <b>108</b> and to help adapt to changing insulin sensitivity of the user over the phases of the menstrual cycle. The sensors <b>106</b> may include a skin temperature sensor <b>141</b> for sensing the skin temperature of the user at a suitable location, such as the wrist of the user or in proximity to the location of the medicament delivery device <b>102</b>. The sensors <b>106</b> may include a heart rate monitor <b>142</b> for sensing the heart rate of the user <b>108</b>. A skin conductance sensor <b>143</b> may be provided to measure the skin conductance of the user <b>108</b>. An activity detector <b>144</b>, such as an accelerometer, may be used to measure the activity level of the user. A glucose sensor <b>145</b>, such as a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), may be provided. The glucose sensor <b>145</b> may be an on-body sensor that detects the blood glucose concentration of the user at regular intervals, such as every 5 minutes.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> depicts one exemplary configuration of the sensors <b>106</b> relative to the medicament delivery device <b>102</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, in some exemplary embodiments, the medicament delivery device <b>102</b> includes a delivery device housing or housings <b>150</b> in which components of the medicament delivery device, like the controller <b>110</b>, the reservoir <b>112</b>, the pump <b>113</b> and the storage are contained. An accelerometer <b>160</b> may be contained inside the delivery device housing(s) <b>150</b>. The accelerometer <b>160</b> acts as an activity detector <b>144</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) that may be used to determine if the user is sleeping, exercising, etc. The accelerometer <b>160</b> may also identify a magnitude of activity level of the user <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The delivery device housing(s) <b>150</b> have an adhesive pad <b>152</b> attached to the bottom surface of the delivery device housing(s) <b>150</b>. The adhesive pad <b>152</b> is secured to the delivery device housing(s) <b>150</b> by a suitable means such as by heat welding, an adhesive or other means. The adhesive pad <b>152</b> has an adhesive on its underside. The adhesive secures the adhesive pad <b>152</b> to the skin surface of the user <b>108</b>. Certain sensors may be secured to the underside of the adhesive pad as shown. For example, a heart rate monitor <b>154</b>, a skin temperature sensor <b>156</b>, and a skin conductance sensor <b>158</b> may be secured to the underside of the adhesive pad and may contact the skin surface of the user <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The exemplary embodiments may determine the current phase of the menstrual cycle of the user <b>108</b> and based on that determination may adjust the magnitude of the basal dosages and/or bolus dosages of medicament, such as insulin, to matching changing insulin sensitivity due to the phase of the menstrual cycle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a breakdown of the phases of an idealized menstrual cycle <b>200</b>. The depiction begins at the time that the user begins her period. The menstrual cycle <b>200</b> includes a follicular phase <b>202</b> that precedes ovulation and a luteal phase <b>202</b> that follows ovulation. Ovulation occurs during the peri-ovulation phase <b>210</b>. The follicular phase <b>202</b> contains an early follicular phase <b>206</b> and a late follicular phase <b>208</b>. The luteal phase <b>204</b> contains the early luteal phase <b>212</b>, the mid luteal phase <b>214</b> and the late luteal phase <b>216</b>. The days are numbered from <b>1</b> to <b>28</b> along the top of the phases in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The duration of these phases, and hence the total duration of the cycle, may vary among users.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The insulin needs of users change over the phases of the menstrual cycle <b>200</b>. Changes in estradiol and progesterone levels over the menstrual cycle <b>200</b> are correlated with changing insulin sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity is higher in the early follicular phase <b>206</b> as opposed to the luteal phase <b>204</b>. The insulin needs of a user may vary by 25% within the menstrual cycle. The variations in insulin needs are not consistent for users. A customized approach is helpful. The exemplary embodiments provide such as customized approach.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a flowchart <b>300</b> of basic steps that may be performed in exemplary embodiments to compensate for changing insulin needs over the course of a menstrual cycle of a user <b>108</b>. First, the current phase of the menstrual cycle of the user <b>108</b> is determined at <b>302</b>. This may entail obtaining data from sensors connected to the user and processing the data to determine the current phase. Alternatively, this may entail simply prompting the user <b>108</b> to provide information from which the current phase may be derived. Once the current phase is known, the medicament delivery is adjusted based on the current phase at <b>304</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in the flowchart <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the determination of the current phase of the menstrual cycle of the user <b>108</b> may be determined based on user provided information. At <b>402</b>, the user <b>108</b> may be prompted to provide information regarding the start of the latest menstrual cycle. This may involve, for example, asking the user <b>108</b> to identify the date that their most recent period began. A prompt may be provided on the user interface <b>123</b> of the management device <b>104</b> or the user interface <b>117</b> of the medicament delivery device <b>102</b>. The user might, for instance, be asked to choose a day on a monthly calendar (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>). At <b>404</b>, the information is obtained from the user. The obtained information identifies the date of the beginning of the menstrual cycle of the user and may be used to identify the current phase of the menstrual cycle based on the offset of the current date from the date that the menstrual cycle began.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Another option to determining the current phase of the menstrual cycle of the user <b>108</b> is to rely upon a model <b>115</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> depicts a flowchart <b>410</b> of illustrative steps that may be performed in exemplary embodiments when relying upon a model. The model <b>115</b> may be a deep learning model or other type of neural network model. The model <b>115</b> may use machine learning algorithms and may use logistic regressors, random forests, support vector machines boosting and bagging approaches and/or unsupervised learning methods. The model <b>115</b> automatically detects a current phase of the menstrual cycle of a user and learns trends in insulin sensitivity variation for the user. At <b>412</b>, the machine learning model <b>115</b> is trained. The machine learning model <b>115</b> may be trained on data obtained from other women and then may be customized to the user <b>108</b>. Alternatively, the machine learning model <b>115</b> may be trained solely on data for the user <b>108</b>. For example, the medicament delivery device <b>102</b> may be secured to the user <b>108</b> and the sensors <b>106</b> may gather data for a period of two to three months. During this time, the machine learning model <b>115</b> may be in training mode. Once the training is complete, the machine learning model <b>115</b> is used to determine the current menstrual cycle phase of the user <b>108</b> at <b>414</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a block diagram <b>500</b> of the data flow for the machine learning model <b>504</b>. The machine learning model <b>504</b> processes inputs <b>502</b> and generates an output <b>506</b> of the current menstrual cycle phase. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts a diagram <b>600</b> showing some of the inputs that may be used by the machine learning model <b>602</b> in exemplary embodiments. Many of these inputs are sensor values <b>604</b>. For example, the sensor values may include values from sensors like those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> of a skin temperature sensor <b>141</b>, a heart rate sensor <b>142</b>, a skin conductance sensor <b>143</b>, an activity detector <b>144</b> and/or a glucose sensor <b>145</b>. The sensor values <b>604</b> are segregated into nighttime readings (as indicated by time values when taken) and daytime readings where the user is at rest (as determined by the accelerometer readings or other activity level sensor readings). These values are more determinative of a current phase of menstrual cycle of the user <b>108</b> than values taken when the user <b>108</b> is active. The machine learning model <b>602</b> may use insulin delivery histories <b>606</b> as input. Carbohydrates consumed <b>608</b> may be input as well as user input values <b>610</b>. Carbohydrate consumption levels may be indicative of a current phase of the menstrual cycle of the user <b>108</b>. The machine learning model <b>602</b> may also receive time and/or date values <b>612</b> as input.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Skin temperature generally drops in the follicular phase <b>202</b> and for most women is significantly higher in the luteal phase <b>204</b>. Nightly heart rate may be lower than average in the follicular phase <b>202</b> and higher than average in the luteal phase <b>204</b>. Nightly heart rate variability may be higher in the follicular phase <b>202</b> than average and lower than average in the luteal phase <b>204</b>. Skin conductance may be lower in the follicular phase <b>202</b> than in other portions of the menstrual cycle. Increased carbohydrates are typically consumed during the luteal phase <b>204</b>. These observations may be used by the logic or the machine learning model <b>602</b> to determine current phase of the menstrual cycle of the user.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The machine learning model <b>602</b> may determine whether the current phase of the user is the follicular phase <b>204</b> by performing the steps of the flowchart <b>700</b> in exemplary embodiments. The machine learning model <b>602</b> may be rules based in some exemplary embodiments. The flowchart <b>700</b> encodes some of the logic used by a general rule of the machine learning model <b>602</b>. These steps may in some exemplary embodiments be performed by software that is not part of a machine learning model.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">At <b>702</b>, a determination is made whether a current skin temperature of the user <b>108</b> is greater than a mean skin temperature of the user over a time interval, such as over one or more menstrual cycles. This check is made because, in general, during the follicular phase the skin temperature of a woman is elevated above the mean skin temperature. If not, the conclusion is reached that the current phase is not a follicular phase at <b>708</b>. If the skin temperature is greater than the average skin temperature, the variability of the heart rate of the user <b>108</b> is compared to the mean heart rate variability of the user to determine if the heart rate variability is greater than the average heart rate variability over an interval at <b>704</b>. Heart rate variability refers to the degree to which heart rate varies over a menstrual cycle and the mean heart rate variability refers to the average heart rate variability over multiple menstrual cycles, such as those for which data was gathered in the training. It is known that heart rate variability increases to be above average for many women during the follicular phase <b>204</b>. If heart rate variability is not higher than the mean, it is concluded that the current phase is not a follicular phase at <b>708</b>. If heart rate variability of the user is above the mean, the current heart rate of the user is compared to the mean heart rate at <b>706</b>. If the current heart rate is above the mean heart rate, it is determined that the current phase is the follicular phase <b>204</b> at <b>710</b>. Otherwise, the current phase is determined to not be the follicular phase at <b>708</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts a flowchart <b>800</b> of logic that may be applied in exemplary embodiments by the machine learning model <b>602</b> or by logic to determine if the current phase is the luteal phase <b>204</b>. In general, a number of checks are made to see if sensed values are indicative of the current phase being the luteal phase <b>204</b>. The flowchart <b>800</b> captures a general rule that may be applied by the machine learning model <b>602</b>. At <b>802</b>, a check is made whether a current skin temperature is higher than the mean skin temperature for the user <b>108</b>. If not, the current phase is determined to not be the luteal phase at <b>808</b>.

At <b>902</b>, the classification of phase for the previous day by the machine learning model <b>602</b> is compared with the classification of current phase chosen for the current day by the machine learning model <b>602</b>. An analysis is made whether the classifications are consistent at <b>904</b>. In other words, does the current day's classification of current phase make sense with yesterday's classification. For example, if yesterday's classification was the early follicular phase and today's classification was the mid luteal phase, there is an inconsistency as these phases are not adjacent to each other and do not follow each other. If there is an inconsistency, the classification of the current phase is invalidated at <b>906</b>. If there is not an inconsistency, the classification of the current phase is validated at <b>908</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Another validation option is to look at the blood glucose concentration levels for the user to validate the classification of the current phase by the machine learning model <b>602</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> depicts a flowchart <b>920</b> of illustrative steps that may be performed in exemplary embodiments to validate the classification of the current phase.

These obtained sensor values are compared to the expected values for the current phase classification from the machine learning model <b>602</b> at <b>926</b>. For example, if there is a reduction in nighttime blood glucose concentration levels relative to a baseline, it is an indication that there is increased insulin sensitivity. An increase in insulin sensitivity is associated with follicular phase <b>202</b> and a decrease in insulin sensitivity is associated with the luteal phase <b>204</b>.

These validations may be performed before the classification of the current phase is used to adapt medicament dosages. The validations provide an added level of confidence that the classifications of current phase are accurate and reliable. The consequences of invalidation may be determined by the machine learning model <b>602</b>. Invalidation may prompt the machine learning model <b>602</b> to repeat the classification of the current phase, for instance.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Once the current phase of the menstrual cycle of the user <b>108</b> is determined, the basal dosage of medicament to be delivered by the medicament delivery device <b>102</b> may be adjusted as needed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts a diagram <b>1000</b> showing the inputs an output of the basal adaptivity mechanism <b>1006</b> of the exemplary embodiments.

The basal adaptivity mechanism <b>1006</b> receives the classification of the current phase <b>1004</b> of the menstrual cycle of the user <b>108</b>. The basal adaptivity mechanism <b>1006</b> also receives a most recent blood glucose concentration reading and information regarding excursions from past cycles (a cycle is, for example, a 5-minute interval). The basal adaptivity mechanism <b>1006</b> considers basal needs separately for nighttime, morning and daytime because the needs at these portions of the day tend to vary. As such, depending on the time of day, the basal adaptivity mechanism <b>1006</b> may produce a nighttime basal dosage <b>1008</b>, a morning basal dosage <b>1010</b> or a daytime basal dosage <b>1012</b>. In general, the basal adaptivity mechanism <b>1006</b> looks at the current menstrual phase classification <b>1004</b> and the historical blood glucose concentration trends in earlier menstrual cycles to adapt the basal dosage amounts <b>1008</b>, <b>1010</b> and <b>1012</b>. In general, the dosages of basal insulin are increased in the early luteal phase <b>212</b> and gradually return to normal levels at the end of the luteal phase <b>204</b>.

At <b>1302</b>, the user <b>108</b> requests a medicament bolus, such as a bolus of insulin. At <b>1304</b>, the current phase of the menstrual cycle of the user <b>108</b> is determined as discussed above. As was mentioned above, insulin sensitivity may vary with phase of the menstrual cycle. The exemplary embodiments may adapt for the changing insulin sensitivity by adapting the insulin to carbohydrates ratio (ICR), which may be used in determining the bolus dosage. The ICR is used to determine how much insulin is needed to compensate for a quantity of carbohydrates that is ingested. If insulin sensitivity increases, the ICR is decreased, whereas if insulin sensitivity decreases, the ICR is increased. At <b>1306</b>, the ICR for the current phase of the menstrual cycle of the user <b>108</b> is identified and at <b>1308</b> is used to calculate the bolus dosage. The magnitude of the increase in ICR or decrease in ICR is customized to the user's learned change in insulin sensitivity across the phases of the menstrual cycle of the user.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The bolus dosage is proportional to the carbohydrates ingested and the ICR. In particular, the bolus dosage equals the grams of carbohydrates ingested divided by the ICR. ICR typically will be higher during the luteal phase <b>204</b> compared to the follicular phase <b>202</b>. A suitable increase in the ICR for the luteal phase is 10% compared to the follicular phase <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The ICR adaptation may follow the insulin sensitivity trend. As explained above, the insulin sensitivity changes at the individual level. As an example, suppose that the insulin sensitivity decreases in the early luteal phase <b>212</b> as described above, sensitivity changes the ICR would be reduced by 15% compared to baseline ICR in the early luteal phase <b>212</b>, increased by 10% in the mid luteal phase <b>214</b> and reduced by 5% in the late luteal phase <b>216</b> compared to baseline ICR.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">When the insulin sensitivity does not change through the menstrual cycle, the ICR may not be modulated through the menstrual period. The insulin sensitivity may be determined, such as described above, by looking at changes in blood glucose concentration for the user relative to the quantity of insulin delivered. If the area under the blood glucose curve is remaining the same, but the insulin delivery amount is increased, this means that the insulin sensitivity has been reduced (for the same blood sugar levels we are requiring more insulin). Conversely, if the area under the blood glucose curve remains the same, but the amount of insulin needed has reduced, then the insulin sensitivity has increased. When comparing insulin sensitivity across the menstrual cycle one can compare the ratio of blood sugar area under the curve to insulin delivery and infer insulin sensitivity variation or the lack thereof. If the change in insulin sensitivity over the user's menstrual cycle is below a threshold based on the comparison, the modulation by menstrual cycle phase described herein may not be performed.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As was mentioned above, the medicament delivery device <b>102</b> may include a user interface <b>117</b> and the management device <b>104</b> may include a user interface <b>123</b>.
