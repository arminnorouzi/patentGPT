No. 61/624,155, filed Apr. 13, 2012, and entitled &#x201c;BONE FUSION DEVICE,&#x201d; which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to bone fusion devices. More specifically, the present invention relates to devices for fusing vertebrae of the spine that can be inserted arthroscopically.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The spinal column is made up of vertebrae stacked on top of one another. Between the vertebrae are discs which are gel-like cushions that act as shock-absorbers and keep the spine flexible. Injury, disease, or excessive pressure on the discs can cause degenerative disc disease or other disorders where the disc becomes thinner and allows the vertebrae to move closer together or become misaligned. As a result, nerves may become pinched, causing pain that radiates into other parts of the body, or instability of the vertebrae may ensue.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One method for correcting disc-related disorders is to insert a fusion cage between the vertebrae to act as a structural replacement for the deteriorated disc. The fusion cage is typically a hollow metal device usually made of titanium. Once inserted, the fusion cage maintains the proper separation between the vertebrae to prevent nerves from being pinched and provides structural stability to the spine. Also, the inside of the cage is filled with bone graft material which eventually fuses permanently with the adjacent vertebrae into a single unit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The use of fusion cages for fusion and stabilization of vertebrae in the spine is known in the prior art. U.S. Pat. No. 4,961,740 to Ray, et al. entitled, &#x201c;V-Thread Fusion Cage and Method of Fusing a Bone Joint,&#x201d; discloses a fusion cage with a threaded outer surface, where the crown of the thread is sharp and cuts into the bone. Perforations are provided in valleys between adjacent turns of the thread. The cage can be screwed into a threaded bore provided in the bone structure at the surgical site and then packed with bone chips which promote fusion.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,015,247 to Michelson entitled, &#x201c;Threaded Spinal Implant,&#x201d; discloses a fusion implant comprising a cylindrical member having a series of threads on the exterior of the cylindrical member for engaging the vertebrae to maintain the implant in place and a plurality of openings in the cylindrical surface.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 6,342,074 to Simpson entitled, &#x201c;Anterior Lumbar Underbody Fusion Implant and Method For Fusing Adjacent Vertebrae,&#x201d; discloses a one-piece spinal fusion implant comprising a hollow body having an access passage for insertion of bone graft material into the intervertebral space after the implant has been affixed to adjacent vertebrae. The implant provides a pair of screw-receiving passages that are oppositely inclined relative to a central plane. In one embodiment, the screw-receiving passages enable the head of an orthopaedic screw to be retained entirely within the access passage.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,287 to Bagby entitled, &#x201c;Self-tapping Interbody Bone Implant,&#x201d; discloses a bone joining implant with a rigid, implantable base body having an outer surface with at least one bone bed engaging portion configured for engaging between a pair of bone bodies to be joined, wherein at least one spline is provided by the bone bed engaging portion, the spline being constructed and arranged to extend outwardly of the body and having an undercut portion. U.S. Pat. No. 6,582,467 to Teitelbaum et al. entitled, &#x201c;Expandable Fusion Cage,&#x201d; discloses an expandable fusion cage where the surfaces of the cage have multiple portions cut out of the metal to form sharp barbs. As the cage is expanded, the sharp barbs protrude into the subcortical bone of the vertebrae to secure the cage in place. The cage is filled with bone or bone matrix material.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 5,800,550 to Sertich entitled, &#x201c;Interbody Fusion Cage,&#x201d; discloses a prosthetic device which includes an inert generally rectangularly shaped support body adapted to be seated on hard end plates of vertebrae. The support body has top and bottom faces. A first peg is movably mounted in a first aperture located in the support body, and the first aperture terminates at one of the top and bottom faces of the support body. Further, the first peg projects away from the one of the top and bottom faces and into an adjacent vertebra to secure the support body in place relative to the vertebra.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 6,436,140 to Liu et al. entitled, &#x201c;Expandable Interbody Fusion Cage and Method for Insertion,&#x201d; discloses an expandable hollow interbody fusion device, wherein the body is divided into a number of branches connected to one another at a fixed end and separated at an expandable end. The expandable cage may be inserted in its substantially cylindrical form and may be expanded by movement of an expansion member to establish lordosis of the spine. An expansion member interacts with the interior surfaces of the device to maintain the cage in the expanded condition and provide a large internal chamber for receiving bone in-growth material.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">These patents all disclose fusion cage devices that can be inserted between vertebrae of the spine in an invasive surgical procedure. Such an invasive surgical procedure requires a long recovery period.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention is directed to a bone fusion device for insertion between bones that are to be fused together, such as, for example, the vertebrae of a spinal column. The bone fusion device comprises at least one extendable tab and one or more tab extension assemblies. Each tab extension assembly is able to be adjusted in order to individually control the extension or contraction of a side of the tab thereby enabling adjustment of the height and/or angle of the tab with respect to the body of the bone fusion device. The bone fusion device is in its most compact state when the tab is aligned with the body of the device such that the tab lies within the exterior of the body of the device. In this compact form, the bone fusion device is preferably inserted between the vertebrae by using an arthroscopic procedure. After the device has been positioned between the vertebrae, the tab is extended using the extension assemblies such that the tab abuts the bottom surface of the upper vertebrae. The angle of the tab with respect to the body of the device is able to be adjusted such that it corresponds to the vertebrae. Specifically, each extension assembly is able to be individually adjusted such that the side controlled by each assembly is raised or lowered until the desired tab angle is achieved. In this way, the tab is advantageously positioned and angled to correspond to the vertebrae to help brace the device until the bone has fused and to provide a larger surface area to which the bones attach and fuse during a healing period.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A first aspect of the present application is directed to a bone fusion device for insertion into a desired location. The device comprises a body having an interior cavity, a tab configured to fit within the interior cavity and selectively move from a retracted position within interior cavity of the body to an extended position extending out of the body and a plurality of extension assemblies coupled to a different portion of the tab and configured to move the different portions of the tab between the retracted position and the extended position independent of the remainder of the extension assemblies. In some embodiments, each of the extension assemblies comprise a worm gear operably coupled between a drive screw and a support jack such that rotation of the drive screw rotates the worm gear which retracts or extends the support jack into or out of the worm gear. In some embodiments, at least one of the drive screws of the extension assemblies is accessible through a first lateral side of the body and at least a second one of the drive screws is accessible through a second lateral side of the body. In some embodiments, the extension assemblies are pivotably coupled to the different portions of the tab such that the tab is able to pivot about the extension assembly. In some embodiments, the body has a bottom surface and an upper surface, wherein the upper surface is angled with respect to the bottom surface. In some embodiments, the device further comprises one or more plugs, wherein the body and the tab comprise one or more holes that extend from outside the device to the inner cavity and are configured to be removably filled by the plugs. In some embodiments, the plugs comprise bone material. In some embodiments, the tab comprises one or more tangs positioned along the perimeter of the top surface of the tab and fit within recesses in the top surface of the body when the tab is in the retracted position.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the following description, numerous details and alternatives are set forth for purpose of explanation. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the invention can be practiced without the use of these specific details. For instance, the figures and description below often refer to the vertebral bones of a spinal column. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that some embodiments of the invention are practiced for the fusion of other bones, including broken bones and/or joints. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order not to obscure the description of the invention with unnecessary detail. Further, although the figures and description below refer to a bone fusion device having a single tab and a pair of tab extension assemblies, it is understood that the bone fusion device is able to comprise multiple tabs each having any number of tab extension assemblies.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate an external and internal perspective view of a bone fusion device <b>100</b> according to some embodiments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the bone fusion device <b>100</b> comprises a body <b>102</b>, at least one tab <b>104</b> and a plurality of tab extension assemblies each comprising a drive screw <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B, a gear <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B and a supporting jack <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B. Alternatively, the device <b>100</b> is able to comprise a single tab extension assembly. The front tab extension assembly comprises a front drive screw <b>106</b>A which is mechanically coupled to a front supporting jack <b>110</b>A via a front gear <b>108</b>A, and the back tab extension assembly comprises a rear drive screw <b>106</b>B which is mechanically coupled to a rear supporting jack <b>110</b>B via a rear gear <b>108</b>B. As a result, the supporting jacks <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B are able to be individually and selectively raised or lowered with respect to the gears <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B by rotating or otherwise manipulating the corresponding drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B of the extension assemblies. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, when combined with the body <b>102</b> and tab <b>104</b>, the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B are able to be positioned within a pair of screw channels <b>204</b> of the body <b>102</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and the supporting jacks <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B are able to couple with the jack holes <b>208</b> at the front and rear of the tab <b>104</b>. Accordingly, by accessing and adjusting the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B of the tab extension assemblies through the screw channels <b>204</b> of the body <b>102</b>, a user is able to not only selectively extend and retract the tab <b>104</b> a desired distance from the body <b>102</b>, but also is able to adjust the angle of the tab <b>104</b> by lowering or raising the sides of the tab <b>104</b> with respect to each other. Alternatively, the tab extension assemblies are able to comprise other components for selectively raising or lowering the tab <b>104</b> such as a plurality of angled extending blocks that are able to be individually controlled by drive screws such that they press against the tab <b>104</b> to selectively extend/retract and adjust the angle of the tab <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The bone fusion device <b>100</b> is able to be constructed from a high strength biocompatible material, such as titanium, which has the strength to withstand forces in the spine that are generated by a patient's body weight and daily movements. Alternatively, part or all of the bone fusion device <b>100</b> is able to be constructed from one or more of the group consisting of ceramics, high strength biocompatible material, a polymer such as PEEK, PEKK and other polymeric materials, stainless steel, titanium, titanium alloys such as nitinol and other biocompatible metals. In some embodiments, the materials used to construct the bone fusion device include using additives, such as carbon fibers for better performance of the materials under various circumstances. The base biocompatible material is often textured or coated with a porous material conducive to the growth of new bone cells on the bone fusion device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">It should be noted that although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate a single tab <b>104</b> having a pair of extension assemblies, the bone fusion device <b>100</b> is able to comprise any number of tabs <b>104</b> each having any number of extension assemblies. Further, although the extension assemblies are shown as coupling to a front end and a back end of the tab <b>104</b>, the assemblies are able to be coupled to any portion of the tab <b>104</b> such that the angle of the tab <b>104</b> in any plane is able to be adjusted using the extension assemblies. In particular, for each tab extension assembly coupled to a tab <b>104</b>, another side or portion of the tab <b>104</b> is able to be selectively raised or lowered with respect to the body <b>102</b> and/or other portions of the tab <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of the components of the bone fusion device <b>100</b> according to some embodiments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the body <b>102</b> comprises a body cavity <b>202</b> for housing the other components in a retracted state, one or more screw channels <b>204</b> for receiving the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B, and one or more body apertures <b>206</b> for providing access to the cavity <b>202</b>. Specifically, the body <b>102</b> houses the tab <b>104</b> and tab extension assemblies within the body cavity <b>202</b> such that when the device <b>100</b> is in a retracted state the tab <b>104</b> and tab extension assemblies are all positioned within the outer dimensions of the body <b>102</b>. This enables the bone fusion device <b>100</b> to have the smallest profile possible when in the tab <b>104</b> is retracted thereby minimizing the size of the required surgical incision for the bone fusion surgery.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, the body <b>102</b> has a substantially rectangular structure with an angled upper surface that aligns with the upper surface of the tab <b>104</b> when the tab <b>104</b> is retracted. In some embodiments, the upper surface of the body <b>102</b> is angled downward from front to back such that the front wall is higher than the back wall. Alternatively, the upper surface of the body <b>102</b> is able to be angled upward from front to back and/or otherwise angled. Alternatively, the body <b>102</b> is able to comprise other shapes such as shapes that substantially conform to the shape of vertebrae. In some embodiments, the screw channels <b>204</b> positioned such that the screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B are accessible from the same side of the body <b>102</b>. Alternatively, the channels <b>204</b> are able to be positioned such that the screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B are accessible from one or more different sides of the body <b>102</b>. The apertures <b>206</b> of the body <b>102</b> extend from the cavity <b>202</b> to the exterior of the body <b>102</b>. As a result, the apertures <b>206</b> permit bone graft material to be inserted into the device <b>100</b> and to contact the vertebral bone before or after the device <b>100</b> has been inserted between the vertebrae of the patient. As used herein, bone graft material is able to refer to materials, biologics or other structures that promote osteoinduction and/or osteoconduction as are well known in the art. For example, the bone graft material is able to comprise, in combination or separately, one or more of autologous bone, allograft bone, artificial bone paste, artificial bone putty, osteoinduction material, osteoconduction material or other &#x201c;scaffolding&#x201d; for bone to grow upon and to induce bone growth as are well known in the art. The bone graft material and the surface texturing of the device <b>100</b> encourage the growth and fusion of bone from the neighboring vertebrae. The fusion and healing process will result in the bone fusion device <b>100</b> aiding in the bridging of the bone between the two adjacent vertebral bodies of the spine which eventually fuse together during the healing period. Additionally, it is understood that although as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the body <b>102</b> comprises a single aperture <b>206</b> positioned on a rear surface, the body <b>102</b> is able to comprise any number of apertures <b>206</b> positioned on any of the surfaces of the body <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, the body <b>102</b> of the bone fusion device <b>100</b> comprises one or more gripping channels (not shown) each having at least one gripping aperture. In such embodiments, the gripping apertures are able to receive the gripping fingers of a bone fusion device insertion instrument such that the instrument cannot slip out of place during operation. In particular, the gripping channels and insertion instrument are able to be substantially similar in operation and structure to the bone fusion device channels and bone fusion device insertion instrument described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/521,681, filed Aug. 9, 2011 and entitled &#x201c;BONE FUSION DEVICE, APPARATUS AND METHOD,&#x201d; which is hereby incorporated by reference. As a result, an insertion instrument is able to grip and insert the bone fusion device <b>100</b> while preventing or at least minimizing the risk of the insertion instrument and/or bond fusion device <b>100</b> slipping out of place. Indeed, this security is necessary to ensure that the surgeon is able to precisely place and control the device <b>100</b> within a patient during surgery.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the tab <b>104</b> comprises one or more tab apertures <b>210</b> and one or more jack holes <b>208</b> such that there is at least one jack hole <b>208</b> for each jack <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B. Specifically, the jack holes <b>208</b> are positioned and sized such that the ends of the jack heads <b>224</b> of the jacks <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B are able to couple to the tab <b>104</b> by being positioned within the jack holes <b>208</b>. For example, in some embodiments a pair of jack holes <b>208</b> are able to be positioned across from each other on the tab <b>104</b> such that the holes <b>208</b> straddle each jack head <b>224</b> preventing the jack <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B from separating from the tab <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the jack holes <b>208</b> (and at least a portion of the profile of the jack heads <b>224</b>) are substantially circular such that when coupled to the jacks <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B, the jacks <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B are able to rotate within the jack holes <b>208</b> with respect to the tab <b>104</b>. In particular, this rotational coupling provides the advantage of enabling the angle of tab <b>104</b> with respect to the body <b>102</b> and/or extension assemblies to be adjusted because the rotation of the jacks <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B within the holes <b>208</b> corresponds to the angle change of the tab <b>104</b> with respect to the body <b>102</b> and/or assemblies. Alternatively, the jack holes <b>208</b> and jack heads <b>224</b> are able to comprise ball joints or other shapes and/or profiles that enable both coupling and rotation as are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The tab <b>104</b> is shaped such that the tab <b>104</b> is able to fit within the cavity <b>202</b> of the body <b>102</b>. For example, in some embodiments the tab <b>104</b> is shaped such that its perimeter profile matches the perimeter of the cavity <b>202</b> and/or such that the outwardly facing surface of the tab <b>104</b> is substantially flush with the frame <b>114</b> of the bone fusion device <b>100</b> when the tab <b>104</b> is in the retracted position. In some embodiments, the upper surface of the tab <b>104</b> is angled downward from front to back such that the front wall is higher than the back wall. Alternatively, the upper surface of the tab <b>104</b> is able to be angled upward from front to back and/or otherwise angled. Alternatively, the tab <b>104</b> is able to comprise other shapes as are well known in the art. In some embodiments, tabs <b>104</b> having upper surfaces of varying angles are able to be interchanged within the bone fusion device <b>100</b>. As a result, a user is able to exchange the current tab <b>104</b> of a device <b>100</b> with a different tab <b>104</b> having a differently angled upper surface. This allows the same bone fusion device <b>100</b> to be switched from having the maximum parallel distraction <b>120</b> with a tab <b>104</b> with a parallel upper surface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>A</figref> to the maximum angle <b>122</b> with a tab <b>104</b> having the maximum angled upper surface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>B</figref> or angles in between. In some embodiments, the outwardly facing surface of the tab <b>104</b> has sharp serrated edges, protrusions, ridges or threads along the length of the tab <b>104</b> for engaging the adjacent vertebrae. Further, it is understood that although as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the tab <b>104</b> comprises a single tab aperture <b>210</b> positioned on an upper surface, the tab <b>104</b> is able to comprise any number of tab apertures <b>210</b> positioned on any of the surfaces of the tab <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B each comprise a positioning aperture <b>214</b>, a threaded portion <b>212</b> and a recessed portion <b>216</b>, the gears <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B each comprise gear teeth <b>218</b> and interior threading <b>220</b>, and the jacks <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B each comprise a jack head <b>224</b>, exterior threading <b>222</b> and a bottom protrusion <b>226</b>. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the threaded portion <b>212</b> of the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B is positioned such that the threads align with the gear teeth <b>218</b> of one of the gears <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B and the interior threading <b>220</b> of the gears <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B matches the exterior threading <b>222</b> of the jack heads <b>224</b> when the jack heads <b>224</b> are positioned within the gears <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B. As a result, when the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B are rotated, the threaded portion <b>212</b> applies force to the gear teeth <b>218</b> rotating the interior threading <b>220</b> of the gears <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B. This rotation causes the interior threading to apply force to the exterior threading <b>222</b> of the jacks <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B causing the jacks <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B to extend out of or retract further within the gears <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B. In particular, if the screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B are rotated in a first direction, the jacks <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B are extended out of the gears <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B until the bottom protrusion <b>226</b> reaches the interior threading <b>220</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). Conversely, if the screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B are rotated in an opposite second direction, the jacks <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B are retracted further within the gears <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B until the bottom of the jack heads <b>224</b> abut the upper surface of the gears <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). Thus, when coupled to the tab <b>104</b>, by rotating the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B, the tab extension assemblies are able to selectively retract/extend and adjust the angle of the tab <b>104</b> with respect to the body <b>102</b>.

For example, a universal joint is able to be used instead of the threaded portion <b>212</b> and gear teeth <b>218</b> in order to translate the rotation of the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B to the gears <b>108</b>A <b>108</b>B.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The positioning apertures <b>214</b> of the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B are positioned on the end of the screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B such that they are accessible when the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B are within the screw channels <b>204</b> of the body <b>102</b>. As a result, a user is able to insert one or more tool engaging members (not shown) into the positioning apertures <b>214</b> in order to rotate the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B. The structure of the positioning apertures <b>214</b> is configured such that the structure enables one or more engaging members of tools to rotate the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B. For example, the positioning apertures <b>214</b> are able to match the engaging members of allen wrenches, flat-head screw drivers, phillips screw drivers and/or the engaging members of other types of tools as are well known in the art. The recessed portions <b>216</b> of the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B are positioned such that they are adjacent to and/or surround the gear <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B that is not mechanically coupled to the threaded portion <b>212</b> of that drive screw <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B. As a result, the recessed portions <b>216</b> are able to help hold the gears <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B and screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B in place with respect to each other while not translating the rotation of the screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B to the gear <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B of the other tab extension assembly. Alternatively, the recessed portions <b>216</b> are able to be omitted. For example, the recessed portions <b>216</b> are able to be omitted and the threaded portion <b>212</b> is able to protrude out from the cylindrical body of the screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B in order to maintain mechanical coupling with the gear teeth <b>218</b>. In some embodiment, the body <b>102</b> further comprises one or more tool channels (not shown) that selectively couple with a tool when the engaging member of the tool is coupled with one or more of the positioning apertures <b>214</b>. As a result, the tool and its engaging member is able to be prevented from slipping out of the positioning apertures <b>214</b> which is able to cause harm to a patient during an insertion procedure.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrate cross sectional view of the bone fusion device <b>100</b> with the tab <b>104</b> fully retracted and fully extended, respectively, according to some embodiments.

Alternatively, the top/bottom profile of the body <b>814</b> is able to comprise one or more other shapes that substantially match bones that are to be fused to the bone fusion device <b>800</b>. Alternatively, the top profile of the tabs <b>830</b> are able to be shaped as described herein, wherein the body <b>814</b> remains the standard shape as described above. In some embodiments, the top profile of the tabs <b>830</b> are shaped substantially similar to the top/bottom profile of the body <b>814</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>D-<b>8</b>F</figref>, the tabs <b>830</b> have rounded edges to match the perimeter of the frames <b>814</b>. Alternatively, the top profile of the tabs <b>830</b> is able to comprise other shapes as are well known in the art. In some embodiments, the top profile shapes of the body <b>814</b> are between 15 and 25 mm along the anterior/posterior axis and between 20 and 45 mm along the lateral axis. Alternatively, other dimensions are envisioned. For example, for bone fusion devices designed for cervical spinal bones, the body <b>814</b> is able to be less than 15 mm along the anterior/posterior axis and less then 20 mm along the lateral axis. Alternatively, the body <b>814</b> is able to be 55 mm or longer along the lateral axis (typically for extreme lateral lumbar interbody fusion). In some embodiments, the body <b>814</b> and/or tab <b>830</b> have an angled upper surface such that the angle of the bone fusion device <b>800</b> matches the angle between the vertebrae. In some embodiments, the angle is equal to 15 degrees. Alternatively, other angles are able to be utilized. In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>G</figref>, the drive screws <b>808</b> are able to be non-parallel with the elongated top dimension/axis <b>815</b> of the body <b>814</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As a result, the bone fusion device <b>800</b> provides the advantage of substantially matching the horizontal profiles of the bones to be fused, thereby increasing the strength and efficiency of the fusion process. Further, the profile shapes provide the advantage of enabling a user to select a bone fusion device <b>800</b> with a top profile shape whose orientation matches the insertion orientation of the operation. Additionally, the angles at which the drive screws <b>808</b> are oriented with respect to the elongated axis <b>815</b> of the body <b>814</b> is able to be selected to match the angle of access provided by a desired operation. As a result, the bone fusion device <b>800</b> does not need to be turned to be in the proper orientation between the bones of the patient whether the procedure is anterior, posterior, lateral, far-lateral or transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. Moreover, the upper surface angles provide the advantage of enabling a user to select a bone fusion device <b>800</b> with a body <b>814</b> and/or tab <b>830</b> angle that matches the angle between the target vertebrae.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a cross sectional perspective view of a bone fusion device <b>900</b> having one or more angled drive screws according to some embodiments.

At least one of the drive screws <b>904</b>&#x2032; is able to be angled with respect to the elongated dimension of the body <b>902</b> while still operable coupled with one of the gears <b>906</b>. Alternatively, a plurality or all of the drive screws <b>904</b>, <b>904</b>&#x2032; are able to be angled or non-parallel with respect to the elongated dimension of the body <b>902</b>. As a result, a user is able to control the extension, retraction and angle adjustment of the tab (not shown) by rotating the gears <b>906</b> using the drive screws <b>904</b>, <b>904</b>&#x2032;. In some embodiments, the angled drive screws <b>904</b>&#x2032; are positioned such that the drive screw <b>904</b> is substantially perpendicular to the elongated dimension of the body <b>902</b>.

In some embodiments, the device <b>2500</b> comprises a locking aperture <b>2502</b> and a position locking mechanism <b>2503</b> for each tab extension assembly or drive screw <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B. Alternatively, one or more of the tab extension assemblies or drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B are able to have more or less than one locking aperture <b>2502</b> and/or position locking mechanism <b>2503</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The dial <b>2504</b> is configured to rotatably fit within the locking apertures <b>2502</b> and comprises a dial aperture <b>2512</b> and one or more dimples <b>2510</b> along the edge or perimeter of the dial <b>2504</b>. The dial aperture <b>2512</b> is able to be sized or otherwise configured to receive an end of one of the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B such that if a drive screw <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B is within the dial aperture <b>2512</b>, the end of the drive screw <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B will cause the dial <b>2504</b> to rotate along with the drive screw <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B. In some embodiments, the drive screw <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B causes the dial <b>2504</b> to rotate by directly physically contacting the dial aperture <b>2512</b>. Alternatively, the drive screw <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B is able to cause the dial <b>2504</b> to rotate via indirect contact. The one or more dimples <b>2510</b> are able to be configured to receive one or more bumps <b>2508</b> of the stoppers <b>2506</b>. In particular, the dimples <b>2510</b> are able to have concave dimensions that substantially match convex dimensions of the bumps <b>2508</b>. The stoppers <b>2506</b> are able to be configured to fit within the locking apertures <b>2502</b> adjacent to the dial <b>2504</b> and comprise one or more bumps <b>2508</b>. The stoppers <b>2506</b>, dials <b>2504</b> and apertures <b>2502</b> are configured such that when within the locking apertures <b>2502</b>, the stoppers <b>2506</b> are adjacent or in contact with the dial <b>2504</b> and the bumps <b>2508</b> of the stoppers <b>2506</b> snap or spring fit within the dimples <b>2510</b> of the dial <b>2504</b> when a dimple <b>2510</b> and a bump <b>2508</b> are aligned. Additionally, when a dimple <b>2510</b> and a bump <b>2508</b> are not aligned, the bump <b>2508</b> is compressed against the dimple-less edge of the dial <b>2504</b> and primed to spring or decompress into a dimple <b>2510</b> when alignment is achieved.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some embodiments, the dial <b>2504</b> is held in place within the locking apertures <b>2502</b> by force applied by the bumps <b>2508</b> of the stoppers <b>2506</b>. Alternatively, the dial <b>2504</b> is able to be otherwise coupled or uncoupled within the locking apertures <b>2502</b> by one or more fastening elements as are well known in the art. In some embodiments, the stoppers <b>2506</b> are held in place within the locking apertures <b>2502</b> by place holders <b>2507</b>. In particular, the place holders <b>2507</b> are able to be tensioned and/or compressed by the wall of the locking apertures <b>2502</b> when the stoppers <b>2506</b> are inserted into the locking apertures <b>2502</b> and thus provide a spring force against the walls of the locking apertures <b>2502</b> to try and relieve that tensioning/compression. Accordingly, the spring force holds the stoppers <b>2506</b> within the locking apertures <b>2502</b>. Alternatively, one or more of the stoppers <b>2506</b> are able to be otherwise coupled or uncoupled within the locking apertures <b>2502</b> by one or more fastening elements as are well known in the art. Although as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, the device <b>2500</b> comprises one side of the body <b>102</b> including two position locking mechanisms <b>2503</b>, wherein the position locking mechanisms <b>2503</b> comprise a single dial <b>2504</b> having sixteen dimples <b>2510</b> and two stoppers <b>2506</b>, it is understood that any of the sides of the body <b>102</b> are able to include one or more position locking mechanisms <b>2503</b> and the position locking mechanisms <b>2503</b> are able to include any number of dials <b>2504</b> having any number of dimples <b>2510</b> coupled to any number of stoppers <b>2506</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In operation, as the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B are rotated to extend or retract sides of the tab <b>104</b>, the dial <b>2504</b> is rotated along with the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B and the bumps <b>2508</b> compress and decompress into and out of the dimples <b>2510</b> as they move in an out of alignment with the bumps <b>2508</b>. As a result, each point during the rotation of the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B that results in an alignment of a bump <b>2508</b> and a dimple <b>2510</b> serves as a demarcated degree of rotation and/or degree of extension/retraction of the associated side of the tab <b>104</b>. In this way, the position locking mechanism <b>2503</b> provides the advantage of enabling a user to rotate the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B and thereby extend the sides of the tab <b>104</b> to predetermined rotation/extension amounts and/or by predetermined rotation/extension intervals represented by the spacing and number of dimple <b>2510</b> and bump <b>2508</b> alignment points. For example, the position and/or number of dimples <b>2510</b> and/or bumps <b>2508</b> of the position locking mechanism <b>2503</b> is able to be adjusted to adjust the number and/or position of the alignment points and therefore the number and/or position of plate extension points. Thus, the position locking mechanism <b>2503</b> of the bodiless bone fusion device <b>2500</b> is able to be tuned to different size devices <b>2500</b> based on the number of extension increments needed and the desired extension distance interval between each of the increments. In some embodiments, the increments are configured to be constant. Alternatively, the increments are able to be configured to decrease in size as the sides of the tab <b>104</b> approach their maximum extension level. Alternatively, other increment profiles are able to be used as are well known in the art. Further, the compression of the bumps <b>2508</b> and their resistance thereto during rotation of the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B between alignment points provides a slipping resistance force the resists unintended rotation of the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B out of an alignment point. As a result, the position locking mechanism <b>2503</b> provides the advantage of reducing the chance of the drive screws <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B unintentionally rotating and/or the sides of the tab <b>104</b> unintentionally extending or retracting.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Thus, the bone fusion device, system and method described herein has numerous advantages. First, the bone fusion device, system and method provide the advantage of substantially matching the device or tab top surface profiles with the horizontal profiles of the bones to be fused, thereby increasing the strength and efficiency of the fusion process. As a result, the bone fusion device does not need to be turned to be in the proper orientation between the bones of the patient whether the procedure is anterior, posterior, lateral or transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. Second, the bone fusion device, system and method provide the advantage of allowing the body to be extended from angles other than parallel to one or more of the drive screws, which is critical in procedures where the device is to be inserted from varying angles. Third, the extension measurement instrument provides the advantage of enabling a user to accurately measure the size of the space to be filled by the bone fusion device thereby allowing the correct bone fusion device to be selected, while also having a minimal profile such that the incision required is minimized. Further, the bone fusion device, system and method provides the advantage of enabling each side of the tab to be individually adjusted such that the side controlled by each assembly is raised or lowered until the desired tab angle is achieved. In this way, the tab is advantageously positioned and angled to correspond to the vertebrae to help brace the device until the bone has fused and to provide a larger surface area to which the bones attach and fuse during a healing period. Moreover, the bone fusion device, system and method provides the advantage of enabling the user to physically pack a material bag full of bone grafting material in order to maximize the amount of grafting material provided to the bones, as well as providing the advantage of keeping the bone grafting material in the desired location and shape with respect to the bones to be fused to and/or the position of the bone fusion device thereby increasing the efficiency of the bone growth and/or healing process. Additionally, the position locking mechanism provides the advantage of reducing the chance of the drive screws unintentionally rotating and/or the sides of the tab unintentionally extending or retracting. Finally, the bone fusion device, system and method provides the advantage of allowing the bone grafting material to be packed into the material bags and keeping the bone grafting material in the desired position and/or shape with respect to the adjacent bones.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The present invention has been described in terms of specific embodiments incorporating details to facilitate the understanding of principles of construction and operation of the invention.
