This makes it possible to form electric fields by radio-frequency waves uniformly in the space SP. The radio-frequency electric fields formed in the space SP excite the gas in the space SP, and plasma is generated from the gas. As a result, the plasma is generated with a uniform density distribution in the space SP.

The diameters of the dielectric plates <b>18</b> and the dielectric plate <b>180</b> are 300 mm, and the materials thereof are AlN. The thickness of the intermediate portion Rb of the dielectric plate <b>18</b> of (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is 2.0 cm, and the thicknesses of the central portion Ra and the outer peripheral portion Rc are 0.5 cm. The conductor <b>17</b> was formed by thermal spray of Al. In the comparative example, unlike the embodiment, the thickness of the dielectric plate <b>180</b> is 2.0 cm at the center portion and 0.5 mm at the outer peripheral portion, and is gently inclined from the center toward the outer peripheral portion.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As is clear from the graph of (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in the dielectric plate <b>180</b> of the comparative example illustrated in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the value of the electric field energy E<sup>2 </sup>was higher at the outer peripheral portion and became lower toward the central portion. The electric field energy E<sup>2 </sup>correlates with the plasma density. The electric field energy E<sup>2 </sup>is an integrated distribution in the height direction of the electric field energy (between the upper electrode <b>14</b> and the stage <b>12</b>) at a certain position in the radial direction, and this integrated distribution substantially coincides with the plasma density distribution. Therefore, it can be seen that the dielectric plate <b>180</b> of the comparative example illustrated in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> has not reached the point at which the plasma density distribution is made uniform.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In contrast, in the dielectric plate <b>18</b> according to the embodiment illustrated in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the thickness is in an approximately inverted-W shape. As a result, as shown in the graph of (e) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the electric field energy E<sup>2 </sup>became uniform in the region from the center 0 of the dielectric plate <b>18</b> to 150 mm in the radial direction. As a result, it was found that, in the dielectric plate <b>18</b> according to the embodiment, the uniformity of the plasma density distribution is achieved above the substrate W having a diameter of 300 mm.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Two reasons will be described as to why the uniformity of plasma density distribution is achieved by making the thickness of the dielectric plate <b>18</b> in an approximately inverted-W shape. The first reason is that the density distribution of plasma is determined by the electric field distribution in the plasma. When a metal (conductor) is used instead of the dielectric plate <b>18</b>, the radio-frequency electric field propagating from the waveguide <b>15</b> outside the upper electrode <b>14</b> does not reach the center indicated by the axis AX. Therefore, in order to increase the electric field in the central portion, the material of the dielectric plate <b>18</b> is made of a dielectric such as ceramic. As a result, radio-frequency waves pass through the interior of the dielectric, and this facilitates the reach of a radio-frequency electric field as a whole.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, by making the thickness of the dielectric plate <b>18</b> in an approximately inverted-W shape and flattening the bottom surface, the central portion Ra and the outer peripheral portion Rc are made thinner than the intermediate portion Rb. As a result, the path in the dielectric plate <b>18</b> through which radio-frequency waves pass becomes narrower in the central portion Ra and the outer peripheral portion Rc than in the intermediate portion Rb. In order to make radio-frequency waves propagate up to the central portion Ra, the path in the intermediate portion Rb on the way to the central portion Ra is widened to some extent so that the radio-frequency waves can easily pass therethrough.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The thickness of the outer peripheral portion Rc is made smaller than the thickness of the intermediate portion Rb. Since radio-frequency waves propagate from the outer peripheral side toward the center, the electric field tends to be stronger in the outer peripheral portion Rc than in the intermediate portion Rb. Therefore, when the outer peripheral portion Rc and the intermediate portion Rb have the same thickness, it is assumed that an electric field stronger than that in the intermediate portion Rb is generated in the outer peripheral portion Rc, and the propagation of radio-frequency waves is interrupted while the radio-frequency waves are propagating from the outer peripheral portion Rc to the central portion Ra via the intermediate portion Rb so that the radio-frequency waves do not propagate up to the central portion Ra.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Therefore, in order to strengthen a radio-frequency electric field propagating to the central Ra to some extent, recesses are formed in the outer peripheral portion Rc and the central portion Ra of the dielectric plate <b>18</b> to narrow the path through which the radio-frequency waves propagate. In the dielectric plate <b>18</b> according to the embodiment, the thickness of the outer peripheral portion Rc is made smaller than the thickness of the intermediate portion Rb. As a result, the electric field is weakened in the outer peripheral portion Rc, so that the radio-frequency waves easily propagate from the outer peripheral portion Rc to the intermediate portion Rb. As a result, the radio-frequency waves also easily propagate from the intermediate portion Rb to the central portion Ra, so that the electromagnetic waves can be propagated up to the central portion Ra. Therefore, it is possible to strengthen the radio-frequency electric field in the central portion Ra, and as illustrated in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the electric field energy E<sup>2 </sup>becomes uniform in the radial direction of the dielectric plate <b>18</b>. From the foregoing, by making the thickness of the dielectric plate <b>18</b> in an inverted-W shape, it is possible to achieve uniformity in plasma density distribution and to uniformly generate plasma above the substrate W.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The second reason is that by making the thickness of the dielectric plate <b>18</b> in an approximately inverted-W shape, it is possible to eliminate a high-order mode of surface wave plasma propagating from the waveguide <b>15</b>. As a result, it is possible to generate surface wave plasma of a single TMO<b>1</b> mode, to achieve uniformity in plasma density distribution, and to uniformly generate the plasma above the substrate W.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In particular, the plasma processing apparatus <b>1</b> according to the embodiment is suitable for generating plasma in a soft diffusion mode in which a substrate W is less damaged, compared to plasma in a coupling mode (a normal CCP), which is more often applied when the apparatus functions as an etching apparatus. That is, the plasma processing apparatus <b>1</b> according to the embodiment is suitable when it functions as a film forming apparatus.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Here, the difference between the coupling mode and the diffusion mode will be described. In the coupling mode, the upper electrode <b>14</b> and the lower electrode (stage <b>12</b>) are electrically coupled. In the diffusion mode, the upper electrode <b>14</b> and the lower electrode are not electrically coupled. Therefore, in the coupling mode, a strong electric field is generated between the upper electrode <b>14</b> and the lower electrode, and in the diffusion mode, a strong electric field is not generated between the upper electrode <b>14</b> and the lower electrode. That is, in the diffusion mode, since the electric field on the surface of the substrate W and its vicinity becomes almost 0, there is an advantage in that there is almost no electric field on the surface of the substrate W and damage to the substrate W due to plasma can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, the diffusion mode may be defined by a distance G between the upper electrode <b>14</b> and the stage <b>12</b> and a plasma electron density Ne. For example, the distance G and the plasma electron density Ne are defined as follows. At this time, the frequency of the radio-frequency waves is set to, for example, 180 MHz.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">G=60 mm</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Ne=5&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup></p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The values of the distance G and the plasma electron density Ne are not limited to the above example, but when the distance G is sufficiently larger than a skin depth &#x3b4;, the electric field in the substrate W and its vicinity becomes almost 0, so that the diffusion mode is set. When the plasma electron density Ne is a density generally called high-density plasma, the plasma becomes the diffusion mode. The skin depth &#x3b4; is a depth from the surface where the current flowing there is attenuated to 1/e (about 0.37 times) with respect to the current flowing on the surface.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The skin depth &#x3b4; is expressed by Equation 1 below.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>[Equation 1]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0061" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3b4;=&#x221a;{square root over (2/&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;)}&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">&#x3c3; is the electrical conductivity of a material, &#x3bc; is the magnetic permeability of the material, and &#x3c9; is an angular frequency of an alternating current (radio-frequency waves).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">The skin depth &#x3b4; is proportional to the plasma electron density Ne. In an etching apparatus for etching a substrate W, the distance G is, for example, about 5 mm to 30 mm, and the distance between the upper electrode <b>14</b> and the lower electrode is short. Therefore, in the etching apparatus, the plasma is in the coupling mode and is generally not the plasma in the diffusion mode.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061">The plasma in the diffusion mode is suitable for a film forming process performed by a film forming apparatus having a distance G of, for example, 40 mm or more, such as a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) apparatus. For example, the plasma in the diffusion mode is preferably used in a CVD apparatus in which a plasma generation function is added to a thermal CVD apparatus. By using the plasma in the diffusion mode, the effect of the plasma can be utilized in the thermal CVD apparatus while suppressing the damage to the substrate W by the plasma. Thus, it is suitable for film formation of a SiN film and a TEOS film.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">As described above, in the plasma processing apparatus <b>1</b> according to the embodiment, radio-frequency waves are radiated into the processing container <b>10</b> from the exterior of the outermost periphery of the upper electrode <b>14</b>. In the case of the plasma in the diffusion mode, the upper electrode <b>14</b> and the lower electrode are not electrically coupled with each other. Therefore, the radio-frequency waves radiated from the outermost periphery of the upper electrode <b>14</b> propagate to the center side of the upper electrode <b>14</b> while being reflected by the surface of the plasma. Due to this reflection, the plasma density distribution tends to be high in the peripheral portion of the substrate W and low in the central portion of the substrate W.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063">In contrast, in the plasma processing apparatus <b>1</b> according to the embodiment, the width of the propagation path of radio-frequency waves is adjusted by adjusting the thickness of the dielectric plate <b>18</b> such that the thickness is in an approximately inverted-W shape, and as illustrated in (e) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the in-plane uniformity of plasma density can be achieved by making the radio-frequency electric field (energy) distribution uniform.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">[Modification of Dielectric Plate]</heading><p id="p-0067" num="0064">The thickness of the dielectric plate <b>18</b> according to the modification of the embodiment of (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is in an approximately inverted-W shape, and the central portion Ra and the outer peripheral portion Rc are formed in a slope shape. Even in this case, the central portion Ra and the outer peripheral portion Rc are thinner than the intermediate portion Rb. As a result, the path in the dielectric plate <b>18</b> through which radio-frequency waves pass becomes narrower in the central portion Ra and the outer peripheral portion Rc than in the intermediate portion Rb. In order to make radio-frequency waves propagate up to the central portion Ra, the path in the intermediate portion Rb on the way to the central portion Ra is widened to some extent so that the radio-frequency waves can easily pass therethrough. As a result, radio-frequency waves are not interrupted in the course of propagating from the outer peripheral portion Rc to the central portion Ra via the intermediate portion Rb, thereby enabling the radio-frequency waves to propagate up to the central portion Ra. In addition, it is possible to prevent the electric field strength in the outer peripheral portion Rc from becoming higher than the electric field strength in the intermediate portion Rb.

The distance between the conductive layer <b>123</b> and the top surface of the stage <b>12</b> is larger than the distance between the conductive layer <b>122</b> and the top surface of the stage <b>12</b>. The conductive layer <b>123</b> is a heater. In an embodiment, the conductive layer <b>123</b> is connected to a heater power supply <b>58</b>. The conductive layer <b>122</b> is connected to an electrostatic chuck power supply <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0082">Even in the plasma processing apparatus <b>1</b> according to the modification, the unevenness of the dielectric plate <b>18</b> and the conductor <b>17</b> is adjusted to form a substantially W shape, thereby adjusting the width of the passage of the radio-frequency electric field. As a result, even when the radio-frequency waves propagate through the outer peripheral portion Rc&#x2192;the intermediate portion Rb&#x2192;the central portion Ra of the dielectric plate <b>18</b>, the electric field distribution due to the radio-frequency waves can be made uniform as in the case of the embodiment. This makes it possible to achieve in-plane uniformity of plasma density.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0083">The thickness of the dielectric plate <b>18</b> is in an approximately inverted-W shape (the outer peripheral portion is thin, the intermediate portion is thick, and the central portion is thin). This makes it possible to form electric fields by radio-frequency waves uniformly in the space SP. The radio-frequency electric fields formed in the space SP excite the gas in the space SP, and plasma is generated from the gas. As a result, the plasma is generated with a uniform density distribution in the space SP. The substrate W on the stage <b>12</b> is processed with chemical species from the plasma.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0084">In the plasma processing apparatus <b>1</b> according to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and the plasma processing apparatus <b>1</b> according to the modification of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a corrosion-resistant film is formed on at least the bottom surface among the surfaces of the dielectric plate <b>18</b>. The corrosion-resistant film may be an yttrium oxide film, an yttrium oxyfluoride film, an yttrium fluoride film, or a ceramic film containing yttrium oxide, yttrium fluoride, or the like.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0085">The plasma processing apparatuses <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>5</b></figref> may have two layers of conductors <b>17</b> embedded in the top surface and/or inside the dielectric plate <b>18</b>, rather than one layer.
