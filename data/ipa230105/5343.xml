By using the air guns, it is possible to stimulate a specified region of the user even at distances from the user and eliminate the need to wear of the device. However, even when only the air guns are used, it is difficult to represent continuous movement of the wind.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Therefore, in the present invention, attention is focused on apparent motion perception and, using the air guns, the wind stimuli are presented to two or more different points on a body surface of the user at appropriately timed intervals to allow the user to feel sensations of motion at the individual points on the body surface. Also, in the present invention, attention is focused on an audiotactile interaction, and sites to which wind is to be presented are brought into synchronization with a normal position of an audio image generated from a virtual target object to allow the user to feel continuous wind resulting from the movement of the virtual target object. Thus, it is possible to allow the user to feel the continuous wind without wearing a device. In addition, it is possible to allow the user to feel the continuous wind as continuous wind resulting from the movement of the virtual target object and realize staging that provides a sense of presence of the virtual target object.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">[Overall Configuration of Stimulus Presentation System <b>1</b>]</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an overall configuration of a stimulus presentation system <b>1</b>. The stimulus presentation system <b>1</b> includes an audio source reproduction device <b>11</b>, a plurality of video cameras <b>12</b>, a stimulus presentation device <b>13</b>, and a plurality of air guns <b>14</b>. The stimulus presentation device <b>13</b> is physically and electrically connected to the audio source reproduction device <b>11</b>, the plurality of video cameras <b>12</b>, and the plurality of air guns <b>14</b> to be communicative therewith.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The audio source reproduction device <b>11</b> is a device that reproduces an audio source. The audio source reproduction device <b>11</b> reproduces, e.g., an audio source of a virtual-experience <b>3</b>D content. The audio source of the virtual-experience <b>3</b>D content is an extremely short audio source such as, e.g., a sound of footsteps passing before eyes of the user. A length of the audio source may also be large. When the length of the audio source is large, the stimulus presentation device <b>13</b> subsequent to the audio source reproduction device <b>11</b> divides the audio source to extract a specified audio source. The audio source reproduction device <b>11</b> can be implemented using, e.g., audio equipment in a city or a personal computer in the city.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The plurality of video cameras <b>12</b> are disposed so as to surround the user listening to a reproduced sound from the audio source described above. The plurality of video cameras <b>12</b> are devices that images the user at different angles. The video cameras <b>12</b> can be implemented using, e.g., video cameras in the city.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The stimulus presentation device <b>13</b> is a device that uses audio image normal position information representing the normal position of the audio image (e.g., a sound of footsteps) acquired from the audio source reproduction device <b>11</b> and a plurality of user videos imaged at different angles by the plurality of video cameras <b>12</b> to control ejection times at which respective air streams are ejected from two or more of the plurality of air guns <b>14</b>, wind power strengths of the air streams, and ejection angles of the air streams. The stimulus presentation device <b>13</b> can be implemented using, e.g., a computer (such as, e.g., a server device or a client device in the city) including a CPU, a memory, a communication interface, and the like.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The plurality of air guns <b>14</b> are arranged so as to surround the user listening to the reproduced sound from the audio source described above. The plurality of air guns <b>14</b> are devices that adjust, based on control by the stimulus presentation device <b>13</b>, respective ejection angles thereof to the ejection angles of the air streams set by the stimulus presentation device <b>13</b> and eject the air streams with ejection strengths of the air streams set by the stimulus presentation device <b>13</b> at the ejection times of the air streams set by the stimulus presentation device <b>13</b>. Each of the air guns <b>14</b> can be implemented by combining, e.g., a cylindrical body that ejects the air stream, an ejection control unit such as a CPU that ejects the air stream with the set strength at the set time, and a muzzle control unit such as a CPU that controls an orientation of a muzzle of the cylindrical body.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">[Configuration of Stimulus Presentation Device <b>13</b>]</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the stimulus presentation device <b>13</b> includes an acquisition unit <b>131</b>, a control unit <b>132</b>, a determination unit <b>133</b>, and an adjustment unit <b>134</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The acquisition unit <b>131</b> has a function of acquiring, from the audio source reproduction device <b>11</b>, audio image normal position information. As described above, the audio image normal position information is information representing the normal position of the audio image. The audio image is a spatial image of a sound perceived by the user. The normal position of the audio image is a position of the audio image viewed from the user. The audio image normal position information includes information such as a position of the audio image viewed from the user at a predetermined time after reproduction of the content, an azimuth direction thereof, a distance thereof, and the like. The acquisition unit <b>131</b> can acquire, from the audio source reproduction device <b>11</b>, the audio image normal position information in a format such as MIDI data or B-Format.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The control unit <b>132</b> has a function of determining, using the audio image normal position information described above, the respective ejection times at which the plurality of air streams are to be ejected, the respective wind power strengths thereof, and respective ejection azimuth directions thereof and causing the individual air guns <b>14</b> disposed in the respective ejection azimuth directions to sequentially eject the individual air streams with the respective wind power strengths at the respective ejection times.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The ejection times of the air streams are set at given time intervals which allow the user to perceive an apparent motion. The given time intervals are set within a range of, e.g., 10 to 200 msec. By setting the time intervals between the individual ejection times at which the plurality of air streams is to be ejected within the range of 10 to 200 msec, an effect of allowing the user to feel a sensation of motion is achieved.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Each of the wind power strengths of the air streams is set based on a magnitude of a distance between the user and the normal position of the audio image. The control unit <b>132</b> changes the number of the air streams to be ejected toward a body site (described later) and causes, when the number of the air streams to be ejected is plural, the plurality of air streams to be continuously ejected at given short time intervals. The control unit <b>132</b> changes, based on the magnitude of the distance between the user and the normal position of the audio image, the number of the air streams to be ejected toward the body site (described later). For example, when the distance from the user to the normal position of the audio image is short, the control unit <b>132</b> causes the air stream to be continuously ejected more than once to enhance wind power while, when the distance from the user to the normal position of the audio image is long, the control unit <b>132</b> causes the air stream to be ejected once to reduce the wind power. In other words, the control unit <b>132</b> controls an intensity of the stimulation by changing the number of the air streams to be ejected. The control unit <b>132</b> may also change an amount of the air stream to be pushed out toward the body site (described later), a speed at which the air stream is pushed out, or the both (the amount of the air stream to be pushed out and the speed at which the air stream is pushed out) depending on the magnitude of the distance between the user and the normal position of the audio image. For example, when an amplitude of a cone of a speaker unit is used as a method of controlling the pushing out of the air streams from the air guns <b>14</b>, the cone is typically moved using one waveform as an output signal to thus push out the air stream. Consequently, the amount of the air stream to be pushed out is adjusted using a magnitude of the amplitude (sound pressure level), and the speed at which the air stream is pushed out is adjusted using a frequency of the output signal (frequency of oscillation). Thus, the intensity of the stimulation applied to the user is controlled.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The determination unit <b>133</b> has a function of receiving, from the plurality of video cameras <b>12</b>, the plurality of user videos at the different angles. The determination unit <b>133</b> has a function of determining a body region of the user to which stimuli are to be presented by using the plurality of user videos. The body region to be determined is, e.g., a face, an arm, a neck, or the like. Note that the body region to be determined is preferably a region in which skin is exposed from clothes.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The adjustment unit <b>134</b> has a function of determining, within a range of the body region of the user described above, a plurality of different body sites on the body of the user to which the plurality of air streams is to be applied and adjusting ejection angles of the individual air guns <b>14</b> such that the respective muzzles of the air guns <b>14</b> are pointed at the plurality of body sites. The individual air guns <b>14</b> are those of the plurality of air guns <b>14</b> arranged so as to surround the user which are disposed in the respective emission azimuth directions determined by the control unit <b>132</b>. Consequently, the determined body sites correspond to the normal position of the audio image. By causing the body sites to correspond to the normal position of the audio image, an effect of allowing the applied air streams to be felt as the wind resulting from the movement of the virtual target object is achieved. Note that the adjustment unit <b>134</b> preferably determines the plurality of body sites within the range of the exposed body region of the user.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">[First Modification of Configuration of Stimulus Presentation Device <b>13</b>]</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The stimulus presentation device <b>13</b> can be implemented by a computer. The audio source reproduction device <b>11</b> can also be implemented by a computer such as a personal computer in a city. The ejection control unit and the muzzle control unit of each of the air guns <b>14</b> can also be implemented by a computer such as a CPU. Therefore, in the stimulus presentation device <b>13</b>, the audio source reproduction device <b>11</b> may be included as a functional unit thereof serving as an audio source reproduction unit, and each of the ejection control unit and the muzzle control unit of the air gun <b>14</b> may also be included as a functional unit thereof.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">[Second Modification of Configuration of Stimulus Presentation Device <b>13</b>]</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The control unit <b>132</b> controls the ejection times and the wind power strengths of the air streams from the air guns <b>14</b>. The adjustment unit <b>134</b> controls the ejection angles of the air streams from the air guns <b>14</b>. The control unit <b>132</b> and the adjustment unit <b>134</b>, which are common in terms of controlling the air guns <b>14</b>, may also be integrally configured as one functional unit.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">[Third Modification of Configuration of Stimulus Presentation Device <b>13</b>]</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It may also be possible to provide a Peltier element or the like in the vicinity of each of the air guns <b>14</b> and control a temperature of the air stream ejected from the air gun <b>14</b>. By, e.g., increasing the temperature of the air ejected from the air gun <b>14</b>, it is possible to allow a sensation of blowing hot wind to be felt. Conversely, by lowering the temperature of the air stream ejected from the air gun <b>14</b>, it is possible to allow a sensation of blowing cool wind to be felt. This can increase types of wind to be experienced by the user.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">[Arrangement of Video Cameras <b>12</b> and Air Guns <b>14</b>]</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a layout of the video cameras <b>12</b> and the air guns <b>14</b>.
