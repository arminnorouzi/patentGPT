The drawings may possibly include parts different from each other in the dimensional relation and the ratio.

Other terms not specifically defined in the present specification follows the definitions and the measurement methods in G.650.1 and G.650.2.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic sectional view of a multi-core optical amplifying fiber according to a first embodiment and illustrates a cross-section perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the multi-core optical amplifying fiber. A multi-core optical amplifying fiber <b>1</b> is a double-cladding and seven-core multi-core optical fiber including seven core portions <b>1</b><i>aa </i>and <b>1</b><i>ab</i>, an inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b </i>surrounding the core portions <b>1</b><i>aa </i>and <b>1</b><i>ab</i>, and an outer cladding portion <b>1</b><i>c </i>surrounding the inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The core portions <b>1</b><i>aa </i>and <b>1</b><i>ab </i>are arranged in a triangular lattice that achieves the close-packed state. The core portion <b>1</b><i>aa </i>is disposed at or near the center of the inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b</i>. Six core portions <b>1</b><i>ab </i>are disposed around the core portion <b>1</b><i>aa </i>so as to be positioned at the corners of a regular hexagon. The core portions <b>1</b><i>aa </i>and <b>1</b><i>ab </i>contain germanium (Ge) and/or aluminum (Al), for example, as dopant for adjusting the refractive index that increases the refractive index. The core portions <b>1</b><i>aa </i>and <b>1</b><i>ab </i>also contain Er as a rare-earth element serving an amplifying medium. Er is added at such a concentration that the peak of the absorption coefficient at a wavelength of approximately 1530 nm is 2.5 dB/m to 11 dB/m, for example. The addition concentration is 250 ppm to 2000 ppm, for example. The absorption coefficient and the addition concentration, however, are not particularly limited. Al also has the function of suppressing concentration quenching of Er.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b </i>has a refractive index lower than the maximum refractive index of the core portions <b>1</b><i>aa </i>and <b>1</b><i>ab</i>. The inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b </i>is made of pure quartz glass containing no dopant for adjusting the refractive index, for example. As a result, the refractive index profile of the core portions <b>1</b><i>aa </i>and <b>1</b><i>ab </i>and the inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b </i>is a step-index type. The inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b </i>may have trench portions positioned on the outer peripheries of the core portions <b>1</b><i>aa </i>and <b>1</b><i>ab</i>. In this case, the trench portion is made of quartz glass doped with dopant for adjusting the refractive index, such as fluorine (F), that decreases the refractive index, and the refractive index of the trench portion is lower than that of the other part of the inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b </i>made of pure quartz glass.

The cores &#x394; of the core portions <b>1</b><i>aa </i>and <b>1</b><i>ab </i>according to the present embodiment are substantially equal and are 0.35% to 2% at a wavelength of 1550 nm, for example.

In the case of Er, the optical amplification wavelength band in which the rare-earth element can perform optical amplification is a band called a C-band of 1530 nm to 1565 nm, for example, and a band called an L-band of 1565 nm to 1625 nm, for example. The mode field diameter of the core portions <b>1</b><i>aa </i>and <b>1</b><i>ab </i>at the wavelength at which Er performs optical amplification, specifically at 1550 nm, is 5 &#x3bc;m to 11 &#x3bc;m, for example.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The outer cladding portion <b>1</b><i>c </i>has a refractive index lower than that of the inner cladding portion <b>1</b><i>b </i>and is made of resin, for example.
