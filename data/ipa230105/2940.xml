As examples, articles of apparel (e.g., shirts, pants, socks, footwear, jackets and other outerwear, briefs and other undergarments, hats and other headwear), containers (e.g., backpacks, bags), and upholstery for furniture (e.g., chairs, couches, car seats) are often at least partially formed from textiles. These textiles are often formed by weaving or interlooping (e.g., knitting) a yarn or a plurality of yarns, usually through a mechanical process involving looms or knitting machines. One particular object that may be formed from a textile is an upper for an article of footwear.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Knitting is an example of a process that may form a textile. Knitting may generally be classified as either weft knitting or warp knitting. In both weft knitting and warp knitting, one or more yarns are manipulated to form a plurality of intermeshed loops that define a variety of courses and wales. In weft knitting, which is more common, the courses and wales are perpendicular to each other and may be formed from a single yarn or many yarns. In warp knitting, the wales and courses run roughly parallel.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although knitting may be performed by hand, the commercial manufacture of knitted components is generally performed by knitting machines. An example of a knitting machine for producing a weft knitted component is a V-bed flat knitting machine, which includes two needle beds that are angled with respect to each other. Rails extend above and parallel to the needle beds and provide attachment points for feeders, which move along the needle beds and supply yarns to needles within the needle beds. Standard feeders have the ability to supply a yarn that is utilized to knit, tuck, and float. In situations where an inlay yarn is incorporated into a knitted component, an inlay feeder is typically utilized.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure can be better understood with reference to the following drawings and description.

The actuator may include a motor, and/or the actuator may be operable to move at least one of the first needle bed and the second needle bed while at least one of the first needle bed and the second needle bed performs a knitting process.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a knitting machine <b>100</b> in accordance with certain aspects of the present disclosure. The knitting machine <b>100</b> may include two needle beds (a front or first needle bed <b>102</b> and a back or second needle bed <b>104</b>) that are angled with respect to each other (e.g., thereby forming a V-bed). The needles of the first needle bed <b>102</b> may lay on a first plane, and the needles of the second needle bed <b>104</b> may lay on a second plane. The first plane and the second plane may be angled relative to each other and meet to form an intersection (or axis) that extends along a majority of a width of the knitting machine <b>100</b>. The needles each may have a first or neutral position where they are retracted and a second or extended position where they are extended. In the neutral position, an end of the needles is spaced from the intersection, and in the extended position, the needles pass through the intersection. The needles, needle beds, and intersection are described in additional detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/048,540, patented as U.S. Pat. No. 9,060,570, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">One or more rails <b>106</b> may extend above and parallel to the intersection and may provide attachment points for one or more feeders <b>108</b>. Herein, the rails <b>106</b> are defined by a track for which a feeder <b>108</b> may couple to in a movable manner. The rails <b>106</b> may be secured to a body <b>107</b>, where the body <b>107</b> includes a rail <b>106</b> on each side (e.g., on two sides as shown) (and where each of the rails <b>106</b> are configured to couple to a different feeder <b>108</b>). Two rails <b>106</b> are included in the depicted embodiment, but more or fewer than two rails <b>106</b> may be included. The feeders <b>108</b> may include a dispensing area <b>110</b> located near the intersection and configured to dispense a yarn <b>112</b> to at least one of the first needle bed <b>102</b> and the second needle bed <b>104</b> as it moves along the intersection.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The knitting machine <b>100</b> may include a carriage <b>114</b> (also called a cam box) that is movable along the first needle bed <b>102</b> and the second needle bed <b>104</b>. An upper portion <b>116</b> of the carriage <b>114</b> may include a set of plungers (described in more detail below) that can selectively engage at least one of the feeders <b>108</b> such that the feeder <b>108</b> that is engaged moves along one of the rails <b>108</b> as the carriage <b>114</b> moves. As the carriage <b>114</b> moves along the first needle bed <b>102</b> and the second needle bed <b>104</b>, the carriage <b>114</b> may selectively actuate needles of the first needle bed <b>102</b> and/or the second needle bed <b>104</b> such that the actuated needles move from the default position to the extended position. The actuation may be the result of a set of cams (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the carriage <b>114</b> making contact with a butt portion of the needles and forcing the needles to move from the default position to the extended position as the carriage <b>114</b> passes. Due to the action of the carriage <b>114</b>, the feeder <b>108</b>, and the needles, the yarn <b>112</b> may be dispensed from the feeder <b>108</b> and to the needles of at least one of the first needle bed <b>102</b> and the second needle bed <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the knitting machine <b>100</b> may have needle beds that are movable relative to each other. For example, the first needle bed <b>102</b> and the second needle bed <b>104</b> may be movable in a first direction <b>118</b> and/or a second direction <b>120</b>. The first direction <b>118</b> and the second direction <b>120</b> may be parallel to the longitudinal axis defining the operation or knitting location of the needles of the knitting machine <b>100</b> (which may be an intersection point be of needles respectively from the first needle bed <b>102</b> and the second needle bed <b>104</b>, for example), and therefore also parallel to the course-wise direction (or longitudinal dimension of courses) when the knitting machine is operating. Such movement may be referred to as &#x201c;racking.&#x201d; While some existing machines are capable of slight racking (e.g., with total displacement of one needle bed relative to the other being up to a distance containing about 3 needles on one of the needle beds), such racking is primarily limited in purpose to calibration and alignment functions during machine setup along with forming knit wedges. By contrast, in the present embodiments, the knitting machine <b>100</b> may be capable of racking an extreme amount (e.g., offsetting by the distance containing 10 consecutive needles or more), and such racking may be utilized during knitting to form novel embodiments of knitted components as described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The movement of the first needle bed <b>102</b> relative to the second needle bed <b>104</b> may be controlled via an actuator <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, the actuator <b>122</b> may include an electric motor. The electric motor may be controlled, for example, by a computing interface, dials, switches, etc. (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Alternatively, the actuator <b>122</b> may comprise a manual input for moving the first needle bed <b>102</b> and/or the second needle bed relative to one another. For example, the manual input may comprise one or more levers, rotatable shafts, etc. (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) for manipulation by an operator. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the actuator <b>122</b> may be operatively connected to the first needle bed <b>102</b> and/or the second needle bed <b>104</b> by any means suitable for transmitting linear movement, including, for example, one or more shafts, gears, or linkages, and that transmission of the rotational and/or linear movement to the first needle bed <b>102</b> and/or the second needle bed <b>104</b> may result in rotation of the needle bed(s), linear movement of the needle bed(s), or a combination of both rotation and linear movement of the needle bed(s), as further described below.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, other components of the knitting machine <b>100</b> may be designed to accommodate extreme racking movement of at least one of the first needle bed <b>102</b> and the second needle bed <b>104</b>. For example, frame members and walls of the knitting machine <b>100</b> (e.g., the depicted wall <b>124</b>) may be removed (e.g., with reference to existing machine), moved, may include openings for receiving a needle bed (e.g., opening <b>126</b>), and/or may be otherwise redesigned such that they do not inhibit movement of the needle beds <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> along the first direction <b>118</b> and/or the second direction <b>120</b>. Thus, in certain embodiments, the first needle bed <b>102</b> may be movable/displaceable relative to the second needle bed <b>104</b> (through movement of one or more of the beds) for a distance that is equal to, or greater than, the distance containing five consecutive needles on one of the needle beds (e.g., such as a distance greater than or equal to the distance containing at least 10 needles, 20 needles, 50 needles, or even 100 needles or more on a needle bed).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">This racking capability may provide the knitting machine <b>100</b> with the ability to form knitted components with enhanced structures relative to previously-known varieties. For example, the knitting machine <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be capable of forming a knitted component <b>130</b> having two portions, each with a double-jersey knit structure, that overlap and connect with at least one connection course. To illustrate, and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a first portion <b>152</b> of a knitted component <b>130</b> may be formed at least partially on a first needle bed <b>102</b>, and a second portion <b>154</b> of the same knitted component <b>130</b> may be formed on a second needle bed <b>104</b>. During initial formation of the first portion <b>152</b> and the second portion <b>154</b> of the knitted component <b>130</b>, the first portion <b>152</b> and the second portion <b>154</b> may be offset (e.g., may be free from overlapping each other). While not shown explicitly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, one skilled in the art will understand that, since the two portions do not overlap from a front perspective, the first portion <b>152</b> and/or the second portion <b>154</b> may each be formed on both needle beds <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. In other words, the first portion <b>152</b> and the second portion <b>154</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may each have a double-jersey knit structure, herein defined as a knit structure formed using at least one needle from each of two needle beds in a single course. Thus, the formation of the first portion <b>152</b> and/or the second portion <b>154</b> with double-jersey knit structures may utilize the full capacity of two needle beds of the knitting machine <b>100</b>, which may provide the ability for each of the knit portions to have a relatively enhanced complexity for providing certain physical and/or visual characteristics (e.g., a relatively strong, inelastic, and durable structure) in addition to inlaid yarns/strands and/or other features not possible or impractical for formation on only one needle bed. A single-jersey knit structure, by contrast, is defined herein as a knit structure having a course formed using the needles of only one needle bed.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first portion <b>152</b> and the second portion <b>154</b> of the knitted component <b>130</b> may be formed with a common feeder or different feeders. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a first feeder <b>108</b><i>a </i>(and potentially additional feeders) may be used to form the first portion <b>152</b>, and a second feeder <b>108</b><i>b </i>(and potentially additional feeders) may be used to form the second portion <b>154</b>. Advantageously, using different feeders may provide the first portion <b>152</b> and the second portion <b>154</b> with different characteristics (e.g., by dispensing different yarns from the respective feeders), may reduce knitting time relative to processes using a common feeder, etc. If multiple feeders are used simultaneously, the knitting machine <b>100</b> may include separate actuation devices for simultaneous operation. For example, the feeders of the knitting machine <b>100</b> may be individually driven (e.g., via a belt-drive), more than one carriage <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may be included, etc.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">After formation of the first portion <b>152</b> and the second portion <b>154</b> of the knitted component <b>130</b>, the first portion <b>152</b> and/or the second portion <b>154</b> may be prepared for being moved via movement of at least one of the needle beds <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. For example, a transfer technique may be initiated to move all of the loops <b>136</b> of the first portion <b>152</b> to the first needle bed <b>102</b> and/or to move all of the loops <b>138</b> of the second portion <b>154</b> to the second needle bed <b>104</b>. As would be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, this transfer step frees the first portion <b>152</b> from the second needle bed <b>104</b> (e.g., such that no loops of the first portion <b>152</b> are held by needles of the second needle bed <b>104</b>) and also frees the second portion <b>154</b> from the first needle bed <b>102</b>. Importantly, since after such a transfer step, the second needle bed <b>104</b> can move relative to the first portion <b>152</b> of the knitted component <b>130</b> without pulling on, stretching, distorting, or otherwise interfering with the knit structure of the first portion <b>152</b> of the knitted component <b>130</b>. The same is true of movement of the first needle bed <b>102</b> relative to the second portion <b>154</b> of the knitted component <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, once the first portion <b>152</b> and the second portion <b>154</b> are formed and their loops transferred to the respective first needle bed <b>102</b> and second needle bed <b>104</b>, the first portion <b>152</b> and the second portion <b>154</b> can be moved into alignment (e.g., such that they overlap from the front perspective of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). This movement may occur due to movement of the first needle bed <b>102</b> relative to the second needle bed <b>104</b>. Such movement may occur automatically (e.g., via a programmed actuator as described above) or manually (e.g., through user-actuated movement via a hand-crank or other suitable means). While knitting may halt during this movement, it will be appreciated that single-jersey knitting may continue to occur during this movement.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Once the first portion <b>152</b> and the second portion <b>154</b> of the knitted component <b>130</b> are moved such that they at least partially overlap on the knitting machine <b>100</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), one or more connection courses may be formed to secure the first portion <b>152</b> to the second portion <b>154</b>. Then, the knitting machine <b>100</b> may continue to knit the knitted component <b>130</b> thereby forming a third portion <b>140</b> (which may have a double-jersey knit structure). Once knitting is complete, and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the knitted component <b>130</b> may therefore have a first portion <b>152</b> and a second portion <b>154</b> that overlap in a flat orientation, each having a double-jersey knit structure. When in such a flat orientation, the first portion <b>152</b> and the second portion <b>154</b> may form separable layers, where each layer has a double-jersey knit structure. Further, the first portion <b>152</b> and the second portion <b>154</b> may overlap at a location immediately adjacent to the connection course (at least when in a flat orientation), including in a location immediately adjacent to the connection course <b>142</b> in a direction <b>155</b> (which is perpendicular the course-wise direction). That is, if the course-wise direction extends along the longitudinal axis of the connection course <b>142</b>, the first portion <b>152</b> overlaps the second portion <b>154</b> at a location <b>157</b> that is immediately adjacent to the connection course <b>152</b> in the direction <b>155</b>, where the direction <b>155</b> is perpendicular to the course-wise direction.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The connection course(s) <b>142</b> may secure the first portion <b>152</b> to the second portion <b>154</b>, and in some embodiments may be the terminus of a separate third portion <b>140</b> of the knitted component <b>130</b>. While not shown, it is contemplated that the process described above may be repeated multiple times to form a knitted component having more than two layers, and/or different areas where each of the different areas has multiple layers. For example, a fourth portion of the knitted component (not shown) may be formed, and the fourth portion of the knitted component may be moved relative to the third portion of the knitted component and then connected to the third portion with a connection course formed on the knitting machine.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The knitting process described above, made possible by the knitting machine <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> having extreme racking capability, may be advantageous for forming a variety of knitted components. For example, the capabilities of the knitting machine <b>100</b> may be beneficial for forming enhanced uppers configured for use in an article of footwear and/or other articles, such as articles of apparel. When referring to articles of footwear, the disclosure may describe basketball shoes, running shoes, biking shoes, cross-training shoes, football shoes, golf shoes, hiking shoes and boots, ski and snowboarding boots, soccer shoes, tennis shoes, and/or walking shoes, as well as footwear styles generally considered non-athletic, including but not limited to dress shoes, loafers, and sandals.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">To illustrate, and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>B</figref>, a first portion <b>152</b> of an upper <b>150</b> may be formed in a first location <b>156</b> of the knitting machine <b>100</b>, as shown. A first feeder <b>160</b> (at least) may be utilized to form the first portion <b>152</b>. Similarly, a second portion <b>154</b> of the upper <b>150</b> may be formed in a second location <b>158</b> of the knitting machine <b>100</b>, and a different second feeder <b>162</b> (at least) may be used. In the depicted example (which is non-limiting), the first portion <b>152</b> may form the majority of the outer surface of an upper, and the second portion <b>154</b> may form the tongue of the upper. When the second portion <b>154</b> forms a tongue, a forward terminus of the tongue (e.g., within area <b>157</b>) may be coextensive with the first portion <b>152</b>, and may overlap the first portion <b>152</b>, such that the forward terminus of the tongue is covered by the first portion <b>152</b> from an external perspective.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Each of the first portion <b>152</b> and the second portion <b>154</b> may be formed with a double-jersey knit structure utilizing a first set of needles <b>166</b> of the first needle bed <b>102</b> and a second set of needles <b>168</b> of the second needle bed <b>104</b>. Advantageously, using two needle beds (i.e., double-jersey knitting) may provide an enhanced knit structure with suitable strength, durability, and desirable visual characteristics. Further, double jersey knitting may provide the ability for inlaying at least one tensile strand <b>170</b> within a course during the knitting process. One example of inlaying is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/048,527, filed on Mar. 15, 2011, and patented as U.S. Pat. No. 8,522,577, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. While not shown, the second portion <b>154</b> of the upper <b>150</b> could also include one or more inlaid strands or other elements.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Once the first portion <b>152</b> and the second portion <b>154</b> are formed, all of the outstanding loops of the first portion <b>152</b> that are on the second needle bed <b>104</b> of the knitting machine may be transferred to the first needle bed <b>102</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, for example). Similarly, all of the outstanding loops of the second portion <b>154</b> that are on the first needle bed <b>102</b> may be transferred to the second needle bed <b>104</b> (similar to as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Then, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the first portion <b>152</b> may be moved relative to the second portion <b>154</b> such that the first portion <b>152</b> and the second portion <b>154</b> at least partially overlap from a front perspective. While in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, only one needle bed moves (e.g., moving the first portion <b>152</b> from the first location <b>156</b> to the second location <b>158</b>), both needle beds may move, and/or only the other needle bed may move. Once the components of the upper <b>150</b> are in their desired positions, one or more connection courses <b>142</b> may then be formed on the first needle bed <b>102</b> and the second needle bed <b>104</b> to secure the first portion <b>152</b> and the second portion <b>154</b> together. It is contemplated that the connection courses may be formed using the first feeder <b>160</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) and/or the second feeder <b>162</b>, but a separate feeder may alternatively be used (such as feeder <b>163</b>), particularly if it is desirable to provide an additional portion or third portion (e.g., a toe area in the depicted example) with yarns of different materials.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Advantageously, the first portion <b>152</b> and the second portion <b>154</b> may be secured together on the knitting machine and without necessitating sewing or otherwise attaching the portions together after the knitting process. That is, the knitting process on the knitting machine may substantially secure the two portions together and also may form the remainder of the upper <b>150</b> without the need for significant post-knitting processes or steps. Such an embodiment may display enhanced strength and durability relative to other embodiments, and substantially completing formation during one process (e.g., on the knitting machine) may increase manufacturing efficiency and/or reduce manufacturing costs, thus lowering the overall cost to consumers. This contrasts with embodiments where two or more portions are formed separately as distinct knitted components and then later secured to each other after knitting.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a flow diagram that depicts certain steps of a method for forming a knitted component on a knitting machine in accordance with the aspects discussed above. Additional steps may be included (and/or some left out), and therefore the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is not intended to be exhaustive. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, steps <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> may include knitting a first portion of a knitted component and a second portion of a knitted component. Each of the first portion and the second portion may include a double-jersey knit structure, and formation of the first portion and the second portion may occur simultaneously (e.g., with different feeders in some embodiments). In steps <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>, each of the first portion and the second portion of the knitted component may be transferred to a respective needle bed such that the needle beds can move relative to one-another without distorting and damaging the two knit portions. In step <b>310</b>, one of the needle beds of the knitting machine may be moved relative to the other (e.g., &#x201c;racking&#x201d;) to align the two knit portions on the knitting machine. Finally, in step <b>312</b>, the first portion and the second portion may be secured, while still on the knitting machine, by knitting at least one connection course.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The present disclosure encompasses any and all possible combinations of some or all of the various aspects described herein.
