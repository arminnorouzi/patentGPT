An increase in the pressure in the pressure line owing to a closure of the spraying-out opening results in the bypass line opening and, owing to a pressure difference brought about by the cleaning liquid, to the plunger being moved by way of the cleaning liquid so as to switch off the pump of the high-pressure cleaning appliance. Nevertheless, a high pressure remains in the pressure line, so that an operator, when actuating an actuating element, for opening the spraying-out opening, has to apply a large force in order to open, counter to the pressure, a corresponding valve in the pressure line. The processes for regulating the pressure and for opening and closing the valve in the pressure line via the actuating element are associated with high structural outlay and a high degree of wear of the components.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The disclosure is based on an object of further developing a generic high-pressure cleaning appliance in such a way that it is convenient to use, can be used with a low degree of wear and can be produced with little structural outlay.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the disclosure, the high-pressure cleaning appliance is structurally configured in such a way that the adjustment of the operating state of the motor is possible only if the valve is in the open state. The two operating states of the motor include the off state and the on state. In the off state, the motor is off and is not supplied with electrical energy. In the on state, the motor is on and is supplied with electrical energy. The fact that the high-pressure cleaning appliance is structurally configured in such a way that the adjustment of the operating state of the motor is possible only if the valve is in the open state means that the motor can be switched from the off state into the on state only if the valve is in the open state. In this way, it is possible to avoid a situation in which a high pressure acts on the valve due to the motor and the delivery pump during the pumping of the liquid. The fact that the high-pressure cleaning appliance is structurally configured in such a way that the adjustment of the operating state of the motor is possible only if the valve is in the open state means that the motor can be switched from the on state into the off state only if the valve is in the open state. In this way, it is ensured that the pressure prevailing in the delivery line owing to the pumping of the liquid via the delivery pump can, at least in part, be reduced if the motor is transferred from the on state into the off state. In this way, a situation in which the valve is subjected to high pressure after being transferred into the closed state is avoided. The components involved in the switching-on and/or switching-off of the motor are not subjected to any pressure due to the liquid delivered by the delivery pump.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The fact that the high-pressure cleaning appliance is structurally configured in such a way that the adjustment of the operating state of the motor is possible only if the valve is in the open state means that build-up of a high pressure in the delivery line can be prevented. In this way, the valve may be configured for much lower pressures. Owing to the lower pressure in the delivery line, in particular if the valve is in the closed state and the motor is in the off state, a low force is required for setting the valve into the open state. In this case, the operator has to apply only a small force, since he or she does not have to work against a high pressure of the liquid in the delivery line. This makes possible a convenient use of the high-pressure cleaning appliance according to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In particular, the high-pressure cleaning appliance is structurally configured in such a way that the adjustment of the valve state is possible only if the motor is in the off state. In this way, the valve can be transferred from the closed state into the open state only if the motor is in the off state. Likewise, the valve can be transferred from the open state into the closed state only if the motor is in the off state. In this way, the valve may be configured for low pressures. The degree of wear of the valve is low.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Advantageously, the high-pressure cleaning appliance can be configured in such a way that the valve can be set into the closed state only after the motor has been set into the off state. In this way, it is ensured that, if the valve is closed, a high pressure cannot be formed in the delivery line of the high-pressure cleaning appliance. At the time of the closure of the valve, the motor of the delivery pump is already off. In this way, the delivery pump cannot increase the pressure of the liquid against the closed valve. The fact that the valve is closed only after the motor has been switched off means that pressure in the delivery line can already be reduced before the closure of the valve. In this way, easier and more convenient closure of the valve by the user is possible. This makes possible a convenient use of the high-pressure cleaning appliance according to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Advantageously, the motor can be set into the on state only after the valve has been set into the open state. In this way, an increase in the pressure on the closed valve due to the delivery pump is prevented. Therefore, in the closed state of the valve, a high pressure does not prevail at the valve. This makes possible simple and convenient opening of the valve. There is no need for the user to apply a large force for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment of the disclosure, the high-pressure cleaning appliance includes an actuating element. Expediently, the high-pressure cleaning appliance is configured in such a way that an electrical signal can be generated directly by the actuating element, and that the motor can be set into at least one of the two operating states as a consequence of the electrical signal generated directly by the actuating element.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In particular, the high-pressure cleaning appliance is configured in such a way that the electrical signal generated directly by the actuating element for setting the motor into at least one of the two operating states is forwarded, at least in part, wirelessly to the motor. Expediently, the electrical signal triggered by the actuating element can be communicated wirelessly to the motor. This makes possible particularly simple production of the high-pressure cleaning appliance. Moreover, a convenient use of the high-pressure cleaning appliance is possible. There is no need to take into account the routing of a cable. The actuating element can be positioned at any desired place along the delivery line of the high-pressure cleaning appliance.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Advantageously, the high-pressure cleaning appliance can be configured in such a way that the setting of the motor into at least one of the two operating states as a consequence of the electrical signal generated directly by the actuating element is realized independently of the pressure conditions in the delivery line. In particular, the adjustment of the motor from the on state into the off state is realized without an element that is adjusted in a manner dependent on the pressure in the delivery line. The fact that the motor can be set into the on position or the off position as a consequence of the electrical signal generated directly by the actuating element means that a high pressure in the delivery line can be avoided when the valve is in the closed state. Since the switching-off or switching-on of the motor does not need to be realized via a hydraulic mechanism, but rather is realized as a consequence of the electrical signal generated directly by the actuating element, the components involved are much less susceptible to wear.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The fact that the motor can be set into the off position or the on position as a consequence of the electrical signal generated directly by the actuating element means that quick switching-on of the motor and quick switching-off of the motor are possible. Such a configuration of the high-pressure cleaning appliance renders unnecessary hydraulic deactivation of the motor. Consequently, numerous components of the high-pressure cleaning appliance can be saved. These saved components are subjected to a high degree of wear in the prior art. This is not the case for the components required in the case of a configuration of the high-pressure cleaning appliance with the motor being switched on and switched off as a consequence of an electrical signal generated&#x2014;without the effect of a hydraulic force&#x2014;directly by the actuating element. In this way, operation with a low degree of wear is possible. Owing to the smaller number of components required to bring about the switching-on and switching-off of the motor, only a low structural outlay is required for producing the high-pressure cleaning appliance.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment of the disclosure, the high-pressure cleaning appliance has a valve-actuating element which can be actuated separately from the actuating element. The valve can be set into one of the two valve states via the valve-actuating element. Expediently, the high-pressure cleaning appliance is configured in such a way that the actuating element, for setting the operating state of the motor, can be actuated only if the valve has be brought into the open state via the valve-actuating element. In particular, the valve-actuating element is configured in such a way that, when actuated, it releases the actuating element for actuation. In the case of actuation of the valve-actuating element, the valve is in the open state. In the case of non-actuation of the valve-actuating element, actuation of the actuating element is not possible. In the case of actuation of the actuating element, the motor is in the on state. It may be provided that the high-pressure cleaning appliance is configured in such a way that the valve-actuating element is in an arrested state when the actuating element is actuated. If the valve-actuating element is in an arrested state, it is held in a position in which the valve-actuating element otherwise is in the case of actuation by a user. Active actuation of the valve-actuating element by a user is not required in the case of the valve-actuating element being arrested.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In particular, the setting of the valve into one of the two valve states via the valve-actuating element is realized mechanically. In this case, the force applied by the operator is transmitted in particular directly to the valve.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Advantageously, the valve can be set into one of the two valve states via the actuating element. In this case, the actuating element serves both for setting the operating state of the motor and for setting the valve state of the valve. In this case, a valve-actuating element is not provided.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In particular, the setting of the valve into one of the two valve states via the actuating element is realized mechanically. In this case, the force applied by the operator is transmitted in particular directly to the valve.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In particular, the actuating element has a pivot lever with a first end position. Expediently, the valve is set in the closed state only in the first end position of the pivot lever. In particular, the high-pressure cleaning appliance is configured in such a way that the motor is set into the off state, as a consequence of the electrical signal generated directly by the pivot lever, prior to the first end position of the pivot lever being reached. It may however also be provided that the motor is set into the off state when the first end position of the pivot lever is reached. In this way, a temporal sequence for the switching-off of the motor and the transfer of the valve into the closed state is defined. The valve closed after the motor has been switched off. It may also be provided that the valve closes when the motor is switched off.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment of the disclosure, it is provided that, in the off state of the motor, a pressure which corresponds at most to 15 bar, in particular at most to 10 bar, preferably at most to the prevailing line pressure, acts on the valve in the closed state of the valve by way of the liquid in the delivery line. The prevailing line pressure is the pressure in the delivery line before the delivery pump, after connection of the liquid source, is put into operation for the first time. The prevailing line pressure is the pressure which prevails in the supply line of the liquid source. The fact that a pressure of at most 15 bar, in particular a pressure of at most 10 bar, preferably a pressure corresponding at most to the prevailing line pressure, acts on the valve means that the actuating element can be actuated with little force. The valve can be opened with little force.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Expediently, the valve is the only valve in the delivery line. This makes possible simple production of the high-pressure cleaning appliance. Only a small number of components are required.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In particular, the valve is arranged in the delivery line between the delivery pump and the spraying-out opening. It may however also be provided that the valve is arranged in the delivery line between the connection and the delivery pump.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Advantageously, the high-pressure cleaning appliance can be configured in such a way that the setting of the motor into at least one of the two operating states as a consequence of the electrical signal generated directly by the actuating element is realized independently of the pressure conditions in the delivery line. In particular, the setting of the motor into at least one of the two operating states is realized after generation of the electrical signal generated directly by the actuating element independently of the pressure conditions in the delivery line. In particular, the liquid in the delivery line is not involved in the forwarding of the electrical signal generated directly by the actuating element to the motor. Expediently, the communication of the electrical signal generated directly by the actuating element to the motor is realized exclusively electrically and/or electromagnetically.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In particular, the high-pressure cleaning appliance has a gun. Expediently, the actuating element is arranged on the gun. This allows intuitive use of the high-pressure cleaning appliance. The gun, in particular the spraying-out opening arranged in the gun, can be directed at a target, and at the same time the valve can be opened via the actuating element. Activation of the motor of the delivery pump is also possible via the actuating element. In this way, convenient operation of the high-pressure cleaning appliance is possible in a simple manner. Expediently, the delivery pump is formed separately from the gun.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an embodiment of the disclosure, the high-pressure cleaning appliance is configured in such a way that the magnitude of the liquid volume flow delivered through the delivery line can be set by way of an electrical volume signal which can be selected via the actuating element. In particular, the electrical volume signal brings about a setting of the delivery power of the delivery pump. The larger the electrical volume signal, the higher the delivery power of the delivery pump.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It may also be provided that the high-pressure cleaning appliance has a regulation line which connects the part of the delivery line between the delivery pump and the spraying-out opening to the part of the delivery line between the connection and the delivery pump. In particular, a regulation valve is arranged in the regulation line. Expediently, the regulation valve can be set via the electrical volume signal generated directly by the actuating element. In this case, the regulation valve can be adjusted continuously in a stepped or stepless manner between a completely closed state and a completely open state. The regulation valve may have various degrees of closure between the completely closed state and the completely open state. It may be provided that the magnitude of the volume flow can be set by way of the degree of closure of the regulation valve.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">It may be provided that the volume signal can be selected in multiple different steps. Expediently, the electrical volume signal can be selected steplessly via the actuating element. In particular, the electrical volume signal can be selected steplessly. In this way, the magnitude of the liquid volume flow delivered through the delivery line can be set steplessly.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In particular, the operator can freely select the pump power of the delivery pump via the actuating element, according to the required volume flow. It may also be provided that the operator can freely select the degree of closure of the regulation valve via the actuating element, according to the required volume flow.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In particular, the actuating element has a first end position, in which the valve is in the closed state. In particular, the actuating element has a second end position, in which the valve is in the open state. The actuating element covers a travel distance between the first end position and the second end position. Advantageously, the high-pressure cleaning appliance can be configured in such a way that the delivered volume flow is, at least sectionally, proportional to the travel distance covered by the actuating element. In other words, at least over a portion of the travel distance, it holds that: the greater the intensity of pressing of the actuating element, the greater the delivered volume flow.

The counter-pressure <b>35</b> of the actuating element <b>7</b> increases over the travel distance of the actuating element <b>7</b> from the position s<sub>0 </sub>to the position s<sub>1</sub>. At the position s<sub>1 </sub>of the actuating element <b>7</b>, the motor <b>4</b> is, in all the embodiments, in its off state.

The valve <b>8</b> is open. In the range between the positions s<sub>2 </sub>and s<sub>3 </sub>of the travel distance of the actuating element <b>7</b>, the actuating element <b>7</b> directly generates an electrical volume signal. The volume signal becomes stronger with larger travel distance of the actuating element <b>7</b>. Accordingly, it is also the case that the volume flow <b>25</b> increases. In the range between the positions s<sub>2 </sub>and s<sub>3 </sub>of the travel distance of the actuating element <b>7</b>, the strength of the electrical volume signal <b>25</b> is proportional to the travel distance covered by the actuating element <b>7</b>.

In the embodiments, a spring pushes the actuating element <b>7</b> into the position s<sub>0</sub>. The counter-pressure <b>35</b> on the actuating element <b>7</b> slightly increases as the travel distance covered by the actuating element <b>7</b> increases, owing to the larger spring force.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The range of the travel distance of the actuating element <b>7</b> between the positions s<sub>3 </sub>and s<sub>4 </sub>is associated with a boost function. The boost function again provides a larger volume flow and thus a higher pressure for the liquid in the delivery line <b>5</b> in the region of the exit opening <b>6</b>. In order to pass into this range, the operator must firstly exert a larger force on the actuating element <b>7</b>. If, proceeding from position s<sub>3</sub>, the operator actuates the actuating element <b>7</b> further, the counter-pressure on the actuating element <b>7</b> firstly increases sharply. This increase in the counter-pressure is for structural reasons. In the embodiments, the actuating element <b>7</b> has to overcome a latching protuberance which presents a resistance for the actuating element <b>7</b>. Owing to the larger force required for this purpose that is to be applied by the operator, the actuating element <b>7</b>, after overcoming the highest counter-pressure, covers the remaining travel distance up to the position s<sub>4 </sub>very quickly and jerkily. Therefore, in terms of time, the volume flow <b>25</b> increases very quickly in this range. This is perceived as a jump in the volume flow <b>25</b> by the operator. A larger volume flow <b>25</b>, and thus also a larger pressure, is available in an abrupt manner. The boost function has been activated. After the highest counter-pressure between the positions s<sub>3 </sub>and s<sub>4 </sub>has been overcome, the counter-pressure decreases again over the travel of the actuating element <b>7</b> to the position s<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">If the operator ends the actuation of the actuating element <b>7</b> in the position s<sub>4</sub>, the actuating element <b>7</b> is pushed back into the position s<sub>0 </sub>owing to the spring. Over the travel of the actuating element <b>7</b> from the position s<sub>4 </sub>to the position s<sub>0</sub>, firstly, at the position s<sub>2</sub>, the actuating element <b>7</b> directly generates the electrical signal that brings about a setting of the motor <b>4</b> into the off state <b>10</b> and subsequently, at the position s<sub>1</sub>, the valve <b>8</b> is set mechanically into the closed position <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an alternative embodiment for a high-pressure cleaning appliance <b>1</b>.
