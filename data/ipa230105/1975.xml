The main stroller frame comprises a central frame hub, and a handle part, a rear leg part and a front leg part that can separately be pivotally coupled to the central frame hub. The main stroller frame further comprises a fitting part attached to the handle part. The compact foldable stroller has an unfolded state for use and a folded state for storage. When the compact foldable stroller changes from the unfolded state to the folded state, the fitting part approaches a rear wheel set. The main stroller frame can be compactly folded by means of a series of pivot points, which may accept child seats of various configurations during installation. The seat can be folded in a manner suitable to the folding boundary size of the main stroller frame, thereby keeping the folding size of the stroller unit minimal.</p></abstract><drawings

Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure generally relates to a stroller used to transport children while the caregiver is walking outside of the home. More particularly, the invention relates to a stroller capable of folding to a compact size while still allowing for multiple seating modes for the child.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are several strollers in the market that allow the child seat to be attached to the main stroller frame in multiple configurations, as well as strollers that are able to fold to a compact and easily transported size. Currently strollers that offer multiple seating modes for the child do not fold to a compact size that is easy to transport. Furthermore, stroller that are able to fold to a compact size, often do not have full features on the child seat or the main stroller frame, in addition to small wheels that do not allow the stroller to handle uneven terrain.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The object of the present disclosure is to provide a compact collapsible stroller, which can reduce or eliminate at least one of the above-mentioned disadvantages.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This disclosure features a main stroller frame and a child seat that can be attached to the main stroller frame in multiple configurations.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is a feature of this disclosure that the stroller is folded in two steps because the child seat folds separately from the main stroller frame.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is a feature of this disclosure that as part of the seat fold, the seat frame is released to pivot around the seat mount so that both the upper and lower seat frames hang relatively vertical with respect to the seat mount.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to achieve the above objects of the present disclosure, in one aspect, the present disclosure provides a compact collapsible stroller including a main stroller frame. The main stroller frame includes a central frame hub and a handle portion, a rear leg portion, and a front leg portion pivotally coupled to the central frame hub. The main stroller frame further includes an adapter portion attached to the handle portion. The compact collapsible stroller has an unfolded state for use and a folded state for storage, and the adapter portion approaches rear wheels when the compact collapsible stroller is transformed from the unfolded state to the folded state.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, in the folded state, the central frame hub and a seat mount overlap in a lateral direction</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, in the folded state, each of the handle portion, the rear leg portion, and the front leg portion substantially vertically extends downward from the central frame hub, and each of an upper frame, a lower frame and a child tray substantially vertically extends downward from the seat mount.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the handle portion comprises: a lower handle portion pivotally coupled to the central frame hub; a handle portion hub is formed at an end of the lower handle portion opposite to the central frame hub; an upper handle portion pivotally coupled to the handle portion hub.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the rotation of the upper handle portion can disengage the lower handle portion from the central frame hub, so that the lower handle portion can rotate relative to the central frame hub.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the rotation of the lower handle portion relative to the central frame hub causes the seat mount to approach to the central frame hub.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the main stroller frame further comprises a carrying basket extending backward from the rear leg portion, and when the compact collapsible stroller changes from the unfolded state to the folded state, the carrying basket rotates and compactly closes to the rear leg portion.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, the main stroller frame further includes: an upper link attached to the adapter portion and pivotally connected to the handle portion; a lower link pivotally connected to the rear leg portion and the upper link.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the compact collapsible stroller further includes a basket frame which attached between the lower link and a pivot point on the rear leg portion.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, when transforming from the unfolded state to the folded state, through the downward pivoting movement of the handle portion, the upper link drives the lower link in a downward movement, thereby driving the basket frame attached to the lower link to rotate corresponding to the pivot point on the rear leg portion.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the compact collapsible stroller has a rectangular folding boundary, and when the compact collapsible stroller is transformed from the unfolded state to the folded state, none of parts of the compact collapsible stroller exceed beyond the folding boundary.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is an advantage of this disclosure that the child seat frame pivot is located to allow the seat frame to be folded within the main stroller frame folding boundary.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is an advantage of this disclosure that the child tray is released from a locked position and able to pivot relative to the child seat frame during the motion of folding the child seat frame.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is an advantage of this disclosure that the free pivoting vertical orientation allows the seat to find an optimal storage location within the main stroller frame folding boundary.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Various objects, features and advantages of the present disclosure will become more apparent from the detailed descriptions of exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure with reference with the accompanying drawings.

the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, the embodiments are only provided for illustration and explanation and cannot be used to limit the scope of patent protection of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0094">The terms used in the present disclosure are only for the purpose of describing specific embodiments and are not intended to limit the present disclosure. The singular forms of &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;said&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; used in the present disclosure and the appended claims are also intended to include plural forms, unless the context clearly indicates other meanings. It should also be understood that the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; used herein refers to and includes any or all possible combinations of one or more associated listed items.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0095">The compact collapsible stroller (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;stroller&#x201d;) <b>1</b> of the present disclosure includes a collapsible main stroller frame <b>10</b>, which can accommodate child seat frames <b>20</b> of various configurations (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0096">One configuration of the child seat frame <b>20</b> may include an upper frame <b>210</b>, a lower frame <b>220</b>, a child tray <b>230</b>, and a seat mount <b>240</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The upper frame <b>210</b> and the lower frame <b>220</b> are pivotally connected to the seat mount <b>240</b> through an upper seat frame hub <b>211</b> and a lower seat frame hub <b>221</b>. Likewise, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>3</b>A</figref>, the child tray <b>230</b> is pivotally connected to the seat hub (seat mount) <b>240</b> through a child tray hub <b>231</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0097">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>4</b>A</figref>, the child seat frame <b>20</b> may have a seat mode and a cradle mode. One configuration for attaching the child seat frame <b>20</b> to the main stroller frame <b>10</b> is in a forward sitting position, which is the seat mode. In the seat mode, the upper frame <b>210</b> may extend upward from the seat mount <b>240</b>, specifically, obliquely extending backward and upward, and the lower frame <b>220</b> may extend downward from the seat mount <b>240</b>, specifically, obliquely extending forward and downward. At this time, the upper frame <b>210</b> and the lower frame <b>220</b> are formed in a linear shape passing through the seat mount <b>240</b>. In the cradle mode, the upper frame <b>210</b> and the lower frame <b>220</b> extend horizontally from the seat mount <b>240</b> to both sides thereof. The child seat frame <b>20</b> can be converted from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> to a position where the cradle is lying down.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0098">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in order to convert the child seat frame <b>20</b> from the seat mode to the cradle position (i.e., cradle mode), the user may manipulate the recline handle <b>223</b>, which uses a cable to retract the spring-loaded lower frame plunger <b>222</b> from a position engaging with the seat mount <b>240</b>. This allows the entire child seat frame <b>20</b> to rotate to a horizontal position relative to the seat mount <b>240</b>, and re-engages the spring-loaded lower frame plunger <b>222</b> with the seat mount <b>240</b> to lock the child seat frame <b>20</b> in this position.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0099">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in addition to the reclining handle <b>223</b>, the child seat frame <b>20</b> also includes a fold handle <b>213</b> for folding the child seat frame <b>20</b> as a part of the folding of the stroller. The fold handle <b>213</b> retracts the spring-biased upper frame plunger <b>212</b> from its engagement position with the lower seat frame hub <b>221</b>. The upper frame (i.e., upper seat frame) <b>210</b> can now rotate around the seat mount <b>240</b> relative to the lower frame (i.e., lower seat frame) <b>220</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, when the upper frame <b>220</b> rotates, a ramped surface <b>2111</b> in the upper seat frame hub <b>211</b> acts on a ramped surface <b>251</b> on the latch pin assembly <b>250</b> to press the latch pin assembly <b>250</b> into the seat mount <b>240</b>, and separate the latch pin assembly <b>250</b> from the child tray hub <b>231</b>, thereby releasing the child tray <b>230</b> to be able to pivot freely around the seat mount <b>240</b>. In addition, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a spiral control surface <b>2112</b> located in the upper seat frame hub <b>211</b> disengages the two lower seat frame hubs <b>221</b> from the seat mount <b>240</b> because it acts on a lower frame plunger control post <b>2221</b>. This allows the lower frame <b>220</b> to rotate around the seat mount <b>240</b> to a relatively vertical (upright) position with respect to the seat mount <b>240</b>. The spiral control surface <b>2112</b> is formed to gradually move away from the center of the upper seat frame hub <b>211</b> from one side to the other, so that when the upper seat frame hub <b>211</b> rotates relative to the seat mount <b>240</b>, the spiral control surface <b>2112</b> may abut against and push the lower frame plunger control post <b>2221</b> to move away from the seat mount <b>240</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, this operation causes the upper frame <b>210</b>, the lower frame <b>220</b> and the child tray <b>230</b> to fall parallel to one another and relatively vertical (upright) to the seat mount <b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0100">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the stroller main frame <b>10</b> may include a handle portion <b>110</b>, a rear leg portion <b>120</b> and a front leg portion <b>130</b>. Each part of the stroller main frame <b>10</b> is pivotally connected to a central frame hub <b>140</b>. An lower end of the rear leg portion <b>120</b> has rear wheels <b>180</b>. An lower end of the front leg portion <b>130</b> has front wheels.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0101">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>11</b>A</figref>, a frame latch <b>150</b> pivotally connected to a handle part plate <b>111</b> engages with a locking pin <b>1211</b> on the rear leg part plate <b>121</b> such that the stroller <b>1</b> is locked in the opened position. When the frame latch <b>150</b> is rotated so that the latch surface passes through the lock pin <b>1211</b> and is disengaged from the lock pin <b>1211</b>, the handle section plate <b>111</b> is allowed to rotate, and a front leg section plate <b>131</b> is pulled by a link <b>160</b> to the folded position. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the handle portion <b>110</b>, the rear leg portion <b>120</b>, and the front leg portion <b>130</b> are folded almost parallel to one another to obtain a compact folded size for easy transportation or storage of the main stroller frame <b>10</b> when the stroller is not in use. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the upper half of the handle portion <b>110</b> is locked by a spring biased plunger <b>112</b> and thus cannot be rotated, the spring biased plunger <b>112</b> is pulled to an unlocked state by a cable anchored in a main folding release housing. In this way, the upper handle portion <b>113</b> and the parent bracket (the part extending horizontally from the upper handle portion <b>113</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) can be rotated in the folding process to obtain a more compact folding size. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the stroller <b>1</b> has a folding boundary (as shown by the dotted block in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>) in the folding process. When the stroller <b>1</b> is transformed between the unfolded state and the folded state, none of the parts can exceed beyond the folding boundary.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0102">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the upper handle portion <b>113</b> is pivotally fixed to the handle portion hub <b>114</b>. The spring biased plunger <b>112</b> is engaged with the handle portion hub <b>114</b> so that the upper handle portion <b>113</b> cannot pivot relative to the handle portion hub <b>114</b>. The spring biased plunger <b>112</b> can be actuated via a cable to disengage from the handle portion hub <b>114</b> so that the upper handle portion <b>113</b> can pivot relative to the handle portion hub <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0103">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the cable anchored on a circular barrel <b>1141</b> in the handle portion hub <b>114</b> and attached to the frame latch <b>150</b> rotates with the upper handle portion <b>113</b>, to actuate the frame latch <b>150</b> (an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows a direction in which the frame latch <b>150</b> is actuated) and pivot it past the locking pin, and thus fold the handle portion <b>110</b> toward the closed position. Time for folding is controlled by an extended latch surface <b>151</b> of the frame latch <b>150</b>. The extended latch surface <b>151</b> allows the frame latch <b>150</b> to engage with the locking pin <b>1211</b> until the upper handle portion <b>113</b> has rotated by a larger distance from its original position. When the extended latch surface <b>151</b> is disengaged from the locking pin <b>1211</b>, the handle portion <b>110</b> may be folded toward the closed position. This results in a more natural folding movement while preventing the main stroller frame <b>10</b> from being accidentally folded (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>). When the upper handle portion <b>113</b> rotates toward the opened position, an anchor end of the cable rotates backward (counterclockwisely as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>) along with the upper handle portion <b>113</b>, and the length from the cable to the frame latch <b>150</b> increases, which allows the frame latch <b>150</b> to re-engage with the locking pin <b>1211</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0104">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> and <b>16</b>A</figref>, the rotation of the lower handle portion <b>115</b> also drives a series of couplings between the seat mount <b>240</b> and the stroller basket for carrying the baby. An upper link <b>116</b> is directly attached to the seat frame hub (seat mount) <b>240</b> and is connected to the handle portion <b>110</b> at a pivot point <b>1151</b>. An upper end of the upper link <b>116</b> is formed with an adapter portion <b>170</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). Due to the downward folding movement of the handle portion <b>110</b>, the upper link <b>116</b> is driven downward and the child seat hub (seat mount) <b>240</b> is pulled within a predetermined folding boundary. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>17</b>A</figref>, a basket frame is attached between a lower link <b>117</b> and a pivot point on the rear leg portion <b>120</b>. A carrying basket <b>190</b> may be provided below a basket frame (a left part of the lower link <b>117</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). During the folding of the main stroller frame <b>10</b>, only the carrying basket <b>190</b> is linked to the main stroller frame <b>10</b> to be folded, while the adapter portion <b>170</b> is not linked. Through the downward folding movement (pivoting movement) of the handle portion <b>110</b>, the upper link <b>116</b> drives the lower link <b>117</b> in a downward movement, and further drives the basket frame downward and rotates it behind the rear leg portion <b>120</b>. This allows the basket frame to be installed within the folding boundary while maximizing its size so as to achieve maximum storage capacity.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0105">When the stroller <b>1</b> is transformed from the unfolded state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> and <b>17</b></figref>) to the folded state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A and <b>17</b>A</figref>), the seat mount <b>240</b> gradually approaches the central frame hub <b>140</b>, and finally overlaps or at least substantially overlaps in a transverse direction (perpendicular to the paper surface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref>). At this time, the handle portion <b>110</b>, the rear leg portion <b>120</b>, and the front leg portion <b>130</b> vertically extend substantially downward from the central frame hub <b>140</b>, and the upper frame <b>210</b>, the lower frame <b>220</b>, and the child tray <b>230</b> vertically extend substantially downward from the seat mount <b>240</b>, so that the stroller <b>1</b> in the folded state occupies the minimum space.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0106">Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed here.
