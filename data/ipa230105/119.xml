Further aspects of the invention are the use of a paste to prepare a beverage and a process for preparing a paste.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">There is increasing consumer interest in beverages which contain high levels of fat, for example beverages containing ingredients such as butter, medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil or coconut oil. Making such beverages at home is often not convenient, requiring blending the fats into the beverage using a kitchen blender. Even with the use of a mechanical device such as a blender, high fat beverages generally have an oily layer on the top of the beverage which is unattractive.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are a number of popular high fat spreads, for example hazelnut and chocolate spreads to eat with bread. Typically they contain around 60% sugar and 30% fat. When a spoonful of such a paste is manually mixed into hot water it does not disperse readily. It appears that, as the sugar dissolves, the hazelnut and cocoa powder form a suspension of cocoa particles and large clumps of hazelnut butter. The insoluble cocoa and hazelnut components settle at the bottom.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a need for beverages containing high levels of fat which can be conveniently prepared by simple mixing, for example via the provision of a pre-prepared high fat composition that can be added to water or a base beverage such as coffee, tea or cocoa to provide a beverage containing high levels of fat. Ideally the high fat composition should not only provide high levels of fat, it should also lighten the appearance of the beverage and not lead to the formation of an oily layer on the top of the beverage. Preferably the materials used to prepare such beverages should provide a good shelf-life and should not contain ingredients that consumers may consider artificial or undesirable.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Any reference to prior art documents in this specification is not to be considered an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of the common general knowledge in the field. As used in this specification, the words &#x201c;comprises&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprising&#x201d;, and similar words, are not to be interpreted in an exclusive or exhaustive sense. In other words, they are intended to mean &#x201c;including, but not limited to&#x201d;.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the present invention is to improve the state of the art and to provide an improved solution to overcome at least some of the inconveniences described above. The object of the present invention is achieved by the subject matter of the independent claims. The dependent claims further develop the idea of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, the present invention provides in a first aspect a paste for preparing a beverage, the paste having a continuous aqueous phase, the paste comprising 0.1 to 50 wt. % sweetener; 10 to 50 wt. % fat; 0 to 50 wt. % polysaccharides having a molecular weight below 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>Da; and 0.5 to 5 wt. % high molecular weight polysaccharides having a molecular weight between 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>Da and 2.5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>Da; wherein the paste is free from added monoacylglycerols, diacylglycerols and diacetylated tartaric acid esters of monoglycerides</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a second aspect, the invention provides the use of the paste of the invention to prepare a beverage. In a further aspect, the invention relates to a process for preparing the paste of the invention.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It has been surprisingly found by the inventors that a beverage containing a high level of fat may conveniently be prepared from a paste according to the invention by simply mixing the paste with water (e.g. hot water), for example mixing into water by hand using a spoon. The composition of the invention stabilizes small oil droplets in the continuous aqueous phase of the paste so that the fat disperses readily into an aqueous beverage without causing large globules of oil to appear on the surface of the beverage.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a microscope image of the coconut cream ketogenic beverage enhancer paste of Example 1.

The high molecular weight polysaccharides may have a weight average molecular weight between 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>Da and 2.5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>Da. Pastes are soft substances, for example the paste of the invention may exhibit a maximum penetration force of less than 100 gram-force at 20&#xb0; C., for example a maximum penetration force between 10 and 60 gram-force at 20&#xb0; C. The maximum penetration force may for example be measured using a texture analyser fitted with a 60&#xb0; conical probe. Pastes are thick substances, for example the paste of the invention may have a viscosity greater than 1000 mPa&#xb7;s (for example greater than 1500 mPa&#xb7;s, for further example greater than 3000 mPa.$) measured at a shear rate of 75 s<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>at 20&#xb0; C. In an embodiment, the paste has a viscosity between 1000 mPa&#xb7;s and 50000 mPa&#xb7;s (for example between 3000 and 45000 mPa.$) at a shear rate of 75 s<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>at 20&#xb0; C. For example as measured using an Anton Paar Rheometer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The polysaccharides having a molecular weight below 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>Da may be fructan or glucan.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Polysaccharides are polymeric carbohydrate molecules composed of long chains of monosaccharide units bound together by glycosidic linkages. In the context of the current invention, oligosaccharides contain between three and ten monosaccharide units and polysaccharides contain more than ten monosaccharide units. Polysaccharides having a molecular weight between 10<sup>4 </sup>Da and 2.5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>Da contain large numbers of linked monosaccharide units.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The molecular weight of a polysaccharide may for example be determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), for example using a carbohydrate specific orcinol-sulfuric acid carbohydrate detector. For example, separation may be performed using a set of Superose&#x2122; 6 Increase 10/300 GL and Superdex&#x2122; 30 Increase 10/300 GL columns connected in series. A 0.1N KOH solution prepared by filtering through 0.45u filter may be used as the eluent for the chromatography, for example with an eluent flow through the columns kept constant at 0.5 ml/min. The eluted carbohydrates may be detected by continuously injecting them into a segmented orcinol-sulfuric acid stream initially heated to 115&#xb0; C. and cooled to 15&#xb0; C. in the SEC setup prior to de-bubbling and absorption measurement at 420 nm.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Molecular weight standards (for example pullulan molecular weight standards and sugars) may be injected into the SEC system for calibration. The weight average molecular weight may be calculated from the carbohydrate profile of the sample.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an embodiment, the invention provides a paste for preparing a beverage, the paste having a continuous aqueous phase, the paste comprising 0.1 to 50 wt. % sweetener; 10 to 50 wt. % fat (for example 20 to 40 wt. % fat); 0 to 50 wt. % polysaccharides having a weight average molecular weight below 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>Da (for example 20 to 40 wt. % polysaccharides having a weight average molecular weight below 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>Da, for further example 25 to 35 wt. % polysaccharides having a weight average molecular weight below 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>Da); and 0.5 to 5 wt. % (for example 0.8 to 2 wt. %) high molecular weight polysaccharides having a weight average molecular weight between 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>Da and 2.5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>Da; wherein the paste is free from added monoacylglycerols, diacylglycerols and diacetylated tartaric acid esters of monoglycerides.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The polysaccharides having a weight average molecular weight below 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>Da may be fructan or glucan.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an embodiment, the paste has a dispersed fat phase. The dispersed fat phase may be emulsified in the continuous aqueous phase by the high molecular weight polysaccharides. The high molecular weight polysaccharides may for example be present at the oil-fat interface. The nature of the continuous phase may be determined by any method known in the art, for example it may be determined by microscopy, for example by microscopy of a sample where the fat and/or water phase have been selectively stained.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the context of the present invention, the term fat refers to triglycerides. Fats are the chief component of animal adipose tissue and many plant seeds. Fats which are generally encountered in their liquid form at ambient temperature are commonly referred to as oils. In the present invention the terms oils and fats are interchangeable.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embodiment the sweetener is selected from the group consisting of sucrose, dextrose, fructose, lactose, maltose, hydrolysed corn syrup, allulose, tagatose, erythritol, steviol glycosides, mogrosides and combinations of these. For example the sweetener may be selected from the group consisting of sucrose, allulose, tagatose, erythritol, steviol glycosides, mogrosides and combinations of these. The paste may be suitable for people following a ketogenic diet, for example the sweetener may consist of sweeteners that do not contribute significant amounts of glucose to the blood, for example allulose, tagatose, xylitol, maltitol, sorbitol, erythritol, steviol glycosides or mogrosides.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment the polysaccharides having a molecular weight below 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>Da are fructan. Fructans are polymers of fructose molecules. Fructans with a short chain length (less than 10 monomer units) are known as fructooligosaccharides. Fructans do not contribute significant amounts of glucose to the blood and so are suitable for people following a ketogenic diet. The fructan according to the present invention may have a chain length of 10 or above. The fructan according to the present invention may have a weight average molecular weight below 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>Da. In an embodiment of the invention the fructan is inulin. The molecular weight of inulin varies according to source and processing but is usually below 5500 Da.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an embodiment, the invention provides a paste for preparing a beverage, the paste having a continuous aqueous phase, the paste comprising 0.1 to 50 wt. % sweetener; 10 to 50 wt. % fat (for example 20 to 40 wt. % fat); 0 to 50 wt. % fructan (for example 20 to 40 wt. % fructan, for further example 25 to 35 wt. % fructan); and 0.5 to 5 wt. % (for example 0.8 to 2 wt. %) high molecular weight polysaccharides having a weight average molecular weight between 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>Da and 2.5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>Da; wherein the paste is free from added monoacylglycerols, diacylglycerols and diacetylated tartaric acid esters of monoglycerides.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Advantageously, the paste of the invention has good dispersability and emulsion stability without requiring emulsifiers that may be badly perceived by consumers. In an embodiment, the paste contains less than 0.1 wt. % of monoacylglycerols (MAG), diacylglycerols (DAG) and diacetylated tartaric acid esters of monoglycerides (DATEM). For example, the paste may contain less than 0.01 wt. % of MAG, DAG and DATEM. The paste of the invention may be free from added MAG, DAG and DATEM. By the term &#x201c;free from added&#x201d; is meant that the paste does not contain any MAG, DAG or DATEM which have been added as such. A paste free from added MAG, DAG and DATEM may contain minor amounts of these emulsifiers which are present as minor impurities of one or more of the ingredients of the paste. For example, vegetable oils may naturally contain small amounts of monoacylglycerols and diacylglycerols. The paste of the invention may be free from MAG, DAG and DATEM. Monoacylglycerols are also known as monoglycerides and diacylglycerols are also known as diglycerides.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an embodiment, the paste of the invention contains less than 0.01 wt. % (for example less than 0.001 wt. %) of low molecular weight emulsifiers added as such. In the context of the present invention the term low molecular weight emulsifiers refers to emulsifiers with a molecular weight below 1500 Dalton. The paste of the invention may be free from low molecular weight emulsifiers added as such.

In the context of the present invention the term &#x201c;nut&#x201d; is used in the culinary sense. The nut according to the invention may be a true nut for example hazelnut or chestnut. The nut may be a drupe such as almond, cashew, coconut, pecan, pistachio, walnut, apricot kernel. The nut may be a nut-like seed, for example brazil nut, macadamia nut, peanut or pine nut. Preferably the nut component comprises the majority (for example at least 80, 90, 95, 98 wt. %), of the dry components of the nut once components that are not normally eaten have been removed, for example husk, skin or shell. The nut component may be for example a nut paste, nut butter, nut slurry or nut cream. The nut component may comprise at least 15 wt. % fat, for example at least 20 wt. % fat. The nut component may be obtained from nuts as raw material by any processing, for example, through physical processing, e.g. removing husk, skin or shell and other parts that are not normally eaten, mincing, grinding milling, pulverization, and/or separation, and/or sometimes by heat treatment (for example roasting). The nut may be selected from the group consisting of hazelnut, chestnut, almond, cashew, coconut, pecan, pistachio, walnut, apricot kernel, brazil nut, macadamia nut, peanut, pine nut and combinations of these. The nut may be almond and/or coconut. The nut component may be selected from the group consisting of coconut cream, almond butter and combinations of these.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Coconut cream is a thick milky fluid obtained by manually or mechanically extracting fresh coconut kernel. It contains at least 20 wt. % fat.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Nut butters are formed by grinding culinary nuts into a paste. The nut butters according to the invention may be selected from the group consisting of almond butter, cashew butter, hazelnut butter, macadamia nut butter, peanut butter, pecan butter, pistachio butter and walnut butter.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The inventors were surprised to find that a nut component comprising the majority of the dry components of the nut was particularly effective at stabilizing a beverage prepared from a high fat paste and preventing an oily layer appearing on the surface.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, almond butter was more effective at stabilizing a beverage prepared from a high fat paste than almond oil; almond oil with skim milk powder (providing protein); or almond oil with skim milk powder and soy lecithin (providing protein and phospholipids).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an embodiment the high molecular weight polysaccharides are comprised in at least one gum selected from the group consisting of gum acacia, pectin, guar, gellan, xanthan, carob, carrageenan, cellulose gum and combinations of these. For example the high molecular weight polysaccharides may be comprised in at least one gum selected from the group consisting of gum acacia, pectin, guar and combinations of these. For example, the paste may comprise gum acacia.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an embodiment the high molecular weight polysaccharides are comprised in a vegetable material selected from the group consisting of coffee, tea and combinations of these. The coffee or tea may be fermented and/or roasted. Tea in the present context refers to leaves and leaf buds of <i>Camellia sinensis</i>. The tea may be matcha tea. The high molecular weight polysaccharides may be comprised in aqueous extracts of coffee or tea. The high molecular weight polysaccharides according to the invention may be obtained from coffee, for example the high molecular weight polysaccharides may be obtained from high yield coffee extracts such as extracts with a yield on a roasted coffee weight basis of more than 35%, for example more than 40%, 45%, 50% and 55%. When roasted coffee is extracted at temperatures above 100&#xb0; C., for example temperatures between 130&#xb0; C. and 180&#xb0; C., partial hydrolysis of the coffee occurs releasing soluble polysaccharides. In an embodiment, the high molecular weight polysaccharides are polysaccharides of galactose, mannose and arabinose. In a further embodiment, the paste comprises at least 3 wt. % on a dry basis of high molecular weight polysaccharides having a molecular weight between 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>Da and 2.5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>Da being polysaccharides of galactose, mannose and arabinose from roasted coffee extract. At least 80 wt. % of the high molecular weight polysaccharides according to the paste of the invention may be polysaccharides of galactose, mannose and arabinose. The high molecular weight polysaccharides being polysaccharides of galactose, mannose and arabinose may be quantified by separation of the desired molecular weight by membrane filtration followed by complete hydrolysis and quantification of galactose, mannose and arabinose by HPLC. The inventors were surprised to find that high molecular weight polysaccharides obtained from high yield coffee extracts were particularly effective at stabilizing an oil in water emulsion.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Low yield coffee extracts may also be used in the paste of the invention as may coffee extracts such as cold brew coffee, but other sources of high molecular weight polysaccharides may need to be added to reach a level of between 0.5 to 5 wt. % on a dry basis of high molecular weight polysaccharides having a molecular weight between 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>Da and 2.5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>Da in the paste. The paste of the invention may not contain coffee, for example the paste may be suitable for adding to a coffee beverage but not contain coffee itself.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is beneficial for the dispersion of the paste that it comprises soluble bulk sweeteners.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an embodiment the paste comprises 20 to 40 wt. % sweetener wherein the sweetener is selected from the group consisting of allulose, tagatose, erythritol, xylitol and combinations of these. The sweetener may be allulose.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Fructan helps create suitable viscosity for the paste. In an embodiment the fructan is present at a level between 10 and 50 wt. % of the paste. In an embodiment the fructan may be insoluble in water at 20&#xb0; C. An insoluble fructan (for example a fructan that forms a gel) maintains a thick texture in the paste.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an embodiment the paste has a solid fat content at 20&#xb0; C. of between 0 and 50, for example between 0 and 30, for example between 0 and 20%, for further example between 0 and 10%. This level of solid fat content provides a paste which is easy to handle, for example is easy to spoon out of a jar, and disperses well into water. It is surprising that the composition of the invention provides an oil in water emulsion that is stable against oiling-out (oil rising to the surface on storage) despite the low solid fat content. Components with high solid fat content are commonly added to materials such as peanut butter to prevent oiling-out. A solid fat content solid fat content at 20&#xb0; C. of between 0 and 50% may for example be achieved by mixing fats which, although having a higher solid fat content individually, form a eutectic mixture when mixed. The solid fat content may be measured by pulsed NMR, for example according to the IUPAC Method 2.150 b (special thermal pretreatment) [IUPAC, Standard Methods for the Analysis of Oils, Fats and Derivatives, 7th Revised and Enlarged Edition (1987)]. The fat may be extracted from the paste before solid fat content measurement, for example it may be extracted using Soxhlet extraction.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an embodiment, the paste has a water to fat ratio by weight from 0.35 to 2.0, for example from 0.4 to 1.6, for further example from 0.6 to 0.95. It is beneficial that the paste according to the invention can provide a stable oil in water emulsion in a system having an excess of fat compared to water. The paste may have a moisture content between 10 and 25 wt. %. The paste may have a water activity of less than 0.85 at 20&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In an embodiment the paste comprises a fat-containing ingredient selected from the group consisting of dairy butter, cream, clarified butter fat or ghee, lard, tallow, medium chain triglyceride oil, high oleic oils, interesterified oils, hydrogenated fats, omega-3 oil, vegetable oils such as olive oil, palm oil, canola oil, peanut oil, corn oil, coconut oil, soybean oil, cocoa butter, chocolate and combinations of these. For example the paste may contain a fat-containing ingredient selected from the group consisting of dairy butter, medium chain triglyceride oil, high oleic oils, omega-3 oil, chocolate and combinations of these.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The paste may comprise medium chain triglycerides (MCT) oil, for example the paste may comprise between 5 and 20 wt. % medium chain triglycerides (for example between 8 and 20 wt. % medium chain triglycerides). These are triglycerides where two or three of the fatty acid moieties have six to twelve carbon atoms. MCT oils are favoured by persons following a ketogenic diet. The paste may for example comprise MCT oil and allulose.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The paste may comprise dairy butter, for example dairy butter and MCT oil. Coffee with medium chain triglyceride oil and butter is considered by many people to be an energizing drink promoting high performance. It is advantageous that the paste of the invention allows such a beverage to be prepared easily and without significant oil floating on top. Dairy butter is most frequently made from cow's milk but can also be manufactured from the milk of other mammals, such as sheep and goats.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In an embodiment the paste comprises buttermilk, for example sweet buttermilk powder.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an embodiment the paste comprises<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0054">25 to 35 wt. % allulose;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0055">20 to 30 wt. % dairy butter;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0056">10 to 14 wt. % MCT oil;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0057">8 to 15 wt. % inulin;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0058">4 to 8 wt. % buttermilk powder;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0059">0.8 to 2 wt. % gum acacia;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0060">made up to 100 wt. % with water.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0055" num="0061">The paste may be suitable for people following a vegan ketogenic diet.

The mixture was cooled to 60&#xb0; C. while stirring, filled into containers, sealed and allowed to cool.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0116">The viscosity of each paste was measured at a shear rate of 75 s<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>at 20&#xb0; C. using an Anton Paar Rheometer.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>2a</entry><entry>2b</entry><entry>2c</entry><entry>2d</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Viscosity/mPa &#xb7; s</entry><entry>38901</entry><entry>8522</entry><entry>19585</entry><entry>22072</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0084" num="0117">The pastes were examined by microscopy and added to a coffee beverage as in Example 1.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0118">A microscope image of the almond butter paste (2a) is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.
