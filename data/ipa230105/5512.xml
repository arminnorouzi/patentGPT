In contrast to dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) cells, an SRAM cell can use a latch to store data; therefore, no refresh process is needed, and power consumption is rather low when the device is idle. However, while the DRAM cell can be implemented by one single transistor, the SRAM cell may include more transistors and thus require more area.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, to increase access speed of the SRAM, two-port SRAM cells have been developed to provide a two-read, two-write, or one-read-one-write operation within one system clock cycle. However, the two-port SRAM cell requires even more transistors than the one-port SRAM cells. Consequently, the two-port SRAM cell occupies an increasingly large area in the system as memory requirements increase. Therefore, developing a way to improve the access speed without excessively increasing the area occupied by the SRAM cell has become an important issue that needs to be solved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One embodiment of the present disclosure provides an interface transformer.

The pseudo multiport storage device <b>10</b> includes an interface transformer <b>100</b> and a storage circuit <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, the storage circuit <b>12</b> can be a register file or a static random-access memory (SRAM), and can include a plurality of one-port SRAM cells.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the present embodiment, when the pseudo multiport storage device <b>10</b> receives an input clock signal CLK<b>0</b>, the interface transformer <b>100</b> can transform the input clock signal CLK<b>0</b> into a transformed clock signal CKI that has a higher frequency so that the storage circuit <b>12</b> can perform read operations and write operations according to the transformed clock signal CKI with a higher speed.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a timing diagram of the clock signals processed by the interface transformer <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the transformed clock signal CKI can have two pulses P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> within a cycle duration T<b>1</b> of the input clock signal CLK<b>0</b>. In such case, although the storage circuit <b>12</b> is a one-port storage circuit <b>12</b> that performs one read operation or one write operation at a time, the storage circuit <b>12</b> can perform two operations, such as one read operation and one write operation, according to the two pulses P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> of the transformed clock signal CKI, during one single cycle of the input clock signal CLK<b>0</b>. That is, the interface transformer <b>100</b> can generate the transformed clock signal CKI with a higher frequency according to the input clock signal CLK<b>0</b> so that the storage circuit <b>12</b> can perform two operations consecutively within one cycle of the input clock signal CLK<b>0</b>. As a result, the pseudo multiport storage device <b>10</b> can have a function similar to that of a two-port storage device, and can be used as a pseudo two-port storage device.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the present embodiment, the pseudo multiport storage device <b>10</b> can perform a read operation according to the first pulse P<b>1</b> and a write operation according to the second pulse P<b>2</b> when operating in the read-write mode.

For example, in a read mode, the storage device <b>10</b> may perform a read operation according to the first pulse P<b>1</b> and be idle during the second pulse P<b>2</b>.

The first clock generator <b>110</b> can generate an intermediate clock signal CLK<b>1</b> according to at least the input clock signal CLK<b>0</b>. In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a rising edge RE<b>0</b> of the input clock signal CLK<b>0</b> precedes a rising edge RET of the intermediate clock signal CLK<b>1</b>. On the other hand, a falling edge FET of the intermediate clock signal CLK<b>1</b> precedes a falling edge FE<b>0</b> of the input clock signal CLK<b>0</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The combinational circuit <b>120</b> can receive the intermediate clock signal CLK<b>1</b> and generate a mask clock signal CLK<b>2</b> according to the intermediate clock signal CLK<b>1</b>. For example, the combinational circuit <b>120</b> may include one or more delay units to generate the mask clock signal CLK<b>2</b> from the intermediate clock signal CLK<b>1</b>. In some embodiments, the combinational circuit <b>120</b> may further include a chopping unit for adjusting the pulse width of the mask clock signal CLK<b>2</b> according <b>30</b> to system requirements.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The second clock generator <b>130</b> can generate a transformed clock signal CKI according to at least the input clock signal CLK<b>0</b> and the mask clock signal CLK<b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the transformed clock signal CKI has a first pulse P<b>1</b> and a second pulse P<b>2</b> within the cycle duration T<b>1</b> of the input clock signal CLK<b>0</b>. In the present embodiment, the first pulse P<b>1</b> can be produced according to the rising edge RE<b>0</b> of the input clock signal CLK<b>0</b> during a first time interval TL<b>1</b> in which the input clock signal CLK<b>0</b> is at a high voltage. In addition, the second pulse P<b>2</b> is produced according to the rising edge RE<b>2</b> of the mask clock signal CLK<b>2</b>. Furthermore, a duration of the first pulse P<b>1</b> and a duration of the second pulse P<b>2</b> are both less than a duration of the first time interval TL<b>1</b>. Consequently, the interface transformer <b>100</b> can generate the transformed clock signal CKI having double pulses in each cycle of the input clock signal CLK<b>0</b>, and the storage circuit <b>12</b> can perform a read operation and a write operation according to the two pulses of the transformed clock signal CKI within each cycle of the input clock signal CLK<b>0</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the first clock generator <b>110</b> according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. The first clock generator <b>110</b> includes a first latch circuit <b>112</b>. The first latch circuit <b>112</b> includes a clock positive terminal CP for receiving the input clock signal CLK<b>0</b>, a reset terminal RST for receiving a first reset signal SIG<sub>RST1</sub>, and an output terminal Q for outputting the intermediate clock signal CLK<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a timing diagram of the signals received and transmitted by the first clock generator <b>110</b>.

Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the rising edge RE<b>1</b> of the intermediate clock signal CLK<b>1</b> is produced after the rising edge RE<b>0</b> of the input clock signal CLK<b>0</b>. In addition, after the rising edge RE<b>1</b> is produced, the first latch circuit <b>112</b> can be reset and generate the falling edge FE<b>1</b> of the intermediate clock signal CLK<b>1</b> when the first reset signal SIG<sub>RST1 </sub>changes from a high voltage to a low voltage.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the first clock generator <b>110</b> can further include a first delay and inverse circuit <b>114</b>. The first delay and inverse circuit <b>114</b> can generate the first reset signal SIG<sub>RST1 </sub>by delaying and inverting the intermediate clock signal CLK<b>1</b>. For example, the first delay and inverse circuit <b>114</b> may include (N+1) inverters. N is a positive even integer and can be determined according to the desired length of delay. In such case, the first reset signal SIG<sub>RST1 </sub>changes from the high voltage to the low voltage after the rising edge RET of the intermediate clock signal CLK<b>1</b> has been produced for a period thanks to the first delay and inverse circuit <b>114</b>. When the first reset signal SIG<sub>RST1 </sub>changes to the low voltage, the first latch circuit <b>112</b> is reset to have its output become logic &#x201c;0&#x201d; and thus generates the falling edge FET of the intermediate clock signal CLK<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the present embodiment, the first clock generator <b>110</b> can generate the intermediate clock CLK<b>1</b> according to the input clock signal CLK<b>0</b> and the first reset signal SIG<sub>RST1 </sub>by utilizing a self-propagation scheme.
