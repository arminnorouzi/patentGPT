A printer <b>100</b> serving as the image forming apparatus according to the present embodiment includes a sheet feeding device <b>60</b>, a registration roller pair <b>4</b>, photoconductor drums <b>20</b>Y, <b>20</b>C, <b>20</b>M, and <b>20</b>K serving as image bearers, a primary transfer device <b>12</b>, a secondary transfer device including a secondary transfer roller <b>5</b>, and a fixing device <b>80</b>. The printer <b>100</b> is a four-color tandem type of image forming apparatus that forms toner images of respective colors of yellow (Y), cyan (C), magenta (M), and black (K) on the photoconductor drums <b>20</b>Y, <b>20</b>C, <b>20</b>M, and <b>20</b>K.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The sheet feeding device <b>60</b> includes a sheet feeding tray and a sheet feed roller <b>3</b>. The sheet feeding tray loads a stack of a plurality of sheets S serving as recording media. The sheet feed roller <b>3</b> separates and feeds the sheets S loaded in the sheet feeding tray one by one starting from the uppermost sheet. The sheet S fed by the sheet feed roller <b>3</b> is temporarily stopped by the registration roller pair <b>4</b> and corrected for positional deviation. Then, the registration roller pair <b>4</b> sends the sheet S to a secondary transfer nip formed by an intermediate transfer belt <b>10</b> and the secondary transfer roller <b>5</b>, at a timing in synchrony with rotation of the photoconductor drums <b>20</b> and the intermediate transfer belt <b>10</b>, that is, at a timing at which a leading edge of a toner image formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>10</b> from the photoconductor drums <b>20</b> meets a certain position of a leading edge of the sheet S in a sheet conveyance direction. One of supporting rollers <b>11</b> is disposed facing the secondary transfer roller <b>5</b> via the inner surface of the intermediate transfer belt <b>10</b> while the secondary transfer roller <b>5</b> contacts the outer surface of the intermediate transfer belt <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The printer <b>100</b> serving as the image forming apparatus according to the present embodiment includes a charging roller <b>30</b> as a charging device, an exposure device <b>8</b>, a developing device <b>40</b> including a developing roller, the primary transfer device <b>12</b>, and a cleaning device <b>50</b> including a cleaning blade in this order around the photoconductor drum <b>20</b> of each color in the direction of rotation of the photoconductor drum <b>20</b> indicated by each arrow. The exposure device <b>8</b> irradiates and scans an exposure area between the charging roller <b>30</b> and the developing device <b>40</b> on the photoconductor drum <b>20</b> with a laser beam Lb via mirrors.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Toner bottles <b>9</b>Y, <b>9</b>C, <b>9</b>M, and <b>9</b>K containing respective color toners are detachably attached to the printer <b>100</b> above the intermediate transfer belt <b>10</b>. Each of the color toners respectively contained in the toner bottles <b>9</b>Y, <b>9</b>C, <b>9</b>M, and <b>9</b>K is supplied to the developing device <b>40</b> (i.e., the developing device <b>40</b>Y, <b>40</b>C, <b>40</b>M, or <b>40</b>K) of the corresponding color.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">After the photoconductor drum <b>20</b> (i.e., the photoconductor drum <b>20</b>Y, <b>20</b>C, <b>20</b>M, or <b>20</b>K) starts to rotate, the charging roller <b>30</b> (i.e., the charging roller <b>30</b>Y, <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, or <b>30</b>K) uniformly charges the surface of the photoconductor drum <b>20</b>. Then, the exposure device <b>8</b> irradiates and scans the exposure area with the laser beam Lb based on image data to form an electrostatic latent image corresponding to an image to be created. The rotation of the photoconductor drum <b>20</b> moves the electrostatic latent image to a position facing the developing device <b>40</b>. At the position, the developing device <b>40</b> supplies toner to the electrostatic latent image to visualize the electrostatic latent image as a toner image. The primary transfer device <b>12</b> (i.e., the primary transfer device <b>12</b>Y, <b>12</b>C, <b>12</b>M, or <b>12</b>K) applies a transfer bias to the intermediate transfer belt <b>10</b> to transfer the toner image formed on the photoconductor drum <b>20</b> onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>10</b>. Then, the secondary transfer roller <b>5</b> applies a transfer bias to the sheet S entering the secondary transfer nip at a predetermined timing to transfer the toner image formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>10</b> onto the sheet S.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The sheet S bearing the toner image is conveyed toward the fixing device <b>80</b>, and the fixing device <b>80</b> fixes the toner image onto the sheet S. After the fixing of the toner image to the sheet S, an ejection roller pair <b>7</b> ejects the sheet S, and the sheet S is stacked on an output tray. As the photoconductor drum <b>20</b> rotates, the residual toner remaining on the surface of photoconductor drum <b>20</b> and the intermediate transfer belt <b>10</b> without being transferred from the photoconductor drum <b>20</b> and the intermediate transfer belt <b>10</b> to the sheet S reaches the cleaning device <b>50</b> (i.e., the cleaning device <b>50</b>Y, <b>50</b>C, <b>50</b>M, or <b>50</b>K) or a cleaning device <b>70</b>. Then the cleaning blade scrapes the residual toner to clean the surface of the photoconductor drum <b>20</b> while the residual toner passes through the cleaning device <b>50</b> or the cleaning device <b>70</b>. After the cleaning device <b>50</b> and the cleaning device <b>70</b> clean the photoconductor drum <b>20</b>, a discharger discharges a residual potential on the photoconductor drum <b>20</b>, and the photoconductor drum <b>20</b> is prepared for the next image forming operations.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a schematic configuration of the fixing device <b>80</b>. The fixing device <b>80</b> includes a fixing sleeve <b>81</b> and a pressure roller <b>82</b>. The fixing sleeve <b>81</b> is directly heated by radiation heat of heat sources <b>83</b> from the inner peripheral side of the fixing sleeve <b>81</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates halogen heaters as an example of the heat sources <b>83</b>. A nip formation pad <b>84</b> is disposed inside the fixing sleeve <b>81</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and faces the pressure roller <b>82</b> via the fixing sleeve <b>81</b> to form a nip region (also referred to as a fixing nip region) between the pressure roller <b>82</b> and the fixing sleeve <b>81</b>. The nip formation pad <b>84</b> slides directly or indirectly via a slide sheet over the inner surface of the fixing sleeve <b>81</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the nip region has a flat shape. However, in some embodiments, the nip region may have a concave shape or any other suitable shape. The concave shape of the nip region is advantageous in that the ejecting direction of a leading edge of a recording sheet is close to the pressure roller to enhance the sheet separation and reduce occurrence of a jam.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The fixing sleeve <b>81</b> is a metal sleeve made of, for example, nickel or steel use stainless (SUS), or an endless sleeve (or film) using a resin material such as polyimide. The surface layer of the fixing sleeve <b>81</b> includes a release layer such as a perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA) or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) layer to facilitate separation of toner of a toner image on a recording medium so that toner does not adhere to the surface of the fixing sleeve <b>81</b>. An elastic layer may be sandwiched between the base material of the fixing sleeve <b>81</b> and the PFA or PTFE layer, and the elastic layer may be made of silicone rubber. Omitting the elastic layer made of silicone rubber reduces heat capacity and improve energy saving. However, the slight surface roughness of the fixing sleeve <b>81</b> may be transferred onto a recording medium while a toner image is fixed onto the recording medium, causing an orange-peel image, which is an image having uneven gloss in a solid part of the image. To address this circumstance, the elastic layer made of silicone rubber has a thickness not smaller than 100 &#x3bc;m. Deformation of the elastic layer made of silicone rubber absorbs the slight surface asperities in the fixing sleeve <b>81</b>, preventing formation of a faulty image having uneven gloss (e.g., an orange peel image).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The fixing device <b>80</b> includes a support member <b>85</b> (serving as a stay) inside the fixing sleeve <b>81</b> to support the nip region. The support member <b>85</b> prevents bending of the nip formation pad <b>84</b> that receives pressure by the pressure roller <b>82</b>, thus obtaining a uniform nip width in the axial direction of the support member <b>85</b>. By supporting the pressure from the pressure roller <b>82</b> at the support member <b>85</b>, the nip formation pad <b>84</b> obtains the surface pressure in the fixing nip region to fuse and fix toner on the toner image to the recording medium.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The support member <b>85</b> is formed by bending iron or stainless steel and has a large heat capacity with an iron plate or a SUS plate having a thickness of approximately 2 mm to 4 mm. The support member <b>85</b> is held and secured by a holder and positioned at both ends of the support member <b>85</b>. The fixing device <b>80</b> includes a reflector <b>86</b> between the heat source <b>83</b> and the support member <b>85</b>. The reflector <b>86</b> reflects the radiation heat from the heat sources <b>83</b> toward the inner circumferential surface of the fixing sleeve <b>81</b>. Accordingly, the support member <b>85</b> can be prevented from being unnecessarily heated by the heat sources <b>83</b>, thus reducing waste of energy. Here, the same effect can be obtained even if the surface of the support member <b>85</b> is heat-insulated or mirror-finished instead of including the reflector <b>86</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The pressure roller <b>82</b> includes an elastic rubber layer on a core metal. A release layer (PFA or PTFE layer) is disposed on the outer surface of the pressure roller <b>82</b> in order to obtain releasability. As described below, a driving force is transmitted to the pressure roller <b>82</b> through gears from a driving source, such as a motor, provided in the printer <b>100</b>, to rotate the pressure roller <b>82</b>. A spring presses the pressure roller <b>82</b> against the nip formation pad <b>84</b> via the fixing sleeve <b>81</b>. As the spring presses and deforms the elastic rubber layer of the pressure roller <b>82</b>, the pressure roller <b>82</b> produces the fixing nip region having the predetermined length in the sheet conveyance direction. The pressure roller <b>82</b> may be a hollow roller. Alternatively, the pressure roller <b>82</b> may include a heating source such as a halogen heater. The elastic rubber layer may be made of solid rubber. Alternatively, if no heater is situated inside the pressure roller <b>82</b>, the elastic rubber layer may be made of sponge rubber. The sponge rubber is preferable because the sponge rubber has an increased insulation that draws less heat from the fixing sleeve <b>81</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The fixing sleeve <b>81</b> rotates in accordance with rotation of the pressure roller <b>82</b>. Specifically, as a driving source drives and rotates the pressure roller <b>82</b>, a driving force of the driving source is transmitted from the pressure roller <b>82</b> to the fixing sleeve <b>81</b> by a frictional force of the nip region, thus rotating the fixing sleeve <b>81</b>. The fixing sleeve <b>81</b> is sandwiched and rotated at the nip region, and travels while being guided by holders (flanges) at both ends in other portions than the nip region. With the construction described above, the fixing device <b>80</b> attaining quick warm-up is manufactured at reduced costs.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Curl of Sheet S</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The sheet S that has been left in a high temperature and high humidity environment for a long time absorbs moisture to increase the water content. In particular, recycled paper has a high hygroscopic property and tends to have a high water content. When such a sheet like the sheet S passes through the fixing device <b>80</b> when the temperature difference between the fixing sleeve <b>81</b> and the pressure roller <b>82</b> is high, a temperature difference occurs between the front and back surfaces of the sheet, moisture moves from the high temperature side (fixing sleeve side) to the low temperature side (pressure roller side), the sheet shrinks due to moisture evaporation from the pressure roller side, and then the sheet curls to the opposite side of the printing surface (back curl).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In order to correct the back curl of the sheet S, prior to generation of a back-edge curl, the bending force in the opposite direction is applied to the sheet S. A decurling device <b>90</b> is disposed downstream from the fixing device <b>80</b> in the sheet conveyance direction and is rotated by the driving force transmitted from the same driving source as the pressure roller <b>82</b>. A cooling pressure roller <b>91</b> is driven to rotate by the frictional force from a cooling pressure roller <b>92</b>. The sheet passes through a nip region sandwiched between the cooling pressure roller <b>91</b> and the cooling pressure roller <b>92</b> and is bent by a guide plate <b>93</b> to correct the curl. In the present embodiment, the decurling device <b>90</b> employs cooling pressure rollers.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In other words, the decurling device <b>90</b> includes the cooling pressure roller <b>91</b> and the cooling pressure roller <b>92</b>. Typically, rollers such as a conveyance roller or a decurler as a curl correcting device may be used after fixing the toner image. However, in the present embodiment, the decurling device <b>90</b> employs the cooling pressure rollers instead of these rollers. The cooling pressure rollers are rollers having an elastic layer uniformly in the axial direction. The waving of the sheet is reduced by pulling the sheet at a slightly increased linear velocity of the cooling pressure roller <b>92</b> compared with the pressure roller <b>82</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">One of the pair of rollers may be a hard roller in the curl correcting device. In the present embodiment, both rollers of the curl correcting device <b>90</b> are elastic rollers each including an elastic layer. The distance between the axes of the cooling pressure rollers is fixed. The surface pressure of the cooling pressure rollers is relatively small when plain paper is printed in an image forming mode. The surface pressure of the cooling pressure rollers is relatively large and the nip width is widened when a recording medium sandwiched and thickened by lamination films on the front and back sides passes the cooling pressure rollers in a lamination mode. The image forming mode and the lamination mode are described below. When a thick film passes through the cooling pressure rollers, a relatively large pressure is applied to the thick film so that the laminated film is sufficiently pressed. In addition, since the elastic layer of the cooling pressure roller is compressed in the radial direction and stretched in the circumferential direction at the nip region as compared with the case of printing on plain paper, the linear velocity at the nip region is increased as compared with the case of printing on plain paper.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Laminating Process</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The sheet feeding device <b>60</b> includes a sheet feed tray as a sheet container for a recording medium. When printing on a sheet, a large number of cut sheets of recording media are loaded in the sheet feed tray of the sheet feeding device <b>60</b>. On the other hand, when the laminating process is executed, printed sheets each sandwiched between pouch-type lamination films by a user are loaded in the sheet feed tray of the sheet feeding device <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The pouch-type lamination film is a sheet in which one side of four sides of two films is bonded or one film is folded into two to sandwich a printed material. The sheet is loaded in the sheet feed tray so that the bonded side of the sheet or the folded side of the sheet faces downstream in the sheet feeding direction.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The image forming apparatus includes a bypass tray <b>61</b> separately from the sheet feed tray as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. On the other hand, when the laminating process is executed, the lamination film may be loaded in the bypass tray <b>61</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Drive Transmission Mechanism for Sheet Conveyance</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the present embodiment, the printer <b>100</b> has the image forming mode and the lamination mode. The conveying speed of a sheet in the fixing device in the lamination mode is slower than the conveying speed of the sheet in the image forming mode. In a case where the drive motor is driven at a rotational speed lower than a rated range as a method of low linear velocity conveyance in the lamination mode, a rotational speed variation may occur. Therefore, a speed reducer is usually used in order to drive the drive motor at a low linear velocity. On the other hand, when the speed reducer is used, a costly motor that rotates at high-speed rotation is used in order to drive at a rotation speed for normal printing. As a result, the cost is increased. In particular, since the linear velocity of a conveyance motor for conveying other than a motor for fixing and transferring toner is faster than the process linear velocity of the motor for fixing and transferring toner in order to reduce the printing time, a costly motor is used in a case where the speed reducer is used to reduce the linear velocity in the lamination mode. On the other hand, since the maximum speeds (the maximum speed in the image forming mode) of the fixing roller and the transfer roller are not so high, driving the fixing roller and the transfer roller is achieved from a low speed to a normal speed by using the speed reducer without using a costly motor.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a schematic configuration of a drive transmission mechanism related to sheet conveyance in the image forming apparatus according to the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The sheet feed roller <b>3</b> is driven by a drive motor <b>3</b><i>b </i>via a clutch <b>3</b><i>a </i>serving as a drive transmission connection changer. When the conveying force is applied to the sheet S, the clutch <b>3</b><i>a </i>is engaged, so that the drive motor <b>3</b><i>b </i>rotates to convey the sheet S. When the clutch <b>3</b><i>a </i>is disengaged (disconnected) from the drive motor <b>3</b><i>b</i>, the conveying force is not applied to the sheet S, and the sheet S is conveyed by the conveying force of another driving source. The registration roller pair <b>4</b> and the ejection roller pair <b>7</b> have substantially the same configuration as the configuration of the sheet feed roller <b>3</b>, the clutch <b>3</b><i>a</i>, and the drive motor <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The secondary transfer roller <b>5</b> is driven by a drive motor <b>5</b><i>b </i>via a speed reducer <b>5</b><i>a</i>. The fixing device <b>80</b> is driven by a drive motor <b>80</b><i>b </i>via a speed reducer <b>80</b><i>a</i>. A low linear velocity in the lamination mode is achieved by the speed reducer. The following motors are used as these drive motors. When a normal motor is rotated at a speed lower than a predetermined range, problems of unevenness of rotation or stop accuracy occur. In the present embodiment, a motor with a reduction ratio of 50 times is used to avoid problems of unevenness of rotation and stopping accuracy even at a linear velocity of 10 mm/sec in the lamination mode. The motor applies torque that is sufficient to rotate at 150 mm/sec in the normal printing. The linear velocity is changed by changing the rotation speed of the drive motor <b>80</b><i>b</i>. The clutches and the drive motors are controlled by a controller <b>300</b>. An operation panel <b>310</b> for operation such as a selecting the lamination mode is connected to the controller <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this embodiment, the lamination film is conveyed at a normal linear velocity until the lamination film reaches the secondary transfer roller <b>5</b> in the lamination mode. The driving forces of the conveyance rollers are disengaged by the clutches while the lamination film is sandwiched by the secondary transfer roller <b>5</b>, the pressure roller <b>82</b>, and the cooling pressure roller <b>92</b>, so that the lamination film is conveyed by driving force of each of the secondary transfer roller <b>5</b>, the pressure roller <b>82</b>, and the cooling pressure roller <b>92</b>. After passing through the cooling pressure roller <b>92</b>, the driving forces of the conveyance rollers are engaged again by the clutches, and the lamination film is conveyed at the normal linear velocity. In the case where the secondary transfer roller <b>5</b> is brought into contact with and separated from the sheet, the secondary transfer roller <b>5</b> may be separated from the sheet during the laminating process.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Specific examples are described below. The sheet feed roller <b>3</b> and the registration roller pair <b>4</b> rotate at a low printing linear velocity of 75 mm/sec to convey a lamination film, i.e., a recording medium sandwiched between lamination films on both sides. When the leading edge of the lamination film reaches the secondary transfer roller <b>5</b>, the clutch <b>3</b><i>a </i>and a clutch <b>4</b><i>a </i>are disengaged from the drive motor <b>3</b><i>b </i>and a drive motor <b>4</b><i>b</i>, respectively. As a result, the conveying force is not transmitted to the lamination film. The secondary transfer roller <b>5</b>, the fixing device <b>80</b>, and the cooling pressure rollers <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> rotate at a linear velocity of 30 mm/sec or 20 mm/sec to attach the lamination film while conveying the lamination film. When the trailing edge of the lamination film passes through the cooling pressure rollers <b>91</b> and <b>92</b>, a clutch <b>7</b><i>a </i>is engaged with a drive motor <b>7</b><i>b</i>, then the ejection roller pair <b>7</b> rotates at a low printing linear velocity 75 mm/sec to eject the lamination film.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Each of the sheet feed roller <b>3</b>, the registration roller pair <b>4</b>, and the ejection roller pair <b>7</b> rotates at a faster linear velocity than the linear velocities of the secondary transfer roller <b>5</b> and the fixing device <b>80</b>, serving as image forming units, in order to reduce the time from sheet feeding to sheet ejecting. When the laminating process is executed, the printing linear velocity is 50% or less of the low printing linear velocity. It is more preferable that the printing linear velocity is 30% or less of the low printing linear velocity. The difference is constantly 10 times or more between the conveyance linear velocity other than fixing and transfer during normal printing and the lamination linear velocity. The drive motor is rated to rotate at a linear velocity of about eight times as fast as a regular drive motor. The torque is insufficient when the linear velocity is higher than the linear velocity of the drive motor, and the rotation speed of the motor is not stable when the linear velocity is lower than the linear velocity of the drive motor.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Therefore, the linear velocity of the fixing device <b>80</b> having effects on the lamination quality may be reduced. Alternatively, since the linear velocity of the secondary transfer roller <b>5</b> is not increased, the linear velocity of the secondary transfer roller <b>5</b> is synchronized with the linear velocity of the fixing device <b>80</b> at a low linear velocity, then the linear velocity of the secondary transfer roller <b>5</b> may be reduced. As a result, the lamination quality is improved by reducing the linear velocities of the fixing device <b>80</b> and the secondary transfer roller <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Verification Test</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The lamination quality evaluation was performed using a modified multi-function product (MFP) MP C5504 (product name) manufactured by Ricoh Company, Ltd.

Since the cooling pressure rollers <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> were not provided, the waving quality was evaluated as poor.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0076">As described above, the image forming apparatus according to the present embodiment includes a fixing device that fixes a toner image formed on a recording medium. The fixing device includes a fixing rotator and a pressing rotator, and a cooling pressure roller. The pressing rotator is in contact with the fixing rotator and forms a nip region with the fixing rotator. The cooling pressure roller is disposed downstream from the pressing rotator in the conveyance direction of the recording medium. The cooling pressure roller conveys the lamination film at a linear velocity that is 50% or less than the lowest printing velocity of the several normal printing modes. The cooling pressure roller applies pressure to the overall axial surface. Therefore, by performing lamination at a relatively low speed that is different from normal printing, the glue of the lamination film may be heated and melted sufficiently. The adhesion of the lamination film may be enhanced by conveying the sheet at the linear velocity that is 50% or less than the normal printing velocity during the laminating process. Since a linear velocity of normal printing is typically high, when a laminating process is executed at the linear velocity, heat is not sufficiently transmitted to the lamination film, failing to fix the lamination film.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0077">Further, the cooling pressure roller may reduce waving after the sheet has passed through the fixing device. Since a cooling pressure roller is not typically provided after the fixing process, waving is likely to occur due to contraction after the heating process from the fixing device. When a cooling time is relatively short, the waving is also likely to occur. When the cooling time is short, the film is likely to be scratched or curled.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0078">On the other hand, when the cooling pressure roller is provided, the cooling pressure roller contracts in a pressed state, that is, in a constrained state. Due to this configuration, the waving is not likely to occurs. In other words, since the contraction of the lamination film after the heating in an unconstrained state is in a free state, the waving of the lamination film is likely to occur. The cooling time after the heating may be allocated sufficiently.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0079">As described above, the image forming apparatus according to the present embodiment achieves the following modes effectively.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0080">Mode 1</p><p id="p-0072" num="0081">An image forming apparatus includes a fixing device configured to fix an image on a sheet by application of heat and pressure, and a drive transmission mechanism. The drive transmission mechanism is configured to change between a sheet conveying speed in the fixing device in an image forming mode and a sheet conveying speed in the fixing device in a lamination mode. The sheet conveying speed in the fixing device in the lamination mode is slower than the sheet conveying speed in the fixing device in the image forming mode. In the image forming apparatus that switches a plurality of sheet conveying speeds according to a sheet type such as the thickness of a sheet in the image forming mode, the sheet conveying speed in the fixing device in the lamination mode is slower than the slowest sheet conveying speed in the image forming mode. By reducing the fixing speed in the lamination mode as described above, the lamination film may be pressed and heated more satisfactory when compared to the case in which the sheet conveying speed is used in the fixing device in the image forming mode. As a result, the adhesion of the lamination film is enhanced, and the laminating process is also enhanced. When the sheet conveying speed for fixing the lamination film is substantially the same as the sheet conveying speed in the image forming mode, the conveying speed is too fast and heat is not sufficiently transmitted to the lamination film.

That is, when the lamination film is conveyed in the image forming apparatus, the linear velocity of the fixing device (or the fixing device and the transfer device while the transfer device sandwiches a sheet) is slower than the linear velocity of conveying members other than the above-described devices such as conveyance rollers.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0088">Mode 5</p><p id="p-0080" num="0089">The image forming apparatus according to Mode 4, the speed of sheet conveying in the fixing device in the lamination mode is 50% of or less than the speed of sheet conveying in the fixing device in the image forming mode.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0090">According to Modes 4 and 5, the sheet conveying speed in the period until the leading edge of the sheet reaches the fixing device and at least a part of the period after the trailing edge of the sheet passes through the fixing device is faster than the sheet conveying speed of the fixing device in the lamination mode, and the processing speed may be increased accordingly.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0091">Mode 6</p><p id="p-0083" num="0092">The image forming apparatus according to any one of Modes 1 to 5, the drive transmission mechanism includes an upstream sheet conveying member upstream from the fixing device in the conveyance direction of the sheet, a downstream sheet conveying member downstream from the fixing device in the conveyance direction of the sheet, a drive source configured to drive each of the upstream sheet conveying member and the downstream sheet conveying member, and a drive transmission connection changer. The drive transmission connection changer is configured to change connection of at least one of the upstream sheet conveying member and the downstream sheet conveying member with the drive source when a drive force is transmitted from the drive source to each of the upstream sheet conveying member and the downstream sheet conveying member.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0093">Mode 7</p><p id="p-0085" num="0094">The image forming apparatus according to Mode 6, the drive transmission connection changer is configured to block transmission of the drive force of each of the upstream sheet conveying member and the downstream sheet conveying member facing the fixing device during a period in which the sheet being conveyed by the fixing device faces the at least one of the upstream sheet conveying member and the downstream sheet conveying member.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0095">According to Modes 6 and 7, the sheet conveying member is disposed at a position facing the sheet conveyed in the fixing device. While the sheet conveyed in the fixing device faces the sheet conveying member, the drive transmission connection changer blocks drive transmission, and the sheet may be conveyed by the fixing device. For example, while the lamination film is sandwiched by the transfer roller, the fixing roller, and the cooling pressure roller, the lamination film is conveyed by the driving forces of the transfer roller, the fixing roller, and the cooling pressure roller. By so doing, the lamination film may be conveyed without any problem. As a result, a less costly motor may be used as the motor of the sheet conveying member provided with the drive transmission connection changer.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0096">Mode 8</p><p id="p-0088" num="0097">The image forming apparatus according to any one of Modes 1 to 8, further includes cooling pressure rollers disposed downstream from the fixing device in the sheet conveyance direction.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0098">Mode 9</p><p id="p-0090" num="0099">The image forming apparatus according to Mode 8, the cooling pressure rollers are a pair of rollers provided with an elastic layer, and a distance between axes of the cooling pressure rollers in the image forming mode is equal to a distance between axes of the cooling pressure rollers in the lamination mode.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0100">Mode 10</p><p id="p-0092" num="0101">The image forming apparatus according to Mode 8 or 9, the cooling pressure rollers are a pair of rollers, at least one of the cooling pressure rollers includes an elastic layer, a nip width of each of the cooling pressure rollers is less than or equal to 1 mm when a plain paper is nipped between the cooling pressure rollers, and the nip width of each of the cooling pressure rollers is in a range of more than or equal to 1 mm and less than or equal to 3 mm when the sheet is nipped by a lamination film.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0102">Mode 11</p><p id="p-0094" num="0103">The image forming apparatus according to any one of Modes 8 to 10, a surface layer of the cooling pressure rollers is a release layer.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0104">According to Modes 8 to 11, the occurrence of waving, scratches on the lamination film, and curling of the lamination film may be reduced. This effect is achieved due to the following reasons. The distance between the axes of the cooling pressure rollers is constant regardless of the printing mode and the type of recording medium, and the pressure to the recording medium changes in accordance with the thickness of the recording medium. When printing is performed on a plain paper at a normal linear velocity, the surface pressure of the plain paper is relatively low, and the torque of the drive motor does not increase. On the other hand, since a large surface pressure is applied during the laminating process, waving of the lamination film may be reduced. In addition, the linear velocity of each cooling pressure rollers is pulled at a speed slightly faster than the speed of the fixing roller to further reduce waving of the lamination film. When a thick film passes between the cooling pressure rollers, the elastic layer is deformed to increase the linear velocity. In particular, according to Mode 11, toner adhesion on the image surface may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0105">Mode 12</p><p id="p-0097" num="0106">The image forming apparatus according to any one of Modes 1 to 11, further includes at least two sheet ejection openings through which the sheet from the fixing device is ejected. Of the at least two sheet ejection openings, the sheet is ejected through a sheet ejection opening having a longer conveyance path from the fixing device in the lamination mode. Due to such a configuration, curling of the lamination film may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0107">The above-described embodiments are illustrative and do not limit the present invention.
