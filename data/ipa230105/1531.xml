The diameter of the first gear <b>92</b> is less than the diameter of the second gear <b>96</b>. For example, the gear ratio may be from about 3:1 to about 6:1, or other suitable ratios.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the gearbox transmission <b>54</b> includes a gearbox housing <b>110</b> defining a gear compartment into which the output shaft <b>100</b> of the belt assembly <b>72</b> extends. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the belt-drive housing <b>70</b>, and in particular the housing body <b>74</b>, is rotatably coupled to the gearbox housing <b>110</b> such that the belt-drive transmission&#x2014;along with the motor <b>50</b>, the attachment <b>19</b>, and the handle <b>14</b>&#x2014;is rotatable generally about an axis A<b>2</b> that is coaxial with the output axis OA<b>2</b> of the output shaft <b>100</b>, although the axis of rotation A<b>2</b> may not be coaxial with the output axis OA<b>2</b> in other embodiments. The gearbox transmission <b>54</b> further includes a worm <b>111</b> coupled to the output shaft <b>100</b> of the belt assembly <b>72</b>; a worm gear <b>112</b> engaging the worm; and an output shaft <b>114</b> coaxially coupled to the worm gear for rotation about its axis OA<b>3</b>. The output shaft <b>114</b> extends through an opening <b>118</b> in an upper surface of the debris shroud <b>18</b>. The output shaft <b>114</b> is configured to couple to a sanding disc within the shroud <b>18</b>. Bearings <b>120</b> are disposed within the gearbox.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As can be understood from the above description, in operation the output shaft <b>60</b> of the motor <b>50</b> is rotatably driven to impart coaxial rotation of the input shaft <b>90</b> and input gear <b>92</b> of the belt assembly <b>72</b>. Rotation of the input gear <b>92</b> drives axial rotation of the output gear <b>96</b> and output shaft <b>100</b> of the belt assembly <b>72</b> via the belt <b>98</b>. Rotation of the output shaft <b>100</b> of the belt assembly <b>72</b> drives rotation of the worm <b>111</b>, which in turn drives rotation of the worm gear <b>112</b> and the output shaft of the gearbox transmission to rotate the sanding disc.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As mentioned above, the drive <b>17</b> defines the portion of the vacuum passage that fluidly connects the debris shroud <b>18</b> to the handle attachment <b>19</b> and the handle <b>14</b>. In this regard, the vacuum passage is defined the coupling <b>40</b>, the belt-drive housing body <b>74</b>, and the gearbox housing <b>110</b>. The coupling <b>40</b> defines upper and lower downstream openings <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b </i>fluidly connecting the prongs <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the forked attachment <b>19</b> and a coupling plenum <b>124</b> defined by the coupling. The coupling plenum <b>124</b> is fluidly connected to a housing plenum <b>126</b> defined by the housing body <b>74</b> and the divider plate <b>78</b>. The divider plate <b>78</b> separates the vacuum passage and the belt assembly cover <b>76</b>.
