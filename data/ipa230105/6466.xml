In the currently illustrated example, a reader device <b>110</b> may transmit RF signals <b>115</b>, for example, to one or more energy-harvesting devices <b>130</b>. In an implementation, the energy of RF signals <b>115</b> may be harvested, collected and/or stored, for example, at an energy-harvesting device <b>130</b>. In some implementations, energy-harvesting device <b>130</b> may reflect and/or backscatter a portion of RF signals <b>115</b> back to reader device <b>110</b> and/or may modulate the reflected and/or backscattered portion of RF signals <b>115</b> to indicate particular detectable symbols and/or parameters (e.g., an identifier of an object associated with and/or co-located within an energy-harvesting device <b>130</b>).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Additionally, energy-harvesting device <b>130</b> may harvest and/or collect energy received from RF signal <b>115</b> for use in powering one or more subsystems of energy-harvesting device <b>130</b> (e.g., one or more processors, microprocessors, memory, sensors, transceiver devices, display devices, etc., not shown). For example, energy-harvesting device <b>130</b> may include one or more antennae, resonating circuitry and/or structures, charge pumps, charge storage devices (e.g., capacitors) and/or the like to harvest and/or collect energy from a portion of RF signal <b>115</b> received at energy-harvesting device <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an embodiment, reader device <b>110</b> and energy-harvesting device <b>130</b> may communicate bidirectionally. For example, reader device <b>110</b> may amplitude-modulate baseband signals and/or signal packets and may transmit amplitude-modulated wireless signals and/or signal packets (e.g., RF signal <b>115</b>) to energy-harvesting device <b>130</b>. Energy-harvesting device <b>130</b> may transmit messages to reader device <b>110</b> in an uplink signal. In one example, an uplink signal may comprise, for example, a signal indicating and/or expressing an identifier of a corresponding energy-harvesting device <b>130</b> and/or object co-located with such a corresponding energy-harvesting device <b>130</b>. In an embodiment, an uplink signal may comprise a reflection of RF signal <b>115</b> that has been modulated with parameters and/or symbols to be detected and/or recovered at reader device <b>110</b>. In particular implementations, reader device <b>110</b> and energy-harvesting devices <b>130</b> may exchange wireless signals and/or signal packets according to one or more signal messaging formats set forth in one or more ISO/IEC 18000 conventions, for example, although subject matter is not limited in scope in this respect. In other examples in which an energy-harvesting device <b>130</b> may comprise more advanced sensing and/or processing capabilities, uplink signals may comprise more robust messaging such as, for example, sensor measurements and/or values computed based, at least in part, on sensor measurements. Also, in an implementation, reader device <b>110</b> may comprise a single board computer hosting a real-time operating system (e.g., Linux) to enable, for example, Internet access (e.g., via network <b>120</b> and/or server computing device <b>130</b>) and/or to perform device management.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As mentioned, a device, such as reader device <b>110</b>, may transmit signals and/or signal packets to energy-harvesting device <b>130</b> via an amplitude-modulated wireless signal, such as RF signal <b>115</b>. Baseband signals and/or signal packets transmitted via amplitude-modulated wireless signals (e.g., RF signal <b>115</b>) may be demodulated at energy-harvesting device <b>130</b> to extract the baseband signals and/or signal packets. As explained more fully below, demodulation of an amplitude-modulated signal may include detecting rising and/or falling of an envelope of the amplitude-modulated signal (e.g., RF signal <b>115</b>). Baseband signals and/or signal packets may be reconstructed at a receiving device (e.g., energy-harvesting device <b>130</b>) based at least in part on the detected envelope of the amplitude-modulated signal, for example. As utilized herein, &#x201c;baseband signal,&#x201d; &#x201c;baseband signal packet&#x201d; and/or the like refer to signals and/or signal packets communicated without modulation.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some circumstances, demodulation of an amplitude-modulated wireless signal (e.g., RF signal <b>115</b>) may pose challenges due at least in part to, for example, a power level at which reader device <b>110</b> transmits RF signal <b>115</b> and/or other factors including, for example, a range and/or distance between reader device <b>110</b> and energy-harvesting device <b>130</b>, deviations from line-of-sight transmissions, presence of multi-path, presence of RF shadows from other energy-harvesting devices <b>130</b>, movement of energy-harvesting devices <b>130</b>, just to provide a few examples of such additional factors. For example, RF power may decay less over shorter distances and may decay to a greater degree over longer distances. Such differences in RF power and/or other circumstances may result in a variety of different envelope characteristics for amplitude-modulated wireless signals received at different energy-harvesting devices <b>130</b>. It may prove challenging to design an envelope detector circuit to adequately and/or appropriately function over such varying circumstances, for example. Adding to the challenges of designing and/or implementing amplitude-modulated signal detection circuits is that energy-harvesting devices, such as energy-harvesting devices <b>130</b>, may tend to be relatively simple, lower cost devices having relatively simple protocols and/or relatively simple circuits.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the particular example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for simplicity of illustration system <b>100</b> includes multiple energy-harvesting devices <b>130</b> to receive an RF signal <b>115</b> from a single reader device <b>110</b>.

Storage media in which such formatted data and/or instructions may be embodied include, but are not limited to, non-volatile storage media in various forms (e.g., optical, magnetic or semiconductor storage media) and carrier waves that may be used to transfer such formatted data and/or instructions through wireless, optical, or wired signaling media or any combination thereof. Examples of transfers of such formatted data and/or instructions by carrier waves include, but are not limited to, transfers (uploads, downloads, e-mail, etc.) over the Internet and/or other computer networks via one or more data transfer protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0079">If received within a computer system via one or more machine-readable media, such data and/or instruction-based expressions of the above described circuits may be processed by a processing entity (e.g., one or more processors) within the computer system in conjunction with execution of one or more other computer programs including, without limitation, net-list generation programs, place and route programs and the like, to generate a representation or image of a physical manifestation of such circuits. Such representation or image may thereafter be used in device fabrication, for example, by enabling generation of one or more masks that are used to form various components of the circuits in a device fabrication process.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0080">In the context of the present patent application, the term &#x201c;connection,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;component&#x201d; and/or similar terms are intended to be physical, but are not necessarily always tangible. Whether or not these terms refer to tangible subject matter, thus, may vary in a particular context of usage. As an example, a tangible connection and/or tangible connection path may be made, such as by a tangible, electrical connection, such as an electrically conductive path comprising metal or other conductor, that is able to conduct electrical current between two tangible components. Likewise, a tangible connection path may be at least partially affected and/or controlled, such that, as is typical, a tangible connection path may be open or closed, at times resulting from influence of one or more externally derived signals, such as external currents and/or voltages, such as for an electrical switch. Non-limiting illustrations of an electrical switch include a transistor, a diode, etc. However, a &#x201c;connection&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;component,&#x201d; in a particular context of usage, likewise, although physical, can also be non-tangible, such as a connection between a client and a server over a network, particularly a wireless network, which generally refers to the ability for the client and server to transmit, receive, and/or exchange communications, as discussed in more detail later.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0081">In a particular context of usage, such as a particular context in which tangible components are being discussed, therefore, the terms &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; and &#x201c;connected&#x201d; are used in a manner so that the terms are not synonymous. Similar terms may also be used in a manner in which a similar intention is exhibited. Thus, &#x201c;connected&#x201d; is used to indicate that two or more tangible components and/or the like, for example, are tangibly in direct physical contact. Thus, using the previous example, two tangible components that are electrically connected are physically connected via a tangible electrical connection, as previously discussed. However, &#x201c;coupled,&#x201d; is used to mean that potentially two or more tangible components are tangibly in direct physical contact. Nonetheless, &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; is also used to mean that two or more tangible components and/or the like are not necessarily tangibly in direct physical contact, but are able to co-operate, liaise, and/or interact, such as, for example, by being &#x201c;optically coupled.&#x201d; Likewise, the term &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; is also understood to mean indirectly connected. It is further noted, in the context of the present patent application, since memory, such as a memory component and/or memory states, is intended to be non-transitory, the term physical, at least if used in relation to memory necessarily implies that such memory components and/or memory states, continuing with the example, are tangible.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0082">Unless otherwise indicated, in the context of the present patent application, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; if used to associate a list, such as A, B, or C, is intended to mean A, B, and C, here used in the inclusive sense, as well as A, B, or C, here used in the exclusive sense. With this understanding, &#x201c;and&#x201d; is used in the inclusive sense and intended to mean A, B, and C; whereas &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; can be used in an abundance of caution to make clear that all of the foregoing meanings are intended, although such usage is not required. In addition, the term &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; and/or similar terms is used to describe any feature, structure, characteristic, and/or the like in the singular, &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; is also used to describe a plurality and/or some other combination of features, structures, characteristics, and/or the like. Likewise, the term &#x201c;based on&#x201d; and/or similar terms are understood as not necessarily intending to convey an exhaustive list of factors, but to allow for existence of additional factors not necessarily expressly described.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0083">Furthermore, it is intended, for a situation that relates to implementation of claimed subject matter and is subject to testing, measurement, and/or specification regarding degree, that the particular situation be understood in the following manner. As an example, in a given situation, assume a value of a physical property is to be measured. If alternatively reasonable approaches to testing, measurement, and/or specification regarding degree, at least with respect to the property, continuing with the example, is reasonably likely to occur to one of ordinary skill, at least for implementation purposes, claimed subject matter is intended to cover those alternatively reasonable approaches unless otherwise expressly indicated. As an example, if a plot of measurements over a region is produced and implementation of claimed subject matter refers to employing a measurement of slope over the region, but a variety of reasonable and alternative techniques to estimate the slope over that region exist, claimed subject matter is intended to cover those reasonable alternative techniques unless otherwise expressly indicated.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0084">To the extent claimed subject matter is related to one or more particular measurements, such as with regard to physical manifestations capable of being measured physically, such as, without limit, temperature, pressure, voltage, current, electromagnetic radiation, etc., it is believed that claimed subject matter does not fall within the abstract idea judicial exception to statutory subject matter. Rather, it is asserted, that physical measurements are not mental steps and, likewise, are not abstract ideas.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0085">It is noted, nonetheless, that a typical measurement model employed is that one or more measurements may respectively comprise a sum of at least two components. Thus, for a given measurement, for example, one component may comprise a deterministic component, which in an ideal sense, may comprise a physical value (e.g., sought via one or more measurements), often in the form of one or more signals, signal samples and/or states, and one component may comprise a random component, which may have a variety of sources that may be challenging to quantify. At times, for example, lack of measurement precision may affect a given measurement. Thus, for claimed subject matter, a statistical or stochastic model may be used in addition to a deterministic model as an approach to identification and/or prediction regarding one or more measurement values that may relate to claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0086">For example, a relatively large number of measurements may be collected to better estimate a deterministic component. Likewise, if measurements vary, which may typically occur, it may be that some portion of a variance may be explained as a deterministic component, while some portion of a variance may be explained as a random component. Typically, it is desirable to have stochastic variance associated with measurements be relatively small, if feasible. That is, typically, it may be preferable to be able to account for a reasonable portion of measurement variation in a deterministic manner, rather than a stochastic matter as an aid to identification and/or predictability.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0087">Along these lines, a variety of techniques have come into use so that one or more measurements may be processed to better estimate an underlying deterministic component, as well as to estimate potentially random components. These techniques, of course, may vary with details surrounding a given situation. Typically, however, more complex problems may involve use of more complex techniques. In this regard, as alluded to above, one or more measurements of physical manifestations may be modeled deterministically and/or stochastically. Employing a model permits collected measurements to potentially be identified and/or processed, and/or potentially permits estimation and/or prediction of an underlying deterministic component, for example, with respect to later measurements to be taken. A given estimate may not be a perfect estimate; however, in general, it is expected that on average one or more estimates may better reflect an underlying deterministic component, for example, if random components that may be included in one or more obtained measurements, are considered. Practically speaking, of course, it is desirable to be able to generate, such as through estimation approaches, a physically meaningful model of processes affecting measurements to be taken.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0088">In some situations, however, as indicated, potential influences may be complex. Therefore, seeking to understand appropriate factors to consider may be particularly challenging. In such situations, it is, therefore, not unusual to employ heuristics with respect to generating one or more estimates. Heuristics refers to use of experience related approaches that may reflect realized processes and/or realized results, such as with respect to use of historical measurements, for example. Heuristics, for example, may be employed in situations where more analytical approaches may be overly complex and/or nearly intractable. Thus, regarding claimed subject matter, an innovative feature may include, in an example embodiment, heuristics that may be employed, for example, to estimate and/or predict one or more measurements.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0089">It is further noted that the terms &#x201c;type&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;like,&#x201d; if used, such as with a feature, structure, characteristic, and/or the like, using &#x201c;optical&#x201d; or &#x201c;electrical&#x201d; as simple examples, means at least partially of and/or relating to the feature, structure, characteristic, and/or the like in such a way that presence of minor variations, even variations that might otherwise not be considered fully consistent with the feature, structure, characteristic, and/or the like, do not in general prevent the feature, structure, characteristic, and/or the like from being of a &#x201c;type&#x201d; and/or being &#x201c;like,&#x201d; (such as being an &#x201c;optical-type&#x201d; or being &#x201c;optical-like,&#x201d; for example) if the minor variations are sufficiently minor so that the feature, structure, characteristic, and/or the like would still be considered to be substantially present with such variations also present. Thus, continuing with this example, the terms optical-type and/or optical-like properties are necessarily intended to include optical properties. Likewise, the terms electrical-type and/or electrical-like properties, as another example, are necessarily intended to include electrical properties. It should be noted that the specification of the present patent application merely provides one or more illustrative examples and claimed subject matter is intended to not be limited to one or more illustrative examples; however, again, as has always been the case with respect to the specification of a patent application, particular context of description and/or usage provides helpful guidance regarding reasonable inferences to be drawn.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0090">With advances in technology, it has become more typical to employ distributed computing and/or communication approaches in which portions of a process, such as signal processing of signal samples, for example, may be allocated among various devices, including one or more client devices and/or one or more server devices, via a computing and/or communications network, for example. A network may comprise two or more devices, such as network devices and/or computing devices, and/or may couple devices, such as network devices and/or computing devices, so that signal communications, such as in the form of signal packets and/or signal frames (e.g., comprising one or more signal samples), for example, may be exchanged, such as between a server device and/or a client device, as well as other types of devices, including between wired and/or wireless devices coupled via a wired and/or wireless network, for example.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0091">In the context of the present patent application, the term network device refers to any device capable of communicating via and/or as part of a network and may comprise a computing device. While network devices may be capable of communicating signals (e.g., signal packets and/or frames), such as via a wired and/or wireless network, they may also be capable of performing operations associated with a computing device, such as arithmetic and/or logic operations, processing and/or storing operations (e.g., storing signal samples), such as in memory as tangible, physical memory states, and/or may, for example, operate as a server device and/or a client device in various embodiments. Network devices capable of operating as a server device, a client device and/or otherwise, may include, as examples, dedicated rack-mounted servers, desktop computers, laptop computers, set top boxes, tablets, RFID reader devices, netbooks, smart phones, wearable devices, integrated devices combining two or more features of the foregoing devices, and/or the like, or any combination thereof. As mentioned, signal packets and/or frames, for example, may be exchanged, such as between a server device and/or a client device, as well as other types of devices, including between wired and/or wireless devices coupled via a wired and/or wireless network, for example, or any combination thereof. It is noted that the terms, server, server device, server computing device, server computing platform and/or similar terms are used interchangeably. Similarly, the terms client, client device, client computing device, client computing platform and/or similar terms are also used interchangeably. While in some instances, for ease of description, these terms may be used in the singular, such as by referring to a &#x201c;client device&#x201d; or a &#x201c;server device,&#x201d; the description is intended to encompass one or more client devices and/or one or more server devices, as appropriate. Along similar lines, references to a &#x201c;database&#x201d; are understood to mean, one or more databases and/or portions thereof, as appropriate.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0092">The term electronic file and/or the term electronic document are used throughout this document to refer to a set of stored memory states and/or a set of physical signals associated in a manner so as to thereby at least logically form a file (e.g., electronic) and/or an electronic document. That is, it is not meant to implicitly reference a particular syntax, format and/or approach used, for example, with respect to a set of associated memory states and/or a set of associated physical signals. If a particular type of file storage format and/or syntax, for example, is intended, it is referenced expressly. It is further noted an association of memory states, for example, may be in a logical sense and not necessarily in a tangible, physical sense. Thus, although signal and/or state components of a file and/or an electronic document, for example, are to be associated logically, storage thereof, for example, may reside in one or more different places in a tangible, physical memory, in an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0093">In the context of the present patent application, the terms &#x201c;entry,&#x201d; &#x201c;electronic entry,&#x201d; &#x201c;document,&#x201d; &#x201c;electronic document,&#x201d; &#x201c;content,&#x201d;, &#x201c;digital content,&#x201d; &#x201c;item,&#x201d; and/or similar terms are meant to refer to signals and/or states in a physical format, such as a digital signal and/or digital state format, e.g., that may be perceived by a user if displayed, played, tactilely generated, etc. and/or otherwise executed by a device, such as a digital device, including, for example, a computing device, but otherwise might not necessarily be readily perceivable by humans (e.g., if in a digital format). Likewise, in the context of the present patent application, digital content provided to a user in a form so that the user is able to readily perceive the underlying content itself (e.g., content presented in a form consumable by a human, such as hearing audio, feeling tactile sensations and/or seeing images, as examples) is referred to, with respect to the user, as &#x201c;consuming&#x201d; digital content, &#x201c;consumption&#x201d; of digital content, &#x201c;consumable&#x201d; digital content and/or similar terms. For one or more embodiments, an electronic document and/or an electronic file may comprise a Web page of code (e.g., computer instructions) in a markup language executed or to be executed by a computing and/or networking device, for example. In another embodiment, an electronic document and/or electronic file may comprise a portion and/or a region of a Web page. However, claimed subject matter is not intended to be limited in these respects.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0094">Also, for one or more embodiments, an electronic document and/or electronic file may comprise a number of components. As previously indicated, in the context of the present patent application, a component is physical, but is not necessarily tangible. As an example, components with reference to an electronic document and/or electronic file, in one or more embodiments, may comprise text, for example, in the form of physical signals and/or physical states (e.g., capable of being physically displayed). Typically, memory states, for example, comprise tangible components, whereas physical signals are not necessarily tangible, although signals may become (e.g., be made) tangible, such as if appearing on a tangible display, for example, as is not uncommon. Also, for one or more embodiments, components with reference to an electronic document and/or electronic file may comprise a graphical object, such as, for example, an image, such as a digital image, and/or sub-objects, including attributes thereof, which, again, comprise physical signals and/or physical states (e.g., capable of being tangibly displayed). In an embodiment, digital content may comprise, for example, text, images, audio, video, and/or other types of electronic documents and/or electronic files, including portions thereof, for example.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0095">Also, in the context of the present patent application, the term parameters (e.g., one or more parameters) refer to material descriptive of a collection of signal samples, such as one or more electronic documents and/or electronic files, and exist in the form of physical signals and/or physical states, such as memory states. For example, one or more parameters, such as referring to an electronic document and/or an electronic file comprising an image, may include, as examples, time of day at which an image was captured, latitude and longitude of an image capture device, such as a camera, for example, etc. In another example, one or more parameters relevant to digital content, such as digital content comprising a technical article, as an example, may include one or more authors, for example. Claimed subject matter is intended to embrace meaningful, descriptive parameters in any format, so long as the one or more parameters comprise physical signals and/or states, which may include, as parameter examples, collection name (e.g., electronic file and/or electronic document identifier name), technique of creation, purpose of creation, time and date of creation, logical path if stored, coding formats (e.g., type of computer instructions, such as a markup language) and/or standards and/or specifications used so as to be protocol compliant (e.g., meaning substantially compliant and/or substantially compatible) for one or more uses, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0096">Signal packet communications and/or signal frame communications, also referred to as signal packet transmissions and/or signal frame transmissions (or merely &#x201c;signal packets&#x201d; or &#x201c;signal frames&#x201d;), may be communicated between nodes of a network, where a node may comprise one or more network devices and/or one or more computing devices, for example. As an illustrative example, but without limitation, a node may comprise one or more sites employing a local network address, such as in a local network address space. Likewise, a device, such as a network device and/or a computing device, may be associated with that node. It is also noted that in the context of this patent application, the term &#x201c;transmission&#x201d; is intended as another term for a type of signal communication that may occur in any one of a variety of situations. Thus, it is not intended to imply a particular directionality of communication and/or a particular initiating end of a communication path for the &#x201c;transmission&#x201d; communication. For example, the mere use of the term in and of itself is not intended, in the context of the present patent application, to have particular implications with respect to the one or more signals being communicated, such as, for example, whether the signals are being communicated &#x201c;to&#x201d; a particular device, whether the signals are being communicated &#x201c;from&#x201d; a particular device, and/or regarding which end of a communication path may be initiating communication, such as, for example, in a &#x201c;push type&#x201d; of signal transfer or in a &#x201c;pull type&#x201d; of signal transfer. In the context of the present patent application, push and/or pull type signal transfers are distinguished by which end of a communications path initiates signal transfer.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0097">Thus, a signal packet and/or frame may, as an example, be communicated via a communication channel and/or a communication path, such as comprising a portion of the Internet and/or the Web, from a site via an access node coupled to the Internet or vice-versa. Likewise, a signal packet and/or frame may be forwarded via network nodes to a target site coupled to a local network, for example. A signal packet and/or frame communicated via the Internet and/or the Web, for example, may be routed via a path, such as either being &#x201c;pushed&#x201d; or &#x201c;pulled,&#x201d; comprising one or more gateways, servers, etc. that may, for example, route a signal packet and/or frame, such as, for example, substantially in accordance with a target and/or destination address and availability of a network path of network nodes to the target and/or destination address. Although the Internet and/or the Web comprise a network of interoperable networks, not all of those interoperable networks are necessarily available and/or accessible to the public.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0098">In the context of the particular patent application, a network protocol, such as for communicating between devices of a network, may be characterized, at least in part, substantially in accordance with a layered description, such as the so-called Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) seven layer type of approach and/or description. A network computing and/or communications protocol (also referred to as a network protocol) refers to a set of signaling conventions, such as for communication transmissions, for example, as may take place between and/or among devices in a network. In the context of the present patent application, the term &#x201c;between&#x201d; and/or similar terms are understood to include &#x201c;among&#x201d; if appropriate for the particular usage and vice-versa. Likewise, in the context of the present patent application, the terms &#x201c;compatible with,&#x201d; &#x201c;comply with&#x201d; and/or similar terms are understood to respectively include substantial compatibility and/or substantial compliance.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0099">A network and/or sub-network, in an embodiment, may communicate via signal packets and/or signal frames, such as via participating digital devices and may be substantially compliant and/or substantially compatible with, but is not limited to, now known and/or to be developed, versions of any of the following network protocol stacks: ARCNET, AppleTalk, ATM, Bluetooth, DECnet, Ethernet, FDDI, Frame Relay, HIPPI, IEEE 1394, IEEE 802.11, IEEE-488, Internet Protocol Suite, IPX, Myrinet, OSI Protocol Suite, QsNet, RS-232, SPX, System Network Architecture, Token Ring, USB, and/or X.25.

A wireless network may further include a system of terminals, gateways, routers, and/or the like coupled by wireless radio links, and/or the like, which may move freely, randomly and/or organize themselves arbitrarily, such that network topology may change, at times even rapidly. A wireless network may further employ a plurality of network access technologies, including a version of Long Term Evolution (LTE), WLAN, Wireless Router (WR) mesh, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th generation (2G, 3G, 4G, or 5G) cellular technology and/or the like, whether currently known and/or to be later developed.
