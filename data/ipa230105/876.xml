Absolute configuration refers to the arrangement in space of the substituents attached to the chiral center. The substituents attached to the chiral center under consideration are ranked in accordance with the Sequence Rule of Cahn, Ingold and Prelog. (Cahn et al., <i>Angew. Chem. Inter.

Atropic isomers owe their existence to a restricted rotation caused by hindrance of rotation of large groups about a central bond. Such atropic isomers typically exist as a mixture, however as a result of recent advances in chromatography techniques, it has been possible to separate mixtures of two atropic isomers in select cases.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0254">&#x201c;Tautomer&#x201d; is one of two or more structural isomers that exist in equilibrium and is readily converted from one isomeric form to another. This conversion results in the formal migration of a hydrogen atom accompanied by a switch of adjacent conjugated double bonds. Tautomers exist as a mixture of a tautomeric set in solution. In solutions where tautomerization is possible, a chemical equilibrium of the tautomers will be reached. The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors, including temperature, solvent and pH. The concept of tautomers that are interconvertible by tautomerization is called tautomerism.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0255">Of the various types of tautomerism that are possible, two are commonly observed. In keto-enol tautomerism a simultaneous shift of electrons and a hydrogen atom occurs. Ring-chain tautomerism arises as a result of the aldehyde group (&#x2014;CHO) in a sugar chain molecule reacting with one of the hydroxy groups (&#x2014;OH) in the same molecule to give it a cyclic (ring-shaped) form as exhibited by glucose.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0256">Common tautomeric pairs are: ketone-enol, amide-nitrile, lactam-lactim, amide-imidic acid tautomerism in heterocyclic rings (e.g., in nucleobases such as guanine, thymine and cytosine), imine-enamine and enamine-enamine. An example of keto-enol equilibria is between pyridin-2(1H)-ones and the corresponding pyridin-2-ols, as shown below.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00118" num="00118"><img id="EMI-C00118" he="22.78mm" wi="41.57mm" file="US20230000877A1-20230105-C00118.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0301" num="0257">It is to be understood that the compounds of the disclosure may be depicted as different tautomers.

Suitable cations include sodium ion, potassium ion, magnesium ion, calcium ion, and an ammonium cation such as tetramethylammonium ion. The aryl- or heteroaryl-substituted benzene compounds also include those salts containing quaternary nitrogen atoms.

Some compounds have a tendency to trap a fixed molar ratio of solvent molecules in the crystalline solid state, thus forming a solvate. If the solvent is water the solvate formed is a hydrate; and if the solvent is alcohol, the solvate formed is an alcoholate.

In some embodiments, combination treatment is achieved by administering two or more agents in a single formulation. Other combinations are also encompassed by combination therapy. For example, two agents can be formulated together and administered in conjunction with a separate formulation containing a third agent. While, in some embodiments, the two or more agents in the combination therapy can be administered simultaneously, they need not be. For example, administration of a first agent (or combination of agents) can precede administration of one or more second agents (e.g., a combination of agents) by minutes, hours, days, or weeks. Thus, the two or more agents can be administered within minutes of each other or within 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, or 24 hours of each other or within 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14 days of each other or within 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 weeks of each other.

The precise effective amount for a subject will depend upon the subject's body weight, size, and health; the nature and extent of the condition; and the therapeutic or combination of therapeutics selected for administration. Therapeutically effective amounts for a given situation can be determined by routine experimentation that is within the skill and judgment of the clinician. In some aspects, the disease or condition to be treated is cancer. In other aspects, the disease or condition to be treated is a cell proliferative disorder.</p><p id="p-0428" num="0382">In certain embodiments the therapeutically effective amount of each pharmaceutical agent used in combination will be lower when used in combination in comparison to monotherapy with each agent alone. Such lower therapeutically effective amount could afford for lower toxicity of the therapeutic regimen.</p><p id="p-0429" num="0383">For any compound, the therapeutically effective amount can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays, e.g., of neoplastic cells, or in animal models, usually rats, mice, rabbits, dogs, or pigs. The animal model may also be used to determine the appropriate concentration range and route of administration. Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in humans. Therapeutic/prophylactic efficacy and toxicity may be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., ED<sub>50 </sub>(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population) and LD<sub>50 </sub>(the dose lethal to 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, and it can be expressed as the ratio, LD<sub>50</sub>/ED<sub>50</sub>. Pharmaceutical compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed, sensitivity of the patient, and the route of administration.</p><p id="p-0430" num="0384">Dosage and administration are adjusted to provide sufficient levels of the active agent(s) or to maintain the desired effect. Factors which may be taken into account include the severity of the disease state, general health of the subject, age, weight, and gender of the subject, diet, time and frequency of administration, drug combination(s), reaction sensitivities, and tolerance/response to therapy. Long-acting pharmaceutical compositions may be administered every 3 to 4 days, every week, or once every two weeks depending on half-life and clearance rate of the particular formulation.</p><p id="p-0431" num="0385">The pharmaceutical compositions containing active compounds of the disclosure may be manufactured in a manner that is generally known, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping, or lyophilizing processes. Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and/or auxiliaries that facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations that can be used pharmaceutically. Of course, the appropriate formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen.</p><p id="p-0432" num="0386">Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL&#x2122; (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol and sorbitol, and sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.</p><p id="p-0433" num="0387">Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying that yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.</p><p id="p-0434" num="0388">Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.</p><p id="p-0435" num="0389">For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser, which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer.</p><p id="p-0436" num="0390">Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art.</p><p id="p-0437" num="0391">The active compounds can be prepared with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811.</p><p id="p-0438" num="0392">It is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved.</p><p id="p-0439" num="0393">In therapeutic applications, the dosages of the EZH2 inhibitors described herein, other therapeutic agents described herein, compositions comprising a compound of Formulae (I)-(VIa) and one or more other therapeutic agents, or the pharmaceutical compositions used in accordance with the invention vary depending on the agent, the age, weight, and clinical condition of the recipient patient, and the experience and judgment of the clinician or practitioner administering the therapy, among other factors affecting the selected dosage. Generally, the dose should be sufficient to result in slowing, and preferably regressing, the growth of the tumors and also preferably causing complete regression of the cancer. Dosages can range from about 0.01 mg/kg per day to about 5000 mg/kg per day. In some aspects, dosages can range from about 1 mg/kg per day to about 1000 mg/kg per day. In some aspects, the dose will be in the range of about 0.1 mg/day to about 50 g/day; about 0.1 mg/day to about 25 g/day; about 0.1 mg/day to about 10 g/day; about 0.1 mg to about 3 g/day; or about 0.1 mg to about 1 g/day, in single, divided, or continuous doses (which dose may be adjusted for the patient's weight in kg, body surface area in m<sup>2</sup>, and age in years). An effective amount of a pharmaceutical agent is that which provides an objectively identifiable improvement as noted by the clinician or other qualified observer. For example, regression of a tumor in a patient may be measured with reference to the diameter of a tumor. Decrease in the diameter of a tumor indicates regression. Regression is also indicated by failure of tumors to reoccur after treatment has stopped. As used herein, the term &#x201c;dosage effective manner&#x201d; refers to amount of an active compound to produce the desired biological effect in a subject or cell.</p><p id="p-0440" num="0394">The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration.</p><p id="p-0441" num="0395">The composition of the disclosure is capable of further forming salts.

Importantly, a sign or symptom can be alleviated without being eliminated. In some embodiments, the administration of pharmaceutical compositions of the invention leads to the elimination of a sign or symptom, however, elimination is not required. Effective dosages are expected to decrease the severity of a sign or symptom. For instance, a sign or symptom of a disorder such as cancer, which can occur in multiple locations, is alleviated if the severity of the cancer is decreased within at least one of multiple locations.</p><p id="p-0463" num="0417">As used herein, the term &#x201c;severity&#x201d; is meant to describe the potential of cancer to transform from a precancerous, or benign, state into a malignant state. Alternatively, or in addition, severity is meant to describe a cancer stage, for example, according to the TNM system (accepted by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)) or by other art-recognized methods. Cancer stage refers to the extent or severity of the cancer, based on factors such as the location of the primary tumor, tumor size, number of tumors, and lymph node involvement (spread of cancer into lymph nodes). Alternatively, or in addition, severity is meant to describe the tumor grade by art-recognized methods (see, National Cancer Institute, www.cancer.gov). Tumor grade is a system used to classify cancer cells in terms of how abnormal they look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread. Many factors are considered when determining tumor grade, including the structure and growth pattern of the cells. The specific factors used to determine tumor grade vary with each type of cancer. Severity also describes a histologic grade, also called differentiation, which refers to how much the tumor cells resemble normal cells of the same tissue type (see, National Cancer Institute, www.cancer.gov). Furthermore, severity describes a nuclear grade, which refers to the size and shape of the nucleus in tumor cells and the percentage of tumor cells that are dividing (see, National Cancer Institute, www.cancer.gov).</p><p id="p-0464" num="0418">In other aspects of the invention, severity describes the degree to which a tumor has secreted growth factors, degraded the extracellular matrix, become vascularized, lost adhesion to juxtaposed tissues, or metastasized. Moreover, severity describes the number of locations to which a primary tumor has metastasized. Finally, severity includes the difficulty of treating tumors of varying types and locations. For example, inoperable tumors, those cancers which have greater access to multiple body systems (hematological and immunological tumors), and those which are the most resistant to traditional treatments are considered most severe. In these situations, prolonging the life expectancy of the subject and/or reducing pain, decreasing the proportion of cancerous cells or restricting cells to one system, and improving cancer stage/tumor grade/histological grade/nuclear grade are considered alleviating a sign or symptom of the cancer.</p><p id="p-0465" num="0419">As used herein the term &#x201c;symptom&#x201d; is defined as an indication of disease, illness, injury, or that something is not right in the body.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for about 85% of all lung cancer cases. Most patients present with advanced stage III or IV NSCLC with a 5-year survival of 24% and 4% respectively. Because of the advanced nature of disease on presentation, surgical resection is often not an option. For the majority of patients therapy involves chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment. The selection of chemotherapy is highly variable based on disease stage, patient performance criteria and geographical regional preference. In most cases chemotherapy is based on a doublet that includes a platinating agent such as cisplatin or carboplatin, and a second cytotoxic drug such as gemcitabine, etoposide or taxotere. For a small number of patients, therapy can include treatment with agents that target specific proteins that are mutated or disregulated such as ALK and EGFR (e.g., crizotinib, gefitinib and erlotinib). Patients are selected for these targeted treatments based on genetic or proteomic markers. A great number of agents have been assessed in late stage NSCLC clinical studies, however most have shown very little benefit over chemotherapy based treatments, with median overall survival typically less than 11 months. Accordingly, there is a tremendous need for new strategies to improve non-small cell lung cancer treatments.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Cancer</heading><p id="p-0468" num="0422">A &#x201c;cancer cell&#x201d; or &#x201c;cancerous cell&#x201d; is a cell manifesting a cell proliferative disorder that is a cancer.

Initial proliferation studies were performed to determine the IC50 of tazemetostat in each cell line. For the screen, tazemetostat was used at concentrations bracketed around the IC50 value. If 50% inhibitory concentration was not reached then tazemetostat was tested starting at 10 &#x3bc;M.</p><p id="p-0518" num="0472">In order to study the effect of dual combination of tazemetostat and a second agent on cell proliferation, cells in log-linear phase growth rate were pre-treated with various concentrations of tazemetostat or DMSO for 7 days in flasks, plated in 384-well plates in the absence of compounds and co-treated on day 8 with tazemetostat or DMSO and the second agent serially diluted for additional 6 days (as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). On day 15, plates were developed for endpoint analysis using Cell Titer Glo to measure ATP content, which was used as an indicator of cell viability.
