id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Applications of the present invention relate generally to medical devices and specifically to system and methods for Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) is the elicitation of muscle contraction using electric pulses.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some cases, Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) is employed during a physical workout, involving stimulating muscle contractions during a training session by delivering electrical pulses that stimulate and heighten muscle contraction, thereby intensifying the workout. Typically, EMS training strengthens core muscles and assists in building body mass and toning of body.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The foregoing examples of the related art and limitations related therewith are intended to be illustrative and not exclusive. Other limitations of the related art will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon a reading of the specification and a study of the figures.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following embodiments and aspects thereof are described and illustrated in conjunction with systems, device and methods which are meant to be exemplary and illustrative, not limiting in scope.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with some applications of the present invention, a system for stimulating a muscle of a user is provided. In some applications, the system delivers stimulation, e.g., electrical stimulation, to a target muscle, to elicit and intensify contraction of the muscle. For example, the electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) delivered by the system in accordance with some applications of the present invention, is used in sports training EMS devices, and/or for physical rehabilitation following an injury, and/or pain management in cases of muscle injury.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with some applications of the present invention, the system is an automatically adaptive muscle stimulation system comprising: (a) a stimulating unit comprising (1) at least one electrode (e.g., at least one pair of electrodes) configured to be place in contact with skin of the user to apply a stimulating current transcutaneously to a subcutaneous target muscle tissue of the user, and (2) a pulse generator configured to generate pulses to drive the electrode to apply the stimulating current to the tissue; (b) a sensing unit comprising at least one sensor and configured to detect a physiological parameter of the user and/or detect a muscle response, and generate a sensing signal in response thereto; and (c) a control processor unit operably coupled to and in communication with the stimulating unit and the sensing unit and configured to receive the sensing signal from the sensing unit to change, based on the sensing signal, at least one parameter of the stimulating current applied to the target muscle tissue.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Typically, the stimulating unit comprises at least two electrodes configured to be placed in contact with skin of the user in a vicinity of the muscle to be stimulated. For example, the muscles stimulated may include abdominal muscles, e.g., the abdominal rectus muscle and/or the external abdominal oblique muscle. For such applications, the electrodes are placed on an abdomen of the user in proximity to the abdominal muscles such that the electrical stimulation is delivered transcutaneously to the abdominal muscles. It is noted that the electrical stimulation may be delivered to a portion of one or more muscles rather than to the entire muscle. For some applications, the system comprises a pulse generator configured to generate an electrical pulse that is applied to the muscle through the at least two electrodes.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with some applications of the present invention, the system is configured to change or adjust application of the electrical pulse to the muscle in accordance with a physiological state of the user in response to a measured parameter of the user, to improve effectiveness of the electrical stimulation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, the system comprises one or more sensors configured to sense a physiological parameter of the user and to generate a sensing signal in response to the physiological parameter, and the control processor is configured to change a parameter of the stimulation applied by the stimulation unit in response to the sensing signal typically without active input from the user. For some applications, the physiological parameter is selected from the group consisting of: skin resistance, movements, body position, heart rate (HR) heart rate variability (HRV), oxygen saturation, acceleration, and a rate of respiration, and the sensor is configured to sense the physiological parameter selected from the group.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, the system is configured to synchronize application of the electrical pulse to the muscle with a phase of a respiratory cycle of the user. For some such applications, the system comprises at least one sensor for sensing breathing of the of the user, and the control processor is configured to receive input from the sensor and identify phases of a respiratory cycle. The control processor is further configured to synchronize the pulse generator in accordance with the respiratory cycle to generate the electrical pulse only during a pre-determined breathing phase, e.g., during inhalation or exhalation. Consequently, the electrical stimulation applied to the muscle of the user is applied during the inhalation phase, or during the exhalation phase.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is hypothesized by the inventors that synchronizing application of the electrical pulse with a breathing phase of the user provides the muscle with the electrical pulse at an optimal stage of the respiratory cycle resulting in enhanced muscle contractions, leading to effective fat burn and improved muscle strength.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">For some applications, the sensor for sensing breathing of the of the user comprises a piezoelectric element for sensing breathing of the user. Typically, the piezoelectric element is configured to generate a signal in accordance with variations in the girth of a thorax during the respiration cycle (for applications in which the piezoelectric element is positioned on a chest of the user).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Additionally, or alternatively the at least one sensor comprises a ECG sensor (e.g., a pair of electrodes) configured to measure ECG signals of the user and the control processor is configured to identify a phase of the respiratory cycle based on the input from the sensor and to drive the pulse generator to generate the pulse during the desired phase of the respiratory cycle, e.g., inhalation or exhalation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some applications, the pair of electrodes sense ECG signals of the user, and the control processor runs an algorithm to identify a respiration waveform based on the ECG-derived respiration information. In some applications, the control processor is configured to identify phases of the respiration cycle based on the EDR-based respiratory cycle and drive the pulse generator to apply the pulse through the electrodes during inhalation. It is hypothesized by the inventors that synchronization of the muscle stimulation timing with the ECG signal enables optimization of fat burn such that the muscle is stimulated while having optimal blood supply coming from the heartbeat phase.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Additionally, or alternatively, for some application, the stimulation unit further comprises a vacuum source for applying vacuum to the skin of the user in proximity of the muscles to be stimulated for increasing blood vessel dilation and blood flow leading to enhanced fat burn and energy consumption.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Additionally, or alternatively, for some applications, the stimulating unit comprises at least two accelerometers arranged in a predetermined pattern in relation to a center point of the muscle, and wherein each of the accelerometers is configured to measure movement of the muscle in one or more degrees-of-freedom.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">For some application, the movement comprises at least one of: an onset, a modification, and a disappearance of a physical movement at the center point in reaction to the electrical pulse.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further additionally or alternatively, a heat source is provided for heating superficial tissue during application of the EMS in accordance with some applications of the present invention. Typically, heating of the tissue in proximity to the electrically stimulated muscles increases metabolism in the tissue resulting in increased substance exchange between fat cells and blood vessels, increased rate of fat metabolic reaction in mitochondrion, and more effective fat burn (lipolysis). Additionally, since oxygen transport between blood vessels and muscle fibers increase with a rise in temperature, energy consumption by muscles is increased. Typically, increasing the superficial muscle temperature by about 20 degrees Celsius increases the rate of oxygen diffusion by more than 50%, resulting in more effective metabolism and fat burn.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">For some applications, the stimulating unit comprises a plurality of electrodes arranged in an array and spatially distributed such that when placed in contact with the user, each electrode (or set of electrodes) stimulates a different portion of the target muscle tissue. Typically, the sensing unit is configured to sense a muscle response to detect muscle fatigue and the control processor is configured to discontinue application of stimulation to the fatigued portion of the muscle and initiate or increase stimulation to non-fatigued portions of the muscle, thereby maximizing muscle response and effectiveness of the EMS.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thus, some applications of the present invention provide an enhanced EMS system and methods for maximizing the effectiveness of EMS for purposes of body shaping, muscle strengthening and fat burn. The system according to some applications of the present invention, combines heating of superficial body layers, dilation of blood vessels by application of superficial vacuum, and timing of the application of EMS pulses with breathing cycles and heart rate, to provide an enhanced and effective EMS treatment.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">There is therefore provided in accordance with some applications of the present invention a system for stimulating a muscle of a user, the system including: a stimulating unit including (i) at least two electrodes configured to be placed in electrical contact with skin of a user in a vicinity of the muscle, and (ii) a pulse generator configured to generate an electrical pulse for application to the muscle through the at least two electrodes;

and the control processor is configured to change the parameters of the pulse applied to the muscle in order to exceed the desired threshold of contractions, based on multiple uses of the system and: (i) iteratively varying the parameters of the electrical pulses, and (ii) measuring an effect of the varying of the parameters of the electrical pulses on the muscle contractions.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">For some applications, the at least two electrodes include an array of at least 2-10 electrodes.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For some applications, a distance between two adjacent electrodes in the array is not greater than 2 cm.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">For some applications, the control processor is configured to discontinue application of electrical pulses through a first one of the electrodes in the array and cause application of electrical pulses through a second one of the electrodes in the array in response to the sensing signal.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For some applications, the system further includes a heat source configured to heat the skin in proximity of the muscle to be stimulated by up to 20 degrees Celsius.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For some applications, the system further includes a vacuum source configured to apply vacuum to the skin of the user in proximity of the muscle to be stimulated.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">There is further provided in accordance with some applications of the present invention a system for stimulating a muscle of a user, the system including: first and second electrodes configured to be placed in electrical contact with skin of a user in a vicinity of first and second portions of the muscle respectively;

The EMS in accordance with some aspects of the present invention, is used for various purposes such as physical rehabilitation, pain control, and in sports training EMS devices.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some aspects, the system causes muscle contraction by applying electrical pulses to the muscles. In some aspects the pulses are generated by a pulse generator and applied through a plurality of electrodes positioned on skin in close proximity to the muscle to be stimulated and/or in close proximity to nerves innervating the muscle. Typically, the electrodes are placed in contact with the skin of a user and the electrical pulses are delivered transcutaneously to the underlying muscles. The system typically causes repeated contraction of the muscles by applying the pulsed electric current through the skin-placed electrodes.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some aspects, a plurality of electrodes, e.g., 2-10 electrodes, e.g., 4-6 electrodes, are placed on skin in a vicinity of muscles to be stimulated. The electrical stimulation may be delivered to different muscles using different electrodes. Furthermore, electrical stimulation may be applied to different portions of a muscle. In some applications, the muscles stimulated may include abdominal muscles, e.g., the abdominal rectus muscle and/or the external abdominal oblique muscle. For such applications, the electrodes are placed on an abdomen of the user in proximity to the underlying abdominal muscles such that the electrical stimulation is delivered transcutaneously to the desired muscles. Additionally, or alternatively, the electrodes are placed on an arm, hip and/or buttocks of the user to stimulate underlying muscles.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some aspects the pulses applied to the muscles may be triangular, square, rectangular, sinusoidal, partial sinusoidal, and/or sawtooth, etc.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some aspects, the electrical pulses are synchronized and/or altered in response with body signals of the user. For example, the pulses are synchronized with a breathing cycle, heart rate&#x2014;ECG reading, movements, and/or a body position of the user. For some such applications, the system comprises a sensor for sensing the body signals, and a control processor comprising processing circuitry for synchronizing the pulses that are applied to the muscles through the electrodes, in a manner that is based on the sensed body signals.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some aspects the system comprises a sensor for sensing breathing of the user, and the electrical pulses are synchronized with the respiratory cycle such that the electrical pulses are generated based on the input from the sensor during a specific phase of the respiratory cycle. For example, the pulses are generated and applied to the muscle during the inhalation phase of the respiratory cycle.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some aspects, synchronizing the stimulation pulses with the respiratory cycle and heartbeat of the user (systolic/diastolic cycles) provides optimization of oxygen consumption for maximum muscle effort, thereby maximizing training and fat burn. Typically, oxygen levels in the blood are controlled by the respiratory cycle and by the heartbeat cycle. Synchronizing between electrical stimulation of muscle and the level of oxygen in blood (that is fed to the muscles) is believed by the inventors to increase the level of muscle stress that can be achieved as well as energy consumption of the muscles. Unlike the natural process occurring when muscles are operated willingly by the user, proper timing with maximum oxygen level, as provided by use of the system in accordance with some applications of the present invention, can be externally controlled by synchronizing the muscles stimulation pulses with breathing and heart rate.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some aspects, the system comprises a piezoelectric respiratory sensor in signal communication with the control processor and the pulse generator. The breathing cycle typically effects deformation of the piezoelectric respiratory sensor and a signal is generated by the sensor in response to the user's breathing. Typically, the control processor comprises circuitry configured to receive the signal from the respiratory sensor to determine when the onset of inhalation is occurring and cause the pulse generator to generate an appropriately timed pulse to the muscles through the electrodes, so that the system will stimulate the muscles during inhalation.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some aspects the piezoelectric respiratory sensor (or any other sensor) is coupled to a garment or belt worn by the user. The garment or belt is typically placed across or around a body portion, e.g., a chest of the subject. Typically, deforming forces on the piezoelectric sensor in accordance with the respiratory cycle of the user, generates a signal indicative of the respiratory phase.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some aspects the system further comprises a sensor for sensing additional body parameters of the user, such that application of the electrical stimulating pulses is additionally or alternatively changes in accordance with the body parameters. For example, application of the pulses is synchronized with a heartbeat rate of the user, oximeter readings, and/or motion of the user (e.g., as determined by an accelerometer).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some aspects, the heartbeat rate and respiratory cycle information of the user is sensed by an ECG sensor. In some aspects, at least a pair of the electrodes placed on the skin of the user is configured for sensing ECG signals. Typically, the control processor is configured to identify phases of the respiration cycle based on the input from the ECG sensor and drive the pulse generator to apply the pulse through the stimulating unit during inhalation. In some aspects, the system comprises at least a first pair of electrodes configured to monitor ECG signals and a second pair of electrodes configured to apply electrical pulses to cause contraction of the muscles. In other words, according to an aspect of the invention the system comprises at least two electrodes for stimulating muscles by transmitting electrical pulses in synchronization with the respiration cycle of the user and a heartbeat rate of the user, and at least two electrodes monitor ECG signals in between transmitting the stimulating electrical pulses.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some aspects of the present invention the system further comprises a vacuum source and the method additionally comprises applying vacuum to the skin to increase blood vessel dilation and blood perfusion in superficial layers of the body. Since superficial blood vessels in muscle tissue, skin and fat are not at full diameter, they may exhibit limited flow rates. Decreasing atmospheric pressure by applying vacuum typically increases blood vessel dilation and blood flow leading to enhanced fat burn and energy consumption.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some aspects of the present invention, the system further comprises a heat source for heating the skin and superficial tissue of the user in the vicinity of the muscle designated for treatment thereby increasing metabolism and energy consumption contributing to fat burn and enhancing the EMS treatment. In some aspects one or more of the electrodes are heated to provide heating of the skin and superficial tissue.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some aspects of the present invention a method is provided for non-invasively electrically stimulating muscles. In some aspects, the method comprises ramping up the electrical pulses to a passive pre-strained muscle. For example, training of a passive strained muscle can be performed by generating current pulses in specific sequences via at least first and second groups (e.g., arrays) of three or more electrodes placed in contact with the skin of the user. For such applications, the first group of electrodes stimulates the muscle to a specific level of strain and the second ramps up the stimulation to a tolerable level.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some aspects the method further comprises measuring a parameter of the tissue as indication of effectiveness of the EMS treatment in accordance with some applications of the present invention. For example, effectiveness is measured by monitoring the muscle conductivity (via the stimulation electrodes, in time sequence with the stimulation pulses) and/or accelerometers (maximizing muscle movement) and/or piezoelectric sensors mounted in a belt (maximizing tension force), and/or calorie burn. Feedback may be displayed on a screen or monitor (e.g., by displaying the caloric expenditure).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In accordance with an alternative aspect of the present invention, the muscles are stimulated by High-Intensity Focused Electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology (indirect contact with the skin). For such applications, an applicator comprising a magnetic coil is placed on the skin at the treated area and stimulate the muscles by generating and inducing intensive focused electromagnetic field.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Reference is first made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which is a block diagram of the transmission of stimulation, information, and instructions, in system <b>200</b> for electrical muscle stimulation, in accordance with some applications of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for some applications, system <b>200</b> comprises: (a) a stimulating unit <b>206</b> for applying stimulating pulses for stimulating muscles (and/or nerves innervating the muscles) of the user; (b) a sensing unit <b>202</b> for measuring physiological parameter of the user (e.g., mechanical, electrical and optical), and generating an output sensing signal in response to the measuring; and (c) a control processor unit <b>204</b> operably coupled to sensing unit <b>202</b> and to stimulating unit <b>206</b> and configured to use the output from sensing unit <b>202</b> to modulate stimulation parameters (e.g., the intensity and/or the pattern of stimulation, and/or duration of stimulation) applied to the user by stimulating unit <b>206</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Sensing unit <b>202</b> typically comprises one or more sensors <b>30</b> configured to sense a physiological parameter of the user, typically during a training session, and generate an output in response thereto. The output is typically further processed by a sensing processor such that a clean sensing signal is used to adjust of the stimulation based on the measured physiological parameter. For example, sensing unit <b>202</b> comprises one or more of the following sensors: an ECG sensor <b>32</b>, a sensor <b>36</b> for detecting breathing of the user (e.g., a piezoelectric sensor), a Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor <b>34</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Alternatively, or additionally, sensing unit <b>202</b> may comprise any other sensor, e.g., a sensor for measuring blood oxygenation and heart rate (e.g., a SPO2/PPG sensor), an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor, and/or a motion sensor (e.g., an accelerometer).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The one or more sensors <b>30</b> may be coupled to the user using electrodes (e.g., in the case of the ECG and or the GSR sensors), and/or placed against the user's skin (e.g., as in the case of a PPG sensor), and/or coupled to a garment (e.g., as in the case of a piezoelectric sensor that measures chest movements of the user).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The output from sensing unit <b>202</b> is received by control processor <b>204</b> which comprises a sensing processor. Typically, the signal processor registers the output signal received from sensing unit <b>202</b> and in turn provides sensing unit <b>202</b> with power and/or control signals as needed (e.g. provides sensing unit <b>202</b> with defining parameters for operation such as sample rate and/or dynamic range). For some applications, the signal processor additionally comprises processing circuitry for processing the output signal from sensing unit <b>202</b> to derive parameters of the user that can be used by control processor <b>204</b> to control application of the stimulation to the user by stimulating unit <b>206</b>. For example, the parameters of the user that can be derived from processing the output signal from the sensing unit are:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0093">Heart rate&#x2014;derived, for example, from the ECG, and/or PPG signals.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0094">Heat Rate Variability (HRV)&#x2014;derived, for example, from the ECG signal.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0095">Heart-beat phase (systolic/diastolic)&#x2014;derived, for example, from the ECG signal.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0096">Breathing rate&#x2014;derived, for example, from the piezoelectric sensor signal.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0097">Respiratory cycle phase (inhalation/exhalation)&#x2014;derived, for example, from the piezoelectric sensor signal.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0098">Skin resistance as an indication of stress or discomfort&#x2014;derived, for example, from the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0099">Blood oxygenation and heart rate&#x2014;derived from the SPO2/PPG sensor, for example.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0100">Muscle reaction to stimulation-derived, for example, from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0094" num="0101">Control processor <b>204</b> processes the signal from sensing unit <b>202</b> to generate a control signal that is received by stimulating unit <b>206</b> causing stimulating unit <b>206</b> to generate and apply stimulation to the user based on the instructions of control system <b>204</b>. Thus, depending on the measured parameter by sensors <b>30</b> of sensing unit <b>202</b>, a control signal is received by the pulse generator <b>90</b> of stimulating unit <b>206</b>, which in turn generates pulses applied to the user via the electrodes and is configured to vary one or more stimulation pulse parameters depending on the control signal from control processor <b>202</b>, without active input from the user.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0102">Additionally, or alternatively, control processor <b>204</b> comprises a user interface <b>205</b> having a display such as a screen and/or at least one input means. User interface <b>205</b> allows the user, as well as a physician or a trainer, to view progress of the muscle stimulation and adjust the stimulation settings accordingly.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0103">For some applications, control processor <b>204</b> and user interface <b>205</b> are configured such that the user (or a physician or a trainer) can select a muscle stimulation treatment protocol from a selection of predefined treatment protocols. The treatment protocol is typically selected according to the area of application of the stimulation, user physique and treatment goals. A treatment protocol may be defined by a time series of stimulation intensities and or patterns. Additionally, or alternatively, a treatment protocol may be defined by parameters such as a time series of a desired heart rate, comfort levels, and/or muscle activity. These parameters may be mapped onto the optimal stimulation series by control processor <b>204</b> in accordance with some applications of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0104">For some applications, control processor <b>204</b> is configured to assess calorie expenditure of the user. Typically, the calorie expenditure of the user is assessed based on statistic algorithms that use information derived from the measured physiological parameters of the user taken together with the intensity of the electrical stimulation applied to the user. For example, the output sensing signal generated by sensing unit <b>202</b> together with a known intensity of the estimation is used to calculate the caloric expenditure (kCal/min+total), and muscle work (kj/min) of the user. This information may be displayed to the user via user interface <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0105">As described hereinabove, sensing unit <b>202</b> comprises a breathing sensor in accordance to some applications of the present invention. For some applications, control processor <b>204</b> is configured to identify specific phases in a breathing cycle based on the input from the breathing sensor. Typically, the phases of the breathing cycle are identified by an algorithm for detecting a breathing phase. The algorithm is based on a model that learns the user's breathing pattern morphologies using pattern recognition and machine learning tools in a manner that allows identification of the breathing phase regardless of background noise.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0106">For some applications, control system <b>204</b> is configured to automatically (i.e., without user input) adjust at least one parameter of the muscle stimulation applied to the user in response to measuring physiological parameters of the user. Typically, control processor <b>204</b> comprises stimulation adaptive controller software configured to maximize a measured parameter and/or follow a predetermined time series of values of the measured parameter. For example, control processor <b>204</b> aims to maximize the mechanical contraction effect of the electrical muscle stimulation or follow a times series of heart rate values of the user. In order to ensure safety of the application of the electrical muscle stimulation, the stimulation adaptive controller software is configured to follow a set of limitations, e.g., limiting current of stimulation, rate of contractions (per time unit), level of discomfort, and/or maximal intensity of stimulation. Typically, in order to calculate and perform a safe and effective control of the stimulation, taking into account the training goal and the limitations, control processor <b>204</b> uses machine learning methods on the recorded signals (stimulations parameters, measured physiological signals, electrode sensor output) to create a mathematical model of the relationship between the stimulation parameters (e.g., frequency of pulse, shape of pulse, and/or timing of pulse) and the resulting muscle reaction (first order effects) and the greater effect of stimulation on discomfort and/or heart rate (second order effects).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0107">The machine learning algorithm may be a non-linear regression for estimating a small number of parameters (e.g., 5-10 parameters) in a model-based algorithm or it may be a more complex neural network-based algorithm in a model-free estimation type of algorithm.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0108">Once an estimation of a first and second order effect of the stimulation is generated, control processor <b>204</b> (e.g., using the adaptive controller software), is configured to use the inverse of such a model to calculate an optimal control protocol to ensure safety of the user together with maximal efficiency of the stimulation treatment. For some such applications, at the start of the stimulation treatment, control processor <b>204</b> goes into &#x201c;fast learning mode&#x201d; in which control processor <b>204</b> operates in two modes: (a) a high adaptivity mode in which the internal parameters that limit the extent of model adaption are set to allow a high level of change in a short time period; and (b) an exploratory stimulation mode. In the exploratory stimulation mode system <b>200</b> performs a series of stimulations (e.g., causes application of exploratory stimulation pulses to the muscles (e.g., of different intensity/duration/shape of pulses)) for learning the relationship between the applied pulse and the parameters of the subject measured by the sensors and processed by the control processor, thereby generating an optimal control protocol for each user.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0109">Reference is still made to control processor <b>204</b>. For some applications, control processor <b>204</b> is configured to assess a level of discomfort of the user resulting from the applied muscle stimulation. Typically, the level of discomfort is determined by a discomfort estimation algorithm that uses features derived from the physiological signals obtained from the user by the one or more sensors (e.g., heart rate, HRV, GSR, and/or breathing rate) to estimate the user's discomfort level. Control processor <b>204</b> is configured to change a parameter of the stimulation applied to the user based on the assessed level of discomfort (e.g., lower the intensity or duration of the simulation pulses or discontinue the stimulation. For some applications, control processor <b>204</b> is configured to maximize the stimulation that is applied to the user yet while not exceeding a maximal level of discomfort of the user. In such cases, control processor <b>204</b> generates an internal model of a reasonably expected discomfort level per a certain stimulation intensity. This model typically adapts over time given that discomfort levels generally decrease over time when a generally constant stimulation intensity is applied as the user grows accustomed to the stimulation and the muscle's response is reduced due to localized muscle fatigue.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0110">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> which is a graph modeling discomfort of the user during use of the system for electrical muscle stimulation, in accordance with some applications of the present invention. Typically, a model of the discomfort of the user is constructed by measuring the correlation between the stimulation and the consequent discomfort levels. Given this correlation, control processor <b>204</b> estimates the user's discomfort levels as a result of the stimulation treatment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows that following an initial increase in user discomfort levels (B) at the start of the stimulation treatment (A), discomfort levels decrease as stimulation continues and the user adjusts to the stimulation. Given the constant stimulation, the correlation between stimulation and discomfort (C) will also decline. For some applications, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, once the correlation declines below a certain threshold, control processor <b>204</b> allows for an increase in stimulation intensity without exceeding a predetermined limit of discomfort. Control processor <b>204</b> increases the stimulation parameters leading to an increase in discomfort of the user, causing an increase in the correlation between stimulation and discomfort, setting the cycle back into the initial phase of measuring the correlation between the stimulation and the consequent discomfort levels.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0111">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-E</figref>.

For example, sensing system <b>202</b> and control processor <b>204</b> measure the muscle response and detect at least one characteristic of the stimulated target tissue. The at least one characteristic detected can be a physiological characteristic of the user, a fatigue level of a target muscle, or another characteristic related to muscle condition, performance, or reaction. For example, muscle fatigue is detected using an accelerometer which measures an amplitude of the muscle contraction. Upon detection of fatigue, system <b>200</b>, adjusts at least one parameter of an application of the stimulation by discontinuing application of current through the first subset of electrodes and activating the second subset of electrodes to allow rest of the fatigued muscle portion and stimulation of a different (generally non-fatigued) muscle portion.
