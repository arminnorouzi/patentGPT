In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident, however, that such aspect(s) may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing one or more aspects.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Discussed herein are various aspects and embodiments that relate to desirably managing (e.g., controlling) authorization and authentication with regard to accessing of a service and associated application component (e.g., an application or configuration server) by a communication device and/or an associated user. The disclosed subject matter can enhance (e.g., improve or optimize) security with regard to access to services to ensure that only communication devices and/or associated users that are currently authorized to access a service are able to access the service, enhance security of cryptographic information to ensure that private decryption keys, initialization vectors, and cryptographic algorithms are not shared with outside entities (e.g., application or configuration servers, or other unauthorized entities), enhance security of subscriber-related information (e.g., communication device and/or user-related information) to ensure that entities (e.g., application or configuration servers) are only able to access and receive certain subscriber-related information that such entities are permitted to access, while not being able to access or receive other subscriber-related information that such entities are not permitted to access, and enhance securing access to services and information (e.g., subscriber-related information) at a granular level to enable desirable implementation with internal carrier entities and external third-party entities, among other enhancements, such as described herein.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The various aspects described herein can relate to new radio, which can be deployed as a standalone radio access technology or as a non-standalone radio access technology assisted by another radio access technology, such as Long Term Evolution (LTE), for example. It should be noted that although various aspects and embodiments have been described herein in the context of 5G, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), and/or Long Term Evolution (LTE), or other next generation networks, the disclosed aspects are not limited to 5G, a UMTS implementation, and/or an LTE implementation as the techniques can also be applied in 2G, 3G, 4G, or LTE systems. For example, aspects or features of the disclosed embodiments can be exploited in substantially any wireless communication technology. Such wireless communication technologies can include UMTS, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Wi-Fi, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Enhanced GPRS, Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), LTE, Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), Evolved High Speed Packet Access (HSPA+), High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), High-Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA), Zigbee, or another IEEE 802.XX technology. Additionally, substantially all aspects disclosed herein can be exploited in legacy telecommunication technologies. Further, the various aspects can be utilized with any Radio Access Technology (RAT) or multi-RAT system where the mobile device operates using multiple carriers (e.g., LTE Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)/Time-Division Duplexing (TDD), Wideband Code Division Multiplexing Access (WCMDA)/HSPA, Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)/GSM EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN), Wi Fi, Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), WiMax, CDMA2000, and so on).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As used herein, &#x201c;5G&#x201d; can also be referred to as New Radio (NR) access. Accordingly, systems, methods, and/or machine-readable storage media for reducing interference on reference signals from other co-channel reference signals, and improving the channel estimation performance for CSI estimation and data detection, in 5G systems, and other next generation systems, can be desired. As used herein, one or more aspects of a 5G network can comprise, but is not limited to, data rates of several tens of megabits per second (Mbps) supported for tens of thousands of users; at least one gigabit per second (Gbps) that can be offered simultaneously to tens of users (e.g., tens of workers on the same office floor); several hundreds of thousands of simultaneous connections supported for massive sensor deployments; spectral efficiency that can be significantly enhanced compared to 4G; improvement in coverage relative to 4G; signaling efficiency that can be enhanced compared to 4G; and/or latency that can be significantly reduced compared to LTE.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO) technology can be employed in communication networks, wherein MIMO technology can be an advanced antenna technique utilized to improve spectral efficiency and, thereby, boost overall system capacity. Spectral efficiency (also referred to as spectrum efficiency or bandwidth efficiency) refers to an information rate that can be transmitted over a given bandwidth in a communication system.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For MIMO, a notation (M&#xd7;N) can be utilized to represent the MIMO configuration in terms of a number of transmit antennas (M) and a number of receive antennas (N) on one end of the transmission system. Examples of MIMO configurations used for various technologies can include: (2&#xd7;1), (1&#xd7;2), (2&#xd7;2), (4&#xd7;2), (8&#xd7;2) and (2&#xd7;4), (4&#xd7;4), (8&#xd7;4). The configurations represented by (2&#xd7;1) and (1&#xd7;2) can be special cases of MIMO known as transmit and receive diversity.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some cases, MIMO systems can significantly increase the data carrying capacity of wireless communications systems. Further, MIMO can be used for achieving diversity gain, which refers to an increase in signal-to-interference ratio due to a diversity scheme and, thus, can represent how much the transmission power can be reduced when the diversity scheme is introduced, without a corresponding performance loss. MIMO also can be used to achieve spatial multiplexing gain, which can be realized when a communications system is transmitting different streams of data from the same radio resource in separate spatial dimensions (e.g., data is sent/received over multiple channels, linked to different pilot frequencies, over multiple antennas). Spatial multiplexing gain can result in capacity gain without the need for additional power or bandwidth. In addition, MIMO can be utilized to realize beamforming gain. Due to the benefits achieved, MIMO can be an integral part of the third generation wireless system and the fourth generation wireless system. In addition, 5G systems also will employ massive MIMO systems (e.g., hundreds of antennas at the transmitter side and receiver side). Typically, with a (N<sub>t</sub>, N<sub>r</sub>), where N<sub>t </sub>denotes the number of transmit antennas and N<sub>r </sub>denotes the number of receive antennas, the peak data rate can multiply with a factor of N<sub>t </sub>over single antenna systems in a rich scattering environment.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Communication devices, including wireless or mobile communication devices, can utilize various communication services (e.g., voice, data, or messaging services and applications) to facilitate communication of information between communication devices or performing other desired functions. For example, communication devices can utilize rich communication services to communicate enhanced (e.g., richer or advanced) messages (e.g., voice, text, or multimedia messages; or chat messaging or group chat messaging), perform Internet protocol (IP) voice calling, perform IP video calling, or communicate content, files, or other information (e.g., communicate content or files through content sharing or file sharing; or communicate location information via location services).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">When a communication device desires to utilize a communication service, the communication device can attempt to connect to an application server (e.g., application or configuration server) that can provide or facilitate providing the communication service. It can be desirable to secure the communication service and application server to prevent undesired (e.g., unauthorized or malicious) access to the communication service and application server. It can be desirable for the application server to know (e.g., know in real time) a subscription or account status of a particular communication device and associated user (e.g., subscriber) with regard to the communication service to facilitate knowing whether the particular communication device and user are authorized to access the application server and utilize the communication service. It also can be desirable to secure subscriber-related information (e.g., subscriber identification information, subscription or account status information, or service plan information, . . . ) and security-related information (e.g., private cryptographic key, cryptographic algorithm, token-related information, or initialization vector, . . . ) from access by application servers (e.g., third-party application servers), except when access to certain subscriber-related information or security-related information is permitted. It further can be desirable to not have to create and/or manage respective (e.g., different) decryption keys, initialization vectors, and/or cryptographic algorithms specific to respective application servers or content providers (e.g., third-party application servers or content providers).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Traditionally, when a communication device desires to access a service via an application server, the communication device can receive an encrypted token from an authorization server. The communication device can provide the encrypted token to the application server to attempt to gain access to the desired service. Traditionally, the encrypted token often can include a significant amount of information, including various items of subscriber-related information (e.g., device identifier, subscriber billing address or account, service plan information, and/or other subscriber-related information), associated with the communication device and/or associated user (e.g., subscriber) to enable the application server to know whether the communication device and/or associated user are authorized to use the service, what type of services the communication device is authorized to use, where and how to bill the subscriber (e.g., user) for using such services, etc.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The application server (e.g., application or configuration server) can decrypt the encrypted token using the private decryption key, initialization vector, and decryption algorithm, and can validate, or attempt to validate, the token. The application server can use the decrypted information to determine whether the communication device and/or associated user are authorized to use the service, what type of services the communication device is authorized to use, where and how to bill the subscriber (e.g., user) for using such services, etc. However, there can be a number of the issues and drawbacks associated with including a significant amount of information, particularly subscriber-related information, in the encrypted token. One issue can be that the more information that is encrypted in the encrypted token, the more difficult in can be for an application server to suitably handle, decrypt, and/or otherwise process the encrypted token and the encrypted information therein. This can result in problems in determining whether the communication device is authorized to use the service and/or problems or delays in providing the service to the communication device, and/or can result in the application server not being able to process or suitably process the encrypted token and the communication device being denied access to the service. Certain application servers traditionally have had difficulties processing encrypted tokens (e.g., encrypted tokens that include a significant amount of information) and provisioning services to communication devices.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Another issue can be that, if the application server is not utilized to decrypt the encrypted token, or if less information (e.g., less subscriber-related information) is included in the encrypted token (e.g., to enable the application server to more easily decrypt and process the encrypted token and the included encrypted information), the application server will not have or may not have sufficient subscriber-related information to enable it to determine whether the communication device and/or associated user are authorized to use the service, what type of services the communication device is authorized to use, and/or where and how to bill the subscriber for using such services, etc. Thus, there can be undesirable issues with the traditional techniques relating to authorizing and provisioning services for communication devices and undesirable issues with not having the application server decrypt the encrypted token, including the encrypted information (e.g., subscriber-related information), and/or with the application server not having sufficient information to desirably (e.g., suitably) perform operations relating to authorizing and provisioning services for communication devices.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Still another issue can be that certain application servers (e.g., certain third-party application or configuration servers) can be less trusted or untrusted by the carrier entity that owns, manages, and/or operates the network(s) (e.g., mobility core network and/or service provider (SP) network)). Traditional techniques can enable even less trusted or untrusted application servers to have access to certain subscriber-related information of subscribers where it can be desired that such application servers not have access to that certain subscriber-related information (e.g., because such application server is not permitted to have access to such subscriber-related information and/or because such information is sensitive or confidential subscriber-related information), and/or can enable such application servers to undesirably have access to private decryption keys, initialization vectors, and/or cryptographic algorithms associated with token encryption and decryption.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Thus, traditional techniques for handling access to communication services and/or associated application servers can be undesirably inefficient, inaccurate or insufficiently accurate, or otherwise undesirable or unsuitable. Traditional techniques may allow unauthorized access to a communication service or associated application server. Also, traditional techniques for handling access to communication services can allow application servers to undesirably have access to private decryption keys and/or initialization vectors utilized during token encryption, and/or undesirably have access to subscriber-related information that an application server (e.g., a third-party application server) is not authorized to access or for which it can otherwise be undesirable to allow the application server to access. Traditional techniques also can result in problems that can cause an application server to not be able to suitably process an encrypted token (e.g., an encrypted token comprising a significant amount of subscriber-related information) or to not have sufficient subscriber-related information, and thereby not be able to desirably (e.g., suitably or acceptably) perform operations relating to authorizing or provisioning a service for a communication device. Further, traditional techniques for handling access to communication services can involve creating and/or managing different decryption keys, initialization vectors, and/or cryptographic algorithms for different application servers or content providers.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">To that end, techniques for desirably controlling authorization and authentication for access to a service (e.g., communication service) and an associated application component (e.g., an application service or configuration server) by a communication device and/or an associated user are presented. An application component can be associated with one or more services, such as, for example, rich communication services. The application component can be associated with (e.g., communicatively connected to) an authorization component (e.g., authorization server) that can desirably (e.g., efficiently, securely, and optimally) control authorization and authentication for access to the application component and associated service(s) by a communication device and/or an associated user attempting to access the application component and associated service(s). In some embodiments, the authorization component <b>112</b> can be or can comprise an open identification connect (OIDC) server.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The communication device can communicate a service request to the application component to attempt to access the application component and associated service (e.g., rich communication services). In response to the service request, the communication device can be redirected to the authorization component. The authorization component can generate an encrypted token (e.g., encrypted authentication token), which can comprise device identifier information associated with (e.g., identifying) the communication device and/or associated user, and can communicate the encrypted token, comprising encrypted device identifier information, to the communication device. The communication device can communicate the encrypted token to the application component. The application component can forward (e.g., communicate) the encrypted token to the authorization component for validation (e.g., verification) by the authorization component. The authorization component can determine whether the encrypted token is validated, and whether communication device and associated user are validated to access the application component and associated service, based at least in part on the encrypted token, a private decryption key, a cryptographic (e.g., decryption) algorithm, and an initialization vector, and based at least in part on subscriber-related information associated with the communication device and/or associated user (e.g., subscriber).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For instance, the authorization component can analyze and decrypt the encrypted token, including the encrypted device identifier information, based at least in part on the encrypted token, private decryption key, cryptographic algorithm, and initialization vector (e.g., using the private decryption key, cryptographic algorithm, and initialization vector to decrypt the encrypted token). The authorization component can determine whether the token is authenticated, and accordingly whether the communication device and/or associated user are authenticated, based at least in part on the decrypted information, including the decrypted device identifier information, obtained from decrypting the encrypted token. In some embodiments, the authorization component does not share the private (e.g., secret) decryption key, cryptographic algorithm, or initialization vector with the application component.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">If the authorization component determines that encrypted token is not authenticated (and accordingly, the communication device and/or associated user are not authenticated), the authorization component can communicate not-validated information to the application component to notify the application component that the communication device and/or associated user are not validated. In response to receiving the not-validated information, the application component can deny the communication device and/or associated user access to the service as well as access to the application component.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">If, instead, the authorization component determines that encrypted token is authenticated (and accordingly, the communication device and/or associated user are authenticated), the authorization component can access subscriber-related information (e.g., subscriber identification information, subscription or account status information, or service plan information, . . . ) in a data store (e.g., subscriber database in the data store), and can analyze the subscriber-related information to determine a subscriber or account status (e.g., active status, suspended status, terminated status, non-existent status), service(s) to which the user and/or communication device (e.g., subscriber) is subscribed and/or has an account, and/or type of service plan associated with the service, etc. For instance, the authorization component can determine the real-time subscriber or account status of the communication device and/or user so that it can be known in real time whether the communication device and/or user are authorized to access the service and application component in real time (e.g., at or substantially close to the time the communication device presents the encrypted token to the application component). Based at least in part on the results of analyzing the subscriber-related information, the authorization component can determine whether the communication device and/or associated user are authorized to access the requested service and associated application component.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In response to determining that the communication device and/or associated user are not authorized to access the service and associated application component (e.g., due to the subscriber or account status being suspended, terminated, or non-existent), the authorization component can communicate not-validated information (or not-authorized information) to the application component to notify the application component that the communication device and/or associated user are not validated or authorized to access the requested service or application component. In response to receiving the not-validated information (or not-authorized information), the application component can deny the communication device and/or associated user access to the service as well as access to the application component.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">If, instead, the authorization component determines that the communication device and/or associated user are authorized to access the requested service and application component (e.g., the subscriber or account status is active with regard to the service), the authorization component can communicate validation-related information, including a permitted portion of the subscriber-related information associated with the communication device and/or user, to the application component. The authorization component can determine the permitted portion of the subscriber-related information to which the application component is permitted to have, based at least in part on a defined trust level associated with the application component. In response to receiving the validation-related information, the application component can allow the communication device and/or associated user access to the service and the application component, in accordance with the subscriber or account status, service plan, etc., associated with the communication device and/or user.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">These and other aspects and embodiments of the disclosed subject matter will now be described with respect to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of an example system <b>100</b> that can desirably control authorization and authentication for access to an application component (e.g., an application or configuration server) and associated service by a communication device and/or an associated user, in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.
