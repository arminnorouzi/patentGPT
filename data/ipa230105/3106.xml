id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Provided is an inner string and a well system. The inner string, in one aspect, includes an inner tubular including a sidewall having a thickness (t<sub>3</sub>), the inner tubular having an orientation port extending entirely through the sidewall to provide fluid access from an interior of the inner tubular to an exterior of the inner tubular. The inner string, according to one aspect, further includes a weighted swivel located around the inner tubular, the weighted swivel including an orientation slot, the orientation slot configured to align with the orientation port to provide a pressure reading indicative of a relative location of the inner tubular to the weighted swivel.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure

The drawn figures are not necessarily to scale. Certain features of the disclosure may be shown exaggerated in scale or in somewhat schematic form and some details of certain elements may not be shown in the interest of clarity and conciseness. The present disclosure may be implemented in embodiments of different forms.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Specific embodiments are described in detail and are shown in the drawings, with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the principles of the disclosure, and is not intended to limit the disclosure to that illustrated and described herein. It is to be fully recognized that the different teachings of the embodiments discussed herein may be employed separately or in any suitable combination to produce desired results.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Unless otherwise specified, use of the terms &#x201c;connect,&#x201d; &#x201c;engage,&#x201d; &#x201c;couple,&#x201d; &#x201c;attach,&#x201d; or any other like term describing an interaction between elements is not meant to limit the interaction to direct interaction between the elements and may also include indirect interaction between the elements described.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Unless otherwise specified, use of the terms &#x201c;up,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;upward,&#x201d; &#x201c;uphole,&#x201d; &#x201c;upstream,&#x201d; or other like terms shall be construed as generally away from the bottom, terminal end of a well, regardless of the wellbore orientation; likewise, use of the terms &#x201c;down,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;downward,&#x201d; &#x201c;downhole,&#x201d; or other like terms shall be construed as generally toward the bottom, terminal end of a well, regardless of the wellbore orientation.

The dead zone may be +/&#x2212; four degrees in certain embodiments, where the alignment key (e.g., of the inner string) will dive under the muleshoe (e.g., of the outer string), instead of orienting itself within a guide slot in the muleshoe above the liner hanger (e.g., XG liner hanger). The present disclosure has further recognized that there is an issue/concern in the inability to locate the collet latch system and then pull up to install the liner hanger bushing (e.g., the donut).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Based at least in part upon the foregoing recognitions, the present disclosure has developed one or more axial and/or rotational alignment system, which allow the user to avoid this dead zone. In certain embodiments, the axial and/or rotational alignment system allows a user thereof to sense when the alignment key is within the dead zone (e.g., misaligned). In other embodiments, the axial and/or rotational alignment system allows a user thereof to sense when the alignment key is outside of the dead zone (e.g., aligned).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In at least one embodiment, the disclosure employs an orientation port and/or orientation seal(s) so that they will either: 1) seal and hold pressure while they are aligned within the dead zone, or 2) will not hold pressure while they are aligned within the dead zone. In one embodiment, the collet latch will have a collet that is not permanently supported when in the latched-in position as the current latch does. The collet may have a final setting step to &#x201c;lock&#x201d; the collet latch in the supported position. In many embodiments, the collet will be able to unsnap out of the XG's MLT groove (or another groove/feature) with a slight over-pull (e.g., 10,000-lbs). This will give the operator an indication that the Collet Latch was indeed located within the MLT groove/feature and not hanging up on something else in the wellbore. Once other operations have been performed, one or both features (pressure-indication and re-latching feature) may be employed to re-latch the collet latch with full assurance that the alignment key is in proper alignment and the collet latch is located at the proper depth (e.g., in the MLT Groove). Other features, additions, embodiments may become apparent in taking in the details below.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, illustrated is a well system <b>100</b> designed, manufactured, and operated according to one or more embodiments of the disclosure, and including a pressure indication alignment system (not shown) designed, manufactured, and operated according to one or more embodiments of the disclosure.
