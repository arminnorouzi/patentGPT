These services allow multiple persons to work distributed from each other in various locations, and as they collaborate, they work in a virtual environment hosted by technologies that enable the users to create and share data. A baton passing protocol is sometimes employed where whichever participant is &#x201c;holding the baton&#x201d; (i.e., they have presenter rights) can perform various actions with respect to the data (e.g., documents) in the virtual environment. However, the baton passing protocol can be inefficient since passing of the baton each time to a new user can be time consuming.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, which are not necessarily drawn to scale, and wherein:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a system for providing a collaborative environment for multiple communication devices;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref> depict an illustrative embodiment of a communication device operating in the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and providing feedback information and event management;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a system for providing a collaborative environment for multiple communication devices including connection adjustments and event management;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a method used in portions of the systems described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>5</b></figref> to provide presentation feedback;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a method used in portions of the systems described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>5</b></figref> to facilitate event management in the CSCW environment;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a communication device operating in the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>5</b></figref> where event management is provided;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a communication system that provides media services including a collaborative environment with event management, presentation feedback and/or connection adjustments;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a communication device; and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a diagrammatic representation of a machine in the form of a computer system within which a set of instructions, when executed, may cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methods described herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The subject disclosure describes, among other things, illustrative embodiments for establishing a Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) environment that enables multiple users to generate or otherwise cause events to occur in the CSCW environment.

No. 14/700,729, filed Apr. 30, 2015, by Riecken et al. entitled &#x201c;Apparatus and Method for Providing a Computer Supported Collaborative Work Environment.&#x201d; All sections of the aforementioned application(s) are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a system <b>100</b> that provides for content collaboration, such as via a CSCW environment that enables a user to know when local changes made at the user's device are presented at other devices. System <b>100</b> can include a group of communication devices <b>116</b> that participate in a communication session that establishes the CSCW environment. Any number of communication devices <b>116</b> and any type of communication devices can be utilized in system <b>100</b>, including desktop computers, laptop computers, tablets, mobile phones, set top boxes, televisions and so forth. In one embodiment, a conference server <b>130</b> can be utilized to manage all or a portion of the CSCW environment over a network <b>132</b>. The conference server <b>130</b> can be a single computing device, such as a centralized or a dedicated server, or can be a number of devices, such as in a distributed control environment. In one embodiment, the conference server <b>130</b> can be a network device. In another embodiment, the conference server can be a user device, such as one of the communication devices <b>116</b> that is a participant in the CSCW environment and also manages some of the aspects of the CSCW environment. In one embodiment, the conference server <b>130</b> can be in communication with a database <b>135</b> which is populated with persistent state information of multimedia actions and events occurring in the CSCW environment.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the conference server <b>130</b> can setup, manage, and/or breakdown multiparty virtual multimedia working rooms/sessions that support input from multiple participants (via devices <b>116</b>) who generate (simultaneously or separately) input events (e.g., typing, editing, drawing, dragging, and so forth). In one embodiment, the input events can be serialized to create partial orderings of the work activities generated by the participant devices <b>116</b>. In one embodiment, a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) protocol, such as operated by FIFO server components of the conference server <b>130</b>, can be employed which serializes a diversity of input events from the participant devices <b>116</b>. In one embodiment, the events can be a diversity of different multimedia processes to be performed.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The conference server <b>130</b> can perform functions <b>162</b> (such as via execution of a set of machine-readable instructions) which include managing feedback of some or all actions being performed by some or all participants in the CSCW environment and/or supporting baton passing and/or non-baton passing protocols in the CSCW environment. In one embodiment, all actions performed by any of the participant devices <b>116</b> in the CSCW environment (e.g., which adjust the collaborative presentation) can be monitored for presentation at all of the devices and feedback can be provided to one or more the devices <b>116</b>, such as the source device that generated the particular adjustment to the content.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">System <b>100</b> can deliver anytime-anywhere multimedia communication services between groups of participants working together. Multiple participants, via devices <b>116</b>, can work in the same or various locations. As the participants collaborate, they can work in a virtual environment (i.e., the CSCW environment) that enables the participants to create, modify and/or share work artifacts (e.g., documents, designs, execution of software applications, and so forth). In one embodiment, system <b>100</b> can employ a baton passing protocol whereby whichever participant is &#x201c;holding the baton&#x201d; indicating that they have presenter rights, can perform various actions (e.g., create, edit, save, delete, and so forth) on the documents and applications present in the CSCW environment. In another embodiment, system <b>100</b> enables all or some of the participants to perform all or some of the legal actions associated with the CSCW environment without &#x201c;holding the baton&#x201d; such that there is no need for a baton granting presenter's rights. Thus participants at their discretion can elect when they wish to work with a baton passing protocol or not. This provides greater flexibility and efficiencies in team interactions; for example, tasks can be parallelized during meetings. It can also be observed that participants would be able to perform and work together in a more natural setting, typical to a real-world situation.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, the conference server <b>130</b> can manage feedback delivered to an individual performing an action and/or all or some of the other participants observing the action. The conference server <b>130</b> can serialize sets of inputs occurring from the multiple actions being performed (e.g., simultaneously) by participants at the devices <b>116</b>. The conference server <b>130</b> can process the input of multiple actions in a FIFO manner which enables organizing the observed outcome of multiple simultaneous actions in a serialized result observed by all participants.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">System <b>100</b> can provide feedback for an individual who performs an action (e.g., typing a sentence, drawing a line, presenting a PowerPoint slide, and so forth). In one embodiment, as the individual makes an adjustment to the CSCW environment (e.g., introduces a PowerPoint slide, draws a line on a document currently in the work environment, and so forth), completion of the action requires feedback that the action was performed correctly on the individual's local device and feedback that the result(s) of the action were propagated and presented (or otherwise performed) correctly on all the participants' devices.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, immediate feedback for the user performing the action on their local device can be provided and feedback indicating when the results of the action appear on all the participants' local devices is monitored and then presented at the local device (i.e., the source device that made the change to the CSCW environment). For example, a user can draw a line, type a character, write with digital ink and so forth and the visual result of drawing or typing on the local device of that user is immediate without delay, thus providing a natural environment for the user.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">System <b>100</b> also accounts for latency introduced in propagating the results of the action to the various remote participant devices. Feedback can be provided as to when the remote participants can view the actions performed. For example, when a participant introduces a new PowerPoint slide to the CSCW environment, this participant can determine when to discuss the slide once the feedback mechanism indicates that the slide has been transmitted and is viewable on the remote devices of the other participants.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, communication device <b>116</b>A is illustrated in which content (an image or a drawing of an automobile) is illustrated. The content can be presented by all of the devices <b>116</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The user of communication device <b>116</b>A makes an adjustment <b>216</b> to the content, which in this case is changing the shape of the back end of the automobile. As adjustment <b>216</b> is inputted into communication device <b>116</b>A (e.g., via a keyboard, mouse, stylus, or any other user input) it is presented immediately or in real time at the display of communication device <b>116</b>A so that the user can see the changes as they are being made. In one embodiment, the adjustment <b>216</b> is initially presented in a first format (e.g., as a dashed line) as a non-presentation indicia <b>250</b> to indicate that the adjustment <b>216</b> has not yet been presented at one or more other devices (e.g., <b>116</b>B, <b>116</b>C, <b>116</b>D) that are participating in the CSCW environment.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, once the adjustment <b>216</b> has been presented at the one or more other devices (e.g., <b>116</b>B, <b>116</b>C, <b>116</b>D) that are participating in the CSCW environment then the adjustment <b>216</b> can be presented in a second format (e.g., as a solid line) as a presentation indicia <b>350</b> to indicate that the adjustment <b>216</b> has been presented at the one or more other devices. This example describes the format change as being broken lines to solid lines, but the format changes can be of various types including color changes, font changes, size changes, motion changes (e.g., jittering line to stable line), blinking changes, and so forth. In one embodiment, the presentation of the presentation indicia <b>350</b> to indicate that the adjustment <b>216</b> has been presented at the one or more other devices can be done only after the feedback from the communication devices <b>116</b>B-D indicates that the adjustment <b>216</b> has been presented at all of the devices <b>116</b>B-D. In another embodiment, the non-presentation indicia <b>250</b> and the presentation indicia <b>350</b> can include a range of formats to indicate which of the communication devices <b>116</b>B-D has been presented the adjustment <b>216</b>. For example, the initial non-presentation indicia <b>250</b> can be multi-colored (e.g., different portions of the adjustment <b>216</b> having different colors) with each of the colors representing one of the other devices <b>116</b>B-D. As the adjustment <b>216</b> is presented at each of the other devices <b>116</b>B-D, the corresponding color for that particular device can be changed to black. Once the adjustment <b>216</b> has been presented at all of the communication device <b>116</b>B-D, the entire adjustment <b>216</b> can be black representing that all of the devices have presented the adjustment <b>216</b>. In one embodiment, a color code can be presented so that the user of communication device <b>116</b>A knows which devices have or have not presented the adjustment <b>216</b>. This particular example is described with respect to utilizing multiple colors, but the exemplary embodiments can be utilize other format changes, such as blinking of the light at variable speeds (e.g., faster blinking indicating fewer devices have presented the adjustment <b>216</b> and faster blinking indicating more of the devices have presented the adjustment <b>216</b>. In this example, the speed of the blinking can be indicative of the number of devices <b>116</b>B-D that have presented the adjustment <b>216</b>, although the identity of those devices may not be presented to the user of communication device <b>116</b>A. In other embodiments, the changing of the format (e.g., over a range of formats such as the multi-color example above) can identify which of the communication devices <b>116</b>B-D have presented the adjustment <b>216</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, communication device <b>116</b>A is illustrated in which the adjustment <b>216</b> to the content is illustrated (e g , immediately when the user of device <b>116</b>A inputs the adjustment) and a group of feedback icons <b>450</b> are presented to indicate whether the adjustment has been presented at the other devices <b>116</b>B-D. In this embodiment, the feedback indicia is separate feedback icons for each of the other communication devices <b>116</b>B-D participating in the CSCW environment. The icons <b>450</b> can identify the particular users of each of the devices <b>116</b>B-D and/or can be distinct from each other so as to identify the particular device <b>116</b>B-D. The icons <b>450</b> can change to indicate presentation or a lack of presentation of the adjustment <b>216</b>, such as having a line through the icon when the adjustment has not yet been presented but removing the line once the presentation has been performed by the particular other device. Other changes in the icon can be used to signify a presentation or a lack of presentation of the adjustment <b>216</b>, such as changing from red to green colors.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment, the icons <b>450</b> can also provide other information associated with the particular device <b>116</b>B-D (e.g., established connection, type of device, bandwidth, and so forth). In another embodiment, the icons <b>450</b> can be a selectable link to enable other operations associated with the CSCW environment, such as selecting an icon of a device that is having difficulty receiving and presenting adjustment <b>216</b> so that the server <b>130</b> can determine if another connection is available for that particular device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one or more embodiments, system <b>100</b> can employ multimedia application device drivers to perform various operations including: performing multimedia actions (e.g., drawing) on the local client device of the originating participant performing the multimedia action; performing a feedback-multimedia-action on the local client device of the originating participant who performed the initial multimedia action where the feedback communicates to the originating participant that the initial action has been transmitted and presented to the remote participants on their remote client devices; performing the necessary functions to transmit and present to all remote participants in a CSCW working session a multimedia action performed by a participant; and/or performing history functions by maintaining persistent state information of the sequence of all events/actions occurring during a CSCW working session.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, system <b>500</b> is illustrated in which communication devices <b>116</b>A-D participate in a CSCW environment that is being managed in whole or in part by conference server <b>130</b>. Upon determination of a failure to present the adjustment <b>216</b> at device <b>116</b>D, the conference server <b>130</b> can attempt to adjust the connection <b>519</b> that the device is utilizing for the CSCW environment. The adjustment of the connection can include adjusting parameters of the connection (e.g., bandwidth, network resources, and so forth) and/or can include establishing another connection <b>520</b> for the communication device <b>116</b>D.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a method <b>600</b> used to establish and/or facilitate providing a shared environment (e.g., a CSCW environment) for multiple communication devices, such as devices <b>116</b>A-D. Method <b>600</b> can provide feedback of all actions being performed by all participants in a CSCW environment, and can support baton passing and/or non-baton passing protocols in the CSCW environment.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Method <b>600</b> can allow all participants to freely perform all legal actions without &#x201c;holding the baton&#x201d; so that there is no need for a baton granting presenter's rights. Thus participants at their discretion can elect when they wish to work with a baton passing protocol or not. This provides greater flexibility and efficiencies in team interactions; for example, tasks can be parallelized during meetings. It can also be observed that participants would be able to perform and work together in a more natural setting, typical to a real-world situation. Method <b>600</b> can also provide feedback to: (1) an individual performing an action and/or (2) all the other participants observing the action.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Method <b>600</b> can begin at <b>602</b> where a communication session is established over a network between a group of communication devices, such as devices <b>116</b>A-D. At <b>604</b>, local adjustments can be monitored, such as by the conference server <b>130</b>. For example, adjustment data can be received by the conference server <b>130</b> which was generated by a first communication device (e.g., device <b>116</b>A) according to user input at the first communication device. The adjustment data can be representative of an adjustment made by the first communication device to content (e.g., drawing a line in a diagram, adding a slide, recording audio, and so forth) according to the user input to generate adjusted content. The content can be presented by the group of communication devices at display devices as part of the CSCW environment.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">At <b>606</b>, feedback can be obtained indicating which of the other devices have presented the adjustment to the content. For example, the conference server can be in communication with the other devices and can receive feedback (e.g., from the other devices once the adjustment has been presented by the other devices (e.g., individually from each of the other devices). At <b>608</b>, feedback signal(s) can be provided to the device that generated the content adjustment (e.g., conference server <b>130</b> transmitting a feedback signal to the communication device <b>116</b>A). The feedback signal can be indicative of completion of the presentation of the content adjustment at the other devices.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">At <b>610</b>, a determination can be made as to whether the content adjustment has been presented at all of the other communication devices. If so, method <b>600</b> can return to <b>604</b> to continue monitoring for content adjustments. If one or more of the other communication devices has not presented the content adjustment, then at <b>612</b> the conference server can attempt to make connection adjustments for those particular communication devices, such as establishing other connections.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, a determination that feedback information has not been received from a particular communication device can be according to expiration of a time period. In another embodiment, the CSCW environment can be managed according to a first-in-first-out protocol. In one embodiment, the providing of the feedback signal(s) enables the device which is the source of the content adjustment to present a feedback indicia that includes changing a presentation format of the adjusted content, where the presentation format comprises a color, a font, a size, a motion, a blinking, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a method <b>700</b> used to establish and/or facilitate providing a shared environment (e.g., a CSCW environment) for multiple communication devices, such as devices <b>116</b>A-D. Method <b>700</b> can provide an efficient technique for managing events in a non-baton passing protocol in the CSCW environment. Method <b>700</b> can allow all or some of the participants to freely perform all or some of the legal actions without &#x201c;holding the baton&#x201d; so that there is no need for a baton granting presenter's rights. Method <b>700</b> can be combined in whole or in part with all or portions of method <b>600</b>, such as to provide feedback to: (1) an individual performing an action and/or (2) all the other participants observing the action.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Method <b>700</b> can begin at <b>702</b> where a communication session is established over a network between a group of communication devices, such as devices <b>116</b>A-D. The communication session can be a CSCW environment employing a non-baton passing protocol. At <b>704</b>, local events can be monitored, such as by the conference server <b>130</b>. The local events can be any type of an event that alters or adjusts the CSCW environment including adjustments to the content, adding new content, moving a pointer, navigation changes (e.g., rotation of the view), and other CSCW environment changes. For example, communication device <b>116</b>A may begin to draw (a first event) resulting in content adjustment <b>216</b> being presented at the display device of communication device <b>116</b>A. Communication device <b>116</b>B can be initiating a second event, such as changing a slide that is being shown in the CSCW environment. At <b>706</b>, a determination can be made as to whether the first and second events are in conflict. If there is no conflict then the first and second events can be provided to the other communication devices for presentation. However, in this example, since communication device <b>116</b>A is trying to draw on the content of the presented slide while communication device <b>116</b>B is trying to replace that particular slide with another slide, a conflict does exist.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">At <b>708</b>, conflict resolution can be implemented, such as by conference server <b>130</b>, to resolve the conflict between the first and second events (or any number of events) and at <b>710</b> adjustment data representing the event (which may be resolved via the conflict resolution) can be provided to the other devices of the CSCW environment. In one embodiment, the conflicting events can be events that overlap in time.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, the conflict resolution can be based on a priority determination. For example, the priority determination can be based on types of events, such as editing content taking priority over replacing the entire content with another slide with other content. A priority list can be generated (with or without user input) to assist in managing the conflict resolution, such as creating a prioritizing order for various events including content edits, content view changes, navigation in the window presenting the content, adding new content, changing a slide to show new content, adding audio, changing audio, and so forth. In another example, the priority determination can be based on the particular device causing the event, such as providing communication device <b>116</b>A with priority over communication device <b>116</b>B for all events or for designated events.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, the conflict resolution can be based on designating layers of control over the CSCW environment to the communication devices <b>116</b>A-D. For instance, communication device <b>116</b>A can be authorized to utilize a first group of control commands (e.g., content editing, adding content, and replacing a slide to provide new content) while communication device <b>116</b>B can be authorized to utilize a second group of control commands (e.g., navigating a pointer, panning, rotating and/or zooming the view of the content). In this example, the authorized control commands can be performed by one of the devices without preventing performance of the authorized control commands of the other of the devices. In one embodiment, unauthorized events (i.e., the communication device is not designated to perform the particular control command) can be prohibited at the unauthorized communication device or can be performed (in whole or in part) but not provided to the other devices, such as presenting an authorized edit of the content at the device making the unauthorized edit but not providing the unauthorized edit to any of the other devices. In another embodiment, a message or other prohibition indicia can be presented at the communication device that is attempting to make the unauthorized edit. These examples describe unauthorized edits, but the exemplary embodiments are applicable to any type of unauthorized event caused by a communication device (e.g., in response to user input) that does not have authorization to utilize the particular control command</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment, conflict resolution can be according to other techniques, such as which device initiated the event first. In another embodiment, the conflict resolution can be independent of the timing of the initiation of the events. In one embodiment, the conflict resolution can be according to a combination of techniques, such as providing different devices with authorization to perform different groups of control commands and resolving any conflicts that occur between control commands of the different groups based on a priority determination, such as editing content from a first group of control commands taking priority over rotating the view of the content from a second group of control commands</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In another embodiment, conflicted events can be cancelled or delayed. For example, a first event editing the content in one particular way may take priority over a second event editing the content in another particular way, where the first event is provided to the other communication devices for presentation and the second event is cancelled or otherwise not distributed to the other devices. In another embodiment, a first event caused by a first communication device editing the content may take priority over a second event caused by a second communication device rotating the view of the content, where the first event is provided to the other communication devices for presentation and the second event is delayed and then provided to the other devices. In this example, a third communication device may receive and present the edited content (based on the first event) and then after a particular time period the third communication device may receive and present the rotated view of the edited content.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, communication device <b>116</b>A is illustrated in which the adjustment <b>216</b> to the content is illustrated (e.g., immediately at the local device when the user of device <b>116</b>A inputs the adjustment). A first graphical pointer <b>816</b>A (e.g., any visual symbol that is manipulated via user input such as an arrow, a cross, and so forth) is presented which is controllable via user input at the communication device <b>116</b>A.
