Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to wiring devices and, more specifically, to a ground fault interrupt electrical wiring device with a USB power supply.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The proliferation of mobile devices has created a widespread need for readily available charging ports. Nearly every mobile device can be charged with a charging cable that has a USB connector on one end and a micro USB or lightning connector on the other. The need for readily available charging ports can thus be met by USB ports provided in an electrical wiring device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such electrical devices can be equipped to have ground fault protection. Ground faults occur for several reasons. First, the hot conductor may contact ground if the electrical wiring insulation within a load circuit becomes damaged. This scenario represents a shock hazard. For example, if a user comes into contact with a hot conductor while simultaneously contact ground, the user will experience a shock. A ground fault may also occur when the equipment comes in contact with water. A ground fault may also result from damaged insulation within the electrical power distribution system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A ground fault creates a differential current between the hot conductor and the neutral conductor. Under normal operating conditions, the current flowing in the hot conductor should equal the current in the neutral conductor. Accordingly, GFCIs are typically configured to compare the current in the hot conductor to the return current in the neutral conductor by sensing the differential current between the two conductors. When the differential current exceeds a predetermined threshold, usually about 6 mA, the GFCI typically responds by interrupting the circuit. Circuit interruption is typically effected by opening a set of contacts disposed between the source of power and the load. The GFCI may also respond by actuating an alarm of some kind.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the combination of a ground fault interrupt and the accompanying electromechanical assembly for separating the contacts requires considerable space within the housing of an electrical wiring device. The addition of a USB power supply for supplying power to the USB port can result in an electrical wiring device with a relatively large profile. The electrical wiring device housing must remain within certain limits to fit into a standard wall box and to avoid taking up too much space within a wall.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">But measures to more compactly fit the USB power supply together with the ground fault interrupt protective device can exacerbate heat management issues of the USB power supply and ground fault interrupt circuit, as heat-generating components are necessarily positioned near one another to minimize the profile of the electrical wiring device. More specifically, various components of the USB power supply and the ground fault interrupt circuit, such as a bridge rectifier, microcontroller or transformer, (these are only provided as example components, as the various components included can vary depending on the particular example USB power supply and ground fault interrupt circuit) produce a relatively large amount of heat. When these components are used together in a compact housing, the heat produced by each can cause the electrical wiring device to overheat.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, there is a need for a ground fault interrupt electrical wiring device with a USB charging port that is relatively compact while managing the heat of the USB power supply circuit and ground fault interrupt circuit.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The examples described herein can be combined in any way technically possible.</p><p

substrate is comprised of a material having a resistivity greater than ambient air.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an example, a first surface of the insulative substrate is disposed adjacent to the USB power supply circuit, wherein at least one component of the USB power supply circuit is seated within a recess of the insulative substrate, the recess being dimensioned to receive the at least one component.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an example, a second surface of the insulative substrate is disposed adjacent to the USB power supply circuit, wherein at least one component of the USB

hot receptacle contact and the second hot receptacle contact, wherein the neutral receptacle contact is in electrical contact with the second neutral receptacle contact by a second fixed contact bridge extending between the neutral receptacle contact and the second neutral receptacle contact, wherein the first fixed contact bridge and the second fixed contact bridge are respectively diverted

circuit comprises a transformer, wherein the second printed circuit board includes a first side and a second side, wherein the first side faces the ground fault interrupt assembly, wherein the second side faces away from the ground fault interrupt assembly, wherein the transformer is disposed on the second side of the second printed circuit board.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an example, each of the components of the USB power supply circuit are disposed on the second side.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an example, the USB power supply circuit comprises a controller and a bridge rectifier, wherein the controller is separated from the bridge rectifier of by a distance of at least 15 mm.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an example, the ground fault interrupt assembly is disposed between the USB power supply circuit and a front cover, wherein the USB power supply circuit is electrically connected to the USB receptacle by a conductive wire extending past the ground fault interrupt assembly and between the line conductor and the neutral conductor.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an example, the USB power supply circuit is in electrical contact with the hot load terminal and the neutral load terminal to receive power when the electrical wiring device is in the reset state.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an example, the USB power supply circuit is in

These features will be described in detail in this disclosure. Many of these features can be implemented independent of one another (that is, to the extent technically possible, certain examples of protective device <b>10</b> can employ some of these features but not others). Further, many of these features can be employed to minimize the profile or to manage heat in electrical wiring devices besides protective device <b>10</b>; indeed, many can be employed outside of an electrical wiring device with both a ground fault interrupt assembly and a USB power supply and USB port. For example, many of these features can be employed in any ground fault interrupt electrical wiring device (where a USB power supply and USB port are omitted), likewise many of these features can be employed in any electrical wiring device having an DC power supply and charging port (rather than only a USB power and port). Further, although many of these inventive features are shown with a particular example of a ground fault interrupt assembly, many of these features can be used in any suitable ground fault interrupt assembly, as appropriate for the particular ground fault interrupt assembly used.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Certain structural and functional aspects of embodiments of the present invention are similar to embodiments of the protective wiring device described and illustrated in U.S. application Ser.

Both the USB PCB <b>302</b> and the electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> are disposed within an interior compartment of housing (e.g., within back body <b>14</b>).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts perspective view of ground fault assembly <b>200</b>, USB PCB <b>302</b>, together with hot line contact arm <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>, neutral line contact arm <b>104</b>-<b>2</b>, hot line terminal <b>102</b>-<b>1</b>, neutral line terminal <b>102</b>-<b>2</b>, hot load terminal arm <b>202</b>-<b>1</b>, neutral load terminal arm <b>202</b>-<b>2</b>, and spacer <b>301</b>. As shown, electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> is positioned some distance D from USB PCB <b>302</b>. Distance D generally ensures that the ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> is electrically insulated from the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b>. To minimize the size of distance D, and thus minimize the profile of protective device <b>10</b>, an insulative substrate <b>301</b> can be positioned between electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> and USB PCB <b>302</b>. The insulative substrate <b>301</b> can be formed of any suitable material having a resistivity greater than that of the ambient air&#x2014;e.g., rubber, plastic&#x2014; and can thus be thinner than the width of an air gap required to insulate the ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> from the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b>. In an alternative example, rather than using insulative substrate <b>301</b>, electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> and USB PCB <b>302</b> can be separated only by the air gap, although this will require a slightly larger profile of protective device <b>10</b> as the air gap must be larger than the thickness of insulative substrate <b>301</b> in order to ensure that electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> and USB PCB <b>302</b> are electrically insulated.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">It should be understood that in certain examples, some of which are described below, there may be some electrical communication between ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> and USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> (e.g., to supply the AC mains voltage to the USB power supply circuit). It should thus be understood that, for the purposes of this disclosure, maintaining electrical insulation between the ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> and USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> entails preventing electrical contact between the respective circuits, except from connections that are designed to occur. Stated differently, the insulative substrate <b>301</b> is positioned to prevent unwanted electrical contact that would otherwise occur between the components of the stacked ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> and USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, to further minimize the distance D between electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> and USB PCB <b>302</b>, insulative substrate <b>301</b> can define in its surface one or more recesses for receiving one or more components of either electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> or USB PCB <b>302</b>, thus permitting electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> to be positioned closer to USB PCB <b>302</b>. For example, recesses <b>301</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>301</b>-<b>3</b> can be defined within the otherwise planar surface of the insulative substrate <b>301</b> to receive components such as jumpers and solder from electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> at recess <b>301</b>-<b>3</b> or a diode from USB PCB <b>302</b> at recess <b>301</b>-<b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. This is only provided as an example, however, and it should be understood that in various alternative examples, any number of recesses can each receive any number of any types of components to ensure that electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> is positioned as close as possible to USB PCB <b>302</b> while providing insulation between the respective circuits. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> spacer <b>301</b> can be fitted to USB PCB <b>302</b> via snap fittings <b>301</b>-<b>6</b> to ensure that spacer <b>301</b> and USB power supply <b>302</b>-<b>1</b> remain held together compactly.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Both ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> and USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> employ a metal-oxide varistor (MOV) to protect against transient voltages (i.e., voltage surges) that would otherwise damage ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> or the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b>. Because the MOV is a fairly large component, in order to reduce the size of the ground fault interrupt circuit and USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> (and thus reduce the overall profile of protective device <b>10</b>), a single MOV can be commonly shared between the ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> and the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b>. Stated differently, a single MOV can be commonly disposed between the hot and neutral input terminals of both the ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> and the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> to shunt current from each in the event of transient voltage. This can be accomplished by providing electrical contact between the hot inputs of both the ground fault interrupt circuit and the USB power supply circuit and one lead of the MOV and electrical contact between the neutral inputs of both the ground fault interrupt circuit and the USB power supply circuit and the other lead of the MOV. In this way, excess current from a voltage transient present in the AC mains voltage, will be shunted by the MOV common to both the ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> and the USB power supply circuit. Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, in this example, MOV2 of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> and MOV1 of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> are implemented as the same component.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in order to electrically connect the same MOV <b>204</b> to both the ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> and the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b>, leads <b>204</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>204</b>-<b>2</b> can be permitted to extend through the electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> to USB PCB <b>302</b>, or, otherwise, from USB PCB <b>302</b> to electromechanical PCB <b>201</b>. Where the leads of the MOV <b>204</b> would normally be trimmed when the MOV <b>204</b> is soldered to either electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> or USB PCB <b>302</b>, the leads can be left untrimmed, thus spanning the distance D between the electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> and USB PCB <b>302</b>, and allowing it to make electrical contact with both ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> and USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the leads of a MOV can extend through through-holes <b>201</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>201</b>-<b>2</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>) of the electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> across distance D separating electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> from USB PCB <b>302</b>, and through the through-holes <b>302</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>302</b>-<b>2</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) of USB PCB <b>302</b>. This example further can serve the dual purpose of bringing power from the hot and neutral terminals of the ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> to the hot and neutral terminals of the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b>. Otherwise, the USB power supply circuit would require a separate connection to the hot and neutral input terminals (e.g., through tabs on hot and neutral input terminals). Further, in this example, holes <b>301</b>-<b>4</b>, <b>301</b>-<b>5</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) defined in spacer <b>301</b> can further act to guide leads <b>204</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>204</b>-<b>2</b> to USB PCB <b>302</b>, and to permit leads <b>204</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>204</b>-<b>2</b> to pass through spacer <b>301</b> to USB PCB <b>302</b> (where they would otherwise be blocked).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Alternatively, rather than employing the leads of the MOV <b>204</b>, separate conductors (e.g., wires) can be used to make common electrical contact between the MOV <b>204</b> and both the ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> and the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b>. For example, MOV <b>204</b> can be soldered to one of the ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> and the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> and connected by a wire to the other.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">To further manage the heat produced by various components of the USB supply circuit, at least one component of the USB supply circuit can be positioned on a side of the USB PCB <b>302</b> facing away from electromechanical PCB <b>201</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, certain components of the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> are positioned on the side of the USB PCB <b>302</b>, i.e., on the side labeled <b>302</b>B, facing away from electromechanical PCB <b>201</b>. This placement of USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> components functions to manage the heat produced by those components by situating the USB PCB <b>302</b> between the heat-generating components and the electromechanical PCB <b>201</b>, thus thermally insulating the components of USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> from the components of the ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b>. In addition, this positioning of the components of the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> increases the distance between the components of the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> and the components of the ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, only certain components&#x2014;e.g., those that generate the most heat&#x2014;are positioned on side <b>302</b>B. For example, transformer <b>1102</b> (designated as T<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) can be positioned on side <b>302</b>B alongside various other components. However, as shown, other heat-generating components, such as bridge rectifier <b>1103</b> (designated as BR<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>), and controller <b>1104</b> (designated as U<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>), are situated on side <b>302</b>A. These components are not positioned on side <b>302</b>B in order to space them from transformer <b>1002</b> and to better manage spacing on USB PCB <b>302</b>, where there is limited surface area to position components. In alternative example, all components of USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> are positioned on side <b>302</b>B in order to space them from the components of ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Likewise, some or all components of the ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> can be positioned on side <b>201</b>A of electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> facing away from USB PCB <b>302</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, certain components of the ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> are faced toward USB PCB <b>302</b>; however, in alternative examples, some of these components, or all of these components, can be positioned on the opposite side of electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> in order to increase the distance between the components of the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> and the ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> and to position the electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> as a thermal insulator.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Furthermore, the components on a single side of USB PCB <b>302</b> and electromechanical PCB <b>201</b> can be spaced to spread the heat generated across the PCB rather than concentrating it in one place. This can be seen, for example, by the relative positions of bridge rectifier <b>1103</b> and controller <b>1104</b>, which are spaced across side <b>302</b>A of USB PCB <b>302</b> to avoid concentrating the heat generated by each in a single location. In an example, the bridge rectifier <b>1103</b> and controller <b>1104</b> can be spaced by a distance of at least 15 mm to spread the heat generated across USB PCB <b>302</b>. (In an example, a distance of 20 mm was shown to effectively spread the heat generating components across the surface of the USB PCB <b>302</b>.)</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">To further manage heat, various components of protective device <b>10</b> can be comprised of materials having a thermal conductivity of at least 35% IACS. Such components can be, for example, hot line terminal <b>102</b>-<b>1</b>, neutral line terminal <b>102</b>-<b>2</b>, hot contact arm line <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>, neutral contact line arm <b>104</b>-<b>2</b>, hot load terminal arm <b>202</b>-<b>1</b>, neutral load terminal arm <b>202</b>-<b>2</b>, and jumpers <b>201</b>-<b>3</b>. The material can, for example, be <b>7025</b> brass (which has a conductivity of 40% IACS), although it is conceivable that other materials could be used.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a perspective view of the protective device <b>10</b> shows the separator <b>16</b>, hot receptacle terminal <b>22</b>-<b>1</b>, neutral receptacle terminal <b>22</b>-<b>2</b>. As shown, hot receptacle terminal <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> includes a fixed contact bridge <b>22</b>-<b>12</b> and neutral receptacle terminal <b>22</b>-<b>2</b> includes fixed contact bridge <b>22</b>-<b>22</b>. The fixed contact bridge <b>22</b>-<b>12</b> serves to provide electrical contact between the hot outlet receptacle contacts <b>22</b>-<b>10</b>, and fixed contact bridge <b>22</b>-<b>22</b> serves to provide electrical contact between the neutral outlet receptacle contacts <b>22</b>-<b>20</b>. Thus, by placing hot receptacle terminal <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> in electrical contact with hot line contact arm <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> (and hot load terminal arm <b>202</b>-<b>1</b>) and by placing neutral receptacle terminal <b>22</b>-<b>2</b> in electrical contact with neutral line contact arm <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> (and neutral load terminal arm <b>202</b>-<b>2</b>), the AC mains voltage will exist between the hot outlet receptacle contacts <b>22</b>-<b>10</b> and the neutral outlet receptacle contacts <b>22</b>-<b>20</b> as long as the protective device <b>10</b> is in the reset state. Once the protective device <b>10</b> enters the tripped state and trip mechanism <b>203</b> interrupts electrical contact between the hot line contact arm <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> and hot receptacle terminal <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> and between neutral line contact arm <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> and neutral receptacle terminal <b>22</b>-<b>2</b>, the hot receptacle terminal <b>22</b>-<b>1</b> and the neutral receptacle terminal <b>22</b>-<b>2</b> will cease to be powered.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In order to further reduce the profile of protective device <b>10</b> fixed contact bridge <b>22</b>-<b>12</b> and fixed contact bridge <b>22</b>-<b>22</b> can be diverted toward the sidewalls of back body <b>14</b> (i.e., at an angle perpendicular to or oblique to axis A-A), allowing USB receptacle PCB <b>303</b> (and consequently, USB receptacles <b>303</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>303</b>-<b>2</b>) to be disposed between fixed contact bridge <b>22</b>-<b>12</b> and fixed contact bridge <b>22</b>-<b>22</b> and, thereby, to be seated deeper in within back body <b>14</b>. Stated differently, by diverting the fixed contact bridge <b>22</b>-<b>12</b> and fixed contact bridge <b>22</b>-<b>22</b> toward the sidewalls of housing&#x2014;between hot outlet receptacle contacts <b>22</b>-<b>10</b> and neutral outlet receptacle contacts <b>22</b>-<b>20</b>&#x2014;fixed contact bridge <b>22</b>-<b>12</b> and <b>22</b>-<b>22</b> can be disposed to the sides of electromechanical assembly <b>200</b>, and thus do not contribute to the profile of protective device <b>10</b>. In the example shown, the diverted fixed contact bridge <b>22</b>-<b>12</b> and fixed contact bridge <b>22</b>-<b>22</b> can each be diverted toward a respective sidewall of back body <b>14</b>, such that no other components are positioned between the diverted fixed contact bridge <b>22</b>-<b>12</b> and the sidewall of back body <b>14</b> and between fixed contact bridge <b>22</b>-<b>22</b> and the sidewall of back body <b>14</b>.

The protective device <b>10</b> includes a differential transformer <b>1002</b> which is configured to sense load-side ground faults, i.e. ground faults located in loads connected to load terminals or receptacle contacts. Transformer <b>1004</b> is configured as a grounded neutral transmitter that is configured for grounded-neutral fault detection. Both differential transformer <b>1002</b> and grounded-neutral transformer <b>1004</b> are electrically coupled to the fault detector U<b>1</b>. Detector U<b>1</b> receives power from half wave rectification diode D<b>1</b>, inputting power to Vs pin <b>3</b> of detector U<b>1</b> and further processed by internal regulation circuit. The output of the detector U<b>1</b> is connected to the control input of SCR Q<b>1</b>. When SCR Q<b>1</b> is turned ON, the solenoid coil K<b>1</b>A is energized to actuate the trip mechanism <b>203</b> such that the trip mechanism <b>203</b> opens and switch K<b>1</b>B closes. Solenoid coil K<b>1</b>A remains energized for a time period that is typically less than about 25 milliseconds. When the trip mechanism <b>203</b> trips, the line terminals are disconnected from their respective load terminals or receptacle contacts. After the fault condition has been eliminated, the trip mechanism <b>203</b> may be reset by way of reset button <b>17</b>. MCU U<b>2</b> provides additional functionality to monitor detector U<b>1</b>. MCU U<b>2</b> is responsible for self-test, miswire detection and indicating status. Unlike detector U<b>1</b> which only receives power and operates within the positive half cycles, MCU U<b>2</b> has power and functions throughout the entire line cycle (positive and negative). This is accomplished via half wave rectification diode D<b>4</b> and voltage regulator Q<b>5</b>, R<b>5</b>, D<b>5</b>, C<b>12</b>, where C<b>12</b> provides storage during the negative half cycle. MCU U<b>2</b> controls FET Q<b>2</b> during self-test via Test GFCI node, where drain of Q<b>2</b> is provided with a positive DC voltage via multiple IO via MCU U<b>2</b>. Various other IO of MCU U<b>2</b> are utilized for basic yet essential standard MCU practices such as zero cross ZC monitoring, system power availability via RST node, programming nodes, etc. Some aspects of self-test and miswire test of MCU U<b>2</b> will be described in detail below, with reference, as appropriate, to related patents. Other aspects of MCU U<b>2</b> are known and do not require a detailed explanation here.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The differential transformer <b>1002</b> includes a secondary winding which is coupled to the fault detector U<b>1</b> accompanied by noise filtering circuitry. The differential transformer <b>1002</b> senses the current differential between the hot and neutral conductors and provides a sensor signal to the ground fault detector U<b>1</b> via the (IN&#x2212;, IN+) inputs. When the differential current (sensor signal) exceeds a predetermined threshold value, the fault detector U<b>1</b> should cause the SCR output to go HIGH.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The grounded neutral transmitter <b>1004</b> is configured to detect a grounded neutral condition. (The line neutral conductor is typically grounded in the electrical circuit at the panel&#x2014; this does not constitute a grounded neutral fault condition). The neutral transmitter <b>1004</b> is configured to couple equal signals into the hot, neutral and self test (3rd wire) conductors. Because the differential transformer <b>1002</b> is configured to sense a current differential, the equal signals provided by the grounded neutral transmitter <b>1004</b> effectively cancel each other out. On the other hand, a grounded neutral condition does occur when the load neutral conductor (i.e., the conductor that is connected to the load neutral terminal or the neutral receptacle contact) is accidentally grounded. This creates a parallel conductive path (relative to the neutral return path) between the neutral line terminal and neutral load terminal. As a result, another signal circulates around this current loop and is coupled onto the neutral conductor (but not the hot conductor) to create a differential current. The differential transformer <b>1002</b> senses the differential current between the hot and neutral conductors and the detector U<b>1</b> generates a fault detection signal to actuate SCR Q<b>1</b>, energize solenoid coil K<b>1</b>A and trip the trip mechanism <b>203</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Any suitable AC/DC power supply circuit may be used as the USB power supply circuit. An example of such a power supply circuit is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> as USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b>. In this example, the input AC mains voltage is received at terminals AC<b>1</b> and AC<b>2</b>. USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> converts this input voltage to a 5V output voltage at terminals 5V_IN and GND. This 5V output voltage is used as the bus voltage Vbus of the USB type A receptacle. This output voltage is only provided as an example potential output voltage. Indeed, various types of USB connectors are designed to supply different voltages and thus, in alternative examples, USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> can be designed to supply the voltage in keeping with the standard types of USB connectors employed in protective device <b>10</b>. Alternatively, a separate output DC/DC output stage can be employed to further condition of the output of USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> in keeping with the requirements of the type of USB receptacle employed.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> receives the AC mains input signal which is rectified and filtered via bridge rectifier BR<b>1</b>, capacitors C<b>20</b>, C<b>3</b>, and inductor L<b>2</b>. The rectified and filtered signal is input to transformer T<b>1</b>. Controller U<b>1</b> which, in an example, is a Power Integrations INN3165C power supply controller, operates in secondary side sensing and regulation the feedback signal appearing at pin <b>3</b> through the voltage divider of R<b>14</b> and R<b>15</b>. U<b>1</b> contains an integral switching device (e.g., a MOSFET). While controller U<b>1</b> keeps MOSFET ON, current in the primary winding of transformer T<b>1</b> increases. During this time, current is prevented from flowing through the secondary winding of transformer T<b>1</b> by MOSFET Q<b>1</b>, which is controlled by controller U<b>1</b> (MOSFET Q<b>1</b> serves as a secondary side rectifier. Generally, the MOSFET Q<b>1</b> is preferred to the traditional diode due to its much lower on-state voltage, which results in less power loss and an increase in overall efficiency.) Once the controller turns the integral MOSFET OFF, it, at the same time, turns MOSFET Q<b>1</b>. The energy stored in the primary winding from the MOSFET ON-time is transferred to the secondary winding of T<b>1</b>, which charges output filter capacitor C<b>14</b>. (Capacitor C<b>22</b> provides additional high-frequency attenuation.) Once controller U<b>1</b> again turns the integral MOSFET off, the load current is supplied from the output filter capacitor C<b>14</b>. The integral MOSFET, transformer T<b>1</b>, and MOSFET Q<b>1</b> together form a variant of a flyback converter. The snubber circuit, consisting of diode D<b>1</b>, resistor R<b>6</b>, capacitor C<b>18</b>, and resistor R<b>21</b> effectively clamps the voltage and suppresses ringing on the drain of the MOSFET.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As described above, various output stages can be incorporated to further condition the output of USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> for powering a Type-A or Type-C USB circuit. In addition, various controllers can be employed to communicate with the connected device as a dedicated charging port. For example, in addition to the above, a Texas Instruments TPS2513A dedicated charging port controller can be employed to monitor USB data voltage and automatically provide the correct electrical signatures on the data lines for charging.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As described above, USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> can, as described above, receive power from a MOV commonly shared between the ground fault interrupt circuit <b>1000</b> and the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b>. Alternatively, tabs on the hot line terminal <b>102</b>-<b>1</b> and neutral line terminal <b>102</b>-<b>2</b> can be in electrical contact with and supply power to the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b>. Both of these methods for supplying power to the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b>, place the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> in electrical contact with the line-side of protective device <b>10</b>. This is generally desirable, as it ensures that the high frequency switching of the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> will not cause nuisance trips of the trip mechanism <b>203</b>. In an alternative example, however, USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> can receive power from the load-side of protective wiring device (e.g., from tabs disposed at the ends of hot load terminal arm <b>202</b>-<b>1</b>, neutral load terminal arm <b>202</b>-<b>2</b>). While USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> is already NEC class <b>2</b> power supply, which supplies acceptable protection from electric shock, by supplying power to the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b> from the load-side, the USB power supply circuit <b>1100</b>, and consequently the USB receptacles, will be disconnected from power in the event of a trip, providing redundant protection methods.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Although a dual-USB dedicated charging port example is described in this disclosure, it should be understood that protective device <b>10</b> can include any number of USB ports.
