The ability to prepare food for a customer during the delivery process can ensure that the customer receives the food in an optimal condition. However, preparing food during the delivery process can be complex because different food items require different types of preparation, different types of cooking instruments, and different amounts of time to complete the preparation. Preparing multiple food items and for multiple customers in different locations further increases the complexity. Considering these variables, coordinating the preparation of multiple types of food to optimize speed and to ensure the food is delivered in an optimal condition can be challenging. Accordingly, an efficient system for coordinating the preparation of food items for delivery would be beneficial.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one example embodiment, a computer-implemented system can comprise a computing system onboard a mobile kitchen vehicle.

The examples described herein are in the context of a food preparation and delivery system that uses mobile kitchen vehicles. The mobile kitchen vehicles can receive customer orders for food items and chefs can prepare the food items using inventory and cooking systems onboard the mobile kitchen vehicle. A chef software application operating on an onboard computing system assists the chef in the preparation of the food items.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The chef software application can analyze numerous variables and devise an optimal schedule and sequence of instructions for preparing food items so that food is delivered to customers more quickly and with higher quality. The chef software application can analyze preparation instructions associated with multiple food items in multiple customer orders in determining the optimal sequence and schedule for a chef to perform each task in preparing the food items. The chef software application's analysis can also consider the multiple cooking systems available onboard the mobile kitchen vehicle and allocate the use of those cooking systems when there are multiple food items requiring the same cooking system. Preparation steps requiring more time can be started earlier, such as before the mobile kitchen vehicle departs for the next customer location. Additionally, because the chef software application can analyze multiple food items and multiple customer orders, the chef software application can look ahead at future orders and begin work on tasks requiring more time. In determining preparation schedules, the chef software application also can consider routing and customer location information to estimate when the mobile kitchen vehicle will arrive at the next customer location as well as future customer locations. Optimizing the timing for preparing each food item facilitates delivering the food items to the customer promptly after they are prepared so that the customer receives food in a hot and/or fresh condition.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The chef software application supports the work of the chef onboard the mobile kitchen system by allowing the chef to focus on the current cooking tasks that are to be completed. In other words, the chef software application allows the chef to avoid being overwhelmed with instructions for multiple orders containing multiple food items while at the same time trying to evaluate numerous variables relating to available cooking systems, preparation times for different items, and estimated times for arriving at multiple customer locations. The chef software application can display the current preparation instructions on which the chef can focus and can avoid burdening the chef with all of the other data the chef software application evaluates in devising preparation schedules. Allowing the chef to focus on the food items currently being prepared allows the chef to produce a higher quality product for the customer.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the following paragraphs, the foregoing and other advantages of the disclosed embodiments will become more apparent. Particular embodiments will be described in further detail by way of example with reference to the drawings. In the description, well-known components, methods, and/or processing techniques are omitted or briefly described. Furthermore, reference to various feature(s) of the embodiments is not to suggest that all embodiments must include the referenced feature(s).</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Control Computing System and Mobile Kitchen Management System</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a block diagram is provided illustrating the architecture of an example food preparation and delivery system <b>100</b>. The system <b>100</b> comprises a control computing system <b>105</b> (also referred to as a remote computing system) and mobile kitchen vehicles <b>170</b> and <b>180</b>. While only two mobile kitchen vehicles <b>170</b> and <b>180</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> for simplicity, it should be understood that the system is scalable and is designed to support many more mobile kitchen vehicles. The mobile kitchen vehicles communicate with the control computing system via a network <b>150</b> that can include one or more of a cellular mobile network, a wide area network, and the Internet. Additionally, customers can communicate orders for food items via network <b>150</b>, or an alternate communications network, to the control computing system <b>105</b>. The customers can communicate orders using a customer device <b>140</b> or <b>141</b>, such as a mobile telephone, a smart phone, or a personal computer. While only two customer devices <b>140</b>, <b>141</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> for simplicity, it should be understood that the system is designed to support a large number of orders from a multitude of customer devices.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The example control computing system <b>105</b> comprises several subsystems illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The subsystems can be implemented as software, hardware, or a combination of software and hardware. Additionally, the subsystems can be implemented as software executing on the control computing system or they can be implemented as software or services implemented on separate or other remote computing systems in a distributed manner. While the subsystems illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are shown as discrete subsystems of the control computing system <b>105</b>, it should also be understood that in some examples the subsystems can be combined with each other or with other subsystems not illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The subsystems of control computing system <b>105</b> include an order system <b>110</b> that receives orders for food items from customer devices. The order system <b>110</b> can include a user interface that receives information, queries, and food item selections from customer devices. The user interface of the order system <b>110</b> also can display on the customer devices available menu items based on the inventory onboard mobile kitchen vehicles near the customer's location as well as displaying an estimated time of delivery.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The order system <b>110</b> hands off customer orders to the mobile kitchen management system <b>112</b>, which manages the assignment of orders to and communications with mobile kitchen vehicles <b>170</b>, <b>180</b>. As one example, the mobile kitchen management system <b>112</b> can include a chef application <b>114</b> and an assignment application <b>115</b>. The assignment application <b>115</b> can retrieve data regarding the available mobile kitchen vehicles, their locations, their currently assigned customer orders, and their current inventory. The assignment application <b>115</b> can use the retrieved data to make assignments of new customer orders to mobile kitchen vehicles. For example, the assignment application <b>115</b> can identify mobile kitchen vehicles that are within a certain distance of a customer and that have the food items identified in the customer's order in onboard inventory. The assignment application <b>115</b> can select from among the identified mobile kitchen vehicles a mobile kitchen vehicle best suited to fulfill the customer order. Criteria for selecting a mobile kitchen vehicle can include proximity to the customer and the number of customer orders already assigned to the mobile kitchen vehicle. The assignment application <b>115</b> also can use the inventory data to determine when mobile kitchen vehicles need to be replenished with new food and supplies.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As will be described further below, the chef application <b>114</b> can analyze the customer orders assigned to a particular mobile kitchen vehicle, determine a preparation schedule for the food items in the customer orders, and present preparation instructions to a chef onboard the mobile kitchen vehicle. In addition to the assignment application <b>115</b> and the chef application <b>114</b>, the mobile kitchen management system <b>112</b> can include other applications such as an image processing system that receives images from the mobile kitchen vehicles. For example, one or more cameras onboard the mobile kitchen vehicles can capture images associated with the food prepared onboard the mobile kitchen vehicle and those images can be transmitted via network <b>150</b> to the image processing system for use in supervising the preparation of the food items.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Additional example subsystems of control computing system <b>105</b> include a customer care system <b>120</b> and a finance system <b>122</b>. The customer care system <b>120</b> can communicate with customer devices regarding reviews of food preparation and food delivery services and can address quality or service matters. The finance system <b>122</b> can manage the processing of payments from customer devices. Although not shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, control computing system <b>105</b> can include other subsystems such as business analytics subsystems that support or improve the food preparation and delivery system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the food preparation and delivery system <b>100</b> can also include one or more databases <b>160</b>. The one or more databases <b>160</b> can store data used in connection with the foregoing subsystems such as the location, inventory, and assigned orders data associated with the various mobile kitchen vehicles. The databases <b>160</b> can also include data associated with customers such as order history or customer preferences that can be used to optimize the experience for the customers.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Mobile Kitchen Vehicle and Chef Application</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a more detailed view of example mobile kitchen vehicle <b>170</b>. The mobile kitchen vehicle <b>170</b> comprises a vehicle with subsystems including food storage systems <b>230</b>, cooking systems <b>240</b>, and an onboard computing system <b>205</b>. The onboard computing system <b>205</b> can include a processor <b>210</b>, memory <b>212</b>, a communications interface <b>215</b>, a user interface <b>211</b>, and storage device <b>213</b>. The components of the onboard computing system <b>205</b> are described in further detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The storage device <b>213</b> can store software that supports one or more persons, such as a chef or other personnel, working onboard the mobile kitchen vehicle <b>170</b>. For example, the software can include a driver application <b>216</b> that assists a worker in navigating the mobile kitchen <b>170</b> to customer locations, commissaries, or supply replenishment centers.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The software also can include a chef application <b>214</b> that receives customer orders for food items, analyzes the customer orders, and provides a chef onboard the mobile kitchen <b>170</b> with instructions for preparing food items. The onboard computing system <b>205</b> can receive customer orders for food items from the mobile kitchen management system <b>112</b> via a communications network. In one example, the chef application is distributed in that it comprises a front end and a back end wherein the back end is chef application <b>114</b> of mobile kitchen management system <b>112</b> and the front end is chef application <b>214</b> stored on onboard computing system <b>205</b>. The back end <b>114</b> and front end <b>214</b> of the chef application can communicate via network <b>150</b> allowing the chef to receive instructions for customer orders and to provide updates regarding the preparation of the customer orders. For instance, chef application <b>114</b> at the back end can receive customer orders from the assignment application <b>115</b> and can analyze the preparation instructions associated with food items in the customer orders to create a preparation schedule. The chef application <b>114</b> can transmit the preparation instructions and preparation schedule to chef application <b>214</b> at the front end for displaying to the chef via user interface <b>211</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In alternate embodiments, the chef application can have other configurations. For example, the analysis of the food preparation instructions and generation of a preparation schedule can be performed at the chef application <b>214</b> at the front end. Such an approach may be preferred where the connectivity via network <b>150</b> is limited. In yet another configuration, the chef application can be stored entirely at one location, either at the control computing system <b>105</b> or the onboard computing system <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The customer orders for food items can be for one or more customers and each food item can have associated instructions for preparing the food items using the cooking systems <b>240</b>, such as an oven, a fryer, a water bath (or rethermalizer), a steamer, or a warming cabinet, onboard the mobile kitchen vehicle. The food storage systems <b>230</b> can contain the ingredients, previously prepared food items, and partially prepared food items that are used in completing the customer orders. As described further below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>4</b></figref>, the chef application <b>114</b>, <b>214</b> analyzes preparation instructions associated with food items in the customer orders and determines an optimal sequence and schedule for preparing those food items. By optimizing the sequence and schedule of the preparation, food can be prepared and delivered to the customer more quickly and efficiently. For instance, preparation steps requiring more time can be started before the mobile kitchen vehicle departs for the next customer location. Additionally, because the chef application can analyze multiple food items and multiple customer orders, the chef application can look ahead at future orders, identify tasks requiring more time, and can consider routing and customer location information in determining the optimal times to begin certain of the preparation steps. Optimizing the timing for preparing each food item also facilitates delivering the food items to the customer promptly after they are prepared so that the customer receives food in a hot and/or fresh condition.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The chef application further assists the chef by performing the analysis of these various factors that affect the preparation schedule in the background, but only presenting the chef with limited tasks that are to be performed at the present time. This approach avoids overwhelming the chef with too much information and allows the chef to focus on the immediate tasks while the chef application plans ahead for the future preparation steps of the current customer order and future customer orders. The chef application can use the user interface <b>211</b> of onboard computing system <b>205</b> to control the amount of information displayed to the chef.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The user interface <b>211</b> of the onboard computing system <b>205</b> also can include one or more input devices that the chef can use to provide input to the onboard computing system <b>205</b>. It can be advantageous if the input device does not require manual contact from the chef in order to keep the chef's hands free for food preparation. As one example, the input device can be a foot pedal that receives inputs from the chef as the chef progresses through a set of preparation instructions. As another example, the input device also can be a microphone that receives audible inputs from the chef. In yet other examples where manual contact by the chef is less of a concern, the display <b>430</b> can be a touch screen display that receives inputs from the chef.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Other systems onboard the mobile kitchen vehicle <b>170</b> can include a telematics system <b>225</b> and a camera system <b>220</b>. The telematics system <b>225</b> can be used for communications between the onboard computing system <b>205</b> and the control computing system <b>105</b>. The communications can include customer orders, status information regarding the preparation of customer orders onboard the mobile kitchen system, and data associated with the various systems onboard the mobile kitchen vehicle <b>170</b> including the cooking systems, the food storage systems, the camera systems, and the engine control system of the mobile kitchen vehicle <b>170</b>. The camera system <b>220</b> can comprise one or more cameras located within the vehicle that can be used to track the progress and the quality of the food preparation. The cameras can supply images of a food item to the onboard computing system <b>205</b> and the images can be associated with the food item that is currently being prepared. When the preparation of a food item is completed, the chef can provide an input to the onboard computing system <b>205</b> indicating that the food item is completed. The camera system <b>220</b> can capture one or more images of the completed food item in its packaging.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The packaging can include a code, such as a bar code or a quick response code, that is visible on the packaging and that is captured in the images taken by the camera system <b>220</b>. Once the camera system <b>220</b> captures an image of the completed food item with the code, the onboard computing system <b>205</b> can transmit a completion notification with an associated image to the mobile kitchen management system <b>112</b> of the control computing system <b>105</b>. As described previously in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an image processing system can analyze images received from the mobile kitchen vehicle. As one example, the image processing system can identify the code in the image and read a tracking identifier embedded in the code. Alternatively, the image processing system can use the code to obtain a tracking identifier in a look-up table. Once the tracking identifier is isolated, the mobile kitchen management system <b>112</b> can link the tracking identifier to a menu item identifier for the food item that was completed. The image of the completed food item and the tracking identifier can be stored in database <b>160</b> for future use in confirming the food item was completed, for quality control, or for other purposes.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Chef Application Operations</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, and <b>4</b></figref> example methods are illustrated for coordinating the preparation and delivery of food items using the example systems previously described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. The example methods illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>4</b></figref> can include algorithms stored as computer-readable instructions in memory for execution by the various systems of the control computing system <b>105</b> and the onboard computing system <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, a method is illustrated in accordance with the example embodiments of the present disclosure. Example method <b>300</b> can begin with operation <b>302</b> wherein the chef application receives a first order and a second order from the control computing system <b>105</b>. As explained previously, the chef application can receive orders from the assignment application <b>115</b>. The first order can be associated with a first customer at a first location and the second order can be associated with a second customer at a second location, wherein the second location is different from the first location. The first order and the second order can each comprise one or more food items and preparation instructions can be associated with each food item. The preparation instructions can take various forms. As one example, the preparation instructions can include a time for preheating cooking equipment and a time for cooking the food item. The preparation instructions can also include particular ingredients to be added to the food item, methods and timing for combining ingredients, condiments to be added to the food item after cooking, and presentation or packaging instructions for the food item.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">For illustrative purposes, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> provides an example of preparation instructions <b>352</b> associated with item <b>1</b> and item <b>2</b> of the first order as well as preparation instructions <b>354</b> associated with item <b>3</b> and item <b>4</b> of the second order. For clarity, the example preparation instructions illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> are relatively simple in that they only include preheating time and cooking time for each of the food items to be cooked. However, in other examples, the other types of preparation information could be associated with each food item such as a time for combining ingredients as well as a method of combining the ingredients. The preparation instructions <b>352</b> and <b>354</b> can be considered potential preparation instructions that generally apply to each item. When a particular customer's order is considered, the customer may have customizations that modify or simplify the potential preparation instructions <b>352</b> and <b>354</b>. Referencing item <b>3</b> as one example, the cooking of a whole chicken may have several potential preparation instructions relating to pre-cooking and post-cooking seasoning as well as sauces that can accompany the whole chicken. However, when a customer places a specific order for the whole chicken, the customer will make certain customization selections that may streamline or simplify the preparation instructions. Accordingly, the preparation instructions for a specific instance of a customer order can be referred to as a line build or build instructions. As will be described further with operation <b>304</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> also illustrates a preparation schedule with build instructions associated with specific instances of food items as ordered by a customers.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring again to method <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, in operation <b>304</b> the chef application determines preparation schedules for the first order and, optionally, the second order, based on the preparation instructions <b>352</b> and <b>354</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the cooking systems available on the mobile kitchen vehicle, and timing information. The cooking systems available on the mobile kitchen vehicle may vary in that in some cases there could be multiple cooking systems, such as multiple water baths or multiple oven bays, that allow for parallel preparation of multiple items. When preparing the preparation schedule, the chef application can analyze existing preparation schedules that may already be in the process of being completed for prior orders to assess when onboard cooking systems will be available. Additionally, the chef application can communicate with the cooking systems available on the particular mobile kitchen vehicle to determine the status and availability of cooking system resources. As an example, if two food items require cooking in an oven, but only one oven is available onboard the mobile kitchen vehicle, the chef application can set the preparation schedule so that one item is cooked first and then placed in an onboard warming cabinet while the second item is placed in the oven. Accordingly, the chef application can analyze multiple orders and formulate a preparation schedule that accounts for the multiple orders for multiple customer destinations that will be prepared using overlapping preparation schedules. Alternatively, in another example that is a simpler approach, the chef application may only analyze and formulate a preparation schedule for one order at a time.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The timing information considered in operation <b>304</b> can include one or both of the estimated time of delivery as well as the estimated time of arrival at the customer's location. The estimated time of arrival is the estimated time for arrival of the mobile kitchen vehicle at the customer's location and is significant because certain preparation instructions, referred to as post-route build instructions below, cannot be executed until the mobile kitchen vehicle arrives at the customer location. The estimated time of arrival at the customer's location will occur before the estimated time of delivery in that the estimated time of delivery is the time at which the completed food items have been packaged and delivered to the customer's door or other customer location. When the customer order was processed and assigned to the mobile kitchen vehicle by the assignment application <b>115</b>, the assignment application <b>115</b> calculated an estimated time of arrival and an estimated time of delivery based on, the ordered items, the location of the customer, and other orders currently assigned to the mobile kitchen vehicle. As new information becomes available such as the completion of other existing orders or traffic patterns for the mobile kitchen vehicle's routes, the assignment application <b>115</b> can provide the chef application with updates to the estimated time of delivery.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In determining the preparation schedule in operation <b>304</b>, the chef application can apply the estimated time of arrival to the preparation instructions <b>352</b> and <b>354</b>, to identify preparation instructions that can be performed while the mobile kitchen vehicle is driving to the customer's location. In other words, these are pre-route preparation instructions because they can be commenced before the mobile kitchen vehicle begins driving the route to the first customer's location. In the example data illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the estimated driving time to the customer's location for order <b>1</b> is 10 minutes and the chef application identifies the pre-heating of the oven and water bath, both requiring 15 minutes, as instructions that can be commenced before the mobile kitchen vehicle begins the 10 minute drive to the first customer's location. Therefore, using the estimated time of arrival, the chef application can categorize preparation instructions as either pre-route preparation instructions or post-route preparation instructions.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the chef application can use the preparation instructions <b>352</b> and <b>354</b> as well as the estimated time of arrival, i.e. the estimated driving time, to create build instructions for the specific instances of the food items the customer ordered. The preparation instructions categorized as pre-route become the pre-route build instructions and the preparation instructions categorized as post-route become the post-route build instructions. The chef application assembles the collection of build instructions into a preparation schedule <b>356</b>. The preparation schedule <b>356</b> includes pre-route build instructions, driving instructions, and post-route build instructions, each of which can be displayed to the chef using the onboard computing system <b>205</b>. Because the pre-heating of the oven and the water bath require more time than the driving time, these steps can be assigned to pre-route build instructions so they can be commenced before the mobile kitchen vehicle begins driving the route to the first customer and they can continue during the drive so that the oven and water bath will be ready for cooking when the mobile kitchen vehicle arrives at the first customer location. In contrast, in the example preparation schedule <b>356</b>, the cooking of the items are placed in the post-route build instructions that are performed after the mobile kitchen vehicle arrives at the customer's location so that the items are fresh and hot when ready for delivery to the customer. As also illustrated in preparation schedule <b>356</b>, the chef application can look ahead and schedule the second customer's orders. By scheduling the second customer's orders, the chef application is able to commence the early cooking of items that require more time, such as a whole chicken and a baked potato. Looking ahead to begin cooking items that require more time allows the system to use the driving time between customers more efficiently and to complete customer orders more promptly. Accordingly, the chef application can create a preparation schedule that interleaves build instructions for multiple orders along with driving instructions.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring again to method <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, once the chef application has determined the preparation schedule <b>356</b>, in operation <b>306</b>, the chef application displays first pre-route build instructions so that the chef can begin pre-heating the oven and water bath. The chef application can display either the entire preparation schedule or only a portion of the preparation schedule such that the displayed tasks can be customized as needed to assist the chef. Additionally, the displayed driving instructions can include directions to the customer's location as well as customer-specific information such instructions for delivering the food items to a front or back door. Because the chef application also looks ahead at the second customer's order for items <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, the chef application can ensure that a sufficient number of oven bays and water baths are pre-heated for the items of both the first customer order and the second customer order. In operation <b>308</b>, in response to the build instructions, the chef application can communicate pre-heating commands to the controllers that control the oven and the water bath. Alternatively, the chef onboard the vehicle can manually set the pre-heating temperatures of the oven and the water bath. In addition to providing commands to the cooking system controllers, the chef application can receive periodic data from sensors in the cooking systems to ensure they are operating at the desired temperatures. The chef application can also monitor each of the build instructions in the preparation schedule to ensure each is completed and to ensure there is no deviation from the preparation schedule. Accordingly, in operation <b>310</b>, the chef application can receive confirmation that the pre-route build instructions are completed, such as an indication that the oven and water bath are powered on and are pre-heating. The confirmation can be in the form of a sensor reading provided to the chef application from each of the cooking systems. Alternatively, the confirmation can be in the form of an input from the chef indicating the pre-route build instructions have been completed.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In accordance with the preparation schedule, in operation <b>312</b> the chef drives the mobile kitchen vehicle to the first customer location. The driver application can assist the chef with navigation to the customer location as well as any specific delivery instructions such as delivery to a back door or other customer-specific instruction. While the mobile kitchen vehicle is proceeding to the first customer location, the chef application can continue to receive sensor data from sensors within the onboard cooking systems and can send new commands to the onboard cooking systems. For instance, if an unexpected delay occurs while in route to the first customer location, the chef application can send a command to the cooking systems to adjust the pre-heating by reducing the temperature or temporarily turning off the cooking systems. When an unexpected delay or change in scheduling occurs, the chef application also can adjust the subsequent steps of the preparation schedule so that items are cooked for the amount of time indicated in the preparation instructions. Adjusting the preparation schedule also facilitates the goal of preparing the food so that it is completed as soon as possible, but not too early such that the food's quality degrades while it sits in the mobile kitchen vehicle waiting to be delivered to the customer. In other words, it is preferable to time the cooking of food items for a customer so that the food items are completed as close as possible to the same time and when the mobile kitchen vehicle is at the customer's location so that the food items can be delivered together to the customer promptly after the cooking is completed, thereby providing the customer with the food items when they are hot and fresh.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The chef application also can receive updated information from the control computing system and make adjustments to the preparation schedule accordingly. As one example, if a customer makes a change to an order via the order system, the control computing system can relay the change to the chef application and the preparation schedule can be adjusted to reflect the change. Changes to a customer order might include exchanging one side item for another side item or modifying a customization such as a particular sauce to be used with the food item. The chef application's capability to change the preparation schedule while the operations of method <b>300</b> are being performed improves efficiency in the preparation of the food items and reduces food waste.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In operation <b>314</b>, the chef application displays the post-route build instructions. The post-route build instructions can be limited to cooking of items for the first customer. Alternatively, as illustrated in the preparation schedule <b>356</b>, the post-route build instructions can include instructions for items in the first customer's order as well as instructions for items in the second customer's order. Starting on items in the second customer's order allows for more prompt completion of items requiring more cooking time such as whole chicken or baked potato. In response to the chef application receiving confirmation that the cooking of the items identified in the post-route build instructions has begun, the chef application can set timers for each of the items to assist the chef with managing the cooking of multiple items simultaneously. The confirmation the chef application receives can be an input from the chef or can be sensor data input from one or more sensors in the cooking systems that detect placement of the food in the cooking systems. While the items in the post-route build instructions are cooking, the chef application can receive updates to customer orders, updates from the chef, and periodic data from the sensors of the cooking systems in operation <b>316</b>. Additionally, in response to these updates and sensor data, the chef application can adjust the temperatures or other settings of the cooking systems by providing commands to the controller of the cooking systems.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">When the timers lapse, the chef application can display instructions to the chef for removing the items from the cooking systems in operation <b>318</b>. Alternatively, the chef application can send a command to the cooking systems to turn down the temperature or turn off the cooking system when the timers lapse. In cases where the oven or the water bath are not going to be used again immediately, the chef application can also provide commands to turn off the cooking systems.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In operation <b>320</b>, the chef application receives confirmation, such as via an input from the chef or from a sensor in the cooking system, that the items have been removed from the cooking systems. In response, the chef application can display packaging and delivery instructions for the first customer's items.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In operation <b>322</b>, the chef application receives confirmation from the chef that the first customer's items have been delivered and transmits the delivery confirmation to the control computing system <b>105</b>. Additionally, in response to the delivery, the chef application can perform an inventory check by confirming via inputs from the chef which items and the number of items that were used in connection with the first customer's order. As one example, if food items or other supplies were dropped during the preparation, it may be the case that multiples of certain items were exhausted in connection with the first customer's order. The updated inventory data collected in the inventory check can be transmitted to the mobile kitchen management system operating at the control computing system and can be used to monitor inventory levels onboard the mobile kitchen vehicle.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, another example method <b>400</b> for coordinating the preparation and delivery of food items is illustrated. Example method <b>400</b> relates to the preparation and delivery of the second customer order that was referenced in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>. Example method <b>400</b> can continue with the preparation schedule <b>356</b> that was created in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. Beginning with operation <b>402</b>, the chef application can continue with the remaining build instructions of the preparation schedule for the second customer order. In some cases, the build instructions for the second order can be performed in parallel with or can overlap in time with the build instructions for the first order. In operation <b>402</b>, the chef application also can update the preparation schedule based on any new data available with respect to the estimated time of arrival at the second customer or changes to customer orders. For example, the actual time required to complete the first customer order or changes in traffic patterns may impact the estimated time of arrival at the second customer location. As another example, in the case where the chef previously began cooking longer term items such as a whole chicken or a baked potato, the time for completion of those items may need to be adjusted if the first customer's order required more time than expected.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In operation <b>403</b>, the chef application can check for additional orders that have been assigned to the mobile kitchen vehicle. The chef application can update the preparation schedule from method <b>300</b> to incorporate build instructions for food items of a third order associated with a third customer. Similar to the description of operation <b>304</b> provided above, the chef application evaluates estimated arrival and delivery times for the third customer, available cooking systems onboard the mobile kitchen vehicle, and the preparation instructions associated with the food items of the third order. The chef application uses the foregoing information to create build instructions for the third order that can be added to the preparation schedule. Additionally, the build instructions for the third order can affect the build instructions for the second order, such as the existence of cooking efficiencies when considering items of the second order and third order. Accordingly, in updating the preparation schedule with the build instructions for the third order, the chef application also can make adjustments to the build instructions for the second order when appropriate.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Operations <b>404</b> through <b>420</b> of method <b>400</b> are generally similar to operations <b>306</b> through <b>322</b> of method <b>300</b>, except that they apply to the preparation of items <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> for the second customer's order. Referring to operation <b>404</b>, the chef application displays the pre-route build instructions for the second order. Referencing the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, because the chef application has already begun the cooking of the longer term items and because the water bath is already pre-heated from the first customer's order, there are no pre-route build instructions other than to check on the status of the whole chicken and baked potato that are already in the process of being cooked.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In operation <b>406</b>, the chef application can check the temperature settings of the cooking systems. In operation <b>408</b>, the chef application can receive confirmation that the pre-route build instructions are completed. The confirmation can be in the form of a sensor reading provided to the chef application from each of the cooking systems such as an indication that the pre-heating has commenced. Alternatively, the confirmation can be in the form of an input from the chef indicating the pre-route build instructions have been completed. The chef application can communicate the completion of the pre-route build instructions to the control computing system <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In accordance with the preparation schedule, in operation <b>410</b> the chef drives the mobile kitchen vehicle to the second customer location. In operation <b>412</b>, the chef application displays the post-route build instructions. As illustrated in the preparation schedule <b>356</b>, the post-route build instructions are the remaining cooking instructions for items <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> of the second customer's order. In response to the chef application receiving confirmation that the cooking of the items identified in the post-route build instructions has begun, the chef application can set timers for each of the items to assist the chef with managing the cooking of multiple items simultaneously. While the items in the post-route build instructions are cooking, the chef application can receive periodic data from the sensors of the cooking systems in operation <b>414</b>. Additionally, when needed, the chef application can adjust the temperatures or other settings of the cooking systems by providing commands to the controller of the cooking systems.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">When the timers lapse, the chef application can display instructions to the chef for removing the items from the cooking systems in operation <b>416</b>. In cases where the oven or the water bath are not going to be used again immediately, the chef application can also provide commands to turn off the cooking systems.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In operation <b>418</b>, the chef application receives confirmation, such as via an input from the chef or an input of sensor data, that that the items have been removed from the cooking systems. In response, the chef application can display packaging and delivery instructions for the second customer's items.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In operation <b>420</b>, the chef application receives confirmation from the chef that the second customer's items have been delivered and transmits the delivery confirmation to the control computing system <b>105</b>. Additionally, in response to the delivery, the chef application can perform an inventory check by confirming via inputs from the chef which items and the number of items that were used in connection with the second customer's order. The updated inventory data collected in the inventory check can be transmitted to the mobile kitchen management system operating at the control computing system and can be used to monitor inventory levels onboard the mobile kitchen vehicle.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">It should be understood that the operations illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>4</b></figref> are only a representative example.
