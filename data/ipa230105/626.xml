device, system, and method for reducing cardiac valve regurgitation and, more particularly, to transcatheter device, system, and method for treatment for mitral valve regurgitation.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Mitral regurgitation is characterized by cardiomyopathy, mitral annular enlargement, and leaflet traction contributing to malcoaptation. A transcatheter mitral loop cerclage (&#x201c;MLC&#x201d;) device applies a circumferential compression to the mitral annulus by creating a loop through the coronary sinus across the interventricular septum. There is a need to have the mitral loop cerclage device to be able to maintain its position from being pushed back into the coronary sinus.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The MLC device for reducing mitral valve regurgitation comprises a first protective tube and a second protective tube. The MLC device has a cerclage rope disposed within the first protective tube and the second protective tube. The first protective tube and the second protective tube each has a proximal end and a distal end. Proximal portions of the two protective tubes are being attached side-by-side along at least a portion of the length of the two protective tubes to define a stem portion. Distal portions of the two protective tubes are being separated thereafter to define a hinge portion.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The MLC device has a stopper being attached on the distal end of the second protective tube to configure to prevent further advancement of the second protective tube into heart muscle. The cerclage rope has an arch portion arranged between the distal ends of the two protective tubes. The first protective tube has at least one anchor disposed between the hinge portion and the distal end of the first protective tube. The anchor configured to lodge into a coronary sinus and maintain the tissue protective device in place.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The first protective tube is configured to be inserted through a coronary sinus to encircle at least part of a mitral valve. The first protective tube has a preformed shape in such as way the first tube is configured to maintain the preformed shape when the first tube traverses through a coronary sinus.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The second protective tube is configured to pass through a tricuspid valve and rest against the right ventricular side of the interventricular septum. The second protective tube has a preformed shape in such as way the second tube is configured to maintain the preformed shape when the second tube traverses through the tricuspid valve. The second protective tube is rigid enough to resist being bent inward as tension is applied.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The method of treating mitral valve regurgitation in a patient by using the MLC device comprises (a) inserting a sheath introducer in a femoral vein; (b) inserting a guide catheter to engage in a coronary sinus through a femoral sheath; (c) traversing a guidewire into an interventricular septum and exiting into the right ventricular (RV) cavity; (d) placing a guidewire catcher in the right ventricular cavity through the femoral sheath and grabbing the exiting guidewire; (e) pulling the guidewire out to the femoral sheath with the guidewire catcher so that the guidewire makes up a path of the femoral vein: inferior vena cava (IVC)-coronary sinus (CS)&#x2014;right ventricular (RV) cavity&#x2014;right atrium (RA)&#x2014;inferior vena cava (IVC)&#x2014;femoral vein; (f) connecting a proximal end of the guidewire to a cerclage rope with a tension lock device; (g) replacing the guidewire with the cerclage rope in place by pulling a distal end of the guidewire; (h) advancing an MLC device through the femoral sheath over the cerclage rope with a delivery system; (i) when the MLC device is on optimal tension, securing an anchor to keep the MLC device in place; (j) when the MLC device is in place, delivering a suitable tension through the tension lock device under a guidance of real time imaging such as echocardiogram; (k) cutting the cerclage rope by a cutting device.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Features and advantages of the claimed subject matter will be apparent from the following description of embodiments consistent therewith, which description should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of the MLC device which includes a stem portion, a first tube, and a second tube;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of the MLC device which shows a hinge portion and a stopper on the second arm;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of the MLC device which shows a lumen of the stopper and a lumen of the first arm;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of a cerclage rope which includes an arch portion and an outer layer;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of a cerclage rope which includes an arch portion and an outer layer;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of the MLC device when the MLC device was advanced over the cerclage rope;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of the MLC device when the MLC device was advanced over the cerclage rope;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of the MLC device when the MLC device was advanced over the cerclage rope;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of the MLC device how the MLC device is advanced over the cerclage rope;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> depicts a procedure where coronary venography through a balloon wedge catheter identifies a basal septal perforator coronary vein through which a guidewire is advanced;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> depicts a procedure where a target-capture device is positioned into the right ventricular outflow tract to ensnare the guidewire that crossed from the coronary vein.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref> depicts a procedure where the guidewire is exchanged for tension device containing an integrated coronary artery protection element.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>D</figref> depicts a procedure where during application of tension, the protection element prevents compression of entrapped circumflex coronary artery branches;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>E</figref> depicts a procedure where in this caudal left anterior oblique projection, the mitral loop cerclage system is shown to surround the mitral annular plane;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>F</figref> depicts a procedure where the tension locking device was embedded in the left subclavicular pocket;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows the tension locking device is embedded in the left subclavicular pocket:</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of MLC device when the tension is loose;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of MLC device when the tension is applied;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> depicts the stopper is placed on the wall of the IVS;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> depicts the first arm encircles the mitral valve;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> depicts the anchor is placed on the first arm;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> depicts the anchor is placed on the first arm;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> depicts the anchor is placed on the first arm;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of the anchor,</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> depicts the anchor is placed in the coronary sinus;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> depicts preferred anchoring sites;
