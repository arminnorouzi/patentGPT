For example, an electromagnetic pump may be used to turn on and/or off a flow of a washer fluid. In addition, an electromagnetic valve may be used to switch flow paths. One flow path may be communicated to a nozzle oriented to a windshield glass. The other one flow path may be communicated to a nozzle oriented to a camera for capturing an external view from the vehicle. A small amount of the washer fluid spilled from the nozzle may cause unintended contamination on the windshield glass or the camera. In the above aspects, or in other aspects not mentioned, there is a need for further improvements in an electromagnetic valve.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the present disclosure, the electromagnetic valve is provided by an electromagnetic section and a flow path section. A sealing member is interposed between the electromagnetic section and the flow path section. The electromagnetic section and the flow path section are mechanically fixed by a member. Since the electromagnetic section and the flow path section are separated, an inflow direction of a working fluid into a flow path section and an outflow direction of the working fluid from the flow path section can be freely determined, and a degree of freedom of an outputting direction is increased. Since the electromagnetic section has no flow path for the working fluid, it is possible to reduce the electromagnetic section in size.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The electromagnetic section includes: a core which is arranged in a magnetic circuit formed at the coil is energized; a plunger which is arranged in the magnetic circuit to oppose the core via a magnetic gap; and a normally close compression spring which urges the plunger in a direction away from the core. Further, the flow path section includes: an inflow passage for a working fluid; an outflow passage for the working fluid; a movable valve member; a valve body formed between the inflow passage and the outflow passage and having a normally close valve seat on which the valve member comes in contact with; and a normally open compression spring which urges the valve member in a direction away from the normally close valve seat</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the disclosure, the contact portion of the valve member with the valve seat has a spherical shape. The valve member is held by being sandwiched between the plunger and the normally open compression spring. The plunger comes in contact with a center portion of the spherical shape of the valve member. The normally open compression spring comes in contact with a peripheral portion of the valve member. As a result, the valve member moves together with the plunger. The valve member can be reliably seated on the valve seat even if the plunger is slightly tilted.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A preferable embodiment in this disclosure may have the configurations described below. In one embodiment, a spring receiver in an annular shape is formed at an equator portion of the valve member. As a result, since it is possible to stabilize contact location to the valve member in an assembling work caused by error differences of inner diameters of the normally open compression springs and dimensional error differences of spherical surfaces of the valve members, it is possible to stabilize a load of the normally open compression springs by suppressing differences of deformations of the springs. As a result, it is possible to stabilize an urging load on the valve member when it is seated on the normally open valve seat, and it is possible to reduce concerns about liquid leakage due to insufficient urging load.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">More specifically, if the normally open compression spring comes in contact with the spherical portion of the valve member, the contact position with the valve member varies due to error of the size within the diameter tolerance of the normally open compression spring. Will occur. In the case that the diameter of the normally open compression spring is small, it comes in contact with the valve member on a side closer to a center axis of the valve member. In the case that the diameter is large, it comes in contact with on a side to an outer periphery of the valve member. On the other hand, in the case that a spring receiver in an annular shape is provided at the equator portion, error differences in diameters of the normally open compression springs can be absorbed by the spring receiver. As a result, it is possible to stabilize a spring length of the normally open compression spring, and a compressive force is kept stable.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the valve body includes two members, an upper body and a lower body. It is possible to simplify a configuration of the flow path section by forming the outflow passage and the normally open valve seat on the upper body and forming the normally close valve seat on the lower body.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the normally close valve seat and the normally open valve seat are arranged so as to face each other, and the normally close valve seat and the normally open valve seat have taper shapes corresponding to the spherical shape of the valve member. It is possible to improve a sealing performance by guiding the valve member by the taper shape portions.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, a normally open outflow passage is formed in the upper body. The electromagnetic valve of the present disclosure may be used as a normally open type on/off switchable two-way valve.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, a normally close outflow passage is formed in the upper body. The electromagnetic valve of the present disclosure may be used as a normally close type on/off switchable two-way valve.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the outflow passage includes two, the normally close outflow passage and the normally open outflow passage. The normally open outflow passage is formed in the upper body, and the normally close outflow passage is formed in the lower body. The electromagnetic valve of the present disclosure may be used as a three-way valve.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a piping configuration of an electromagnetic valve.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the electromagnetic valve of a first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of the electromagnetic valve illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a line IV-IV in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of a valve member illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a top view of the valve member illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a perspective view of a pressure relief valve member illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a top view of the pressure relief valve member illustrated in</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an electromagnetic valve of a second embodiment.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating another piping configuration of an electromagnetic valve.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an electromagnetic valve of a third embodiment.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an electromagnetic valve of a fourth embodiment.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a perspective view showing another shape of the valve member.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a front view of the valve member illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">JP2014-66309A discloses a comparative example, in which a flow path of a washer fluid is switched by using an electromagnetic valve so that the washer fluid flows to a wind glass when the electromagnetic valve is not energized and flows to a rear camera when the electromagnetic valve is energized. A coil and a yoke are arranged around a second discharge port connected to the rear camera. Therefore, a volume of the electromagnetic section including the coil and the yoke is large. Further, since a passage (second discharge port) through which the working fluid flows is formed in the electromagnetic section, an outputting direction of the working fluid is also limited.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further, as a result of the working fluid passage (second discharge port) being located at a center of the electromagnetic section, a plunger for urging the valve member toward a side to the valve seat has to be a cylindrical shape. Further, since the plunger and the valve member are integrally fixed, if the plunger is tilted, there is a concern that liquid may leak due to poor seating of the valve member on the valve seat.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In view of the above points, it is an object of the present disclosure to provide an electromagnetic valve which improve a degree of freedom of an outputting direction of the working fluid, reduces a size of the electromagnetic section, and allows reliable seating of the valve member on the valve seat regardless of an inclination of the plunger.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The first embodiment is a fluid system as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

The pressure relief spring <b>216</b> and the pressure relief valve member <b>217</b> are arranged on the pressure relief guide <b>234</b> of the upper body <b>212</b>.

As is described in a second and subsequent embodiments, the flow path section <b>240</b> may change directions of the inflow passage <b>222</b>, the normally open outflow passage <b>223</b>, and the normally close outflow passage <b>228</b>. Furthermore, the normally open outflow passage <b>223</b> or the normally close outflow passage <b>228</b> may be eliminated to make it as a two-way valve.

Therefore, it is possible to assemble the flow path section <b>240</b> after assembling the electromagnetic section <b>230</b> as described above, and it is possible to improve an ability of assemble.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Next, an operation of the electromagnetic valve <b>200</b> of the present disclosure is described.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the case that the washer fluid is injected from the nozzle <b>100</b> toward the camera <b>131</b>, the electromagnetic valve <b>200</b> is not energized. Therefore, the valve member <b>214</b> receives the urging force of the normally close compression spring <b>207</b> via the plunger <b>209</b> and closes the normally close valve seat <b>229</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">As an operation of the pump <b>120</b> is started, the high-pressure washer fluid is sent to the electromagnetic valve <b>200</b> via the pipe <b>102</b>. Pumped washer fluid flows into the inflow passage <b>222</b>, and then flows out from the normally open outflow passage <b>223</b> via the communication hole <b>226</b>, the valve chamber <b>225</b>, and the normally open valve seat <b>227</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">During this period of time, the valve member <b>214</b> is pressed against the normally close valve seat <b>229</b> by receiving the pressing pressure of the normally close compression spring and a pressure of the washer fluid. Here, even if a position of the valve member <b>214</b> is slightly displaced, a contact surface of the valve member <b>214</b> with the normally close valve seat <b>229</b> has a spherical shape, and the normally close valve seat <b>229</b> has a tapered shape, therefore, it is always guided in directions to coincide center axes. Therefore, the valve member <b>214</b> surely comes in contact with the normally close valve seat <b>229</b> and demonstrates sufficient sealing performance.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The washer fluid of the electromagnetic valve <b>200</b> is injected from the nozzle <b>100</b> via the normally open pipe <b>102</b><i>b</i>. Since the pressure of the washer fluid rises to about 400 Kilopascals, the open pressure of the stop valve <b>101</b> (about 10 kilopascals) is hardly a problem.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">If the cleaning of the camera <b>131</b> is completed, the operation of the pump <b>120</b> is stopped. Since the pressure in the pipe <b>102</b> becomes atmospheric pressure when the pump is stopped, the pipe <b>102</b> is closed by the stop valve <b>101</b>. By closing the stop valve <b>101</b>, it is possible to improve a sharp liquid shut off property in response to an end of injection. In addition, the washer fluid can be stored in the pipe <b>102</b>, and a responsiveness at the next operation can be improved.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the case that the washer fluid is injected onto the rear window glass <b>130</b>, the electromagnetic valve <b>200</b> is energized. The coil <b>205</b> is magnetized by energization to form a magnetic circuit that passes through the yoke <b>201</b>, the core <b>206</b>, the plunger <b>209</b>, and the stator <b>211</b>. The plunger <b>209</b> moves to a side to the core <b>206</b> against the compressive force of the normally close compression spring <b>207</b>, the magnetic gap between the tapered portion of the core <b>206</b> and the tapered portion of the plunger <b>209</b> is narrowed by the magnetic force.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As the plunger <b>209</b> moves, the valve member <b>214</b> is urged up by the normally open compression spring <b>231</b> to close the normally open valve seat <b>227</b>. The operation of the electromagnetic valve <b>200</b> described above is performed before the start of operation of the pump <b>120</b>. Therefore, a pressure of the high-pressure washer fluid from the pump <b>120</b> is not applied to the valve member <b>214</b>, and the movement of the valve member <b>214</b> is not hindered.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Here, since the plunger <b>209</b> has a structure in which it comes into contact with the spherical shape portion of the valve member <b>214</b> in a detachable manner, the valve member <b>214</b> may be slightly displaced when the plunger <b>209</b> is moved. In other words, the present disclosure is configured to allow some deviation of the valve member <b>214</b>. However, the valve member <b>214</b> can reliably seal the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> even if it slightly displaced in accordance with an extending action of the normal open compression spring <b>231</b>, since the valve member <b>214</b> has a spherical shape and the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> also has a tapered shape corresponding to the valve member <b>214</b>. In particular, since the valve member <b>214</b> is made of rubber, it can be brought into close contact with the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> by its own elasticity, and the sealing property can be further improved.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, since the normally open compression spring <b>231</b> comes in contact with the annular spring receiver <b>214</b><i>a </i>of the valve member <b>214</b> formed on the equator portion, it is possible to keep a predetermined pressing force. That is, if the normally open compression spring <b>231</b> came in contact with the spherical shape portion of the valve member <b>214</b>, the normally open compression spring <b>231</b> might be more compressed if it came in contact with a central portion of the valve member <b>214</b> in comparison with if it came in contact with a peripheral portion depending on error differences of the diameters thereof. On the other hand, in this embodiment, since the normally open compression spring <b>231</b> comes in contact with the annular portion, the length of the normally open compression spring <b>231</b> in the mounted state can be kept constant regardless of error differences of the diameters thereof.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">After energizing the electromagnetic valve <b>200</b> to switch the flow paths, the operation of the pump <b>120</b> is started. The high pressure washer fluid from the pump <b>120</b> flows into the inflow passage <b>222</b>, and then flows out from the normally close outflow passage <b>228</b> via the communication hole <b>226</b>, the valve chamber <b>225</b>, and the normally close valve seat <b>229</b>. The washer fluid flows out through the normally close pipe <b>102</b><i>a </i>via the stop valve <b>101</b>, and is injected from the nozzle <b>100</b> to the rear window glass <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">During this time, the valve member <b>214</b> receives the high pressure of the washer fluid and is pressed against the normally open valve seat <b>227</b>. As described above, since the spherical shape portion of the valve member <b>214</b> comes in contact with the tapered shape of the normally open valve seat <b>227</b>, the valve member <b>214</b> is guided in a direction in which the axes coincide with each other, and the valve member <b>214</b> reliably comes in contact with the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> to demonstrate sufficient sealing performance.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">When a cleaning of the rear window glass <b>130</b> is completed, the operation of the pump <b>120</b> is stopped, and when the pressure in the normally close pipe <b>102</b><i>a </i>drops below the open pressure of the stop valve <b>101</b>, the stop valve <b>101</b> is also closed. Subsequently, the energization of the electromagnetic valve <b>200</b> is also terminated. Since the washer <b>208</b> made of a non-magnetic material is interposed between the core <b>206</b> and the plunger <b>209</b>, the plunger <b>209</b> is urged down by the normally close compression spring <b>207</b> in response to a finish of energization.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Since an urging force of the normally close compression spring <b>207</b> is larger than an urging force of the normally open compression spring <b>231</b>, the valve member <b>214</b> is urged against the normally close valve seat <b>229</b>. Since the normally close valve seat <b>229</b> also has a tapered shape corresponding to the spherical shape of the valve member <b>214</b>, it can be reliably sealed as mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As described above, according to the present disclosure, the valve member <b>214</b> comes in contact with the plunger <b>209</b> in a detachable manner. The valve member <b>214</b> is in a spherical shape. The valve member <b>214</b> is arranged so as to fit within the tapered shape of the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> and the normally close valve seat <b>229</b>. Therefore, it is not necessary to provide a guide for the valve member <b>214</b>, and an assembly work of the valve member <b>214</b> becomes easy. A core axis of the valve member <b>214</b> may shift due to an influence of the normally open compression spring <b>231</b> and the washer fluid flow. Even in this case, a shifting of the valve member <b>214</b> is within a range of the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> and the normally close valve seat <b>229</b>. Therefore, the valve member <b>214</b> is urged against the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> or the normally close valve seat <b>229</b> by the normally close compression spring <b>207</b> and a pressure of the washer fluid. Both the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> and the normally closed valve seat <b>229</b> have tapered shapes. Therefore, the valve member <b>214</b> is guided by the tapered shape, and the valve member <b>214</b> comes into contact with the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> or the normally close valve seat <b>229</b> on the entire circumference thereof.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">When the ambient temperature rises while the operation of the pump <b>120</b> is completed, the washer fluid and air in the pipe <b>102</b> expand. The normally open pipe <b>102</b><i>b </i>is closed by the stop valve <b>101</b>, but since the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> is open, the pressure is released to a side to the pump <b>120</b> and does not become high. However, since both the normally close valve seat <b>229</b> and the stop valve <b>101</b> are closed in the normally close pipe <b>102</b><i>a</i>, the washer fluid is trapped in the normally close pipe <b>102</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, the pressure in the normally close pipe <b>102</b><i>a </i>may rise due to an expansion of the washer fluid and the air.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">If the pressure rises equal to or higher than the open pressure of the stop valve <b>101</b>, the washer fluid in the normally close pipe <b>102</b><i>a </i>may leak from the nozzle <b>100</b> to the rear window glass <b>130</b>. However, according to this embodiment, the pressure relief valve <b>233</b> is opened to release the pressure, so that the leakage of the washer fluid can be reliably prevented.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">If the pressure in the normally close pipe <b>102</b><i>a </i>becomes higher than the relief pressure, it lifts the pressure relief valve member <b>217</b> by overcoming an urging force of the pressure relief spring <b>216</b>. As a result, the pressure relief valve seat <b>218</b> is opened and the pressure relief passage <b>232</b> is opened. The normally close outflow passage <b>228</b> communicates with the inflow passage <b>222</b> via the pressure relief groove <b>217</b><i>a </i>of the pressure relief valve member <b>217</b> and the pressure relief guide <b>234</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Since the relief pressure of the pressure relief valve <b>233</b> is about half of the open pressure of the stop valve <b>101</b>, the pressure relief valve <b>233</b> opens before the stop valve <b>101</b> opens so that it is possible to suppress a pressure rise in the normally close pipe <b>102</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Here, since the pressure relief passage <b>232</b> releases the pressure of a trapped part of the washer fluid, a large amount of the washer fluid does not flow in the pressure relief passage <b>232</b>. Therefore, even if there is a portion having a small flow path cross-sectional area such as the pressure relief groove <b>217</b><i>a</i>, no malfunction occurs in an operation. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, three pressure relief grooves <b>217</b><i>a </i>are formed, but these are designed in a symmetrical shape around the axis to balance them, and the number of pressure relief groove <b>217</b><i>a </i>may be one in the flow path cross-sectional area.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Further, since the pressure relief valve member <b>217</b> is held by the guide <b>234</b>, even if the set pressure of the pressure relief spring <b>216</b> is small, a seal between the pressure relief valve member <b>217</b> and the pressure relief valve seat <b>218</b> is ensured.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the above embodiment, the inflow passage <b>222</b> is formed in the upper body <b>212</b>.
