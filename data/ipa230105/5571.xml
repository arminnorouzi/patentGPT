As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the following specific implementations are included.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In step <b>101</b>, first processing shown in step <b>102</b> to step <b>104</b> is performed for an initial seed.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In step <b>102</b>, M molecular structures are generated according to the seed, M being a positive integer greater than one.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In step <b>103</b>, the M molecular structures are taken as candidate molecular structures, and some molecular structures are selected from the candidate molecular structures as progeny molecular structures.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In step <b>104</b>, evolutionary learning is performed on the progeny molecular structures, the progeny molecular structures after evolutionary learning are taken as the seed, and the first processing is repeated until convergence reaches an optimization objective, when the convergence reaches the optimization objective, a newly selected molecular structure is taken as a desired molecular structure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As may be seen, in the solution according to the above method embodiment, an evolutionary-algorithm-based molecular evolution process is adopted, and a desired molecular structure can be acquired automatically through a series of processing such as cyclic iteration to gradually approach a target for optimization, which reduces implementation costs and improves processing efficiency compared with an existing manner.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">There is no restriction on how to acquire the initial seed, which may be randomly generated, for example. The initial seed is an initial molecular structure as a seed. One or more initial seeds may be provided.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">M molecular structures may be generated according to the initial seed. M is a positive integer greater than one, of which the specific value may be determined according to an actual requirement. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the M molecular structures may be generated according to the seed by hidden space (or referred to as implicit space) sampling. A hidden space refers to a data space after raw data is compressed by a neural network, generally with standard normal distribution, so as to facilitate sampling.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">There is no restriction on how to generate the M molecular structures. For example, any generation model based on hidden space sampling may be used to generate the M molecular structures by hidden space sampling. Not limited by the generation form, a model structure may be based on, for example, a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) or a Flow. A model data structure may be based on, for example, a sequence, a graph, or a 3D spatial structure.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The generated M molecular structures may be directly taken as candidate molecular structures for subsequent processing. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, for the generated M molecular structures, unqualified molecular structures may be filtered out first, and then the remaining molecular structures after the filtering may be taken as the candidate molecular structures for subsequent processing.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">There is no restriction on how to filter out the unqualified molecular structures. For example, the unqualified molecular structures may be filtered out using a pre-trained filtering model, or the unqualified molecular structures may be filtered out based on a pre-defined filtering rule.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Through the filtering, the workload of subsequent processing may be reduced, and processing efficiency and accuracy of processing results may be improved.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">For the candidate molecular structures, some molecular structures may be selected therefrom as the progeny molecular structures.

Moreover, it is assumed that, for each candidate molecular structure, a score may be determined by using a molecular activity prediction model and an oil-water distribution coefficient prediction model respectively. That is, 2 scores may be acquired respectively for each candidate molecular structure. An optimization scenario corresponding to the molecular activity prediction model is molecular structure optimization for a target, and an optimization scenario corresponding to the oil-water distribution coefficient prediction model is optimization for results of hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of molecules.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Generally, numbers and types of scores corresponding to different candidate molecular structures are the same.

For example, the P scores may be weighted and added, and calculation results may be taken as the evaluation score of the candidate molecular structure. Weights corresponding to different scores may be the same or different.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For any candidate molecular structure, the evaluation score thereof refers to an adaptability score of the molecular structure in the evolution process.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">By means of the evaluation scores, the progeny molecular structures can be screened accurately and efficiently, which lays a good foundation for subsequent processing.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the progeny molecular structures may be selected according to the evaluation scores in the following specific manners.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">1) The candidate molecular structures are sorted in descending order of the evaluation scores, and the molecular structures in the first N positions after sorting are taken as the progeny molecular structures.

In the manner 2), a subset considering both evaluation scores and molecular diversity may be selected from the candidate molecular structures by the DPP, and molecular structures in the subset are taken as the progeny molecular structures. A specific manner may be determined according to an actual requirement, which is very flexible and convenient. Specific implementation of the DPP is a prior art.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, evolutionary learning may be performed on the progeny molecular structures, so that the molecular structures mutate in anticipation of a higher evaluation score in next evolution process.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">There is no restriction on how to perform the evolutionary learning. For example, the evolutionary learning may be realized by a genetic algorithm or an evolutionary strategy.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, the progeny molecular structure after the evolutionary learning may be taken as the seed, and the first processing is repeated until convergence reaches an optimization objective.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment of the present disclosure, a hidden space corresponding to the progeny molecular structures after evolutionary learning may also be regularized, and then the first processing is repeated.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Through the regularization, a distance between a hidden space vector and a spatial origin may be shortened, preventing excessive deviation of the hidden space vector from a normal molecular data distribution center, so that the optimized molecular structure more similar to drug molecules, so as to prevent excessively strange molecular structures. How to perform the regularization is a prior art.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the convergence reaches the optimization objective, a newly selected molecular structure may be taken as a desired molecular structure, that is, as a final acquired molecular structure.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Based on the above introduction, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an overall implementation process of the molecular structure acquisition method according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a generation operation may be performed for the initial seed.
