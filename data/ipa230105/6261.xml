A secondary battery generally includes battery members such as a positive electrode, a negative electrode, and a separator that isolates the positive electrode and the negative electrode from each other and prevents short circuiting between the positive and negative electrodes.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Known secondary battery structures include a stacked structure in which a positive electrode, a separator, and a negative electrode are stacked alternately and a wound structure in which an elongated positive electrode, separator, and negative electrode are overlapped and then wound up concentrically. In particular, stacked secondary batteries have been attracting interest in recent years from a viewpoint of having excellent energy density, safety, quality, and durability.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In production of a secondary battery, a battery member having adhesive material at a surface thereof may be produced, and this battery member may then be affixed to another battery member, for example. Moreover, a battery member having adhesive material at a surface thereof can be produced by applying, onto the battery member surface, a composition for adhesion (slurry for a secondary battery) containing a polymer (binder) displaying adhesiveness and so forth that are dispersed and/or dissolved in a solvent, and then drying the composition for adhesion (for example, refer to Patent Literature (PTL) 1).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">PTL 1: JP2017-27945A</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the case of a large secondary battery that is for in-vehicle use, for example, the battery generates heat during charging and discharging, leading to the presence of sites of localized high temperature inside of the battery. On the other hand, lithium ion batteries are known to readily degrade and have shortened life at high temperature. Accordingly, since temperature non-uniformity inside a battery results in the formation of sites of localized degradation and also in deterioration of the life of the battery as a whole, there is demand for eliminating temperature non-uniformity inside batteries. (Note that the life of a battery is also referred to using the term &#x201c;cycle characteristics&#x201d; in the following description.)</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, there is room for improvement of the cycle characteristics of a conventional secondary battery such as described above because temperature non-uniformity arises inside the battery.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, an object of the present disclosure is to provide a secondary battery in which internal temperature non-uniformity is eliminated and that has excellent cycle characteristics.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The inventors conducted diligent investigation to achieve the object set forth above.

The other region Q is all regions other than the central region P at the surface Z and is a region that has an area equivalent to 90% of the area of the surface Z.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A feature of the presently disclosed secondary battery is that the resistance A per unit area of the central region P is larger than the resistance B per unit area of the other region Q. Through the resistance A per unit area of the central region P being larger than the resistance B per unit area of the other region Q in this manner, it is possible to cause the secondary battery to display excellent cycle characteristics.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although it is not clear why the secondary battery can be caused to display excellent cycle characteristics through the resistance A per unit area of the central region P being larger than the resistance B per unit area of the other region Q, the reason for this is presumed to be as follows.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Firstly, heat is generated at the surface Z through the flow of current during charging and discharging of the secondary battery. In the case of a conventional secondary battery in which a value of the resistance A per unit area of the central region P is not larger than a value of the resistance B per unit area of the other region Q, heat is generated to at least the same extent in the central region P as in the other region Q. Moreover, at the surface Z, heat can easily be released from the other region Q that is close to an end section of the surface Z but cannot easily be released from the central region P that is distant from the end section of the surface Z. For this reason, accumulation of heat in the central region P is thought to cause the temperature in the central region P to rise compared to that in the other region Q in the case of the conventional secondary battery described above, thereby resulting in the occurrence of temperature non-uniformity inside the battery and the deterioration of cycle characteristics of the secondary battery.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In contrast, as a result of the resistance A per unit area of the central region P being larger than the resistance B per unit area of the other region Q in the presently disclosed secondary battery, it is possible to reduce the current density in the central region P during charging and discharging. This makes it possible to reduce the amount of heat that is generated in the central region P. Therefore, it is presumed that since increased temperature of the central region P due to accumulation of heat can be inhibited, non-uniformity of temperature between the central region P and the other region Q can be reduced, and thus the secondary battery can be caused to display excellent cycle characteristics.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Note that the &#x201c;end section of the surface Z&#x201d; refers to a region that, in a situation in which a region that has a center at the same position as the center R of the surface Z, that has a similar shape to the surface Z, and that has an area equivalent to 90% of the area of the surface Z is taken to be a central region P&#x2033;, is a region of the surface Z other than the central region P&#x2033;.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">A ratio (A/B) of the resistance A per unit area of the central region P and the resistance B per unit area of the other region Q is required to be more than 1, is preferably more than 1.005, and more preferably more than 1.01, and is preferably less than 2, and more preferably less than 1.5. Through the ratio (A/B) of the resistance A per unit area of the central region P and the resistance B per unit area of the other region Q being more than 1, cycle characteristics of the secondary battery can be sufficiently enhanced. On the other hand, when the ratio (A/B) of the resistance A per unit area of the central region P and the resistance B per unit area of the other region Q is less than 2, output characteristics of the secondary battery can be improved.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Note that the resistance A per unit area of the central region P and the resistance B per unit area of the other region Q can be adjusted through the ratio of coverage of adhesive material in each of these regions, the type of polymer used as the adhesive material, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">[Adhesive Material]</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">An adhesive material is normally present at the surface Z (affixing surface X and/or Y).

Examples of lithium salts that can be used include LiPF<sub>6</sub>, LiAsF<sub>6</sub>, LiBF<sub>4</sub>, LiSbF<sub>6</sub>, LiAlCl<sub>4</sub>, LiClO<sub>4</sub>, CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>Li, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>9</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>Li, CF<sub>3</sub>COOLi, (CF<sub>3</sub>CO)<sub>2</sub>NLi, (CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NLi, and (C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>5</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>)NLi</p><p id="p-0229" num="0225">Of these lithium salts, LiPF<sub>6</sub>, LiClO<sub>4</sub>, and CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>Li are preferable because they readily dissolve in solvents and exhibit a high degree of dissociation, with LiPF<sub>6 </sub>being particularly preferable. One electrolyte may be used individually, or two or more electrolytes may be used in combination in a freely selected ratio. In general, lithium ion conductivity tends to increase when a supporting electrolyte having a high degree of dissociation is used.

Examples of suitable organic solvents include carbonates such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC), ethylene carbonate (EC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), propylene carbonate (PC), butylene carbonate (BC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), and vinylene carbonate (VC); esters such as &#x3b3;-butyrolactone and methyl formate; ethers such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane and tetrahydrofuran; and sulfur-containing compounds such as sulfolane and dimethyl sulfoxide. Furthermore, a mixture of such solvents may be used. Of these solvents, carbonates are preferable due to having high permittivity and a wide stable potential region.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0227">In general, lithium ion conductivity tends to increase when a solvent having a low viscosity is used.
