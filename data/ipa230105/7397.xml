num="0000">A wearable audio output device with a rotatable input mechanism outputs first audio that is based on first media and, while outputting the first audio, receives a first input via the rotatable input mechanism. In response to receiving the first input: in accordance with a determination that the first input is a first type of input to the rotatable input mechanism that includes rotation of the rotatable input mechanism, the wearable audio output device changes an audio output volume of the first audio based on the rotation of the rotatable input mechanism while continuing to output the first audio; and, in accordance with a determination that the first input is a second type of input to the rotatable input mechanism, where the second type of input is different from the first type of input, the wearable audio output device ceases to output the first audio.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="234.44mm" wi="158.75mm"

But conventional methods of providing audio outputs using audio output devices are cumbersome, inefficient, and limited. In some cases, conventional methods fail to ensure that wearable audio output devices are properly calibrated and fitted to a user's ears (e.g., so as to enable effective active noise control) and that information about the fit of the wearable audio output devices is effectively conveyed to the user. In some cases, conventional methods fail to ensure that the wearable audio output devices continue to be fitted to the user's ears as the user performs various activities over time. In some cases, limited control over audio outputs is given to inputs provided at the wearable audio output devices; for example, an input may be limited to having control over a single predefined feature of audio output, such as increasing output volume or toggling a feature on or off. In some cases, this limited control over audio outputs interferes with a user's ability to control the amount of sound that the user is able to hear from the surrounding physical environment while wearing the earbuds or earphones. In other cases, the control over audio outputs given to inputs provided at the wearable audio output devices results in undesired acoustic effects when the wearable audio output devices are not placed in both ears. Moreover, in some cases, it would be beneficial to automatically change the manner in which audio outputs are provided in response to certain types of events occurring relative to the wearable audio output devices, but conventional methods provide audio outputs in a static manner irrespective of events occurring relative to the wearable audio output devices. In some cases, user interfaces for controlling audio output settings provide too few controls, for example by providing controls for only one audio output device, thus requiring a user to provide numerous inputs and navigate through different menus or user interfaces to perform a particular operation, or provide too many controls, thus cluttering the user interface and increasing the likelihood that the user will mistakenly interact with the wrong control, particularly for implementations where display area is limited. In addition, conventional methods take longer and require more user interaction than necessary to calibrate the wearable audio output devices and control audio outputs, thereby wasting energy. This latter consideration is particularly important in battery-operated devices.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there is a need for wearable audio output devices and associated computer systems with improved methods and interfaces for determining and adjusting the fit of the wearable audio output devices and for controlling audio outputs using inputs at the wearable audio output devices. Such methods and interfaces optionally complement or replace conventional methods of calibrating audio output devices and controlling audio outputs. Such methods and interfaces reduce the number, extent, and/or nature of the inputs from a user and produce a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated systems and devices, such methods and interfaces conserve power and increase the time between battery charges.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above deficiencies and other problems associated with calibrating audio output devices and controlling audio outputs are reduced or eliminated by the disclosed computer systems and wearable audio output devices.

In some embodiments, the computer system has (and/or is in communication with) a display device, which in some embodiments is a touch-sensitive display (also known as a &#x201c;touch screen&#x201d; or &#x201c;touch-screen display&#x201d;). In some embodiments, the computer system has a graphical user interface (GUI), one or more processors, memory and one or more modules, programs or sets of instructions stored in the memory for performing multiple functions. In some embodiments, the user interacts with the GUI primarily through stylus and/or finger contacts and gestures on the touch-sensitive surface.

In some embodiments, the computer system includes a portable communications device, such as a mobile telephone, that also contains other functions, such as PDA and/or music player functions. Example embodiments of portable multifunction devices include, without limitation, the iPhone&#xae;, iPod Touch&#xae;, and iPad&#xae; devices from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif. Other portable electronic devices, such as laptops or tablet computers with touch-sensitive surfaces (e.g., touch-screen displays and/or touchpads), are, optionally, used. It should also be understood that, in some embodiments, the computer system includes not a portable communications device, but a desktop computer with a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch-screen display and/or a touchpad).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the discussion that follows, a computer system that includes an electronic device with a display device and a touch-sensitive surface is described. It should be understood, however, that the computer system optionally includes one or more other physical user-interface devices, such as a physical keyboard, a mouse and/or a joystick.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The computer system typically supports a variety of applications, such as one or more of the following: a note taking application, a drawing application, a presentation application, a word processing application, a website creation application, a disk authoring application, a spreadsheet application, a gaming application, a telephone application, a video conferencing application, an e-mail application, an instant messaging application, a workout support application, a photo management application, a digital camera application, a digital video camera application, a web browsing application, a digital music player application, and/or a digital video player application.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The various applications that are executed on the computer system optionally use at least one common physical user-interface device, such as the touch-sensitive surface. One or more functions of the touch-sensitive surface as well as corresponding information displayed on the computer system are, optionally, adjusted and/or varied from one application to the next and/or within a respective application. In this way, a common physical architecture (such as the touch-sensitive surface) of the computer system optionally supports the variety of applications with user interfaces that are intuitive and transparent to the user.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Attention is now directed toward embodiments of portable devices with touch-sensitive displays. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a block diagram illustrating portable multifunction device <b>100</b> with touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> in accordance with some embodiments. Touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> is sometimes called a &#x201c;touch screen&#x201d; for convenience, and is sometimes simply called a touch-sensitive display. Device <b>100</b> includes memory <b>102</b> (which optionally includes one or more computer readable storage mediums), memory controller <b>122</b>, one or more processing units (CPUs) <b>120</b>, peripherals interface <b>118</b>, RF circuitry <b>108</b>, audio circuitry <b>110</b>, speaker <b>111</b>, microphone <b>113</b>, input/output (I/O) subsystem <b>106</b>, other input or control devices <b>116</b>, and external port <b>124</b>. Device <b>100</b> optionally includes one or more optical sensors <b>164</b>. Device <b>100</b> optionally includes one or more intensity sensors <b>165</b> for detecting intensities of contacts on device <b>100</b> (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> of device <b>100</b>). Device <b>100</b> optionally includes one or more tactile output generators <b>167</b> for generating tactile outputs on device <b>100</b> (e.g., generating tactile outputs on a touch-sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> of device <b>100</b> or touchpad <b>355</b> of device <b>300</b>). These components optionally communicate over one or more communication buses or signal lines <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As used in the specification and claims, the term &#x201c;tactile output&#x201d; refers to physical displacement of a device relative to a previous position of the device, physical displacement of a component (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface) of a device relative to another component (e.g., housing) of the device, or displacement of the component relative to a center of mass of the device that will be detected by a user with the user's sense of touch. For example, in situations where the device or the component of the device is in contact with a surface of a user that is sensitive to touch (e.g., a finger, palm, or other part of a user's hand), the tactile output generated by the physical displacement will be interpreted by the user as a tactile sensation corresponding to a perceived change in physical characteristics of the device or the component of the device. For example, movement of a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch-sensitive display or trackpad) is, optionally, interpreted by the user as a &#x201c;down click&#x201d; or &#x201c;up click&#x201d; of a physical actuator button. In some cases, a user will feel a tactile sensation such as an &#x201c;down click&#x201d; or &#x201c;up click&#x201d; even when there is no movement of a physical actuator button associated with the touch-sensitive surface that is physically pressed (e.g., displaced) by the user's movements. As another example, movement of the touch-sensitive surface is, optionally, interpreted or sensed by the user as &#x201c;roughness&#x201d; of the touch-sensitive surface, even when there is no change in smoothness of the touch-sensitive surface. While such interpretations of touch by a user will be subject to the individualized sensory perceptions of the user, there are many sensory perceptions of touch that are common to a large majority of users. Thus, when a tactile output is described as corresponding to a particular sensory perception of a user (e.g., an &#x201c;up click,&#x201d; a &#x201c;down click,&#x201d; &#x201c;roughness&#x201d;), unless otherwise stated, the generated tactile output corresponds to physical displacement of the device or a component thereof that will generate the described sensory perception for a typical (or average) user. Using tactile outputs to provide haptic feedback to a user enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to provide proper inputs and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device) which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, a tactile output pattern specifies characteristics of a tactile output, such as the amplitude of the tactile output, the shape of a movement waveform of the tactile output, the frequency of the tactile output, and/or the duration of the tactile output.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">When tactile outputs with different tactile output patterns are generated by a device (e.g., via one or more tactile output generators that move a moveable mass to generate tactile outputs), the tactile outputs may invoke different haptic sensations in a user holding or touching the device. While the sensation of the user is based on the user's perception of the tactile output, most users will be able to identify changes in waveform, frequency, and amplitude of tactile outputs generated by the device. Thus, the waveform, frequency and amplitude can be adjusted to indicate to the user that different operations have been performed. As such, tactile outputs with tactile output patterns that are designed, selected, and/or engineered to simulate characteristics (e.g., size, material, weight, stiffness, smoothness, etc.); behaviors (e.g., oscillation, displacement, acceleration, rotation, expansion, etc.); and/or interactions (e.g., collision, adhesion, repulsion, attraction, friction, etc.) of objects in a given environment (e.g., a user interface that includes graphical features and objects, a simulated physical environment with virtual boundaries and virtual objects, a real physical environment with physical boundaries and physical objects, and/or a combination of any of the above) will, in some circumstances, provide helpful feedback to users that reduces input errors and increases the efficiency of the user's operation of the device. Additionally, tactile outputs are, optionally, generated to correspond to feedback that is unrelated to a simulated physical characteristic, such as an input threshold or a selection of an object. Such tactile outputs will, in some circumstances, provide helpful feedback to users that reduces input errors and increases the efficiency of the user's operation of the device.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, a tactile output with a suitable tactile output pattern serves as a cue for the occurrence of an event of interest in a user interface or behind the scenes in a device. Examples of the events of interest include activation of an affordance (e.g., a real or virtual button, or toggle switch) provided on the device or in a user interface, success or failure of a requested operation, reaching or crossing a boundary in a user interface, entry into a new state, switching of input focus between objects, activation of a new mode, reaching or crossing an input threshold, detection or recognition of a type of input or gesture, etc. In some embodiments, tactile outputs are provided to serve as a warning or an alert for an impending event or outcome that would occur unless a redirection or interruption input is timely detected. Tactile outputs are also used in other contexts to enrich the user experience, improve the accessibility of the device to users with visual or motor difficulties or other accessibility needs, and/or improve efficiency and functionality of the user interface and/or the device. Tactile outputs are optionally accompanied with audio outputs and/or visible user interface changes, which further enhance a user's experience when the user interacts with a user interface and/or the device, and facilitate better conveyance of information regarding the state of the user interface and/or the device, and which reduce input errors and increase the efficiency of the user's operation of the device.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">It should be appreciated that device <b>100</b> is only one example of a portable multifunction device, and that device <b>100</b> optionally has more or fewer components than shown, optionally combines two or more components, or optionally has a different configuration or arrangement of the components.

In some embodiments, some or all of the visual output corresponds to user interface objects. As used herein, the term &#x201c;affordance&#x201d; refers to a user-interactive graphical user interface object (e.g., a graphical user interface object that is configured to respond to inputs directed toward the graphical user interface object). Examples of user-interactive graphical user interface objects include, without limitation, a button, slider, icon, selectable menu item, switch, hyperlink, or other user interface control.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> has a touch-sensitive surface, sensor or set of sensors that accepts input from the user based on haptic and/or tactile contact.

Contact/motion module <b>130</b> includes various software components for performing various operations related to detection of contact (e.g., by a finger or by a stylus), such as determining if contact has occurred (e.g., detecting a finger-down event), determining an intensity of the contact (e.g., the force or pressure of the contact or a substitute for the force or pressure of the contact), determining if there is movement of the contact and tracking the movement across the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., detecting one or more finger-dragging events), and determining if the contact has ceased (e.g., detecting a finger-up event or a break in contact). Contact/motion module <b>130</b> receives contact data from the touch-sensitive surface. Determining movement of the point of contact, which is represented by a series of contact data, optionally includes determining speed (magnitude), velocity (magnitude and direction), and/or an acceleration (a change in magnitude and/or direction) of the point of contact. These operations are, optionally, applied to single contacts (e.g., one finger contacts or stylus contacts) or to multiple simultaneous contacts (e.g., &#x201c;multitouch&#x201d;/multiple finger contacts). In some embodiments, contact/motion module <b>130</b> and display controller <b>156</b> detect contact on a touchpad.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Contact/motion module <b>130</b> optionally detects a gesture input by a user. Different gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns (e.g., different motions, timings, and/or intensities of detected contacts). Thus, a gesture is, optionally, detected by detecting a particular contact pattern. For example, detecting a finger tap gesture includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting a finger-up (lift off) event at the same position (or substantially the same position) as the finger-down event (e.g., at the position of an icon). As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the touch-sensitive surface includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting one or more finger-dragging events, and subsequently followed by detecting a finger-up (lift off) event. Similarly, tap, swipe, drag, and other gestures are optionally detected for a stylus by detecting a particular contact pattern for the stylus.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some embodiments, detecting a finger tap gesture depends on the length of time between detecting the finger-down event and the finger-up event, but is independent of the intensity of the finger contact between detecting the finger-down event and the finger-up event. In some embodiments, a tap gesture is detected in accordance with a determination that the length of time between the finger-down event and the finger-up event is less than a predetermined value (e.g., less than 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 or 0.5 seconds), independent of whether the intensity of the finger contact during the tap meets a given intensity threshold (greater than a nominal contact-detection intensity threshold), such as a light press or deep press intensity threshold. Thus, a finger tap gesture can satisfy particular input criteria that do not require that the characteristic intensity of a contact satisfy a given intensity threshold in order for the particular input criteria to be met. For clarity, the finger contact in a tap gesture typically needs to satisfy a nominal contact-detection intensity threshold, below which the contact is not detected, in order for the finger-down event to be detected. A similar analysis applies to detecting a tap gesture by a stylus or other contact. In cases where the device is capable of detecting a finger or stylus contact hovering over a touch sensitive surface, the nominal contact-detection intensity threshold optionally does not correspond to physical contact between the finger or stylus and the touch sensitive surface.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The same concepts apply in an analogous manner to other types of gestures. For example, a swipe gesture, a pinch gesture, a depinch gesture, and/or a long press gesture are optionally detected based on the satisfaction of criteria that are either independent of intensities of contacts included in the gesture, or do not require that contact(s) that perform the gesture reach intensity thresholds in order to be recognized. For example, a swipe gesture is detected based on an amount of movement of one or more contacts; a pinch gesture is detected based on movement of two or more contacts towards each other; a depinch gesture is detected based on movement of two or more contacts away from each other; and a long press gesture is detected based on a duration of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface with less than a threshold amount of movement. As such, the statement that particular gesture recognition criteria do not require that the intensity of the contact(s) meet a respective intensity threshold in order for the particular gesture recognition criteria to be met means that the particular gesture recognition criteria are capable of being satisfied if the contact(s) in the gesture do not reach the respective intensity threshold, and are also capable of being satisfied in circumstances where one or more of the contacts in the gesture do reach or exceed the respective intensity threshold. In some embodiments, a tap gesture is detected based on a determination that the finger-down and finger-up event are detected within a predefined time period, without regard to whether the contact is above or below the respective intensity threshold during the predefined time period, and a swipe gesture is detected based on a determination that the contact movement is greater than a predefined magnitude, even if the contact is above the respective intensity threshold at the end of the contact movement. Even in implementations where detection of a gesture is influenced by the intensity of contacts performing the gesture (e.g., the device detects a long press more quickly when the intensity of the contact is above an intensity threshold or delays detection of a tap input when the intensity of the contact is higher), the detection of those gestures does not require that the contacts reach a particular intensity threshold so long as the criteria for recognizing the gesture can be met in circumstances where the contact does not reach the particular intensity threshold (e.g., even if the amount of time that it takes to recognize the gesture changes).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Contact intensity thresholds, duration thresholds, and movement thresholds are, in some circumstances, combined in a variety of different combinations in order to create heuristics for distinguishing two or more different gestures directed to the same input element or region so that multiple different interactions with the same input element are enabled to provide a richer set of user interactions and responses. The statement that a particular set of gesture recognition criteria do not require that the intensity of the contact(s) meet a respective intensity threshold in order for the particular gesture recognition criteria to be met does not preclude the concurrent evaluation of other intensity-dependent gesture recognition criteria to identify other gestures that do have a criteria that is met when a gesture includes a contact with an intensity above the respective intensity threshold. For example, in some circumstances, first gesture recognition criteria for a first gesture&#x2014;which do not require that the intensity of the contact(s) meet a respective intensity threshold in order for the first gesture recognition criteria to be met&#x2014;are in competition with second gesture recognition criteria for a second gesture&#x2014;which are dependent on the contact(s) reaching the respective intensity threshold. In such competitions, the gesture is, optionally, not recognized as meeting the first gesture recognition criteria for the first gesture if the second gesture recognition criteria for the second gesture are met first. For example, if a contact reaches the respective intensity threshold before the contact moves by a predefined amount of movement, a deep press gesture is detected rather than a swipe gesture. Conversely, if the contact moves by the predefined amount of movement before the contact reaches the respective intensity threshold, a swipe gesture is detected rather than a deep press gesture. Even in such circumstances, the first gesture recognition criteria for the first gesture still do not require that the intensity of the contact(s) meet a respective intensity threshold in order for the first gesture recognition criteria to be met because if the contact stayed below the respective intensity threshold until an end of the gesture (e.g., a swipe gesture with a contact that does not increase to an intensity above the respective intensity threshold), the gesture would have been recognized by the first gesture recognition criteria as a swipe gesture. As such, particular gesture recognition criteria that do not require that the intensity of the contact(s) meet a respective intensity threshold in order for the particular gesture recognition criteria to be met will (A) in some circumstances ignore the intensity of the contact with respect to the intensity threshold (e.g. for a tap gesture) and/or (B) in some circumstances still be dependent on the intensity of the contact with respect to the intensity threshold in the sense that the particular gesture recognition criteria (e.g., for a long press gesture) will fail if a competing set of intensity-dependent gesture recognition criteria (e.g., for a deep press gesture) recognize an input as corresponding to an intensity-dependent gesture before the particular gesture recognition criteria recognize a gesture corresponding to the input (e.g., for a long press gesture that is competing with a deep press gesture for recognition).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Graphics module <b>132</b> includes various known software components for rendering and displaying graphics on touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> or other display, including components for changing the visual impact (e.g., brightness, transparency, saturation, contrast or other visual property) of graphics that are displayed.

Event information includes information about a sub-event (e.g., a user touch on touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b>, as part of a multi-touch gesture). Peripherals interface <b>118</b> transmits information it receives from I/O subsystem <b>106</b> or a sensor, such as proximity sensor <b>166</b>, accelerometer(s) <b>168</b>, and/or microphone <b>113</b> (through audio circuitry <b>110</b>).

Views are made up of controls and other elements that a user can see on the display.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0140">Another aspect of the user interface associated with an application is a set of views, sometimes herein called application views or user interface windows, in which information is displayed and touch-based gestures occur. The application views (of a respective application) in which a touch is detected optionally correspond to programmatic levels within a programmatic or view hierarchy of the application. For example, the lowest level view in which a touch is detected is, optionally, called the hit view, and the set of events that are recognized as proper inputs are, optionally, determined based, at least in part, on the hit view of the initial touch that begins a touch-based gesture.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0141">Hit view determination module <b>172</b> receives information related to sub-events of a touch-based gesture. When an application has multiple views organized in a hierarchy, hit view determination module <b>172</b> identifies a hit view as the lowest view in the hierarchy which should handle the sub-event. In most circumstances, the hit view is the lowest level view in which an initiating sub-event occurs (e.g., the first sub-event in the sequence of sub-events that form an event or potential event). Once the hit view is identified by the hit view determination module, the hit view typically receives all sub-events related to the same touch or input source for which it was identified as the hit view.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0142">Active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b> determines which view or views within a view hierarchy should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In some embodiments, active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b> determines that only the hit view should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, active event recognizer determination module <b>173</b> determines that all views that include the physical location of a sub-event are actively involved views, and therefore determines that all actively involved views should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, even if touch sub-events were entirely confined to the area associated with one particular view, views higher in the hierarchy would still remain as actively involved views.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0143">Event dispatcher module <b>174</b> dispatches the event information to an event recognizer (e.g., event recognizer <b>180</b>).

Each application view <b>191</b> of the application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b> includes one or more event recognizers <b>180</b>. Typically, a respective application view <b>191</b> includes a plurality of event recognizers <b>180</b>. In other embodiments, one or more of event recognizers <b>180</b> are part of a separate module, such as a user interface kit or a higher level object from which application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b> inherits methods and other properties.

Event recognizer <b>180</b> includes event receiver <b>182</b> and event comparator <b>184</b>. In some embodiments, event recognizer <b>180</b> also includes at least a subset of: metadata <b>183</b>, and event delivery instructions <b>188</b> (which optionally include sub-event delivery instructions).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0147">Event receiver <b>182</b> receives event information from event sorter <b>170</b>. The event information includes information about a sub-event, for example, a touch or a touch movement. Depending on the sub-event, the event information also includes additional information, such as location of the sub-event. When the sub-event concerns motion of a touch, the event information optionally also includes speed and direction of the sub-event. In some embodiments, events include rotation of the device from one orientation to another (e.g., from a portrait orientation to a landscape orientation, or vice versa), and the event information includes corresponding information about the current orientation (also called device attitude) of the device.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0148">Event comparator <b>184</b> compares the event information to predefined event or sub-event definitions and, based on the comparison, determines an event or sub-event, or determines or updates the state of an event or sub-event. In some embodiments, event comparator <b>184</b> includes event definitions <b>186</b>. Event definitions <b>186</b> contain definitions of events (e.g., predefined sequences of sub-events), for example, event 1 (<b>187</b>-<b>1</b>), event 2 (<b>187</b>-<b>2</b>), and others. In some embodiments, sub-events in an event <b>187</b> include, for example, touch begin, touch end, touch movement, touch cancellation, and multiple touching. In one example, the definition for event 1 (<b>187</b>-<b>1</b>) is a double tap on a displayed object. The double tap, for example, comprises a first touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a first lift-off (touch end) for a predetermined phase, a second touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, and a second lift-off (touch end) for a predetermined phase. In another example, the definition for event 2 (<b>187</b>-<b>2</b>) is a dragging on a displayed object. The dragging, for example, comprises a touch (or contact) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a movement of the touch across touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b>, and lift-off of the touch (touch end). In some embodiments, the event also includes information for one or more associated event handlers <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0149">In some embodiments, event definition <b>187</b> includes a definition of an event for a respective user-interface object. In some embodiments, event comparator <b>184</b> performs a hit test to determine which user-interface object is associated with a sub-event. For example, in an application view in which three user-interface objects are displayed on touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b>, when a touch is detected on touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b>, event comparator <b>184</b> performs a hit test to determine which of the three user-interface objects is associated with the touch (sub-event). If each displayed object is associated with a respective event handler <b>190</b>, the event comparator uses the result of the hit test to determine which event handler <b>190</b> should be activated. For example, event comparator <b>184</b> selects an event handler associated with the sub-event and the object triggering the hit test.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0150">In some embodiments, the definition for a respective event <b>187</b> also includes delayed actions that delay delivery of the event information until after it has been determined whether the sequence of sub-events does or does not correspond to the event recognizer's event type.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0151">When a respective event recognizer <b>180</b> determines that the series of sub-events do not match any of the events in event definitions <b>186</b>, the respective event recognizer <b>180</b> enters an event impossible, event failed, or event ended state, after which it disregards subsequent sub-events of the touch-based gesture. In this situation, other event recognizers, if any, that remain active for the hit view continue to track and process sub-events of an ongoing touch-based gesture.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0152">In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer <b>180</b> includes metadata <b>183</b> with configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how the event delivery system should perform sub-event delivery to actively involved event recognizers. In some embodiments, metadata <b>183</b> includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how event recognizers interact, or are enabled to interact, with one another. In some embodiments, metadata <b>183</b> includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate whether sub-events are delivered to varying levels in the view or programmatic hierarchy.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0153">In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer <b>180</b> activates event handler <b>190</b> associated with an event when one or more particular sub-events of an event are recognized. In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer <b>180</b> delivers event information associated with the event to event handler <b>190</b>. Activating an event handler <b>190</b> is distinct from sending (and deferred sending) sub-events to a respective hit view. In some embodiments, event recognizer <b>180</b> throws a flag associated with the recognized event, and event handler <b>190</b> associated with the flag catches the flag and performs a predefined process.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0154">In some embodiments, event delivery instructions <b>188</b> include sub-event delivery instructions that deliver event information about a sub-event without activating an event handler. Instead, the sub-event delivery instructions deliver event information to event handlers associated with the series of sub-events or to actively involved views. Event handlers associated with the series of sub-events or with actively involved views receive the event information and perform a predetermined process.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0155">In some embodiments, data updater <b>176</b> creates and updates data used in application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b>. For example, data updater <b>176</b> updates the telephone number used in contacts module <b>137</b>, or stores a video file used in video and music player module <b>152</b>. In some embodiments, object updater <b>177</b> creates and updates objects used in application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b>. For example, object updater <b>177</b> creates a new user-interface object or updates the position of a user-interface object. GUI updater <b>178</b> updates the GUI. For example, GUI updater <b>178</b> prepares display information and sends it to graphics module <b>132</b> for display on a touch-sensitive display.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0156">In some embodiments, event handler(s) <b>190</b> includes or has access to data updater <b>176</b>, object updater <b>177</b>, and GUI updater <b>178</b>. In some embodiments, data updater <b>176</b>, object updater <b>177</b>, and GUI updater <b>178</b> are included in a single module of a respective application <b>136</b>-<b>1</b> or application view <b>191</b>.

For example, mouse movement and mouse button presses, optionally coordinated with single or multiple keyboard presses or holds; contact movements such as taps, drags, scrolls, etc., on touch-pads; pen stylus inputs; movement of the device; oral instructions; detected eye movements; biometric inputs; and/or any combination thereof are optionally utilized as inputs corresponding to sub-events which define an event to be recognized.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0158"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a portable multifunction device <b>100</b> having a touch screen (e.g., touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) in accordance with some embodiments. The touch screen optionally displays one or more graphics within user interface (UI) <b>200</b>.

In some embodiments, when a wearable audio output device having earbuds to which interchangeable eartips may be attached are worn in a user's ears, the earbuds and eartips together act as physical barriers that block at least some ambient sound from the surrounding physical environment from reaching the user's ear. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, wearable audio output device <b>301</b> is worn by a user such that earbud <b>303</b> and eartip <b>314</b> are in the user's left ear. Eartip <b>314</b> extends at least partially into the user's ear canal. Preferably, when earbud <b>303</b> and eartip <b>314</b> are inserted into the user's ear, a seal is formed between eartip <b>314</b> and the user's ear so as to isolate the user's ear canal from the surrounding physical environment. However, in some circumstances, earbud <b>303</b> and eartip <b>314</b> together block some, but not necessarily all, of the ambient sound in the surrounding physical environment from reaching the user's ear. Accordingly, in some embodiments, a first microphone (or, in some embodiments, a first set of one or more microphones) <b>302</b>-<b>1</b> (e.g., of microphones <b>302</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>) is located on wearable audio output device <b>301</b> so as to detect ambient sound, represented by waveform <b>322</b>, in region <b>316</b> of a physical environment surrounding (e.g., outside of) earbud <b>303</b>. In some embodiments, a second microphone (or, in some embodiments, a second set of one or more microphones) <b>302</b>-<b>2</b> (e.g., of microphones <b>302</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>) is located on wearable audio output device <b>301</b> so as to detect any ambient sound, represented by waveform <b>324</b>, that is not completely blocked by earbud <b>303</b> and eartip <b>314</b> and that can be heard in region <b>318</b> inside the user's ear canal. Accordingly, in some circumstances in which wearable audio output device <b>301</b> is not producing a noise-cancelling (also called &#x201c;antiphase&#x201d;) audio signal to cancel (e.g., attenuate) ambient sound from the surrounding physical environment, as indicated by waveform <b>326</b>-<b>1</b>, ambient sound waveform <b>324</b> is perceivable by the user, as indicated by waveform <b>328</b>-<b>1</b>. In some circumstances in which wearable audio output device <b>301</b> is producing an antiphase audio signal to cancel ambient sound, as indicated by waveform <b>326</b>-<b>2</b>, ambient sound waveform <b>324</b> is not perceivable by the user, as indicated by waveform <b>328</b>-<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0168">In some embodiments, ambient sound waveform <b>322</b> is compared to attenuated ambient sound waveform <b>324</b> (e.g., by wearable audio output device <b>301</b> or a component of wearable audio output device <b>301</b>, such as audio I/O logic <b>312</b>, or by an electronic device that is in communication with wearable audio output device <b>301</b>) to determine the passive attenuation provided by wearable audio output device <b>301</b>. In some embodiments, the amount of passive attenuation provided by wearable audio output device <b>301</b> is taken into account when providing the antiphase audio signal to cancel ambient sound from the surrounding physical environment. For example, antiphase audio signal waveform <b>326</b>-<b>2</b> is configured to cancel attenuated ambient sound waveform <b>324</b> rather than unattenuated ambient sound waveform <b>322</b>.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0169">In some embodiments, wearable audio output device <b>301</b> is configured to operate in one of a plurality of available audio output modes, such as an active noise control audio output mode, an active pass-through audio output mode, and a bypass audio output mode (also sometimes called a noise control off audio output mode). In the active noise control mode (also called &#x201c;ANC&#x201d;), wearable audio output device <b>301</b> outputs one or more audio-cancelling audio components (e.g., one or more antiphase audio signals, also called &#x201c;audio-cancellation audio components&#x201d;) to at least partially cancel ambient sound from the surrounding physical environment that would otherwise be perceivable to the user. In the active pass-through audio output mode, wearable audio output device <b>301</b> outputs one or more pass-through audio components (e.g., plays at least a portion of the ambient sound from outside the user's ear, received by microphone <b>302</b>-<b>1</b>, for example) so that the user can hear a greater amount of ambient sound from the surrounding physical environment than would otherwise be perceivable to the user (e.g., a greater amount of ambient sound than would be audible with the passive attenuation of wearable audio output device <b>301</b> placed in the user's ear). In the bypass mode, active noise management is turned off, such that wearable audio output device <b>301</b> outputs neither any audio-cancelling audio components nor any pass-through audio components (e.g., such that any amount of ambient sound that the user perceives is due to physical attenuation by wearable audio output device <b>301</b>). In some embodiments, in response to particular types of inputs, such as click-and-hold gestures, at stem <b>305</b> of the wearable audio output device <b>301</b>, wearable audio output device <b>301</b> cycles through one or more of the above-discussed audio output modes, as described in further detail herein, for example with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>J and <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0170"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, except that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> illustrates wearable audio output device <b>301</b><i>b </i>as a set of headphones with over-ear earcups worn over a user's ear, rather than one or more earbuds worn in the user's ears.

In some embodiments, the earbuds each include a stem (e.g., that extends from the portion of the earbud that is inserted in a user's ear) that the user can use to provide inputs to the earbuds. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, earbud <b>502</b>-<b>2</b> includes stem <b>801</b>. In some embodiments, stem <b>801</b> is or includes a pressure-sensitive input device that responds to press inputs applied to stem <b>801</b> when held and squeezed between two fingers of hand <b>802</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>. Although only one earbud with a stem (e.g., earbud <b>502</b>-<b>2</b> with stem <b>801</b>) is shown, one of ordinary skill will recognize that earbud <b>502</b>-<b>1</b> can have an analogous structure with a corresponding stem, and that the same functionality described herein with reference to earbud <b>502</b>-<b>2</b> and stem <b>801</b> may be available using earbud <b>502</b>-<b>1</b> and its corresponding stem as well. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> also illustrates input <b>803</b> received at stem <b>801</b> (e.g., a long squeeze gesture that includes a squeeze of stem <b>801</b> that is maintained for at least a threshold amount of time) while the current audio output mode of earbuds <b>502</b> is the active noise control mode, as indicated by active noise control icon <b>709</b> in noise management control <b>707</b>-<b>1</b>. In some embodiments, an audible tone is output to indicate a &#x201c;down click,&#x201d; which occurs when intensity of an input received at stem <b>801</b> has met or exceeded an input intensity threshold (e.g., associated with squeeze gestures). In some embodiments, an audible tone (e.g., the same or different from the &#x201c;down click&#x201d; audible tone) is output to indicate an &#x201c;up click,&#x201d; which occurs when an input whose intensity has met or exceeded the input intensity threshold has been released so that the input intensity decreases to or below the input intensity threshold. In some embodiments, setting the &#x201c;down click&#x201d; intensity threshold to be higher than the &#x201c;up click&#x201d; intensity threshold provides hysteresis so that inadvertent fluctuations in input intensity (e.g., due to unsteadiness of a user's fingers when applying pressure to the input device) do not result in the wearable audio output device inadvertently detecting release of the input. In some embodiments, wearable audio output device <b>301</b> includes one or more tactile output generators, optionally located in stem <b>801</b>. In some such embodiments, an activation tactile output is output to indicate a &#x201c;down click,&#x201d; and/or a release tactile output is output to indicate an &#x201c;up click.&#x201d; In some embodiments, the activation tactile output is the same (e.g., has the same tactile output amplitude, frequency, and pattern) as the release tactile output. In some embodiments, the activation tactile output is different (e.g., in amplitude, frequency and/or pattern) from the release tactile output (e.g., so the user can differentiate between detection of activation and detection of release).</p><p id="p-0215" num="0253"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> illustrates a transition from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> in response to input <b>803</b>. In response to input <b>803</b> (e.g., and in accordance with a determination that input <b>803</b> is a long squeeze gesture), earbuds <b>502</b> switch from the active noise control mode to the next audio output mode in a predefined order of audio output modes, which in this example is the bypass mode, as indicated by bypass icon <b>710</b> in noise management control <b>707</b>-<b>1</b> in FIG. <b>8</b>B.

During the pairing and calibration process, a user is prompted to place the wearable audio output devices in his or her ears, a calibration tone is output via the wearable audio output devices, and a fit of the wearable audio output devices is determined based on whether audio that is detected while outputting the calibration tone meets particular criteria. If the detected audio does not meet the particular criteria, the user is prompted to adjust (e.g., one or both of) the wearable audio output devices. Displaying, on the display device, prompts related to placement and adjustment of the wearable audio output devices guides the user through the pairing and calibration process and provides the user at various points during the process with visual feedback as to actions to perform, whether the process is being performed properly, and/or whether the wearable audio output devices are properly fitted. Providing improved feedback to the user enhances the operability of the computer system and associated devices (e.g., the wearable audio output devices and/or the display device) and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to achieve an intended outcome and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the devices), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the devices by enabling the user to use the devices more quickly and efficiently. In addition, improving the fit of the wearable audio output devices improves the seal between the wearable audio output devices and the user's ears, which enables audio to be played at a lower volume to produce the same effective audio volume perceived by the user (e.g., relative to when the wearable audio output devices are not properly fitted, in which case hearing some ambient noise may cause the user to increase the audio output volume), thereby further reducing power usage and improving battery life of the devices.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0292">The method includes, establishing <b>1004</b> a wireless connection with a pair of wearable audio output devices that includes: a first wearable audio output device (e.g., an earbud or earphone that in some embodiments is one of a pair (e.g., earbuds <b>502</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>502</b>-<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>) with one or more first microphones, and a second wearable audio output device (e.g., an earbud or earphone that in some embodiments is one of a pair) with one or more second microphones.

Providing additional control options for controlling audio outputs without cluttering the user interface with additional displayed controls, as well as reducing the number of inputs needed to perform the additional control options, enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to achieve an intended outcome and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0367">In some embodiments, an operation associated with the first type of gesture is (<b>1218</b>) configurable using a settings user interface (e.g., displayed on a display of an electronic device that is in communication with the wearable audio output device) and selected from a first set of operations that includes transitioning a respective audio output mode of the wearable audio output device; an operation associated with the second type of gesture is configurable using the settings user interface and selected from a second set of operations that includes toggling playing a respective media audio component; an operation associated with the third type of gesture is configurable using the settings user interface and selected from a third set of operations that includes ceasing to play a first respective media audio component in combination with playing a second respective media audio component. For example, as shown in and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B</figref>, the respective operations to be performed in response to click, double click, and click-and-hold gestures are configurable via settings user interface <b>900</b>; wherein the set of available operations for click gestures includes the currently-assigned &#x201c;Play/Pause&#x201d; operation type, the set of available operations for double click gestures includes the currently-assigned &#x201c;Next Track&#x201d; operation type, and the set of available operations for click-and-hold gestures includes the currently-assigned &#x201c;Noise Management&#x201d; operation type.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0368">Allowing a user to configure the operation that is performed in response to a particular type of gesture (or, conversely, allowing a user to configure the type of gesture that causes performance of a particular operation) provides the user with flexibility to customize his or her interactions with the audio output device (e.g., so that particular operation(s), such as those that the user performs more often, can be performed using a gesture via the audio output device without requiring the user to navigate through complex settings menu hierarchies on a separate device, and so that the interactions are more intuitive for the user). Providing flexible and more intuitive user interactions for performing audio output control operations, and reducing the number of inputs needed to perform those operations, enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to achieve an intended outcome and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0369">In some embodiments, the electronic device includes a display (e.g., touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> or display <b>340</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) and a second input device (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface, such as touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> or touchpad <b>355</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>), and detects (<b>1220</b>) a second input via the second input device (e.g., input <b>701</b> via touch screen <b>112</b> of device <b>100</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref>). In some embodiments, in response to detecting the second input, the electronic device displays, on the display, a settings user interface, and displays, in the settings user interface, an output-mode affordance for controlling an audio output mode of the wearable audio output device. In some embodiments, the settings user interface includes a volume affordance, and in response to activation of the volume affordance (e.g., by a hard press or long press, on the second input device, where the second input device includes a touch-sensitive surface such as touch screen <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>), the electronic device updates the settings user interface (or, stated another way, replaces display of the (e.g., first) settings user interface with display of a second settings user interface) to include the output-mode affordance. For example, as described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>D-<b>7</b>E</figref>, settings user interface <b>702</b> includes volume control <b>703</b>, and in response to activation of volume control <b>703</b> by input <b>704</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>), device <b>100</b> displays enhanced volume control user interface <b>705</b>, which includes noise management control <b>707</b>-<b>1</b> that indicates the audio output mode in which earbuds <b>502</b> are currently operating (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>E</figref>).</p><p id="p-0317" num="0370">Providing control options for audio output mode in a settings user interface provides the user with quick access to additional control over audio outputs without requiring the user to navigate through complex settings menu hierarchies.

In some embodiments, while the wearable audio output device is not in communication with the electronic device, the output-mode affordance is not displayed in the settings user interface (e.g., noise management control <b>707</b>-<b>1</b> is not displayed in enhanced volume control user interface <b>705</b> if earbuds <b>502</b> are not connected to device <b>100</b>).</p><p id="p-0319" num="0372">Conditionally displaying control options for audio output mode (e.g., an audio output mode control) in a settings user interface based on whether the audio output device and the device on which the settings user interface is displayed are in communication with each other, such that the control options are only displayed when the two devices are in communication, provides the user with quick access to the control options when relevant (e.g., while the two devices are in communication) but not when those control options would be ineffectual (e.g., while the devices are not in communication). Providing additional control options without unnecessarily cluttering the user interface with additional displayed controls enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to achieve an intended outcome and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0373">In some embodiments, the output-mode affordance includes (<b>1224</b>) a representation of a first respective audio output mode that is a current audio output mode of the wearable audio output device without including representations of any other audio output modes of the wearable audio output device. For example, the output-mode affordance includes a representation of the first audio output mode if the audio output device is operating in the first mode (e.g., without including a representation of the second audio output mode or any other output modes), or a representation of the second audio output mode if the audio output device is operating in the second mode (e.g., without including a representation of the first audio output mode or any other output modes). For example, as described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>E</figref>, noise management control <b>707</b>-<b>1</b> includes pass-through icon <b>711</b> representing the pass-through audio output mode to indicate that earbuds <b>502</b> are in the pass-through audio output mode.

Providing improved feedback to the user without unnecessarily cluttering the user interface with additional displayed controls enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to achieve an intended outcome and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0375">In some embodiments, the electronic device detects (<b>1226</b>), via the second input device, a third input that corresponds to the output-mode affordance; and, in response to detecting the third input, the electronic device displays respective representations of a plurality of audio output modes of the wearable audio output device (e.g., including the representation of the first respective audio output mode that is the current audio output mode). For example, as described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>E-<b>7</b>F</figref>, in response to detecting input <b>708</b> at noise management control <b>707</b>-<b>1</b>, device <b>100</b> displays expanded noise management control <b>707</b>-<b>2</b>, which includes pass-through icon <b>711</b> representing the pass-through mode, bypass icon <b>710</b> representing the bypass mode, and active noise control icon <b>709</b> representing the active noise control mode. In some embodiments, (e.g., while displaying the representations of the plurality of audio output modes), a selection indicator (e.g., selection indicator <b>713</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>F</figref>) is displayed on or over the representation of the first respective audio output mode (or the representation of the first respective audio output mode is otherwise visually distinguished from the other representations of available audio output modes) to indicate that the first respective audio output mode is the current audio output mode of the wearable audio output device. In some embodiments, the electronic device detects, via the second input device, a fourth input that corresponds to a representation of a second respective audio output mode that is distinct from the first respective audio output mode; and, in response to detecting the fourth input: the wearable audio output device transitions from the first respective audio output mode to the second respective audio output mode (e.g., making the second respective audio output mode the current audio output mode). For example, as described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>G-<b>7</b>H</figref>, in response to input <b>712</b> at active noise control icon <b>709</b>, the audio output mode of earbuds <b>502</b> is changed from the pass-through mode to the active noise control mode. In some embodiments, in response to detecting the fourth input, the electronic device ceases to display representations of audio output modes other than the second respective audio output mode (e.g., as described herein with reference <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>I</figref>, regarding collapsing expanded noise management control <b>707</b>-<b>2</b>). In some embodiments, (e.g., where the electronic device continues to display representations of the other audio output modes), in response to detecting the fourth input, the selection indicator is displayed on or over the representation of the second respective audio output mode instead of the first respective audio output mode (or the representation of the second respective audio output mode is otherwise visually distinguished, and the representation of the first respective audio output mode ceases to be visually distinguished, from the other representations of available audio output modes) to indicate that the second respective audio output mode is now the current audio output mode of the wearable audio output device. For example, as described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>G-<b>7</b>H</figref>, in response to selection of active noise control icon <b>709</b> by input <b>712</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>G</figref>), selection indicator <b>713</b> ceases to be displayed over pass-through icon <b>711</b> and is instead displayed over active noise control icon <b>709</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>H</figref>).</p><p id="p-0323" num="0376">Displaying additional options for audio output mode in response to selection of the audio output mode control, and then transitioning the audio output mode of the audio output device in response to selection of a different audio output mode option, provides the user with access to additional audio output modes when requested, without prematurely displaying the other audio output mode options, which may be distracting or misleading to the user. Providing additional control options without unnecessarily cluttering the user interface with additional displayed controls enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to achieve an intended outcome and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0377">In some embodiments, the first respective audio output mode is (<b>1228</b>) distinct from a third audio output mode in which the wearable audio output device provides audio outputs independently of the ambient sound from the physical environment (e.g., an audio output mode in which the wearable audio output device provides neither pass-through audio components nor cancellation audio components, such as the bypass mode represented by bypass icon <b>710</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>G</figref>), and the second respective audio output mode is distinct from the third audio output mode.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0378">Allowing the user to change the audio output mode of an audio output device between two different audio output modes (e.g., between an audio pass-through mode and an audio cancellation mode or vice versa), neither of which is independent of ambient sound from the physical environment, provides the user with flexibility between different levels of audio immersion or audio transparency that can be achieved with a single input, rather than requiring the user to toggle audio immersion on or off separately from toggling audio transparency on or off. Providing this flexibility while reducing the number of inputs needed to access this flexibility enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to achieve an intended outcome and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0379">In some embodiments, detecting the first input includes (<b>1230</b>) detecting an increase in intensity that satisfies an activation intensity threshold, and the wearable audio output device: in response to detecting the increase in intensity that satisfies the activation intensity threshold (e.g., an increase in intensity to or above the activation intensity threshold), provides an activation audio output; detects a decrease in intensity that satisfies a release intensity threshold; and, in response to detecting the decrease in intensity that satisfies the release intensity threshold (e.g., a decrease in intensity to or below the release intensity threshold), provides a release audio output. In some embodiments, the activation intensity threshold is the same as the release intensity threshold. In some embodiments, the activation intensity threshold is different from the release intensity threshold. For example, setting the activation intensity threshold above the release intensity threshold provides hysteresis so that inadvertent fluctuations in input intensity (e.g., due to unsteadiness of a user's fingers when applying pressure to the input device) do not result in the wearable audio output device detecting release of the input. In some embodiments, the activation audio output is the same as the release audio output. In some embodiments, the activation audio output is different from the release audio output (e.g., so the user can differentiate between detection of activation and detection of release). Inputs that include increases to or above an intensity threshold (e.g., &#x201c;down clicks&#x201d;) and decreases to or below the same (or in some embodiments a different) intensity threshold (e.g., &#x201c;up clicks&#x201d;), and corresponding audio outputs are described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>. In some embodiments, in response to detecting an input that does not include an increase in intensity above the activation intensity threshold, in accordance with a determination that the input does not include an increase in intensity above the activation intensity threshold, the wearable audio output device does not provide (e.g., forgoes providing) the activation audio output. In some embodiments, before detecting the decrease in intensity below the release intensity threshold, the device does not provide (e.g., forgoes providing) the release audio output.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0380">Providing audio outputs when an increase in the intensity of an input meets an activation intensity threshold and when a decrease in the intensity of the input meets a release intensity threshold provides audio feedback to the user that these thresholds have been satisfied and that any operation(s) associated with these thresholds will be performed in response to the input. Providing improved feedback to the user enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to achieve an intended outcome and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0381">In some embodiments, the wearable audio output device includes (<b>1232</b>) a first wearable audio output component having a first respective input device and a second wearable audio output component having a second respective input device (e.g., first and second earpieces with respective pressure-sensitive input devices, such earbuds <b>502</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>502</b>-<b>2</b> with respective stems as described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>). In some embodiments, detecting a respective input via the input device includes detecting the input via the first respective input device of the first wearable audio output component or detecting the input via the second respective input device of the second wearable audio output component; and providing a respective audio output via the wearable audio output device includes providing the respective audio output via the first wearable audio output component and providing the respective audio component via the second wearable audio component (e.g., as described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>). In some embodiments, the first wearable audio output component and the second wearable audio component have different behaviors. For example, the first wearable audio output component has a different set of assignments between type of input gesture and operation performed in response than the second wearable audio output component (e.g., a long squeeze gesture via the first wearable audio output component changes the audio output mode of the wearable audio output device, while a different gesture, such as a short squeeze (e.g., single squeeze) gesture, via the second wearable audio output component changes the audio output mode of the wearable audio output device, and/or a long squeeze gesture via the second wearable audio output component performs a different operation, such as toggling playback of media content instead of changing audio output mode).</p><p id="p-0329" num="0382">Providing the same behavior for both components of an audio output device (e.g., one component for a user's left ear and one component for the user's right ear), including providing outputs via both components and responding to inputs the same way regardless of which component is used to provide a respective input, provides the user with improved audio feedback and enables symmetric operation of the audio output device (e.g., regardless of whether the user is left-handed or right-handed) without requiring additional computing resources to perform component-specific input processing. Providing improved feedback to the user and enabling more intuitive user interactions without requiring additional computing resources enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to achieve an intended outcome and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0383">In some embodiments, the wearable audio output device includes (<b>1234</b>) a first wearable audio output component that is in a first position relative to a first ear of a user (e.g., in the user's ear when the component is an in-ear earphone or earbud, or over the user's ear when the component is an over-ear earcup), and a second wearable audio output component that is in a second position relative to a second ear of the user (e.g., in the user's ear when the component is an in-ear earphone or earbud, or over the user's ear when the component is an over-ear earcup). In some embodiments, the second audio output includes a respective media audio component that is based on respective media (e.g., from the electronic device) that is independent of the ambient sound from the physical environment.

Performing these operations in response to a single action (e.g., removing a component from an ear) that is likely an indication that the user wants to hear more ambient sound from his or her surrounding physical environment allows the user to adjust multiple different aspects of audio transparency (e.g., audio output mode as well as media playback) at once without requiring the user to provide separate inputs to adjust each aspect individually.

Operating the wearable audio output device in the noise-cancellation mode while both components are in-ear enables audio to be played at a lower volume to produce the same effective audio volume perceived by the user (e.g., relative to when hearing ambient sound interferes with the user's ability to hear the desired audio, which may cause the user to increase the audio output volume). However, operating the wearable audio output device in the noise-cancellation mode while only one component is in-ear results in undesired acoustic effects from noise-cancellation being performed with respect to only one ear (e.g., ambient sound will be heard by the ear in which a component has not been placed, regardless of how effectively ambient sound is cancelled with respect to the ear in which a component has been placed), and may result in excessive power usage by the wearable audio output device while attempting to cancel ambient sound that cannot be canceled due to lack of an acoustic seal by the component that is not in-ear. Requiring both components to be in-ear in order to transition the wearable audio output device to the noise-cancellation mode, and forgoing transitioning the wearable audio output device to the noise-cancellation mode if at least one component is not in-ear, avoids the undesired acoustic effects of operating the wearable audio output device in the noise-cancellation mode while only one component is in-ear. Preventing operation of the wearable audio output device in an audio output mode that is incompatible with the in-ear status of the wearable audio output components enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0405" num="0477">The computer system operates (<b>1802</b>) the wearable audio output device in a first audio output mode (e.g., an audio output mode other than a noise-cancellation mode). While operating the wearable audio output device in the first audio output mode (<b>1804</b>), the computer system receives, via the one or more input devices, a first input corresponding to a request to transition the wearable audio output device from the first audio output mode to a noise-cancellation mode (e.g., from an audio output mode other than the noise-cancellation mode). While the wearable audio output device is in the noise-cancellation mode (e.g., an active noise control mode), audio outputs that are provided via the wearable audio output device include one or more cancellation audio components selected (e.g., generated) so as to at least partially cancel ambient sound from the physical environment (e.g., the ambient sound being detected using one or more microphones of the wearable audio output device (e.g., microphone(s) <b>302</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, and canceled as described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>).

In some embodiments, the third input (e.g., corresponding to the request to transition the wearable audio output device to the pass-through mode) includes a predefined gesture detected via an input device of the wearable audio output device (e.g., a squeeze gesture via a stem of an earbud).

Providing the user with additional control options enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to achieve an intended outcome and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0496">In some embodiments, in response to receiving the first input, and in accordance with the determination that one of the first wearable audio output component or the second wearable audio output component is not in an in-ear position relative to a respective ear of the user, the computer system transitions (<b>1828</b>) the wearable audio output device from the first audio output mode to a third audio output mode, where the first audio output mode and the third audio output mode are distinct from the noise-cancellation mode. For example, input <b>1430</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>Y</figref> transitions earbuds <b>502</b> from the pass-through mode to the bypass mode (e.g., and a subsequent click-and-hold gesture would transition earbuds <b>502</b> from the bypass mode back to the pass-through mode). In some embodiments, the first input is a predefined gesture via an input device of the wearable audio output device (e.g., a squeeze gesture, such as a click-and-hold gesture, via a stem of an earbud) that is configured to transition the wearable audio output device through a set of predefined audio output modes. In some embodiments, while both wearable audio output components are in-ear, the set of predefined audio output modes includes at least the first audio output mode (e.g., a pass-through mode) and the noise-cancellation mode, and optionally also a third audio output mode (e.g., a noise control off mode).

Providing additional control options that are limited to those appropriate for a current status of the wearable audio output device enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0426" num="0498">In some embodiments, the computer system receives (<b>1830</b>), via the one or more input devices, a fourth input corresponding to a request to transition the wearable audio output device to a noise control off mode (e.g., from an audio output mode other than the noise control off mode). In some embodiments, while the wearable audio output device is in the noise control off mode, audio outputs that are provided via the wearable audio output device do not include one or more (e.g., any) pass-through audio components that include at least a portion of ambient sound from the physical environment and do not include one or more (e.g., any) cancellation audio components selected (e.g., generated) so as to at least partially cancel ambient sound from the physical environment. In some embodiments, the fourth input is a request to transition the wearable audio output device from a respective audio output mode (which is a mode other than the noise control off mode) to the noise control off mode and is detected while operating the wearable audio output device in the respective audio output mode. In some embodiments, in response to receiving the fourth input, the computer system transitions the wearable audio output device to the noise control off mode (e.g., without regard to whether both, either, or neither wearable audio output component is detected as being in-ear).

In some embodiments, the fourth input (e.g., corresponding to the request to transition the wearable audio output device to the noise control off mode) includes a predefined gesture detected via an input device of the wearable audio output device (e.g., a squeeze gesture via a stem of an earbud). Optionally, the computer system and wearable audio output device are configured such that the predefined gesture transitions the wearable audio output device through a set of (e.g., one or more) predefined audio output modes, and the noise control off mode is a next mode, in the set of audio output modes, following the current audio output mode in which the wearable audio output device is being operated when the predefined gesture is detected.</p><p id="p-0427" num="0499">Allowing transitioning of the wearable audio output device to the noise control off mode in response to a request to transition to the noise control off mode, regardless of how many wearable audio output components are in-ear, provides the user with access to control over audio output mode when the quality of audio outputs and the risk of undesired acoustic effects while operating in the requested audio output mode is not dependent on whether one or both components are in-ear. Providing the user with additional control options enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to achieve an intended outcome and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0428" num="0500">In some embodiments, forgoing transitioning the wearable audio output device from the first audio output mode to the noise-cancellation mode is performed (e.g., in accordance with the determination that one of the first wearable audio output component or the second wearable audio output component is not in an in-ear position relative to a respective ear of the user and) in accordance with a determination that the computer system is not in a predefined mode of operation (e.g., an accessibility mode).

For example, ambient sound will be heard by the ear in which a wearable audio output component has not been placed, regardless of how effectively ambient sound is cancelled with respect to the ear in which a wearable audio output component has been placed. However, in some cases, the user is only able to hear sounds with one ear and is unable to hear sounds with the other ear. In such cases, the user may wish to operate the wearable audio output device with the first wearable audio output component placed in the ear that is able to hear and without placing the second wearable audio output component in the ear that is unable to hear. In such cases, the wearable audio output device (and in particular the first wearable audio output component that is in-ear) can be transitioned to the noise-cancellation mode, and audio outputs can be provided in the noise-cancellation mode, without the undesired acoustic effects being perceived.</p><p id="p-0430" num="0502">Where a user is able to hear sounds with only one ear, and the computer system is in a predefined mode of operation such as an accessibility mode, allowing transitioning of the wearable audio output device to the noise-cancellation mode while only one wearable audio output component is in-ear (e.g., in the ear with which the user is able to hear sounds) provides the user with access to control over audio output mode when the risk of undesired acoustic effects is reduced or eliminated by the user not being able to hear sounds with the other ear. Providing the user with additional control options enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to achieve an intended outcome and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0431" num="0503">In some embodiments, the computer system includes a wearable electronic device (e.g., a wristwatch, as represented for example by portable multifunction device <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, and illustrated for example as watch <b>1700</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref>) that includes a display device (e.g., touch-sensitive display system <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) and that is in communication with one or more audio output devices including the wearable audio output device.

In some embodiments, a tactile output (e.g., to indicate an error condition) is generated in conjunction with the selection indicator settling into a predetermined snap position corresponding to an unavailable audio output mode, and in some such embodiments the tactile output generated for the unavailable audio output mode is different from the tactile output generated for an available audio output mode (and optionally also different from other types of tactile outputs discussed herein).</p><p id="p-0444" num="0516">Providing a tactile output as a selection indicator settles into a predetermined snap position associated with an audio output mode provides non-visual feedback to the user indicating that the selection indicator now corresponds to an activatable user interface element.

In addition, prompting the user to improve the acoustic seals between the wearable audio output device and the user's ears enables audio to be played at a lower volume to produce the same effective audio volume perceived by the user (e.g., relative to when the wearable audio output device is not properly fitted, in which case hearing some ambient sound may cause the user to increase the audio output volume), thereby further reducing power usage and improving battery life of the device.</p><p id="p-0492" num="0564">In some embodiments, the quality of the respective acoustic seal between a respective wearable audio output component and a respective ear of the user is further indicated by a second visual property (e.g., position) of (e.g., the graphical portion of) the respective corresponding indication.

In some embodiments, a representation of a seal quality threshold is displayed via the display device, and a position of the graphical indication relative to the representation of the seal quality threshold indicating the quality of the respective corresponding acoustic seal. For example, a horizontal line representing the seal quality threshold is displayed, and positioning of the graphical indication above the horizontal line indicates a good (e.g., or at least sufficient) acoustic seal, whereas positioning of the graphical indication below the horizontal line indicates a poor (e.g., or insufficient) acoustic seal.</p><p id="p-0493" num="0565">Indicating acoustic seal quality by a different visual property of an acoustic seal quality indicator in addition to color provides additional visual feedback to the user so that the user can even more quickly assess the fit of the wearable audio output device and determine which, if any, acoustic seals need to be improved.

While the second incoming call is pending (<b>2534</b>) (e.g., before the second call has been answered or ignored), the user may provide a press-and-hold input (<b>2528</b>-<b>2</b>) to dial <b>334</b> to ignore the second incoming call and to remain on the first call (<b>2536</b>).</p><p id="p-0603" num="0675">Alternatively, in some embodiments, while the second incoming call is pending (<b>2534</b>), the user may provide a single press input (<b>2524</b>-<b>3</b>) to dial <b>334</b> to answer the second incoming call, resulting in the second call being answered and made the active call and the first call being placed on hold (<b>2538</b>).

Similarly, in some embodiments, while the first call is active and the second call is on hold (<b>2540</b>), in response to a press-and-hold input (<b>2528</b>-<b>4</b>), the active first call is ended and the second call is resumed and made active again (<b>2544</b>).</p><p id="p-0605" num="0677"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>C</figref> illustrates example audio alerts that are generated at headphones <b>301</b><i>b </i>in response to inputs at dial <b>334</b> and button <b>336</b>. In some embodiments, as dial <b>334</b> is rotated (e.g., as indicated by arrow <b>2502</b>), one or more sounds (e.g., &#x201c;click&#x201d; sounds) are played to indicate the rotation of dial <b>334</b> (e.g., as dial <b>334</b> rotates through different positions corresponding to different values, as described in further detail herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>D</figref>). In some embodiments, the sounds played as dial <b>334</b> is rotated emulate the sounds made by mechanical detents on a wheel as it rotates. Similarly, in some embodiments, when button <b>336</b> is pressed (e.g., as indicated by arrow <b>2504</b>), a sound (e.g., a &#x201c;click&#x201d; sound) is generated to indicate that button <b>336</b> has been pressed. In some embodiments, the sounds played as button <b>336</b> is pressed emulate the sounds made by pressing and/or releasing a mechanical push button. In some embodiments, sounds are also generated when dial <b>334</b> is pressed. Optionally, sounds generated when dial <b>334</b> is pressed are different from the sounds generated when dial <b>334</b> is rotated. Sounds generated for dial <b>334</b> may be the same as or different from sounds generated for button <b>336</b>.</p><p id="p-0606" num="0678">In some embodiments, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>C</figref>, the sounds generated for operating (e.g., rotating, pressing, etc.) dial <b>334</b> and/or button <b>336</b> are spatial audio sounds that are output so as to sound as though the sounds were coming from specific locations, such as the locations of the corresponding input devices. For example, sounds generated for rotating dial <b>334</b> are output to have simulated spatial location <b>2546</b> corresponding to the physical location of dial <b>334</b>, so that the sounds appear to be made by the rotation of dial <b>334</b>. In another example, sounds generated for pressing button <b>336</b> are output to have simulated spatial location <b>2548</b> corresponding to the physical location of button <b>336</b>, so that the sounds appear to be made by the pressing of button <b>336</b>. In some embodiments, the sounds generated at headphones <b>301</b><i>b </i>for dial <b>334</b> and/or button <b>336</b> supplement sounds naturally produced by mechanical operation of dial <b>334</b> and/or button <b>336</b>.</p><p id="p-0607" num="0679"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>D</figref> illustrates example rules for generating audio alerts for the rotation of dial <b>334</b>. In some embodiments, an audio alert is generated each time the rotation of dial <b>334</b> changes the audio output volume to a respective volume level (e.g., any of levels L<sub>0 </sub>through L<sub>6</sub>, as indicated in audio volume meter <b>2550</b>). For example, an audio alert is generated when the audio output volume increases to level L<sub>3</sub>, and another audio alert is generated when the audio output volume increases further to L<sub>4</sub>. In some embodiments, although such audio alerts are requested or scheduled to be generated, a predefined time period (e.g., a minimum time period) between audio alerts is enforced. For example, if an audio alert was generated for rotation of dial <b>334</b> that increases the audio output volume to volume level L<sub>3</sub>, and further rotation of dial <b>334</b> to increase the audio output volume to volume level L<sub>4 </sub>occurs less than a threshold amount of time after the rotation of dial <b>334</b> that increased the audio output volume to volume level L<sub>3 </sub>(or, the audio alert for volume level L<sub>4 </sub>would have been generated less than the threshold amount of time after the audio alert for volume level L<sub>3 </sub>was generated), an audio alert is not generated for volume level L<sub>4</sub>. Alternatively, the audio alert for volume level L<sub>4 </sub>is delayed until the predefined time period has elapsed since the audio alert for volume level L<sub>3 </sub>was generated. One of ordinary skill will readily understand that analogous principles apply to rotation of dial <b>334</b> in the opposite direction to decrease audio output volume.</p><p id="p-0608" num="0680">In some embodiments, an audio alert is generated for a respective amount of rotation of dial <b>334</b> (e.g., each time the rotation of dial <b>334</b> causes a respective angular position on dial <b>334</b>, such as any of positions <b>2552</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>2552</b>-<b>8</b> on dial <b>334</b>, to cross a reference position, such as position <b>2554</b>). For example, during counterclockwise rotation of dial <b>334</b>, an audio alert is generated when position <b>2552</b>-<b>1</b> on dial <b>334</b> crosses reference position <b>2554</b> (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>D</figref>), and another audio alert is generated when dial <b>334</b> is further rotated such that position <b>2554</b>-<b>2</b> on dial <b>334</b> crosses reference position <b>2554</b>. In some embodiments, a predefined time period is enforced between audio alerts for intervals of rotation of dial <b>334</b>, similar to that described above with reference to changing audio volume levels between audio alerts. For example, if rotation of dial <b>334</b> to angular position <b>2552</b>-<b>3</b> occurs less than a threshold amount of time after rotation of dial <b>334</b> to angular position <b>2552</b>-<b>2</b> (e.g., during counterclockwise rotation of dial <b>334</b>), and an audio alert was generated for angular position <b>2552</b>-<b>2</b>, an audio alert is not generated for angular position <b>2552</b>-<b>3</b>, or alternatively the audio alert for angular position <b>2552</b>-<b>3</b> is delayed until the predefined time period has elapsed since the audio alert for angular position <b>2552</b>-<b>2</b> was generated. One of ordinary skill will recognize that analogous principles apply to clockwise rotation of dial <b>334</b>.</p><p id="p-0609" num="0681">In some embodiments, the rate at which audio outputs are generated for changes in audio output volume and/or angular position varies based on the speed of rotation of dial <b>334</b>. As indicated in graph <b>2556</b>, in some embodiments the number of audio alerts (e.g., &#x201c;click&#x201d; sounds) generated for a given amount of rotation of dial <b>334</b> decreases as the rotation speed of dial <b>334</b> increases. For example, if dial <b>334</b> is rotated slowly from angular position <b>2552</b>-<b>1</b> through angular positions <b>2552</b>-<b>2</b> through <b>2552</b>-<b>4</b>, more &#x201c;clicks&#x201d; are generated than if dial <b>334</b> were rotated quickly through the same angular positions. One of ordinary skill will recognize that this behavior is consistent with the enforcement of a minimum time period between audio alerts (e.g., because a minimum time period is enforced, some audio alerts that would have been generated during slower rotation of dial <b>334</b> may be skipped during faster rotation of dial <b>334</b>, thus decreasing the number of audio alerts per unit of rotation).</p><p id="p-0610" num="0682"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>E</figref> is a conceptual flow diagram illustrating an example audio alert that is conditionally generated based on the type of audio that a user has requested to be played. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>E</figref>, a request to play audio is received (<b>2560</b>). In some embodiments, the request to play audio is received at a wearable audio output device <b>301</b> such as earbuds <b>502</b> or headphones <b>301</b><i>b</i>. In some embodiments, the request to play audio is received in response to a corresponding user input that is received at an electronic device (e.g., device <b>100</b>) that is in communication with wearable audio output device <b>301</b>, and that requests that audio be played (e.g., selection via a displayed user interface of music or a movie to be played). In accordance with a determination that the requested audio includes spatial audio (e.g., the audio that is to be output is to have one or more simulated spatial locations, so that the sounds seem to come from specific location(s)) (<b>2562</b>&#x2014;Yes), an audio alert is played to indicate that the requested audio includes spatial audio content (<b>2564</b>). After the spatial audio indicator alert is played (<b>2564</b>), the requested audio (e.g., requested in operation <b>2560</b>) is played (<b>2566</b>). In accordance with a determination that the requested audio does not include spatial audio (<b>2562</b>&#x2014;No), the audio alert indicating spatial audio is not played, and the method proceeds directly to playing the requested audio (<b>2566</b>). In some embodiments, the spatial audio indicator alert is played in response to a request to play, from the beginning, the audio that includes spatial audio. In some embodiments, the spatial audio indicator alert is not played in response to a request to resume playback of the requested audio after a first portion of the requested audio has been played and playback has subsequently been paused.</p><p id="p-0611" num="0683"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>F</figref> illustrates example audio alerts to indicate the connection status of a wearable audio output device.

Providing additional control options without cluttering the user interface with additional displayed controls enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to achieve an intended result and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0618" num="0690">The wearable audio output device outputs (<b>2602</b>), via the wearable audio output device, first audio that is based on first media (e.g., track <b>2512</b>-<b>1</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref>) (e.g., from an electronic device that is in communication (e.g., paired) with the wearable audio output device).

In a scenario where the first audio output is generated, if the time interval between the first point and the second point is less than the predefined time period, the second audio output is not generated; but if the time interval between the first point and the second point is more than the predefined time period, the second audio output is generated. In another example where the first audio output is generated, if a time interval from the first point to the third point is less than the predefined time period, the third audio output is not generated (e.g., in addition to the second audio output not being generated); but if the time interval from the first point to the third point is more than the predefined time period, the third audio output is generated.</p><p id="p-0647" num="0719">In some embodiments, tactile outputs (e.g., corresponding to the audio outputs generated for the rotation of the rotatable input mechanism) are also generated for the rotation of the rotatable input mechanism. In some embodiments, the tactile outputs are subject to analogous timing and/or spacing constraints as those described above for the audio outputs.</p><p id="p-0648" num="0720">Outputting audio outputs in response to inputs via the rotatable input mechanism provides the user with confirmation that such inputs have been registered, particularly where the rotatable input mechanism is not itself a mechanical wheel that generates its own sound when rotated. Providing improved feedback to the user enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to achieve an intended result and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0649" num="0721">In some embodiments, outputting a respective audio output in response to receiving an input via a respective input device includes (<b>2634</b>) generating the respective audio output with a respective simulated spatial location that corresponds to a physical location (e.g., a physical spatial location) of the respective input device (e.g., so that the audio output sounds as though it were coming from the physical location of the respective input device). For example, an audio output generated in response to rotation (or a press) of the rotatable input mechanism is generated to sound as though the audio is coming from the location of the rotatable input mechanism (e.g., to be perceived as the rotatable input mechanism making sound when being rotated (or pressed)). Similarly, an audio output generated in response to a press of the input device is generated to sound as though the audio is coming from the location of the input device (e.g., to be perceived as the input device making a sound when pressed).

Providing improved feedback to the user enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to achieve an intended result and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0651" num="0723">In some embodiments, prior to outputting the first audio that is based on first media (e.g., in response to receiving a request to output the first audio) (<b>2636</b>): in accordance with a determination that the first audio includes audio associated with one or more physical spatial locations (e.g., spatial audio content that is to be output so as to sound as though the audio is coming from a particular physical location), the wearable audio output device outputs respective audio indicating that the first audio includes audio associated with one or more physical spatial locations (e.g., as described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>E</figref>). In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the first audio does not include audio associated with one or more (e.g., any) physical spatial locations, the wearable audio output device forgoes outputting the respective audio (e.g., as described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>E</figref>).</p><p id="p-0652" num="0724">Providing an audio indication before playing audio content that includes audio content that is to be output at different simulated spatial locations provides the user with feedback that the audio that is about to be played includes spatial audio content. Providing improved feedback to the user enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to achieve an intended result and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0653" num="0725">In some embodiments, prior to outputting the first audio that is based on first media (<b>2638</b>): the wearable audio output device detects placement of the wearable audio output device on a user (e.g., on the user's head and/or over the user's ears); and, in response to detecting placement of the wearable audio output device on a user, the wearable audio output device plays an audio indication. In accordance with a determination that the wearable audio output device is in communication with an electronic device (e.g., from which to receive audio for output), the audio indication is a first audio indication; and in accordance with a determination that the wearable audio output device is not in communication with an electronic device, the audio indication is a second audio indication that is different from the first audio indication. In some embodiments, the first audio indication indicates that placement of the wearable audio output device on the user has been detected and that the wearable audio output device is connected to an electronic device. In some embodiments, the second audio indication indicates that placement of the wearable audio output device has been detected without the wearable audio output device being connected to an electronic device. For example, as described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>F</figref>, first sound <b>2574</b> indicates that placement of headphones <b>301</b><i>b </i>on user <b>2570</b>'s head has been detected with headphones <b>301</b><i>b </i>being connected to device <b>100</b>, and second sound <b>2578</b> indicates that placement of headphones <b>301</b><i>b </i>on user <b>2570</b>'s head has been detected without headphones <b>301</b><i>b </i>being connected to device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0654" num="0726">Providing an audio indication in response to detecting placement of the wearable audio output device on a user, and providing different audio indications based on the connection status between the wearable audio output device and another device, provides the user with feedback that the wearable audio output device is correctly positioned and as to whether the wearable audio output device is ready to output audio. Providing improved feedback to the user enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to achieve an intended result and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0655" num="0727">In some embodiments, the wearable audio output device includes (<b>2640</b>) a first wearable component (e.g., a first earcup) and a second wearable component (e.g., a second earcup). In some embodiments, while the first wearable component is in a respective position relative to a first ear of a user (e.g., placed on or over an ear of the user, such as the right ear) and the second wearable component is in the respective position relative to a second ear of the user (e.g., placed on or over the other ear of the user, such as the left ear), and while the second wearable component (e.g., or more generally, the wearable audio output device, including also the first wearable component) is operating in a first audio output mode (e.g., in a noise control off audio output mode (sometimes called a bypass audio output mode or a standard audio output mode) or in an active noise control audio output mode), the wearable audio output device detects a change in position of the first wearable component to a position other than the respective position (e.g., detecting removal of the first wearable component from the respective position relative to the user's ear, such as by being lifted away from the user's ear or being placed elsewhere on the user's head, such as next to (e.g., behind, in front of, or above) the user's ear, so that the user's ear is not covered by the first wearable component). In some embodiments, in response to detecting the change in position of the first wearable component to a position other than the respective position: the wearable audio output device operates the second wearable component of the wearable audio output device in a second audio output mode that includes a greater degree of audio transparency than the first audio output mode (e.g., by the wearable audio output device transitioning itself or at least the second wearable component to a pass-through mode from a different mode such as from the noise control off audio output mode or from the active noise control audio output mode). This feature is described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>G</figref> and is analogous to the features described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>J</figref> and operation <b>1234</b> of method <b>1200</b>.</p><p id="p-0656" num="0728">In some embodiments, at least the second wearable component is operated in the pass-through audio output mode. In some embodiments, the removed first wearable component is also operated in the pass-through audio output mode (e.g., the wearable audio output device as a whole is operated in the pass-through audio output mode). In some embodiments, because the first wearable component has been removed, the first wearable component is not operated in the pass-through audio output mode (e.g., no pass-through audio components are provided via the first wearable component, because the user would not hear them while the first wearable component is removed, thereby potentially reducing power usage). In some embodiments, the wearable audio output device, or at least the second wearable component of the wearable audio output device, is maintained in the pass-through mode if the wearable audio output device was already operating in the pass-through mode.</p><p id="p-0657" num="0729">Operating the wearable audio output device in an audio output mode with a greater degree of audio transparency in response to detecting removal of a first wearable component of the wearable audio output device from an ear of the user provides the user with increased audio transparency of the audio output device in at least the second wearable component while it remains in, on, or over the other ear of the user, consistent with the removal of the first wearable component likely being an indication that the user wants to hear more ambient sound from his or her surrounding physical environment, and without requiring the user to manually change the audio output mode of the wearable audio output device. Performing an operation (e.g., automatically) when a set of conditions has been met without requiring further user input enhances the operability of the device and makes the user-device interface more efficient (e.g., by helping the user to achieve an intended result and reducing user mistakes when operating/interacting with the device), which, additionally, reduces power usage and improves battery life of the device by enabling the user to use the device more quickly and efficiently.</p><p id="p-0658" num="0730">It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b>A-<b>26</b>D</figref> have been described is merely an example and is not intended to indicate that the described order is the only order in which the operations could be performed.
