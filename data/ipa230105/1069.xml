The wound therapy system may include a therapy device and a wound dressing. The therapy device may include an instillation fluid canister, a removable fluid canister, a valve, a pneumatic pump, an instillation pump, and a controller. The wound dressing can be applied to a patient's skin surrounding a wound. The therapy device can be configured to deliver instillation fluid to the wound and provide negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) by maintaining the wound at negative pressure. Components of the wound therapy device, the wound dressing, and the wound site form a negative pressure circuit.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The controller may be configured to operate the pneumatic pump, the instillation pump, and/or other controllable components of the therapy device. According to some embodiments in which the NPWT treatment provided using the NPWT system includes the instillation of instillation fluid to the wound site, the controller may be configured to estimate the volume of the wound site and/or a volume of a quantity of instillation fluid delivered to the wound site based on a comparison of dynamic pressure responses observed as fluid is instilled to the wound site to model pressure response data. Because the dynamic pressure responses are observed simultaneously with the instillation of fluid to the wound site, the system and methods described herein are configured to allow the controller to estimate wound site volume without requiring any additional steps and/or time than would otherwise be required to provide instillation therapy treatment using the NPWT system.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to some embodiments, the wound site volume estimate based on dynamic pressure responses observed during fluid instillation may be used to verify and/or may be verified using wound site volume estimates obtained using any other number of methods to provide the NPWT system with higher confidence wound site volume estimates. For example, in some embodiments, the controller may compare the wound site volume estimated based on dynamic pressure responses observed during fluid instillation to a wound site volume estimated based on a comparison of dynamic pressure responses observed during the purging of negative pressure within the entirety and/or selected portions of the negative pressure circuit.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In various embodiments, the controller may additionally, or alternatively, be configured to prevent and/or detect overfill during the instillation of instillation fluid to the wound site. According to some such embodiments, the controller may use a previously obtained wound site volume estimate (estimated, e.g., during a prior instillation of fluid to the wound site; based on a comparison of dynamic pressure responses observed during the purging of negative pressure from the negative pressure circuit; etc.) as a backstop value against which the volume of the quantity of fluid that has been instilled to the wound site is compared to prevent overfilling the wound site with instillation fluid. In some embodiments, the previously obtained wound site volume estimate may additionally, or alternatively, be used to identify a model pressure decay curve representative of a dynamic pressure response that would be expected during the instillation of instillation fluid to the wound site to attain a predetermined target pressure, as measured, e.g., at any one or more of the wound site, within the tubing fluid connected the wound site to the therapy device, within the removed fluid canister, at the therapy device, etc. In such embodiments, dynamic pressure response at the wound site is monitored in real-time and compared against the model pressure decay curve, with deviations in the monitored pressure at and the expected pressure based on the model decay curve being used to alert the controller to a possible overfill situation which may need to be addressed.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the controller may additionally, or alternatively, estimate and monitor the volume of the wound site at a plurality of times during wound treatment, with the controller determining healing progression of the wound site based on changes in the estimated wound site volume over the course of NPWT treatment. By monitoring the healing progression of the wound site, the controller may be configured to alert a user if the healing of the wound site is not progressing as intended or expected.

In such embodiments, this measured real-time pressure may be compared against a model pressure decay curve (such as described with reference to step <b>502</b> in the method <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> above) representative of a volume corresponding to the estimated wound site <b>114</b> volume obtained at step <b>702</b> and the conditions under which instillation fluid <b>105</b> is being instilled to the wound site at step <b>706</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in the event that the measured real-time pressure decay does not correspond to the expected pressure decay of the model pressure decay curve, at step <b>710</b>, the controller <b>118</b> may generate an alert to the user. In the event that the real-time pressure decay is changing at a rate that is greater than the expected rate, at step <b>712</b> the controller <b>118</b> may optionally also stop the instillation of instillation fluid <b>105</b> to the wound site <b>114</b>, so as to prevent an overfill of fluid.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">As will be understood, the measured real-time pressure decay may vary from the expected pressure decay predicted by the model data for any number of reasons. For example, in embodiments in which the wound site <b>114</b> has decreased in volume since the last time that the volume of the wound site <b>114</b> had been estimated, it is anticipated that pressure decay observed as a result of the no w-smaller dimensioned wound site <b>114</b> will vary from the expected pressure decay predicted by the model data. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the controller <b>118</b> may be configured to generate an alarm at step <b>710</b> and/or stop the instillation of instillation fluid <b>105</b> at step <b>712</b> only in the event that the difference between the measured pressure decay and the expected pressure decay exceeds a predetermined threshold. According to some embodiments, this threshold may correspond to a difference that is greater than approximately &#xb1;15 percent, and more specifically greater than approximately &#xb1;10 percent, and even more specifically greater than approximately &#xb1;5 percent.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">If no difference between the real-time and expected pressure measurement is detected at step <b>708</b> (or if the difference does not exceed the predetermined threshold), a determination is made at step <b>714</b> as to whether a predetermined target pressure has been attained at any one or more of the tubing <b>110</b>, the removed fluid canister <b>106</b>, the therapy device <b>102</b>, at the wound site <b>114</b>, the pump <b>120</b>, etc. If the pressure measured has been determined to be substantially equal to the predetermined target pressure, instillation of the instillation fluid <b>1045</b> is stopped at step <b>716</b>. According to various embodiments, the predetermined target pressure at step <b>714</b> may be between approximately minus 15 mmHg and approximately 15 mmHg, more specifically between approximately minus 5 mmHg and 5 mmH, and even more specifically approximately 0 mmHg.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to some embodiments, if the target pressure has not yet been attained at step <b>714</b>, step <b>706</b> of instilling fluid to the wound site <b>114</b> (and optionally step <b>708</b> of comparing monitored pressure to expected pressure based on model data) may be repeated until it is determined at step <b>714</b> that the target pressure has been attained.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, according to some embodiments, the method <b>700</b> may optionally include step <b>718</b>, which may provide an additional layer of safeguard against overfill for the NPWT system <b>100</b> in the event that the comparison of measured wound site <b>114</b> pressure to the target pressure is insufficient to detect a potential overfill situation. In such embodiments, at step <b>718</b> a total volume of instillation fluid <b>105</b> instilled to the wound site <b>114</b> since the initiation of step <b>706</b> may be compared against the wound site <b>114</b> volume estimate obtained at step <b>702</b>, with the instillation of instillation fluid <b>105</b> being stopped at step <b>716</b> if the volume of instilled fluid is determined to be substantially the same as the estimated wound site <b>114</b> volume. As will be understood, by preventing the instillation of a volume of a quantity of instillation fluid <b>105</b> that exceeds the estimated volume of the wound site <b>114</b>, step <b>718</b> of the method <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> provides an additional level of protection against overfill for the NPWT system <b>100</b>. Alternatively, if the volume of instilled instillation fluid <b>105</b> is less than the estimated wound site <b>114</b> volume, the method <b>700</b> may continue to instill fluid to the wound site <b>114</b> at step <b>706</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to some embodiments, at step <b>720</b>, a current volume of the wound site <b>114</b> may optionally be estimated based on the most recent instillation of fluid during step <b>706</b>, with this most recent estimated wound site <b>114</b> volume being stored at step <b>722</b> for any number of future uses (e.g., for future instillations of fluid according to the method <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, to monitor healing of the wound site <b>114</b> according to the method <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, etc.). In situations in which the instillation of fluid was stopped at step <b>716</b> in response to the target pressure being determined to have been attained at step <b>714</b>, the wound site <b>114</b> volume may be estimated in a manner similar to that described with reference to step <b>508</b> of the method <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in which the pressure decay observed at any one or more of the tubing <b>110</b>, the removed fluid canister <b>106</b>, the therapy device <b>102</b>, at the wound site <b>114</b>, the pump <b>120</b>, etc. during the instillation of fluid is compared to model pressure decay data to identify a corresponding volume of the wound site <b>114</b>. If instillation of instillation fluid <b>105</b> was stopped at step <b>716</b> in response to the volume of instilled fluid being determined to be substantially equal to or greater than the estimated wound site <b>114</b> volume at step <b>718</b>, according to some embodiments, the wound site <b>114</b> volume estimated at step <b>720</b> may correspond to the prior wound site <b>114</b> volume estimate.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As noted above, according to some embodiments, it may be desirable to verify the wound site <b>114</b> volume estimated during instillation of fluid to the wound site <b>114</b> (such as, e.g., described with reference to the method <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and/or the method <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) against wound site <b>114</b> volume estimates obtained according to any other number of different methods. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, an exemplary embodiment of one such method <b>800</b> of verifying a wound site <b>114</b> volume estimate obtained during fluid instillation against a wound site <b>114</b> volume estimated according to another method, or vice versa, is illustrated.

As the negative pressure circuit <b>200</b> is purged during step <b>804</b>, pressure decay within the negative pressure circuit <b>200</b> is monitored (using, e.g. pressure sensor(s) <b>115</b>).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Once the predetermined threshold pressure has been attained within the negative pressure circuit <b>200</b>, the pneumatic pump <b>120</b> is once again operated at step <b>806</b> to evacuate air from the negative pressure circuit <b>200</b> to attain a desired negative pressure with the negative pressure circuit <b>200</b>.

As the removed fluid canister circuit is purged during step <b>810</b>, pressure decay within the removed fluid canister circuit is monitored (using, e.g. pressure sensor <b>115</b>). At step <b>812</b> a first volume of the wound site <b>114</b> is estimated using the pressure decay observed within the negative pressure circuit <b>200</b> and the removed fluid canister circuit during steps <b>804</b> and <b>810</b>, respectively.
