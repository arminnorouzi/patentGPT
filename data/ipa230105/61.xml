Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention relates to viewing life in fish-style tanks, and more particularly, to a device and method of use to draw fish or other animals to a selected location in a tank for better viewing.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">2. Description of Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 37 CFR 1.98</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Several designs for fish tank accessories and items that interest fish have been designed in the past. Most of these include a variety of products of devices that sit on the bottom of the tank. For example, these may include natural and artificial reefs, simulated structures, real and artificial plants, treasure boxes and small pirate ships. None of these include the features of the present invention that draw a fish to a side wall of a tank to better view the fish.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Applicant believes the closest prior art is found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,531,477 issued to Crossman. However, the Crossman device, among other features, requires a pump and a nozzle directing a curtain of water. In contrast, the present device has no required moving parts and does not require a pump. Further, by Crossman having a pump and moving water that design requires an enclosure to channel the water. An advantage of the present design is that when viewing the life in the tank the observer only has to look through the tank wall and not through any structure of the added device. Additionally, the Crossman device works only when submerged to pump water. The present device and method works in wet or dry tanks.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Applicant also notes U.S. Pat. No. 3,512,503 issued to Willinger disclosing a compartmented fish display case. The present device and method of use differ from Willinger because the Willinger device requires a user to manually place the fish inside the device. The present design draws fish or other life inside the tank to enter the structure of their own free will. This Willinger design is to temporarily display fish for sale and does not permit fish to come and go naturally. Willinger also only works for fish and not other types of animals.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other patents and prior art describe related subject matter that provide for a number of more or less complicated features that fail to solve the problem in an efficient and economical way. None of these patents suggest the novel features of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A brief abstract of the technical disclosure in the specification and title are provided as well for the purposes of complying with 37 CFR 1.72 and are not intended to be used for interpreting or limiting the scope of the claims.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Without limiting the scope of the invention, a brief summary of some of the claimed embodiments of the invention is set forth below.

This description is exemplary of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the particular embodiments illustrated and described.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For the purpose of this disclosure, like reference numerals in the figures shall refer to like features unless otherwise indicated or is obvious by context.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The subject device and method of drawing fish to a side of a fish tank is sometimes referred to as the device, the invention, the fish shelter, the shelter assembly, the tube, the fish attraction device and/or method, the fish feeder, the machine or other similar terms. These terms may be used interchangeably as context requires and from use and drawings the intent becomes apparent. The masculine can sometimes refer to the feminine and neuter and vice versa. The plural may include the singular and singular the plural as appropriate from a fair and reasonable interpretation in the situation.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to the drawings, where the present invention is generally referred to with numeral <b>10</b>, it can be observed that it basically includes a shelter assembly <b>12</b>, a shelter assembly <b>14</b>, attachment points <b>16</b>, a panel <b>18</b>, an edge <b>20</b>, an edge <b>22</b>, an edge <b>24</b>, attachment points <b>26</b>, a panel <b>28</b>, a panel <b>30</b>, a panel <b>32</b>, a waterline <b>34</b>, an aperture <b>36</b>, a tank assembly <b>38</b>, a panel <b>40</b>, a panel <b>42</b>, attachment points <b>44</b>, a food <b>46</b>, a rim <b>48</b>, a joint <b>50</b>, a panel <b>52</b>, a joint <b>54</b>, a panel <b>56</b>, a joint <b>58</b>, a panel <b>60</b>, a flex segment <b>62</b>, a panel <b>64</b>, and a corner <b>66</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of a tank assembly <b>38</b> containing an example of prior art <b>11</b> and two different embodiments of devices used to practice the subject method including shelter assembly <b>12</b> and shelter assembly <b>14</b>. Generally, the tank assembly <b>38</b> is comprised of a rigid material with at least one transparent side to view the contents and that is designed and adapted to contain water, typically embodied as a classic style fish tank.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the past, fish have been placed in the interior of the tank assembly <b>38</b> and are free to wander about the volume of the tank. The fish may interact with prior art structures <b>11</b>. For example, prior art may include small structures, reefs, vegetation or other articles around which the fish can swim and hide. These often obscure the ability of those who wish to view and enjoy the beauty of aquatic creatures inside the tank because they are often not visible inside and behind the structures.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">An important aspect of the present invention provides for a structure attached to a transparent side wall of a tank. The inventive structure is integral to the method for attracting fish to the side wall of the tank for viewing, protection, feeding and general enjoyment of the aquatic life in the tank.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The shelter assembly <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a basic example of a fish attracting structure or shelter. It comprises a panel <b>18</b> with a three-dimensional relief and a plurality of attachment points <b>16</b>. The attachment points <b>16</b> connect the shelter assembly <b>12</b> to an interior surface of a wall of the tank assembly <b>38</b>. The relief in the shelter assembly <b>12</b> provides a volume between the panel <b>18</b> and the wall of the tank assembly <b>38</b> to which the shelter assembly <b>12</b> is attached. The fish swims into this volume inside the shelter assembly <b>12</b> on its own free will. In fact, the design naturally attracts the fish into the volume inside.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">This relief area between the panel <b>18</b> and the interior wall of the tank assembly <b>38</b> provides a space for the fish F (or other aquatic life) to find a sanctuary and refuge. This also positions the fish F in a location adjacent to the wall of the tank assembly <b>38</b> that is in a desired location for improved viewing of that aquatic life F through the clear wall of the tank.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The panel <b>18</b> of the shelter assembly <b>12</b> will also have an edge <b>20</b> that defines an entry portal for the fish F to enter the shelter assembly <b>12</b>. Edges <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> on the panel <b>18</b> are generally close enough to the wall of the tank assembly <b>38</b> to which it is attached to partially enclose the interior volume of the shelter assembly so that entry can only be made past the edge <b>20</b>. There may be one or more ingress and egress routes into the shelter assembly <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In this example of the shelter assembly <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> there are open ends defined by edge <b>20</b> and the opposing edge. It should be appreciated that there may be a single opening at edge <b>20</b> with a closed opposing side or there may be openings at each lateral edge of the panel <b>18</b> allowing the fish F to completely pass through the shelter assembly <b>12</b>. More openings are also possible.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The attachment points <b>16</b> allow the shelter assembly <b>12</b> to be adhered to an interior surface of the tank assembly <b>38</b>. The attachment points <b>16</b> may be characterized as suction cups that adhere to the interior surface of the tank assembly in any location and any orientation that the user desires. This also allows the shelter assembly <b>12</b> to be installed in a wide variety of different tank assemblies <b>38</b> that were not necessarily intended to include the shelter assembly <b>12</b>. The device can be retrofitted into any existing tank. Once installed, the shelter assembly may be repositioned or removed for cleaning with ease.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The attachment points <b>16</b> may also be characterized as any other means to attach the shelter assembly <b>12</b> to the interior wall of the tank assembly <b>38</b>. For example, the attachment points <b>16</b> may be pads onto which an adhesive is applied to stick the shelter assembly <b>12</b> inside the tank assembly <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The attachment points may be comprised of magnets that have a corresponding attractive material that pinches the glass between an interior and exterior magnetically attractive element. For example, two magnets or a magnet and a ferrous counterpart may each be on opposite sides of the clear glass panel to which the shelter assembly <b>12</b> is affixed.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Likewise, any method that will allow the shelter assembly <b>12</b> to be held against a side wall of the tank assembly <b>38</b> may be suitable for practicing the method of attracting a fish to the side wall the tank. A hook placed over a top rim of the tank assembly <b>38</b> and holding the shelter assembly against a side wall of the tank assembly <b>38</b> may also be suitable. A stand or legs could also be placed on the bottom of the tank to support the shelter assembly.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The critical aspect is that an area to provide shelter and apparent protection to marine life be provided adjacent to a panel of the tank assembly <b>38</b> to attract and hold the marine life close to that panel to allow for easy viewing through the clear side of the tank.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Yet referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, shelter assembly <b>14</b> demonstrates several variations of the inventive concept. For example, instead of the curved panel <b>18</b> of shelter assembly <b>12</b>, shelter assembly <b>14</b> has a more angular structure comprised of panels <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>. Although shelter assembly <b>14</b> shows a generally rectangular cross-section, other geometric profiles are readily suitable and within the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, two panels may provide a triangular cross-section or four panels may provide a pentagonal cross-section or other number may provide a corresponding cross-sectional shape. However, each should have an area through which the marine life nestled inside can be plainly viewed through the side wall of the tank assembly <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">By having a volume inside, for any version of the shelter assembly the marine life in the tank assembly <b>38</b> instinctively seeks refuge and protection within. An innate sense natural to the fish or other marine life causes them to seek and remain in a closed and protected environment provided by the shelter assembly. By having that shelter assembly against a clear side wall of the tank, enhanced viewing for those animals inside the tank is achieved.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an optional feature of the shelter assembly <b>14</b> to be an aperture <b>36</b> that is provided in the upper panel <b>28</b>. In this example, the shelter assembly <b>14</b> is located on an interior wall of the tank to position the panel <b>28</b> at or about the waterline <b>34</b> of the tank. The aperture <b>36</b> provides an ingress route for a user to deposit food or another object to the fish therein. The aperture <b>36</b> may also allow the fish to gulp air or blow bubbles.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a similar example where a semi tubular horizontal panel <b>42</b> is connected to a semi tubular vertical panel <b>40</b> at a joint <b>50</b>. Attachment points <b>44</b> affix this shelter assembly to a side wall of the tank assembly so that the rim <b>48</b> is at about the waterline <b>34</b>. The rim <b>48</b> may also be placed above or below this waterline <b>34</b>. This allows a user to deposit food <b>46</b> or other object to the interior of this shelter assembly. This can attract a fish into the shelter assembly or can encourage a fish to remain in the shelter assembly longer.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Similarly, the aperture <b>36</b> in shelter assembly <b>14</b> or the vertical panel <b>40</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, may be used as a breathing port. For example, some fish, such as bettas, have habits of sipping air or blowing bubbles. By having an opening on an upper side of the shelter assembly at or near the waterline <b>34</b>, the behaviors of certain fish may be accommodated. This can encourage a fish to enter and remain inside a shelter assembly for longer viewing periods.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The attachment points <b>44</b> are similar to the alternate versions of attachment points <b>16</b> and <b>26</b>, described above. Any of the attachment points can be any means to temporarily or permanently affix the shelter devices to the interior surface of the tank assembly <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a tank assembly <b>38</b> including optional elements of an embodiment of a shelter assembly. Panel <b>52</b> and panel <b>56</b> are joined together at joint <b>54</b> to attach to two separate walls of the tank assembly <b>38</b> straddling both sides of the corner <b>66</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Similarly, panel <b>56</b> and panel <b>60</b> are joined on a single wall of the tank assembly <b>38</b>. However, in this example the panel <b>60</b> is not parallel to panel <b>56</b>. Instead, the joint <b>58</b> allows an angular connection between panel <b>56</b> and panel <b>60</b> so that the fish inside the shelter can swim through panel <b>60</b> to a higher level in the water. Panels <b>56</b> and <b>60</b> may be permanently joined together at joint <b>58</b>. Alternatively, the joint <b>58</b> may be fabricated at a complementary angle between panel <b>56</b> and panel <b>60</b> so that they join sufficiently to afford protection and calm to the sea life within the shelter assembly.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">An optional flexible segment <b>62</b> is provided between panel <b>60</b> and panel <b>64</b>. This flexible segment <b>62</b> can be used to place panels on either side of a corner between walls of the tank assembly <b>38</b> or may connect panels <b>60</b> and <b>64</b> at any desired angle.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Any of the panels may be made from materials having specified opacity. Some versions of the panels may be entirely translucent. Other panels may include a treatment to limit the amount of light that passes through that panel. For example, a surface of a panel may be partially frosted to limit the light transmitted through the panel.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The panels may be formed from generally rigid materials such as plastics, metal, ceramic, porcelain or glass. Other rigid and durable materials may also be suitable if they can hold the relief shape and to be affixed to an interior wall of a tank assembly <b>38</b>. The fish will remain visible through the unobstructed clear side wall of the tank for viewing because the panel material should not substantially block viewing of the interior of the shelter assembly through the clear side wall of the tank onto which it is attached.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The panels may also include a colorant or be tinted to a specified shade. The panels may include light filtering treatments such as polarization or ultraviolet filters. Different types of marine life may be attracted to or repelled by certain color, filter and/or degrees of opacity. Combinations of these characteristics are desired for applications targeting certain fish or with particular types of tank lighting.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, a betta fish will generally tend to prefer and enter a translucent panel but may be reticent to enter a shelter with opaque panels. Other marine life, such as an aquatic salamander, prefers an opaque shelter that may appear to provide greater threat protection. Other fish and marine animals may prefer different colors or to have certain wavelengths filtered through the panel walls. The characteristics of the optics of the panels may be considered in combination with a light source illuminating the interior of the tank assembly <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The opacity of a particular panel may also provide shelter in the form of shade from the illumination on the interior of the tank. This may provide comfort to marine life and encourage them to remain inside the shelter assembly longer for better viewing.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The panels may also include a textured treatment to adjust the level of obscurity. For example, a crazed, crackled, mottled, etched, wavy, dimpled, wrinkled or other textured treatment to limit to varying degrees the ability of the marine life to see through the panel. This can affect their sense of threat level and can improve the effectiveness of the shelter. If a fish cannot see through the shelter it may not perceive any other fish as threats and therefore may be more tranquil with a feeling of safety inside the shelter assembly.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The level of optical clarity and obscurity may be manipulated in the manufacturing process through a range of transparency and translucent embodiments. This may be controlled by material, surface design, ornamentation or other material or surface enhancements that affect the aquatic creature's ability to view through the panel. By having a sense of being enclosed and secure the fish being viewed may be encouraged to enter and remain in the shelter.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Generally, the side wall of the tank assembly <b>38</b> onto which the shelter assembly is attached is clear to permit viewing of a fish or other marine life binding sanctuary inside the shelter assembly. By placing the shelter assembly in a location where people have direct access to viewing the side of the tank assembly <b>38</b>, the marine life is presented for easy viewing. The panel assembly may also provide a background resulting in visual contrast that makes the aquatic life more defined and easier to see and enjoy.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Any of the panel treatments may also be used as a decorative feature in addition to or as an alternative to reasons to encourage particular species or types of aquatic life to enter and remain in a shelter assembly. Any of the panel treatments disclosed herein may be used in combination or individually. For example, a panel may have multiple colors, multiple opacities, ornamentation, visual effects and/or areas with different surface treatments.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The dimensions of the interior volume bounded by the one or more panels in a shelter assembly may also be adjusted for the size and type of marine life targeted. For example, some types of marine life prefer a compact and more tightly enclosed volume. Whereas, others may not enter a tightly confined space. Larger fish may require larger shelter assemblies. Smaller fish may require smaller shelter assemblies. Some fish may group or school into a shelter assembly dimension for such activity. Certain species efficient may be encouraged to mate in such confines or to lay and tend eggs, hatchlings or fry.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">An effective version of the shelter assembly may be described as partial pipes or partial tubes with an open side facing the side wall of the tank assembly <b>38</b> that bound the interior volume where the fish can position itself. Other shapes may be equally effective and may offer a different ornamental or aesthetic form. For example, partial cubes, partial spheres or other irregular shapes resembling rocks, coral or other natural features may be equally effective and provide a degree of aesthetics to fit into other features of the tank.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Similarly, the size, shape and dimension of the ingress and egress openings for the marine life may affect the look and performance of the shelter assembly. Having a single ingress or multiple ingress features may be used to encourage or discourage particular marine life. In another example, multiple ingress routes may be provided without a direct line of sight between those ingress routes. In other words, the ingress routes are on different sides of a visual barrier or around a corner or bend in the shelter structure.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">An example of this is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> where panel <b>52</b> is on a different but adjacent wall from panel <b>56</b>. A fish entering panel <b>52</b> will not see the egress from panel <b>56</b> to panel <b>60</b> because it is around the corner <b>66</b>. Similarly, a shelter assembly configured similar to that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may be entirely submerged in the water allowing the marine life to enter and exit from a side or from the upper rim <b>48</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Multiple panels may be placed adjacent to each other and affixed with their respective attachment points to the side wall to maintain their relative positions. Adjacent panels may also be snapped or clipped together to form more elaborate shelter assemblies.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an example of shelter assembly with panels at multiple depths and in multiple configurations. Any combination of any of the panels and configurations disclosed herein may be used interchangeably and remain within the inventive concept provided herein.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The interior surface of the shelter assemblies may optionally include small pits, crevices or micro-chambers. These may be constructed into the device to facilitate habitation by live food sources such as copepods, amphipods, worms, <i>daphnia </i>and other similar creatures to further increase the visits to the shelter device by the fish.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">It should be appreciated that the terms tank and fish tank are intended to include any type of enclosure that holds an animal. This includes, for example, common fish tanks, terrariums, fish bowls and other structures with at least one clear side for observing the creatures inside with the present device or without. These enclosures may be fresh water, brackish, marine, completely dry or with a water feature combined with a dry area. These terms are used interchangeably to show an example of the scope of animal life, environment and structure and are not intended to be limiting.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Generally, the term fish refers to any creature using the present device and method. A tank generally includes any enclosure containing a clear surface in which to place the device. A side wall of tank is also used interchangeably with wall of enclosure, or wall of tank or viewing wall of enclosure and are used for illustration and not intended to be limiting to a specific type.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Similarly, the terms fish is intended to encompass all animals found in aquariums, terrariums and other animal structures. For example, this may include any fish reptiles, amphibians, arachnids, insects or other creature. It includes both aquatic and non-aquatic, fresh water and salt water. The term marine is inclusive of other environments and is provided to be illustrative and not limiting.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">An important version of the invention can be fairly described as a method of drawing fish (or any animal living in a tank) to an edge of a fish tank for better viewing. The fish tank should have at least one clear wall through which viewers look to observe the animal life. A shelter assembly is provided comprised of a panel that has at least one attachment point. The attachment point is used to affix the shelter assembly to an interior surface of the transparent wall of the tank. The panel is formed with a relief away from an interior surface of the transparent wall so that an interior shelter volume is created which is bounded by the panel and the transparent wall of the fish tank. This also creates an ingress and egress route between the panel and the transparent wall of the tank so that the animal life can enter and exit the interior volume of the shelter. The shelter volume is dimensioned to fit the particular animal life in the tank. Optionally, an upper side of the shelter may have an aperture through which to deposit food or to allow the fish to contact the air above the surface of the water, if there is water in the tank. Optionally, the panel may have a treatment such as a texturing or a coloring or be partially opaque fully opaque or clear, or may have a light filtration treatment applied to it. Optionally, a plurality of shelter assemblies may be connected adjacent to each other and affixed to the interior surface of the wall of the tank. Optionally the interior of the shelter assembly may include an indentation or feature to encourage the establishment of live food sources to further encourage the fish to enter and remain in the shelter assembly.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The foregoing description conveys the best understanding of the objectives and advantages of the present invention. Different embodiments may be made of the inventive concept of this invention. It is to be understood that all matter disclosed herein is to be interpreted merely as illustrative, and not in a limiting sense.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
