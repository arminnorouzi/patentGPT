Such allocation can block network resources and can incur processing that can create network congestion, particularly in scenarios in which the communication session is an automated voice session.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is to be understood that this summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure. This summary is exemplary and not restrictive, and it is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the disclosure nor delineate the scope thereof. The sole purpose of this summary is to explain and exemplify certain concepts of the disclosure as an introduction to the following extensive, more detailed description.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One or more embodiments of the disclosure relate to admission control of a communication session (or sessions). The admission control can be implemented by a network node at the boundary of the network or a subsystem thereof. In one aspect, the admission control can be implemented during a predetermined period and can be based at least on an admission criterion, which can be specific to an end-point device, e.g., a target device or an origination device. The admission criterion can be configurable and, in certain implementations, it can be obtained from historical performance associated with establishment of communication sessions. Such historical performance can be assessed within a period of a configurable span. The methods and systems can comprise initiating, at a first network node, a communication session associated with a target device, determining, at the first network node, if a record is cached that is indicative of one or more of the originating device or a user associated with the originating device, and processing, by the first network node, the communication session based at least on a predetermined session admission metric in response to the record being determined to be cached.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an aspect, admission control methods and systems can be implemented to manage automated communications, also referred to as automated calls (&#x201c;robocalls&#x201d;), and the like. There are many types of automated communications, with some automated communications desired more than others. The methods and systems can utilize a registry of numbers associated with communication systems that perform automated communications to govern whether or not to complete a communication session. The methods and systems can comprise receiving a communication request for a destination call number from an incoming call number, determining whether the incoming call number is present in a registry, processing the communication request based on the determination of whether the incoming call number is present in the registry, determining whether the destination call number is valid, and updating the registry based on destination call number validity. The communication request can comprise an automated communication.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additional aspects or advantages of the disclosure will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the subject disclosure.

As yet another example, a unit can be an apparatus that provides specific functionality through electronic functional elements without mechanical parts, the electronic functional elements can include a processor therein to execute software or firmware that provides, at least in part, the functionality of the electronic functional elements. The foregoing examples and related illustrations are but a few examples and are not intended to be limiting. In addition, while such illustrations are presented for a unit, the foregoing examples also apply to a node, a function, a controller, a component, a system, a platform, and the like. It is noted that in certain embodiments, or in connection with certain aspects or features such embodiments, the terms &#x201c;unit,&#x201d; &#x201c;component,&#x201d; &#x201c;system,&#x201d; &#x201c;interface,&#x201d; &#x201c;platform&#x201d; &#x201c;node,&#x201d; &#x201c;function&#x201d; can be utilized interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Throughout the description and claims of this specification, the words &#x201c;comprise&#x201d; and &#x201c;having&#x201d; and their variations, such as &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; and &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;having&#x201d; and &#x201c;has,&#x201d; mean &#x201c;including but not limited to,&#x201d; and are not intended to exclude, for example, other units, nodes, components, functions, interfaces, actions, steps, or the like. &#x201c;Exemplary&#x201d; means &#x201c;an example of&#x201d; and is not intended to convey an indication of a preferred or ideal embodiment. &#x201c;Such as&#x201d; is not used in a restrictive sense, but for explanatory purposes.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In view of the various aspects of processing a request for an asset in a network, such as those described herein, exemplary methods that can be implemented in accordance with the disclosure can be better appreciated with reference to the figures and associated descriptions. For simplicity of explanation, the exemplary methods disclosed herein are presented and described as a series of actions (also referred to as steps), pictorially represented with a block or as a delivered or received message in a call flow. However, it is to be understood and appreciated that implementation, and related advantages, of such methods is not limited by the order of actions, as some actions may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other actions from that shown and described herein. For example, the various methods (also referred to as processes) of the subject disclosure can alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, when disparate functional elements (network nodes, units, etc.) implement disparate portions of the methods of the subject disclosure, an interaction diagram or a call flow can represent such methods or processes. Furthermore, not all illustrated actions or messages may be required to implement a method in accordance with the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The methods disclosed throughout the subject specification can be stored on an article of manufacture, or computer-readable storage medium, to facilitate transporting and transferring such methods to computing devices (e.g., desktop computers, mobile computers, mobile telephones, and the like) for execution, and thus implementation, by a processor or for storage in a memory.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Reference will now be made in detail to the various embodiments and related aspects of the subject disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and their previous and following description. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The disclosure identifies and addresses, in one aspect, the issue of errors in servicing of communication sessions in a network. Such errors can range from failure to establish a communication session (e.g., faulty connectivity, etc.) to resource blockade, in which network resources available for communication are allocated without establishment of the communication session. As described in greater detail below, the disclosure relates to admission control of a communication session in network. In certain embodiments, the admission control can be implemented by a network node at the boundary of the network or a subsystem thereof. In one aspect, the admission control can be implemented during a predetermined period and can be based at least on an admission criterion, which can be specific to an end-point device, e.g., a target device or an origination device. The admission criterion can be configurable and, in certain implementations, it can be obtained from historical performance associated with establishment of communication session. Such historical performance can be assessed within a sliding period of a configurable span. Certain functional elements of the disclosure can be implemented (e.g., performed) by software, hardware, or a combination of software and hardware. Functional elements of the various embodiment(s) described in the present specification and illustrated in the annexed drawings can be employed in operational environments (access network, telecommunication network, signaling network, etc.) that can include, for example, digital equipment, analog equipment, or both, wired or wireless equipment, etc.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an aspect, provided are methods and systems for handling automated phone calls, referred to as &#x201c;robocalls.&#x201d; An automated communication can utilize a computerized autodialer to deliver a pre-recorded message. Automated communications are often associated with political and telemarketing phone campaigns, but can also be used for public-service or emergency announcements. Some automated communications use personalized audio messages to simulate an actual personal phone call. Overuse of automated communications can overload network systems and harass the public. However, automated communications can provide a benefit to the public by providing an efficient means for communicating relevant information. The methods and systems provided can ensure the benefits of automated communications are realized, while minimizing the negative effects.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Accordingly, the methods and systems provided can establish a registry of unique identifiers associated with automated communications. In an aspect, the registry can be an OID (Origination Identity) Registry, for example. By way of example, an OID can be an address of record, a calling number, call party number, origination address, origination phone number, origination SIP URI or Tel URI, Fully Qualified Domain Name (fqdn), email address, IP address, and the like. The OID Registry can comprise Automatic Number Identification (ANI) functionality. The OID Registry can comprise phone numbers responsible for originating one or more automated communications. An automated communication provider can register one or more phone numbers with the OID Registry to ensure delivery of the automated communication.
