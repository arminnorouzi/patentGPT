In the scope of these therapies, depending on the clinical picture, often a plurality of drugs and optionally parenteral feeding must be administered. Thus, there is a need of modular infusion devices adapted to be easily equipped with a plurality of fluid pumps/infusion pumps. For this purpose it is common to arrange the infusion pumps as a group during use in or at or by means of a supporting or holding device so as to ensure an intended operation and an intended use of the pumps.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A supporting and/or holding device for the position-safe holding of at least one medical fluid pump during its operation is, for instance, known from DE 10 2017 122 044 A1. This device comprises at least one plug-in position for holding the respective medical fluid pump which is provided with a guiding structure cooperating with the fluid pump when it is conveyed from a distal position to the proximal operating position. For this purpose, a plurality of vertically spaced trays adapted for receiving the at least one medical fluid pump project at the front side of the basic body of the supporting and/or holding device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, DE 40 30 368 C1 discloses modular infusion devices comprising a plurality of infusion pumps. The infusion device comprises a joint device holder at which numerous infusion devices/infusion pumps are fastened. The device holder comprises a column against which U-shaped housings of the infusion devices are pushed. Supporting elements as pushing guides for the housings and coupling elements which are connected with corresponding counterparts of the housings are provided at the column.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventionally, each of the medical fluid pumps comprises a display individually indicating an error occurring. In the case of a simultaneous operation of a plurality of these medical fluid pumps, especially if they are fastened in a plurality of supporting and/or holding devices, this individual display of errors may easily become confusing for the operator.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore an object of the present disclosure to avoid or at least mitigate the afore-described disadvantages. For this purpose, a supporting/holding or arranging device for medical fluid pumps is to be provided which, during the operation of a number of (fluid) pumps, ensures a clear display of errors which is easy to perceive visually.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The disclosure accordingly relates to a supporting/arranging or holding device for the (position-safe) holding/fixing of at least one medical fluid pump/infusion pump during its operation with a basic body, from the front side of which a number of vertically/perpendicularly spaced trays project which are adapted to receive a medical fluid pump. The supporting or holding device comprises, at the uppermost end, an intelligent cover/lid/top part for the centralized presentation and/or output of visual (and possibly also acoustic) alarms of said at least one medical fluid pump which currently has a malfunction.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In other words, trays of a supporting or holding device are designed such that one respective medical fluid pump can be mounted in a receiving space between two of these trays. The rear sides of the medical fluid pumps abut on the front side of the basic body of the supporting or holding device (possibly with little clearance). Due to the vertical arrangement of the rectangular and plate-shaped trays the fluid pumps mounted are also arranged and/or stacked vertically. At the upper end of the supporting or holding device an intelligent cover is mounted which is, in the case of a malfunction of the pump, responsible for the alarm representation of the medical fluid pumps mounted in the supporting and/or holding device. In a mounted state of the medical fluid pumps a voltage supply of the fluid pumps and simultaneously also a communication between the fluid pumps and the supporting or holding device and/or the intelligent cover takes place via connections at the supporting or holding device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is thus ensured that the operator keeps a good overview of the fluid pumps throughout the operating period thereof. Especially for the simultaneous operation of a plurality of these supporting or holding devices do the intelligent covers of the supporting or holding devices facilitate the representation and perceptibility of the pump alarms.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the intelligent cover comprises a light strip/light band/fluorescent strip visually indicating an error of the medical fluid pump in the supporting or holding device which comprises the most critical error.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In other words, the intelligent cover of the supporting or holding device indicates the error and/or the occurrence of an error of a mounted/fixed fluid pump visually by means of a light strip. Preferably, also the error (the type of error) of the fluid pump which comprises the most critical error is indicated, i.e., the intelligent cover always represents the error of one single fluid pump in case one and/or a plurality of fluid pumps comprise an error. For the case that an error is detected in one and/or a plurality of fluid pumps of a fluid pump system, i.e., if the intelligent cover indicates a visual alarm, the origin of the error is perceivable at the displays of the individual fluid pumps.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The indicating of an error of one single fluid pump by means of a light strip in the intelligent cover reduces the complexity of the error indication and accordingly also the manufacturing effort and/or the manufacturing costs of the intelligent cover. Moreover, this visual error/alarm indication ensures that an error as well as the type of error in the fluid pump system is perceivable within a supporting or holding device. For the case that a plurality of supporting or holding devices are used simultaneously, the light strips of the intelligent covers indicate the status of the used and/or active fluid pumps in a clear manner without an individual examining of the individual fluid pumps being necessary.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a further preferred aspect the light strip of the intelligent cover emits, depending on the degree of error of the medical fluid pump concerned, green light, yellow light, or red light.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In other words, the light strip of the intelligent cover is designed such that it emits light of different colors, especially green light, yellow light, and red light. By means of this allocation of the different light colors and/or color coding the light strip of the intelligent cover indicates the degree of error and/or the gravity of error of the fluid pump concerned. Green light indicates a precise operation of the mounted fluid pumps, yellow light indicates a noncritical error of at least one mounted fluid pump, and red, especially blinking, light indicates a critical error of at least one mounted fluid pump, i.e., at least one fluid pump within the supporting and/or holding device comprises an error causing an operating failure of this at least one fluid pump.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The use of this color coding of the light strip reduces the complexity of the intelligent cover additionally since no separate display for the error indication is required.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a further preferred aspect the light strip of the intelligent cover is formed of a plurality of, especially three, LED plates oriented at an angle to each other.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In other words, the light strip of the intelligent cover is of multi-part, especially three-part, design. The light strip comprises, for instance, three plates at which a plurality of LEDs are arranged, and which are oriented at an angle to each other, preferably an angle between 179&#xb0; and 135&#xb0;, and perpendicular to a printed circuit board of the intelligent cover on which they are fastened.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The angles between the LED plates of the light strip effect an approximate arcuate shape with a convex light emission and thus achieve a slight dispersion of the emitted light, so that the visual error indication by the intelligent cover can not only be perceived at the front side of the supporting and/or holding device, but also from the side of the supporting and/or holding device.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the LED plates of the intelligent cover emit light of the same brightness or of different brightness and are, possibly independently thereof, in a further preferred manner controllable and/or controlled separately.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In other words, the individual LED plates are preferably controlled separately by electronics in the intelligent cover. The electronics of the intelligent cover is preferably designed such that all three LED plates emit a light with the same brightness, so that a homogeneous illumination is achieved. In a further embodiment the LED plates and/or the controlling electronics are preferably designed such that each of the three LED plates emits light with an individual brightness, i.e. with a brightness not adapted to each other.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a further preferred aspect the intelligent cover comprises a loudspeaker.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with the disclosure the loudspeaker of the intelligent cover serves to acoustically represent and/or express an occurring error of one and/or a plurality of fluid pumps in the supporting or holding device. Preferably, this loudspeaker is arranged at the front side of the intelligent cover and assumes the expression of the acoustic alarms of the mounted fluid pumps. Only in the case of a faulty impairment of the acoustic alarm representation by the intelligent cover does the intelligent cover return this acoustic representation to the individual fluid pumps.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition to the visual alarm the acoustic alarm serves to warn the operator in the case of a faulty behavior of a fluid pump without the operator observing the supporting or holding device including the mounted fluid pumps. Thus, early error detection by the operator is ensured, so that he or she may react quickly enough.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a further preferred aspect the intelligent cover comprises a light sensor detecting the light emission/radiation of the light strip and, possibly independently thereof, switching the, especially visual, output of the alarm and/or the error to the individual medical fluid pumps if a faulty behavior of the light strip is detected.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In other words, a light sensor of the intelligent cover recognizes whether the output of an alarm by the light strip works faultlessly. As soon as no light or too weak light is detected by the light sensor although light should be output by the intelligent cover, i.e. as soon as a faulty behavior of the light strip is detected, the intelligent cover returns the entire object of error indication to the individual fluid pumps in the supporting or holding device. Accordingly, the visual alarm indication only takes place by means of the displays of the individual fluid pumps. A further function of the light sensor consists in that the visual alarm indication of the intelligent cover is adapted to the ambient brightness.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">This ensures that an error occurring in the mounted fluid pump system is, also despite a faulty failure of the light strip at the intelligent cover, consistently indicated and represented acoustically. In other words, the light sensor is part of a fail safe mechanism of the supporting or holding device.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a further preferred aspect the intelligent cover comprises a lateral operating unit in the form of a membrane keyboard.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In other words, the intelligent cover of the supporting or holding device preferably comprises a membrane keyboard comprising additional control buttons/control keys, for instance, an on/off button or buttons for loudspeaker control. Furthermore, the membrane keyboard is provided and adapted to represent information about the intelligent cover by means of additional status indications, preferably in the form of LEDs. The status indications, for instance, render information about the charging and/or discharging state of a rechargeable battery of the intelligent cover or about the state of the mains operation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Implementing the operating unit of the intelligent cover in the form of a membrane keyboard keeps the manufacturing effort and hence the manufacturing costs low. Moreover, such membrane keyboard is insensitive to fluids occurring in an operation of the medical fluid pumps. In contrast, when using conventional keys it is easy for fluid to enter the interior of the intelligent cover, which leads to unintended damage of the cover.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a further preferred aspect the intelligent cover comprises a battery for its own power supply.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In other words, a battery, especially a rechargeable battery, is provided within the intelligent cover. The battery is easy to remove from a battery compartment, especially from the underside of the intelligent cover, as soon as the cover has been lifted off the holding device. The intelligent cover is controllable via the integrated battery or is controlled by means of the battery. Furthermore, the communication within the supporting or holding device is controllable via this battery or is controlled by means of the battery.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">By means of the battery the intelligent cover is capable of bridging interruptions of the mains operation, for instance, during mains failures or during a transport in emergency doctor's operation. In particular, the battery maintains the communication within the supporting or holding device, so that the supporting or holding device and/or the intelligent cover continuously obtains information from the mounted fluid pumps even in the case of such an interruption. The communication in the other direction, i.e. from the intelligent cover to the medical fluid pumps, also takes place continuously.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a further preferred aspect the intelligent cover comprises a circumferential drip edge/drip groove/drip trace at the underside.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In other words, a drip edge is formed at the lower side of the housing of the intelligent cover, which is provided and adapted to specifically break dripping fluid, so that the fluid pumps positioned below the intelligent cover are protected from the dripping fluid. Moreover, no dripping fluid thus gets to the electrical connections which are positioned below the intelligent cover and by which the intelligent cover is connected with the basic body of the supporting or holding device. Preferably, the drip edge is arranged such that penetrating of the fluid into the battery compartment at the underside of the intelligent cover is prevented.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Furthermore, the disclosure relates to a supporting or holding system with an afore-described supporting or holding device and at least one medical fluid pump held in the supporting or holding system by means of the tray provided in operating position. The uppermost medical fluid pump is mounted between the tray provided for it and the intelligent cover.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The medical fluid pump positioned in the mounted state in the uppermost receiving space of the supporting or holding device is mounted between the intelligent cover and a tray of the supporting or holding device. This means that the intelligent cover projects above this medical pump which at the same time rests/abuts on a tray.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The subject matter disclosed will now be explained in detail by means of advantageous embodiments and with reference to the associated Figures.

Moreover, the mainboard <b>22</b> comprises a central rectangular recess <b>38</b> through which the battery <b>26</b> mounted in the battery compartment <b>25</b> extends. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> further shows electronic elements of the mainboard <b>22</b> and illustrates in particular the three LED plates <b>24</b> which are mounted substantially perpendicular to the mainboard <b>22</b> and which are placed next to each other and preferably slightly angled relative to each other. In this representation the three LED plates <b>24</b> project out of the image plane. Thus, light of the LED plates is irradiated both forward and also partially sideward of the holding device.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a sectional view with a sectional plane perpendicular through the display strip <b>12</b> and illustrates the front half of the intelligent cover <b>10</b>. The horizontal faces of the housing upper shell <b>18</b> and of the housing lower shell <b>20</b> extend, from a certain distance to the display strip <b>12</b>, in an angled manner toward same. The resulting inclination at the underside of the display strip <b>12</b> ensures that fluid is discharged along this inclination and flows into the afore-described drip edge <b>36</b>. The drip edge <b>36</b> extends at the position forming the transition between the horizontal housing lower shell <b>20</b> and the inclination in the direction of the display strip <b>12</b>. The intelligent cover <b>10</b> comprises a cavity behind the display strip <b>12</b> in which the mainboard <b>22</b> is screwed horizontally with the housing of the intelligent cover <b>10</b>. The LED plate <b>24</b> which comprises the multi-colored LEDs <b>23</b> is fixed to the mainboard <b>22</b> perpendicular thereto and extends in the direction of the housing lower shell <b>20</b>. The LEDs <b>23</b> are mounted to the upper end edge of the LED plates <b>24</b>, i.e., at the end fixed with the mainboard <b>22</b>. At the same time, the LED plates <b>24</b> are fixed to the mainboard <b>22</b> such that the mainboard <b>22</b> projects slightly over the LED plates <b>24</b> in the direction of the display strip <b>12</b>, so that the light beam emitted by the LEDs <b>23</b> is restricted by the mainboard <b>22</b>. Accordingly, only a small amount of light gets to the housing upper shell <b>18</b> and is focused more efficiently on the display strip <b>12</b>.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
