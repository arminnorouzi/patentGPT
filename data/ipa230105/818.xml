Throughout a normal human lifespan, a person will suffer from various physiological &#x201c;malfunctions&#x201d; mostly in the form of aging and/or disease, which reduce the quality of life, and in certain severe circumstances, may result in death. Some of these conditions are gender specific or gender selective due to the various differences in male and female anatomy and physiology. For example, uterine, ovarian and cervical cancer are female specific, whereas conditions such as prostate and testicular maladies are male specific.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One category of afflictions that specifically affect women is generally known as &#x2018;Female Sexual Disorders.&#x2019; These disorders are defined in <i>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </i>(&#x201c;DSM&#x201d;), and include the following three categories: (1) Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder; (2) Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder; and (3) Female Orgasmic Disorder. All of these afflictions are common and known to significantly reduce the quality of life for millions of women and their sexual partners.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the most current version of DSM, (DSM-V), older terminologies, both Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD) and Female Arousal Disorder were merged into a single category of female sexual disorder now called Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (SIAD). Similarly, the formerly separate dyspareunia and vaginismus disorders are now collectively called Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPD). The terminology Female Orgasmic Disorder (FOD) remains unchanged.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">GPPD is an underreported condition and can occur at any time in a woman's life cycle. 50% of postmenopausal women suffer from a degree of genital pain/penetration disorder, and 15% of all women will experience vestibulodynia, or provoked vulvar pain, at some point in their lifetime. The prevalence of sexual interest/arousal disorder (SIAD) varies, but studies indicate a range from about 26.7% of premenopausal women to about 52.4% of naturally post-menopausal women. Lastly, 4-10% of women do not have orgasms and up to 26% of women report having at least some difficulty with having an orgasm.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The DSM-V defines Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder, (GPPD) as difficulty in vaginal penetration, marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during penetration, or attempt at penetration (dyspareunia), fear or anxiety about pain in anticipation of, during, or after penetration, and tightening or tensing of pelvic floor muscles during attempted penetration (vaginismus).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For many women, however, pain may occur outside the context of penetration or sexual intercourse. For example, pain or discomfort may occur during any manipulation of their external genitalia (a condition known as vulvodynia). Such pain or discomfort may be due to vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), including thinning of the vulvovaginal epithelium and a lack of lubrication and/or may be characterized as vulvodynia.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Vulvar pain is also a frequently occurring problem that affects both pre and post-menopausal women. Generally speaking, vulvodynia may present as more diffuse, constant vulvar pain, exhibiting a general sensation of burning or rawness in affected areas. Localized vulvodynia also known as vestibulodynia is pain around the opening of the vagina, the vulvar vestibule, most commonly found around the posterior hymenal ring between 4 and 8 o'clock, a region sometimes referred to by medical practitioners as the &#x201c;posterior fourchette.&#x201d; This is the most common cause of vulvar pain and the leading cause of dyspareunia in women under the age of 50.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This condition may manifest itself as primary vestibulodynia (i.e. pain with first attempted tampon and/or intercourse) or secondary vestibulodynia (i.e. development of vulvar pain following previously painless tampon use and/or intercourse). Conservative estimates indicate that at least 16% of women in the United States (&#x2dc;14 million women) have experienced some form of chronic vulvar pain. This pain and discomfort seriously impacts and degrades the quality of life. Women suffering from this condition are in need of a clinically-proven, effective treatment, as they regularly self-treat symptoms, wasting both time and money on ineffective treatments. Vulvologists from around the world, including The International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease, and practitioners from multiple professions including: medicine, psychology, physical therapy and nursing have been unable to find an effective treatment for vestibulodynia and/or chronic vulvar pain, i.e., vulvodynia. To date, there has been no effective treatment for this life-altering vulvar pain.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Genitopelvic pain in general tends to be underdiagnosed because many women are either not asked about it in connection with regular medical exams or are uncomfortable discussing it with their healthcare professional. Furthermore, Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPD) frequently becomes the cause (or a significant contributing factor) in the manifestation of Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (SIAD) because the anticipation of pain during sexual encounters may, over time, form a negative cognitive response that inhibits sexual interest, desire and/or arousal.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One cause of Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPD) is vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA). Symptoms may include difficulty or inability to allow penetration, painful intercourse (dyspareunia), irritation, soreness, pain of the external genitalia, specifically of the vulva (vulvodynia), and dryness or decrease in lubrication from loss of mucous secretion. These symptoms exert a negative impact on the quality of life of up to 50% of all postmenopausal women.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Clinical diagnostic indicators of VVA include elevation of vaginal pH and a decrease in the vaginal maturation index. The low glycogen content of the thinned epithelium leads to a reduction in lactic acid production by lactobacilli bacteria, thereby increasing vaginal pH. A vaginal pH of greater than 5, in the absence of other causes, such as infection or semen from recent intercourse, is typically considered an indicator of vaginal atrophy due to lack of estrogen.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Maturation index is a term used to indicate the percentage of vaginal cell types as determined from a cytological exam of epithelial cells from the upper one third of the vagina. It is typically expressed as percentages of each of three cell types (i.e., parabasal, intermediate and superficial cells) found on a wet prep exam. Premenopausal women with adequate estrogen levels have a maturation index of 40% to 70% intermediate cells, 30% to 60% superficial cells, and substantially no parabasal cells (&#x3c;1%). In vaginal atrophy, there is an increase in the parabasal cell population and a corresponding decrease in superficial cells, evidence of the thinning of the vaginal epithelium.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Currently, there are generally speaking, five types of treatments available to address the symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA): 1) the topical or systemic use of exogenous estrogens, 2) The systemic use of a selective estrogen receptor modulator (&#x201c;SERM&#x201d;), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 3) carbon dioxide laser and, 4) the topical use of external lubricants or moisturizers.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The lack of estrogen is believed to be responsible for some VVA symptoms in women. This estrogen deficiency may be due to age-related menopause, or iatrogenically induced menopause which is more likely the cause of estrogen deficiency in younger, pre-menopausal, women who are estrogen deficient. However, it is important to note that genital pain, involving both dyspareunia and vulvodynia, do occur in pre-menopausal women and/or in other women having essentially normal estrogen levels. Thus, not all Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorders can be adequately addressed with exogenous estrogens.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Various forms of estrogens are currently available to treat women with, vulvovaginal atrophy, VVA, associated Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder, GPPD. They include oral estrogens with or without progestins, topical estrogens as creams, suppositories or solid hormone releasing rings (Estring). Bioidentical estrogens are 17 beta-estradiol, estrone, and estriol. Sources of estrogen maybe synthetic, animal source, (Premarin), or plant based extracted from soy or yams. DHEA is metabolized, in vivo, in peripheral tissues to both androgens and estrogens. DHEA causes proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells. Regardless of the source, however, such compounds are all still estrogenic in their inherent effects, both beneficial and adverse, on estrogen sensitive target tissues.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As a result, many women either do not want or are unable to use oral or topical estrogens, which is the current standard therapy prescribed for treating symptoms of VVA. Despite being topical, estrogens applied locally to the vagina undesirably can and do cause statistically higher levels of plasma estradiol. There are significant risks to the use of both oral and topical estrogens in post-menopausal women with or without the adjunctive use of a progestin. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) determined the following risks to be associated with estrogen use: 1) An increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens; 2) An increased risk of stroke and deep venous thrombosis (&#x201c;DVT&#x201d;) in post-menopausal women using unopposed estrogens; 3) An increased risk of probable dementia in post-menopausal women using unopposed estrogens.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, a WHI study reported that women taking estrogen plus progestin had an increased risks of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) in postmenopausal women. Additionally, an estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of the WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women. The WHI estrogen plus progestin sub-study further demonstrated an increased risk of invasive breast cancer. Presently, there are no known safety studies to support the use of oral or topical vaginal estrogen in breast cancer survivors, and any estrogen use by breast cancer survivors is, considered to be, contraindicated by many health-care professionals.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Even while taking systemic (oral) estrogen, 10%-20% of women still suffer from certain residual VVA symptoms. Breast cancer treatment has been linked to an increase in the prevalence of VVA because the surgical, endocrine, and chemotherapeutic agents used in its treatment can cause or exacerbate VVA. As mentioned above, the use of locally applied estrogen treatment for this group of women remains controversial, and, at best, is only marginally effective.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Other currently available treatment options include the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such Ospemifene (OSPHENA&#xae;), an FDA approved oral medication for moderate to severe dyspareunia (GPPD) associated with VVA due to menopause. Such SERMs act as a hormone by binding to the estrogen receptors ER&#x3b1; and ER&#x3b2;, but bind more selectively to certain target organs such as the vagina, and thus produce less systemic estrogenic side effects compared to more non selective oral estrogens. Ospemifene, however, exerts a strong, nearly full estrogen agonist effect in the vaginal epithelium as evidenced by improvement of the vaginal maturation index and decreased vaginal pH. It is an oral medication with both systemic and local estrogenic effects that has to be taken indefinitely to maintain its therapeutic effects. Oral Ospemifene carries the risk of increased cardiovascular events such as deep venous thrombosis, stroke, myocardial infarction, thickening of the endometrium, endometrial polyps, breast tenderness, and breast lumps.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Finally, treatment options for VVA include the use of vaginal moisturizers and lubricants to provide temporary relief from vaginal dryness and dyspareunia by reducing friction. Such compounds, however, do nothing to restore the normal anatomy or function of the female genitalia; thus, they have no long-term therapeutic effects. These exogenous topically applied intravaginal therapeutics can be messy as they will leak out of the vagina when a woman is in the upright position, and are not produced by a woman's body in response to normal physiological responses to sexual stimulation. Vaginal estrogen therapy has proven more effective for VVA than all forms of non-hormonal therapy.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another contributing cause of Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPD) is known as vestibulodynia, vulvodynia and/or vestibulitis. This affliction may be seen in up to 15% of all premenopausal women sometime in their lifetime. It is also a very common affliction of postmenopausal women that can be unrelated to VVA.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Female vestibulodynia may be generally described as a disorder of unknown etiology where there is localized provoked vulvar pain upon penetration of the vagina. There is also tenderness to touch around the vaginal opening (vestibule) during normal self or partner's manual sexual contact or during a health professional's physical examination. The entire area of the vestibule around the vaginal introitus can be affected but the experienced discomfort or pain is most commonly pronounced in the localized area of the posterior fourchette. The affected tissue in the vestibule has increased nerve endings and signs of inflammation and is typically painful. It occurs in women of all ages. It is estimated that approximately 15% of women (about 1 in 7) will experience this type of vulvar pain sometime in their lifetime. Vestibulodynia may lead to dyspareunia or painful intercourse and thus interfere with sexual function by causing pain in genitalia. Vestibulodynia is a challenging disorder and to date there is no definitive treatment for this condition despite a range of treatments, which include: oral tricyclics, neuromodulators (i.e., gabapentin), topical anesthetics, botulinum injections, intralesional corticosteroid injections, biofeedback, sexual therapy, psychotherapy, physical therapy, and surgery as a last resort in an attempt to remove the painful tissue. Women who have vestibulodynia often simultaneously suffer from Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (SIAD) and Female Orgasmic Disorder (FOD) directly because of experiencing vestibulodynia, or provoked vulvar pain.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The two other disorders of female sexual dysfunction are: Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (SIAD) and Female Orgasmic Disorder (FOD).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (&#x201c;SIAD&#x201d;) as specified in the DSM refers to &#x201c;the persistent or recurrent inability to attain or to maintain sufficient sexual excitement, which causes personal distress.&#x201d; In addition to absent or decreased sexual interest, including erotic thoughts or fantasies, there are four criteria that are taken into account to determine whether a woman suffers from SIAD. A woman has SIAD if she experiences personal distress caused by a decrease or lack of at least three of the following four criteria: 1) initiation of sexual activity or responsiveness to a partner's attempts to initiate it, 2) excitement and pleasure, 3) response to sexual cues, and 4) sensations during sexual activity, whether genital or non-genital. Again, three of the foregoing criteria are required for diagnosis. It may be expressed generally as lack of subjective excitement or lack of genital (lubrication/swelling) or other somatic responses.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The prevalence of Sexual Interest Arousal Disorder (SIAD), including low sexual desire, may range from about 26.7% of premenopausal women to 52.4% of naturally post-menopausal women. The disorder had no FDA-approved treatments (until August 2015 when Flibanserin, Addyi, was approved), and the FDA has recognized the condition as an area of unmet medical need.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Female orgasmic disorder, (FOD) as defined in the DSM, is the absence of orgasm (anorgasmia), infrequency or delay of orgasm, and/or reduced intensity of said orgasm. Such orgasmic dysfunction may also occur when a woman has difficulty reaching orgasm, even when sexually aroused with sufficient sexual stimulation. Many women have difficulty reaching orgasm with a partner, or during masturbation, even after ample sexual stimulation. Female Orgasmic Disorder (FOD) affects approximately one in three women.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It can be difficult to determine the particular underlying cause of Female Orgasmic Disorder (FOD). Women may have difficulty reaching orgasm due to one or more physical, emotional, and/or psychological factors. Contributing factors include: older age, medical conditions, such as diabetes, a history of gynecological surgeries, such as a hysterectomy, the use of certain medications, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), mental health conditions, such as depression or anxiety, stress, societal negative stereotypes of women's sexuality, lack of adequate or effective sexual stimulation, etc. Sometimes, a combination of these factors can make achieving an orgasm difficult or not possible.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The inability to orgasm can lead to distress, which may make it even more difficult to achieve orgasm in the future. The main symptom of orgasmic disorder is the inability to achieve sexual climax. Women with Female Orgasmic Disorder (FOD) may have difficulty achieving orgasm during either sexual intercourse or during masturbation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">For many women, having unsatisfying orgasms, less intense orgasms, or taking longer than desirable to reach climax are common symptoms of FOD that lead to emotional distress.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The initial goal of therapy for Female Orgasmic Disorder is to enable the patient to reach an orgasm as desired under any circumstance. Underlying medical etiologies must first be considered including antidepressant-induced anorgasmia, anorgasmia secondary to substance abuse, and underlying neurological disorders.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Evidence about the effectiveness of psychological therapies in successfully treating FOD is inconclusive. Testosterone in combination with estrogen has been tried, but to date no pharmacologic agents have proved to demonstrate long-term beneficial effects on orgasmic function in women with FOD, beyond a placebo effect. A Canadian company is working on a low-dose nasal testosterone gel treatment for Female Orgasmic Disorder, FOD.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">However, at present, no medication has been specifically approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of FOD. In addition, very little information is available about pharmacotherapy specifically targeting disorders of orgasm in women. The significant inherent risks of oral or topical hormonal therapy remain a concern.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Finally, over-the-counter (OTC) products (Zestra&#xae;) and nutritional supplements are marketed, but are ineffective in treating women with FOD. Thus, there is currently no safe or effective treatment for Female Orgasmic Disorder (FOD) that enables an orgasm or enhances the intensity of said orgasm. Therefore, for the treatment of Female Orgasmic Disorder (FOD), it is desirable to provide a therapeutic compound and associated treatment that is easy for the patient to use (e.g., a medication that can be applied to the affected area by the patient themselves) that shows significant improvement in orgasmic ease and intensity in a relatively short period of use and having no significant side-effects.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As discussed above, problem of SIAD encountered by many women reduces quality of life manifested as low female libido or sexual desire, and decreased or absent sexual arousal. In the past, treatments for low female libido have had little success. Some physicians have prescribed various forms of off-label testosterone preparations to increase libido with limited results. Testosterone, however, is not approved by the FDA for treating libido problems in women. Long-term safety data on testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women who have a history of breast or uterine cancer, or who have cardiovascular or liver disease, is lacking, and is being studied. Available data suggests there may be an increased risk of heart attacks, stroke, hair loss on scalp, hair growth on face, acne, heart disease, clitoromegaly, risk of breast or uterine cancer through conversion of testosterone to estrogen, blood clots, deepening of voice, and fetal abnormalities (in pre-menopausal women).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Currently, there is no treatment for female SIAD. Thus, it desirable to provide a therapeutic compound and associated treatment that is easy for patients to use, that shows significant results in a relatively short period of time, and has no significant side-effects.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">One attempt to create a safe and effective treatment for low female libido resulted in the development of the compound Flibanserin, by Sprout Pharmaceuticals, known by the tradename ADDYI, or more colloquially &#x201c;The Pink Pill.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Flibanserin, (BIMT 17 BS; 2H-benzimidazol-2-one, 1,3-dihydro-1-[2-[4-[3(tri-fluoromethyl) phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]) is a non-hormonal, centrally acting molecule that acts as an agonist at postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors and as an antagonist at 5-HT2A receptors</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Approved by the FDA in August 2015, Flibanserin is the first and only drug indicated for pre-menopausal women for SIAD related disorders (formerly termed hypoactive sexual desire disorder). During FDA evaluation, Flibanserin, was twice rejected because according to FDA reviewers: &#x201c;Flibanserin has a challenging benefit/risk assessment.&#x201d; This is due to its relative lack of efficacy for the intended indication as well as the prevalence of certain undesirable side effects. For example, from a median baseline of about 2-3 satisfying sexual events (&#x201c;SSEs&#x201d;) per month, Flibanserin resulted in a median placebo-corrected increase of only about 0.5-1.0 SSEs per month over a six month period. Moreover, this marginal benefit was seen in only 18% of women taking 100 mg daily of the systemic drug for a minimum of 28 days.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">During trials, it was observed that the risks of sedation or hypotension-related adverse events are substantially higher with Flibanserin vs placebo (28.6% Flibanserin vs 9.4% placebo). Flibanserin acts on the central nervous system and must be taken continuously and indefinitely. Side effects of Flibanserin are significant and include hypotension, syncope and somnolence. The risk of such side effects is amplified by drug interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as oral contraceptives or Fluconazole and with concomitant alcohol intake. The FDA concluded that the clinically significant pharmacodynamic interaction between Flibanserin and alcohol is challenging to mitigate, particularly because Flibanserin requires daily use and alcohol consumption, including excessive drinking, is not uncommon in many cultures and further common for those engaging in sexual activity. The combination of ethanol and Flibanserin resulted in concerning cases of hypotension and pre-syncope/syncope. In addition, Flibanserin trials were limited to generally healthy women who were not taking additional medication such as benzodiazepines, sleep aids, narcotics, or other medicines. As with many drug trials, Flibanserin trials were of short duration relative to the potential length of time that Flibanserin could be indicated. Further, it is noteworthy that Flibanserin demonstrated no therapeutic effect at all on Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPD) including vestibulodynia and dyspareunia or on Female Orgasmic Disorder (FOD).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Thus, in view of the foregoing, there is currently a lack of safe efficacious treatments to improve overall sexual function in both men and women as well as certain cutaneous inflammation disorders and treatments for Female Sexual Disorders. These include Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPD), Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (SIAD), and Female Orgasmic Disorder (FOD).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The invention provides safe and efficacious treatments for Female Sexual Disorders, Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorders; vulvovaginal atrophy, vestibulodynia, dyspareunia, Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder, Female Orgasmic Disorder, and low female libido.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The invention provides safe and efficacious compositions and treatments that improve or have a positive effect on male libido, sexual performance, improve sexual sensation, as well as treat certain cutaneous inflammation disorders.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The invention provides safe and efficacious catechin compositions and treatments that improve and/or treat cutaneous inflammations associated with urinary tract disorders in both males and females.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The catechin compounds and treatment methods described herein show significant efficacy for treatment of Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPD), Sexual Interest Arousal Disorder (SIAD) and Female Orgasmic Disorder (FOD).

Previously, topically-applied green tea catechins were used to treat human papilloma-based (HPV) neoplasms. These topical formulations, however, caused significant vulvovaginal discomfort or pain at the catechin concentrations and/or frequency used. Thus, it was surprisingly found that lower concentrations of catechins had the opposite effect, namely, soothing vaginal discomfort, pain, increasing vaginal lubrication, increasing sexual interest and desire, and increasing the frequency and intensity of orgasms. Thus, the result was an amelioration of a variety of Female Sexual Disorders, FSDs. This is a significant public health benefit because the disclosed inventions may be used, optionally, without any female hormones or systemic-based treatments.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">Catechins found in green tea, including Epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechiu and epicatechin are effective in treating FSD and improving overall sexual function of both men and women. The FSDs includes Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder, Female Orgasmic Disorder, Genitopelvic Pain Penetration Disorder including its cutaneous inflammatory components, decreased lubrication, aberrant innervation of vulvodynia, and vulvovaginal atrophy. Catechins were also found to increase female libido. (See U.S. Pat. No. 9,750,716, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.)</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, effective primary catechin treatment preparations may start at about 1% and go up to about 15% catechin measured by weight of active ingredient per weight of total formulation (w/w). The formulations are, for example, ointments, lotions, emulsions, water soluble solutions, and water-insoluble solutions. Further exemplary compositions include liposomes, microparticles, and nanoparticles. Secondary treatment preparations for maintenance of therapeutic effect may be about 1-3% catechin by weight water soluble extract in various deployment preparations. The catechin preparations may be directly applied to the external genitalia, vulvar skin, vestibule, clitoris and the vaginal introitus at regular intervals in a manner to cover intended treatment and/or affected areas with a thin layer of the preparation such as an ointment, liquid, dermal patch, or other suitable topical deployment vector. Other preparations may include spray on or other suitable topical deployment vectors. The frequency of application may start at once a day and either be increased up to about twice a day or decreased to about twice per week for women with either very sensitive skin, or for women who have achieved the desired therapeutic effect and are using it for maintenance.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">Typically, preparations of 5-10% by weight catechin in petrolatum base spread across the intended treatment and/or affected area are sufficient for treatment. Preparations that have a concentration of more than about 10% by weight catechin may cause irritation in some subjects and &#x201c;cancel out&#x201d; or otherwise mask or diminish the therapeutic effects of the present invention if used during initial treatment. Typically, a preparation of about 2.5%-7.5% by weight catechin is initially prescribed. Preparations with lower concentration may be used for women with sensitive skin types (e.g., 2.5%). Alternatively, the catechin percentage may be increased to about 7.5-10%. For most women, daily use of about 0.25 cc-1.5 cc (cubic centimeter) of 5% by weight catechin in petrolatum base spread across the intended treatment and/or affected area is sufficient for treatment.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">The catechin preparations of the present invention are topical, well tolerated, have no significant side-effects, may be safely applied for a long period of time by the patients themselves and is notably effective in treating and alleviating the signs and symptoms of Female Sexual Disorders (SIAD, GPPD, and FOD). Furthermore, the present invention will likely be classified by the FDA as a phase 3 botanical drug according to the 2004 USA FDA CDER guidelines.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">The mechanism of action of catechins according to the present inventions is not fully understood. In vitro, green tea catechins demonstrate antioxidative properties. Antioxidants have anti-inflammatory effects. Catechins also possess immune-stimulating effects and antiviral and anticarcinogenic properties that cause inhibition of enzymes involved in the pathogenesis of human papilloma virus. Of note, whereas catechins have anticarcinogenic properties, estrogens, the current standard of care for VVA, can promote carcinogenesis and are contraindicated in breast and uterine cancer patients.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">Although, the exact mechanism of action of the present invention in not fully understood, it is known that sensations of pain interfere with sexual response. Thus, one mechanism of action for female sexual arousal and orgasmic response in accordance with an aspect of the present invention is believed to be attributable, at least in part, to a neuromodulatory effect of catechins on portions of the nervous system innervating the vulva, vestibule, clitoris, vaginal introitus, labium, perineum and vagina whereby aberrant nociceptive sensory innervation is reduced so as not to interfere with the perception of pleasurable sexual sensations. Another neuromodulatory mechanism of action of catechins is believed to be attributed to a positive stimulatory effect of catechins on sensory afferents located in these same areas of female anatomy.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">The mechanism of action of the catechin preparations of the present invention on VVA and vulvodynia, vestibulodynia may involve reducing the pathological proliferation of nerves (both autonomic and peripheral) of affected vaginal mucous membranes found in all three conditions. This may be shown by histopathological analysis of relevant tissues. Further, catechin preparations of the present invention (sometimes referred to herein as &#x201c;GTO&#x201d; or green tea ointment) may act to selectively bind to certain estrogen receptors in the female genitalia providing localized relief, but with little or no systemic side effects. This is evidenced by the lack of proliferation of vaginal epithelium in response to GTO treatment. Rather, GTO acts locally and specifically as a topical phytoestrogen on the normalization of innervation to the genital skin. This is further evidenced by the lack of alteration in the vaginal maturation index. The effect of topical GTO is localized to the external genitalia, and, particularly the vaginal introitus and vestibule where it was necessary and was sufficient for treatment being applied only to those areas.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">Immuno-histochemistry analysis of vulvar skin of women with vulvodynia has shown altered density of nociceptor nerve endings and an increased number of intraepithelial free nerve endings, lowered tactile and pain thresholds, nociceptor sensitization and overall peripheral nerve hyperplasia. Provoked vulvodynia, is characterized by genital hypersensitivity and sensory hyperinnervation.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">Although direct effects of estrogen withdrawal on vaginal cells are implicated in VVA, (e.g., thinning of the vaginal epithelium) estrogen withdrawal also causes autonomic and sensory nerves to proliferate, suggesting that indirect effects mediated by changes in vulvar vaginal innervation may also contribute to pain associated with VVA.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">Symptoms of VVA and GPPD (vulvodynia and dyspareunia) can be caused by proliferation of autonomic and sensory nerve vulvar vaginal innervation density. Because topical estrogens are more effective than systemic estrogens in the treatment of VVA pain by causing a reduction of abnormal vulvar vaginal innervation the same or similar mechanism may explain why topical GTO's (a phytoestrogen) application to vulvar mucosa is so effective in alleviating vulvar pain and dyspareunia.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">Reduction or normalization of nociceptive (or pain afferent) pathways that are localized in the area of the vestibule, vaginal introitus and posterior fourchette underlies the therapeutic efficacy that is well established through the application of topical estrogen. In view of these observations, the catechin preparations of the present invention are believed to be acting locally without any substantial systemic effects whatsoever as a phytoestrogen. Even when given in large systemic doses to postmenopausal women, green tea and associated catechins have substantially no effects on any systemic estrogen levels.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0096">It is known that certain catechin-based green tea compounds may be used for the treatment condyloma acuminata or genital warts. This is used strictly to treat viral-based papilloma manifestations, such as wart populations on certain areas of the genitalia and anus. For example, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,795,911 and 5,968,973 to Cheng et al. However, as is well known in the art, the treatment of such viral-based maladies is very different from the Female Sexual Disorders described herein because the indication for use of &#x201c;sinecatechins,&#x201d; is for the reduction of condyloma acuminata, or genital warts caused by infection with human papilloma virus. The mode of operation for wart treatment is prescribed because the water soluble extract of green tea leaves possesses antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunostimulatory activity. Therapeutic applications of the green tea water soluble extract is thought to be efficacious due to the specific inhibition of multiple HPV-induced pathways by sinecatechins that is believed to contribute to the reduction or clearance of genital warts, likely via direct antiviral and immunostimulatory effects.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0097">Catechins are used to treat genital warts and other HPV-related conditions because of their antiviral and immunostimulatory activity. Prior to the present invention, they were not used to treat female sexual disorders. This is likely because the highly-concentrated catechin preparations described in Chen et al. are preferably in the 12%-18% range by weight. At such concentrations, the irritation they cause, together with HPV pain, obfuscated the benefits of the inventions described herein. The known anti-viral effects of catechins were not known to have any effect on Female Sexual Disorders as described in the present invention. The regenerative and restorative effects of the present invention are an apparent opposing effect when compared to the prior art highly-concentrated catechin preparations. Accordingly, the results and findings herein were unexpected.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">Thus, the invention provides a topical formulation for the treatment of Female Sexual Disorders including Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPD); Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (SIAD); Female Orgasmic Disorder (FOD), vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) and other vulvovaginal disorders, including but not limited to vestibulodynia. The content of catechin may be between about 2.5-7.5% by weight for initial treatment.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099">The prevalence of Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder SIAD (low sexual desire) may range from about 26.7% of premenopausal women to 52.4% of naturally postmenopausal women. Between 4 and 10% of women do not have orgasms, and up to 26% of women report some difficulty with having an orgasm with a condition known as Female Orgasmic Disorder (FOD).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">Topical GTO can increase a woman's desire, arousal, lubrication, satisfaction and orgasm (intensity and/or frequency) and her frequency of satisfying sexual events, as well as decrease her genital pain and dissatisfaction about her level of sexual desire (Item #13 in Sexual Distress Revised). Topical GTO demonstrates far greater efficacy without any serious side effects as compared to Flibanserin, marketed under the tradename, Addyi, or the &#x201c;The Pink Pill&#x201d;. Flibanserin has marginal efficacy in only 18% of patients taking it for a minimum of 28 days. Flibanserin is a systemic drug that must be taken indefinitely with potential serious side effects of syncope, hypotension and somnolence especially if combined with alcohol.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0101">GTO has a rapid onset of action with all demonstrated clinical changes occurring within days to weeks after regular topical application of GTO. Clinical improvement continues over the month of use and concentration of the drug may be increased as tolerated to maximize efficacy. Topical GTO has no known systemic side effects. Potential local side effects and the safety profile are well documented for GTO because of the FDA approved botanical drug Veregen, (15% GTO), indicated to be applied to each genital wart, three times a day, which has been safely used for more than 15 years. Local irritation is the most common local side effect, and it is more likely to occur the higher the concentration of GTO. Clinical evidence of direct anti-inflammatory effects of the lower concentration (5%) GTO on the genital mucosa are documented in the application presented herein.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0102">It is known that pain interferes with sexual response. Thus, the invention provides increasing female sexual interest and arousal and orgasmic response is through amelioration of genital pain. While not wishing to be bound by theory, the benefits of the invention may be, at least in part, due to neuromodulatory effect of catechins on portions of the nervous system innervating the vulva, clitoris, vaginal introitus, labium, perineum and vagina.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0103">One mechanism of action for female sexual arousal and orgasmic response in accordance with an aspect of the present invention is believed to be attributable, at least in part, to substantially direct neuromodulatory effects of green tea catechins on nerves innervating the female genitalia.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0104">The innervation of the female genital tract is mediated through the somatic and the autonomic nervous systems. Green tea polyphenols and catechins, demonstrate both a positive stimulatory and negative inhibitory effects on portions of the autonomic and somatic nervous systems innervating the vulva, clitoris, vaginal introitus, labium, perineum and vagina. Polyphenols and catechins, of green tea can interact with a range of neurotransmitters and thereby effect neuronal events including modulating neurotransmission, plasticity and synaptogenesis.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0105">As is known in the art, the therapeutic effects of pharmaceuticals on target tissues are frequently dose dependent. For virtually all drugs treatment protocols there are dosage parameters where the therapeutic benefit of the drug is manifest but where exceeding that therapeutic dosage range causes adverse, unwanted side effects, and in some cases, toxicity or exacerbation or worsening of condition for which the drug was supposed to benefit, which is generally undesirable and is therefore clinically avoided.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0106">This dose dependent effect is true with respect to green tea catechins. For example, the clinical outcome of green tea catechins treatment is apparent with respect to modulation of myocardial contractility. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCg) is a major and potent representative in green tea, which has been proved to modulate myocardial contractility. EGCg at low dose conferred cardioprotection, yet at high dose increased the incidences of arrhythmia and diastolic dysfunction. Green tea at low doses was therapeutic but proved toxic at high doses.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107">With respect to the present invention, initial testing with 15% by weight GTO was found to be irritating and too uncomfortable and therefore was not well tolerated, especially when treating subjects with preexisting genital pain. These adverse side effects of 15% by weight GTO precluded observing any evidence both of its efficacy and observable clinically effectiveness as a treatment for female sexual disorders. In fact, the adverse clinical side effects seen with 15% GTO both obscured and/or negated the positive effects seen with the lower concentration in accordance with aspects of the present invention. This dose dependent response of GTO, the frequency of application, three times daily, to each genital wart, along with HPV pain, explains why the higher concentration formulations of GTO were not recognized as having any beneficial effects on female sexual disorders.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0108">The surprising therapeutic effect of 5% GTO applied to the female genitalia target tissues with a frequency from 2-3 times per week up to twice daily use, improved the female sexual response by both enhancing sexual responses and reducing genital pain. Once these therapeutic benefits of 5% GTO are manifest or if there is habituation of a positive therapeutic response, then the frequency of application and/or the concentration of GTO may be increased.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109">In general, the normal female sexual response depends on the function of the peripheral autonomic nervous system and intact signaling pathways controlling the tone of genital vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">Autonomic adrenergic systems are active in women when they become sexually aroused and their activation facilitates female sexual arousal. Adrenaline and noradrenaline metabolite, vanillylmandelic acid, increases prior to intercourse and continues to be elevated over baseline up to 23 hours following sexual activity. In addition, ephedrine, an &#x3b1;- and &#x3b2;-adrenergic agonist, can significantly facilitate the initial stages of physiological sexual arousal in women. EGCg, action on stimulation can be attributed to its substantially direct effect on autonomic adrenergic receptors. These effects influence autonomic nerve pathways that send afferent signals up the spinal cord to the hypothalamus causing release of hormones during orgasm in addition to efferent autonomic pathways sending neural impulses to effect blood flow, lubrication, smooth muscle contraction in the female genitalia.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0111">As noted herein, green tea catechins' effect on autonomic adrenergic receptors is dose dependent, especially during the initial stages of treatment. The present invention starting at about 5% GTO (e.g., about 2.5%-7.5%) has been shown to improve sexual arousal, lubrication and female orgasmic response and decrease genital pain.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0112">During a sexual encounter, sexual sensations from somatic sensory nerve pathways from branches of the pudendal nerve are responsible for sending somatic sexual sensations from the genitalia up the spinal cord to the cerebral cortex. Complete spinal cord injuries typically result in loss of somatic sensation and autonomic sexual inarousability of innervated body parts below level of injury, whereas incomplete injuries result in some sensation and arousability.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0113">HPV infection is not the cause of vulvodynia as most women affected with vulvodynia and vestibulodynia have been shown not to be infected with HPV or have any evidence of HPV infection. Rather, exogenous progesterone, such as found in certain contraceptives, has been shown to be a factor in causing vulvodynia and vestibulodynia. In addition, estrogen withdrawal is a known etiology of genital pain seen in VVA. Conventional treatment for this is topical estrogen cream. This cream reduces the pain in both VVA and in some cases of vulvodynia/vestibulodynia but has no effect whatsoever on HPV. In fact, high estrogenic states such as pregnancy can increase the proliferation of HPV. Thus, GTO's beneficial therapeutic effect on female sexual disorders is not due to GTO's effect on HPV.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0114">The primary focus for sensual response in the human female is the clitoris. The first branch of the pudendal nerve, the dorsal nerve of the clitoris, is a purely sensory nerve without any known motor functions. The second branch of the pudendal nerve, the perineal nerve, provides sensory branches to the perineum, <i>Labia majora, Labia minora </i>and distal third (the perceptually most erogenous portion) of the vagina and also has motor effectors. The dorsal nerve (the first branch of the pudendal nerve) only carries somatosensory impulses from the clitoris. Its' only known function is that of serving as an erotic focus. The clitoris, in its entirety, has been shown to be the most erotically sensitive part of female genital anatomy. Maximum nerve density is known to be in and around the clitoris. The most intense sexual sensations in the human female come from clitoral stimulation. The anatomical site with the strongest orgasmic response requiring the least amount of stimulation necessary to obtain an orgasm involves the clitoral stimulation. The distribution of enhanced sexual sensations, experienced during the use of the present invention, correlate most closely with dorsal nerve or clitoral branch of the pudendal nerve, innervating the entire clitoris, the central external visible glans and body of the clitoris and the so called &#x201c;internal&#x201d; or hidden clitoral crus which bifurcate and extend alongside the right and left ischial pubic rami innervating the lateral walls of the vagina extending anteriorly to the vaginal introitus.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0115">Of note vestibulodynia is characteristically localized to the lateral edges of the vaginal introitus. One effect of GTO is thought to be due to its therapeutic effect on reducing the pathogenic hyper innervation of this area of the vaginal vestibule also termed posterior fourchette in females afflicted with VVA and or vestibulodynia/vulvodynia (i.e., excessive innervation in the &#x201c;wrong&#x201d; area of the genitalia). This decreases nociceptive innervation and thus sensations of pain. GTO's effect here may be due in part because of GTO's inherent property as a phytoestrogen in its selective effect on target tissues without systemic side effects of exogenous estrogen.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0116">The first branch of the pudendal nerve, the dorsal nerve of the clitoris, is responsible for sensations in the clitoris and increased estrogen levels expand the size and sensitivity of the pudendal perineal innervation. Topical application of Green Tea Ointment, GTO, may be acting to increase the sexual sensitivity, arousal and orgasm by expanding the size and sensitivity of the pudendal nerve's innervation. Further, topical GTO, may act to selectively bind to certain estrogen receptors in the female genitalia, specifically the vaginal introitus and vestibule. This reduces abnormal hyperproliferation of nociceptive nerves and provides localized pain relief with no systemic side effects or risks inherent in either topical or systemic estrogens. GTO is a known phytoestrogen without the inherent side effects of exogenous estrogens. This is evidenced by the lack of proliferation of vaginal epithelium in response to topical GTO treatment and by the lack of alteration in the vaginal maturation index of woman using GTO. The safety of GTO use is further demonstrated by the lack of alteration in systemic estrogen levels, even with systemic, rather than topical use of Green Tea catechins. Even when given in large systemic doses to postmenopausal women, green tea and associated catechins have substantially no effects on any systemic estrogen levels. Thus, the use of GTO of the present invention is preferred in the treatment of female sexual disorders as compared to the current conventional use of exogenous estrogens in women, which had numerous well-known risks.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0117">Autonomic innervation of the female genitalia is comprised of nerve fibers from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Sympathetic fibers are derived from the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spinal segments (T10-L2), and the parasympathetic nerve fibers are derived from S2-4. These autonomic fibers, both sympathetic and parasympathetic then coalesce in the pelvis and redistribute to the genital target organs (uterus, cervix, proximal &#x2154;'s of the vagina). Autonomic sensory afferent fibers are believed to follow the same course starting at the genital target organs coalescing in the pelvis and returning to the spinal cord segments.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0118">Female sexual responsivity is a result of sensory input through the peripheral nerves of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems, as well as through cranial nerves and psychogenic stimulation. How and where the afferent information is processed within the spinal cord and brain is not fully known.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0119">Reflex lubrication where a tactile stimuli from the genitalia travels up the spinal cord to and reflexively connect to spinal efferent pathways travels back down the spinal cord to the nerves innervating the vaginal vasculature can occur if an injury is above T9 and not involving T10 to T12 where presumably the reflexive autonomic lubrication center in the spinal cord is located.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0120">GTO and Orgasmic response: The afferent sensory sensations are conducted upwards through the spinal cord where there is a pathway for a spinal reflexive orgasmic response as evidenced by the ability of some women with spinal cord injuries to experience orgasms. However, even with complete spinal cord injuries, some women can experience an orgasm, indicating other nerve pathways that bypass the spinal cord. Impulses ultimately reaching the cerebral cortex, in particular the temporal lobe and the posterior pituitary via the hypothalamus, effect perception of pleasure and among other efferent response, posterior pituitary release of oxytocin and prolactin during enhanced female orgasmic experience. There is a measurable significant increase in blood flow in the posterior pituitary during a human female's orgasm with its release of oxytocin and prolactin. Men unlike women do not demonstrate such large releases of oxytocin and prolactin during orgasm. It is believed that the topical application of GTO in accordance with an aspect of the present invention increases sensory neuronal innervation in and around the clitoris, and, in its entirety (glans, body and crus), is enhancing the pituitary's release of oxytocin and prolactin and the woman's perception of pleasure in her cerebral cortex by increasing the afferent signaling traveling up the spinal cord.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0121">GTO and GPPD: GTO normalizes the nervous innervation by increasing sensory nerve innervation of the dorsal branch of the pudendal nerve in and around the clitoris while GTO acts to decrease the abnormally high nociceptive nerve density around the vaginal vestibule. By these effects GTO increases positive sexual sensory sensations and resultant orgasmic responses but decreases genital pain in and around the vaginal introitus and vestibule as seen in VVA and vulvodynia and vestibulodynia.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0122">Thus, GTO increases neural innervation of the dorsal nerve of the clitoris and thereby stimulating or augmenting sexual sensations and arousal. It also decreases the aberrant hyperinneration of both autonomic and somatic sensory fibers in and around the vaginal introitus, specifically posterior fourchette. This decreases genital pain.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0123">Sexual response includes desire, arousal, lubrication and orgasm. It is known that, if perceived as unpleasant or toxic, sensations of pain can interfere with a woman's sexual response. Genital pelvic pain disorder in VVA and vulvodynia, vestibulodynia is characterized by genital hypersensitivity and sensory hyperinnervation with unmyelinated sensory nociceptor neurons. Although direct effects of estrogen withdrawal on vaginal cells is implicated in VVA, (e.g., thinning of the vaginal epithelium) estrogen withdrawal also causes both autonomic and somatic sensory nerves to proliferate, suggesting that indirect effects mediated by changes in vulvar vaginal innervation may be a major contributor to pain associated with VVA. This has been shown by histopathological analysis of relevant tissues. Topical application of estradiol is a well-documented and effective therapeutic for pain associated with VVA.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0124">Exogenous progesterone use, in contraceptives, in premenopausal women, may be one etiology of vulvar hyperinnervation in vestibulodynia and or vulvodynia. Progesterone can induce both autonomic and somatic sensory nerves to proliferate. Oral progesterones can increase the risk of developing vestibulodynia by four to ninefold. Topical estradiol has been shown to reduce the sensory hyperinnervation and vulvar pain associated with vestibulodynia and vulvodynia.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0125">The mechanism of action of the catechin preparations of the present invention on VVA and vulvodynia, vestibulodynia may involve reducing the pathological proliferation of sensory nerves, hyperinnervation of affected vulvovaginal mucous membranes found in the conditions associated with female Genital Pelvic Pain Disorder (VVA, dyspareunia, vulvodynia, vestibulodynia). Immuno-histochemistry analysis of vulvar skin of women with VVA and vulvodynia, vestibulodynia have shown increased density of nociceptor nerve endings and an increased number of intraepithelial free nerve endings, lowered tactile and pain thresholds, nociceptor sensitization and overall peripheral nerve hyperplasia. This sensory nociceptor axon proliferation may contribute to symptoms of pain, burning and itching associated with VVA and some forms of vulvodynia and vestibulodynia.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0126">GTO, in accordance with aspects of the present invention is thought to be acting as a topical phytoestrogen on the normalization of innervation to the genital skin. The effect of topical GTO is localized to the external genitalia, and, particularly the vaginal introitus and vestibule where it is both necessary and sufficient for alleviation of pain associated with VVA, vulvodynia and vestibulodynia.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0127">Symptoms of VVA and GPPD (vulvodynia, vestibulodynia and dyspareunia) can be caused by proliferation of autonomic and sensory nerve vulvar vaginal innervation density. It is well documented that topical estrogens are more effective than systemic estrogens in alleviating the pain in VVA and vulvodynia/vestibulodynia by reducing and therefore normalizing of abnormal vulvar vaginal hyper innervation. Reduction or normalization of nociceptive (or pain afferent) pathways that are localized in the area of the vulva, vestibule, vaginal introitus, and posterior fourchette, in VVA, vulvodynia and vestibulodynia is the most likely mechanism for the therapeutic efficacy of the application of topical estrogens. It is hypothesized that the same or a similar mechanism is the reason why applying a topical GTO (a phytoestrogen) to vulvar mucosa and vaginal introitus is so effective in alleviating vulvar pain and dyspareunia in both VVA and vulvodynia/vestibulodynia. In view of these observations, the GTO, catechin preparations of the present invention are believed to be acting locally without any known systemic effects whatsoever (as a phytoestrogen).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0128">Antiandrogens exert estrogenic effects on target tissue by blocking the effect of androgens at the cellular level. Green tea catechins estrogenic-like effects may be attributed to epigallocatechin gallate by inhibiting 5-alpha reductase. This reduces the conversion of testosterone to the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0129">Another mode of action of the present invention is on mucous membranes, in connection with its antioxidant effect which might help reduce inflammation and irritation that can be a factor in VVA, vulvodynia, and vestibulodynia.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0130">GTO and lubrication: Lubrication is controlled by both somatic and autonomic neural impulses that travel through the spinal cord. Autonomic fibers send efferent impulses back to genitalia smooth muscle with effects on both vasodilation and therefore lubrication. There is absence of lubrication in women either reflex or psychogenic when the spinal cord is severed between T10 and T12. Psychogenic lubrication, or lubrication in response to non-tactile stimuli is possible if the spinal cord is severed below T12, presumably from neural pathways traveling from cerebral cortex down to spinal centers responsible for autonomic efferent neural pathways innervating smooth muscle and nerves of the vagina. Reflex lubrication is where tactile stimuli from the genitalia travels up the spinal cord to and reflexively connect to spinal efferent pathways travels back down the spinal cord to the nerves innervating the vaginal vasculature can occur if an injury is above T9 and not involving T10 to T12 where presumably the reflexive autonomic lubrication center in the spinal cord is located.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0131">Some aspects of vaginal dysfunction during menopause may be attributable to changes in innervation. Increased sympathetic innervation may augment vasoconstriction and promote vaginal dryness. GTO acting as a phytoestrogen, decreasing aberrant hyperinnervation may be one mechanism whereby GTO increases vaginal lubrication. Another mechanism of the action of GTO catechins on vaginal lubrication would be its direct effect on neurotransmitters on vascular smooth muscle.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0132">The normal female sexual response depends on the function of the peripheral autonomic nervous system and intact signaling pathways controlling the tone of genital vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0133">The first measurable sign of sexual arousal is an increase in vaginal blood flow. This creates the engorged condition, that saturates the fluid resabsorptive capacity of the vaginal epithelium. This results in increase in vaginal fluid, i.e. lubrication which enables less friction during coitus.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0134">Genital motor responses to sexual stimulation including vaginal lubrication is mediated by autonomic vasoactive neurotransmitters including, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and Nitric oxide synthetases.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0135">The mechanisms underlying vaginal lubrication appear to be mediated by several vasoactive neurotransmitters especially Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP). VIP injection into or topical application to the vaginal wall increases vaginal blood flow and induces vaginal fluid production.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0136">Green tea catechins interact with a range of neurotransmitters and other signaling molecules. Nitric Oxide cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway is involved in the physiological mechanism of female genital arousal. Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthases (NOS) and VIP vasoactive intestinal peptides are co-localized in the human vagina. Nitric Oxide synthases are located on the vaginal vessels in close proximity to vasoactive intestinal peptides (VIP) on the vaginal nerve fibers. They are both directly involved in effecting vaginal blood flow and thus lubrication. Disturbances in these pathways are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of sexual dysfunction. Nitric oxide relaxes genital vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle which plays a pivotal role in mediating the normal sexual response to visual and/or tactile erotic stimulation. Insufficient bioavailability of Nitric Oxide (NO) and/or Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) decreases vasodilation which decreases vaginal lubrication. Catechin isolated from green tea has been shown to substantially directly affect the level of NO in endothelial cells. It is by this effect of green tea catechin on the level of Nitric Oxide in endothelial cells that the application of GTO in accordance with aspects of the present invention increase lubrication is efficacious.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0137">One of green tea's catechins, Epigallocatechin gallate, (EGCg), affects adrenergic receptors. Activation of epithelial beta-adrenergic receptor pathways facilitates vaginal lubrication during sexual arousal. Green tea's action on facilitating vaginal lubrication may be attributed to its direct effect on beta adrenergic receptor pathways. Activation of epithelial beta adrenergic receptors facilitates vaginal lubrication during sexual arousal by stimulating vaginal epithelial Cl(&#x2212;) secretion in a cAMP-dependent pathway. Adrenergic alpha-receptors (AR) are an important regulator of genital physiological responses involved in mediating vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle contractility. The concentration of EGCg effects which of the adrenergic receptors (alpha or beta) will be activated. At higher concentration it is shown that EGCG can activate the &#x3b2;2Areceptor. Topical application of GTO directly to genital mucosa would enable higher concentrations of EGCg and facilitate enhancement of vaginal lubrication.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0138">In one embodiment, tea catechin is used in accordance with the present inventions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) wherein R<sub>1 </sub>may represent H or OH and R<sub>2 </sub>may represent H or the chemical structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.

It will be further understood that tea catechins, including green tea catechins, or any other suitable catechin-based or catechin-derived compound is used in accordance with the principles of the present invention at the above-referenced concentrations. For example, a third catechin preparation, formulated by the inventor, may be used if desired. This third preparation was used in connection with many of the patient examples herein which was a 5% green tea ointment preparation, in which 5 grams of a 100-gram tube was comprised of 90% green tea catechin polyphenols. It was compounded and formulated by Custom Scripts Pharmacy of Wesley Hills, Fla.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0142">The specific active ingredient(s) in this drug substance is not identified and the entire drug substance is determined to be active.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0143">In addition, in some embodiments of the invention, Oil of Peppermint NF from 0.1 to 1%, other similar flavor, olfactory or warming compounds may be added to the formulation of the present invention for added stimulatory effect and improved esthetics including improved taste and smell of the catechin product.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0144">The main active ingredient in Veregen&#xae; is sinecatechin polyphenols, which is a partially purified fraction of the water extract of green tea leaves from <i>Camellia sinensis </i>and is a mixture of catechins and other green tea components. Inactive components of Veregen&#xae; ointment include: isopropyl myristate, white petrolatum, cera alba (white wax), propylene glycolpalmitostearate, and oleyl alcohol. Catechins constitute 85 to 95% (by weight) of the total drug substance which includes more than 55% of Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), and other catechin derivatives such as Epicatechin (EC), Epigallocatechin (EGC), Epicatechin gallate (ECg), and some additional minor catechin derivatives i.e., Gallocatechin gallate (GCg), Gallocatechin (GC), Catechin gallate (Cg), and Catechin (C) in varying amounts. In addition to the known catechin components, it also contains gallic acid, caffeine, and theobromine which together constitute about 2.5% of the drug substance. The remaining amount of the drug substance contains undefined botanical constituents derived from green tea leaves.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0145">In some embodiments, Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) may constitute from about 45-%-95% of the active catechin ingredient. The ointment may also include one or more of the following compounds: isopropyl myristate, white petrolatum, cera alba (white wax), propylene glycol palmitostearate, and oleyl alcohol analogous to Veregen&#xae;. However, it will be understood that the active catechins may be formulated with different suitable preservatives, extending agents, emulsifiers, dispersing agents, suitable surfactants, an excipient, and in a time release formulation using techniques known in the art.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0146">In one embodiment, 5% catechin ointment as described herein is applied as a thin layer substantially covering the affected area of the external genital organs. In other embodiments, the ointment is applied once. In other embodiments, the ointment is applied several times daily, daily, weekly, monthly, or on an as-needed basis. In yet other embodiments, the ointment is applied for a period of about 1 week, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 months. For use to improve libido, without any other underlying FOD symptoms, the compounds of the present invention may generally be applied to the area around and into the vaginal introitus, clitoris and/or labia as desired by the user for maximum effect. In some embodiments, suppositories or douches as is known in the art may be used as further described below. Patient studies indicate once daily use in many instances is sufficient for clinical efficacy. However, some cases may require multiple daily applications. In yet other cases, the catechin ointment may be applied every other day, twice weekly or at another interval to achieve the desired clinical results without adverse reaction (e.g., skin irritation).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0147">For example, about 1.0 to 1.5 cm of ointment may be applied to the affected area about one to three times daily. It may be used up to about 4 months or indefinitely without interruption. Mild local skin reactions are not uncommon and initial adverse reactions tend to decrease over the course of treatment.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0148">One method of treatment in accordance with an aspect of the present invention is illustrated the flow chart <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. As shown at step <b>302</b> a patient may be clinically diagnosed with a Female Sexual Disorder. Where medically indicated, appropriate confirmatory testing may be performed (e.g., vaginal pH test, epithelium maturation index, cultures for bacteria and or yeast, and if medically indicated, biopsy). At step <b>304</b>, a health care provider may prescribe a catechin-based treatment of the type described herein. Initially, this is typically in the 2.5%-7.5% by weight range. Treatment instructions may include the application of the catechin-based ointment once a day for a period of about one month. The catechin ointment may be applied at bedtime or after bathing in the morning. Generally speaking, bathing soon after application of the catechin ointment of the present invention is not optimal as it may be washed off before ample absorption. Certain embodiments, however, may be formulated for fast acting absorption and washing may occur at a reasonable time thereafter.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0149">It will be understood the treatment duration described above is merely exemplary, and others may be used as appropriate. For example, the treatment duration may vary based on patient specifics such as degree of severity of condition, which condition(s) are present, age, physiological specifics, etc. Furthermore, the concentration of the medication may also vary based on the same or similar considerations including skin sensitivity and severity of the underlying condition (e.g., about 2%, 5%, 7.5%, or 10%).</p><p id="p-0152" num="0150">After the initial treatment period, the patient may return to the healthcare provider to observe the results of the treatment (step <b>306</b>). Depending on these results, further treatment may be prescribed or additional diagnosis performed (step <b>308</b>). This may include altering diagnosis and changing treatment, continuing treatment, or if the result is an acceptable outcome, tapering or possibly terminating treatment. If the patient is without any substantial adverse effects and is benefiting from the treatment, it may be continued substantially indefinitely.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0151">In the case where additional treatment is appropriate, the health care provider may continue for another period of time and observe results again, in an iterative fashion. Moreover, once &#x201c;primary&#x201d; treatment is complete, with desired clinical results, it may be desirable to continue treatment in a secondary fashion by the use of maintenance products (step <b>310</b>). Such maintenance products may include feminine hygiene soaps, washes, lubricants or other products that contain a lower amount of catechins suitable for long term use and continued clinical efficacy. This may include catechins in the amount of about 1-5% by weight catechin. These products may be used daily or periodically to maintain the desired results.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0152">For example, one treatment protocol in accordance with the present invention may include, after diagnosis, primary treatment with a 5% by weight catechin-based ointment for 2-8 weeks, followed by continued secondary treatment, if appropriate, with a feminine wash, soap or lubricant of about 1-3% by weight catechin for several times per week for an extended period or as needed for maintenance (which, in some cases may be long term). Such a diagnosis and treatment plan may, in some instances, be prescribed at the initial patient visit and diagnosis, with secondary treatment following the resolution of primary symptoms. In this case, steps <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> above may be omitted or may occur after secondary treatment step <b>310</b> has begun.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0153">For some patients that have noted habituation to the treatment, an increase in the concentration or frequency of treatment may be instituted. For example, maintenance treatment may require an increase in the percentage of catechin depending upon a subject's individual response and/or tolerance. For example, an increase from about 5% to about 10% catechin by weight may be indicated.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0154">Embodiments of the invention are also contemplated for over the counter (&#x201c;OTC&#x201d;) applications. For example, catechin preparations of the present invention may be formulated with active ingredients that allow it to be sold OTC. In this instance, the manufacturer may describe the symptoms and/or desired results for certain afflictions and instruct a user to apply an effective amount of the preparation for a certain period of time. If the symptoms resolve, the manufacturer may instruct the user to continue, discontinue or taper treatment (e.g., maintenance or secondary treatment described herein), and if not, seek further assistance from a medical professional.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0155">The formulations of the invention might comprise additional active ingredients or flavor enhancers.

In preferred embodiments, the concentration may be about 1.0% to 2.0%, 2.0% to 3.0%, 3.0% to 4.0%, 4.0% to 5.0%, 5.0% to 6.0%, 6.0% to 7.0%, 7.0% to 8.0%, 8.0% to 9.0%, or 9.0% to 10.0% v/v, or increments therebetween. In a more preferred embodiment, the concentration is about 3.0%.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0158">Emulsifiers for pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and other human consumption are well-known in the art. Exemplary emulsifiers for use in the formulations of the invention include food emulsifiers such as egg yolk (lecitihin), mustard (mucilage), soy lecithin, pickering stabilization, sodium stearoyl lactylate, and DATEM (Diacetyl Tartaric Acid Ester of Monoglyceride) and anise. Other emulsifiers include emulsifying wax, cetearyl alcohol, polysorbate 20, and ceteareth 20.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0159">The formulations of the invention comprise alcohol as surfactant or penetration enhancer. In some embodiments, the concentration of alcohol is about 1.0% to 10% v/v. In preferred embodiments, the concentration of alcohol may be about 1.0% to 2.0%, 2.0% to 3.0%, 3.0% to 4.0%, 4.0% to 5.0%, 5.0% to 6.0%, 6.0% to 7.0%, 7.0% to 8.0%, 8.0% to 9.0%, or 9.0% to 10.0% v/v, or increments therebetween. In a more preferred embodiment, the concentration is about 3.0%. Exemplary alcohols include ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and benzyl alcohol.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0160">Other embodiments of the present invention may include certain other active ingredients to treat the afflictions described herein. For example, low doses of hormones, SERMs, and/or vitamins may be included, if desired for an improved treatment response. For example, the 5% catechin preparation described herein may include about 400-800 IU of Vitamin E, about 1% DHEA, about 0.001.0-1% estrogen and/or if FDA approved about 0.001-0.01% testosterone. A specific example may include about 5% catechin by weight, about 0.01% or less estradiol, estriol, estrone and 400-800 IU of vitamin E. Another embodiment may include about 5% catechin, combined with lower doses of oral medications such as estrogens or SERMS, Ospemifene. Combinations of any of the above may combined together in one topical formulation. The catechin ointment can be used as an &#x201c;estrogen sparing&#x201d; agent lessening the chance of adverse effects from estrogen therapeutics.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0161">The present invention may also be suitable for internal use, for example, through ointment or other application vectors such as suppository or douche. Such uses may require additional FDA approval. In the case of vaginal suppository, the content of tea catechin may be around 100-500 mg/capsule, in some embodiments about 200-300 mg/capsule, and in one specific embodiment a 250 mg/capsule. Of note tea catechin suppositories have the added benefit of reducing uterine fibroids and cervical dysplasia.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0162">Another embodiment of the present invention may include a douche having a solution including a catechin preparation at the concentrations of the invention as disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the douche solution may include a suitable film-forming or absorption agent so that the active ingredients remain attached to the affected internal areas for a period of time after use. In other embodiments, the douche solution comprises time-release formulations such that the solution need only be introduced periodically (i.e., every several days or weekly).</p><p id="p-0165" num="0163">A typical usage example for the suppository in the case where for example the affected area is the cervix or the vagina is to insert a capsule containing 100-500 mg tea catechin, from once to several times every day for a period of 1-2 months. A douche may be used every other day, or twice a week, or periodically as indicated for 1-2 months depending on whether a film-forming or absorption agent used.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0164">It will be understood that other feminine hygiene and lubricant products may also be manufactured that include tea catechins for regular use to obtain the benefits of the present invention. For example, a lubricant such as K-Y Jelly&#xae; (Reckitt Benckiser, Parsippany, N.J.), or other personal lubricant as known in the art, may include about 1-10% by weight catechins as well as certain soap or wash formulations. These may be used, during, after (or before) the treatment regimens described herein to increase or maintain their benefits. In some embodiments, they also may be sold as OTC products that may be used without consulting a health care provider.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0165">It will be further understood that time release formula may be achieved using any suitable method including the use of esters to achieve the desired application of active ingredient. Thus, in some embodiments, time release formulations comprise formate, acetate, propionate, phenylpropionate, butyrate, valerate, hexanoate, caproate, isocaproate, heptanoate, enanthate, octanoate, cypionate, nonanoate, decanoate, or undecanoate.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0166">In preferred embodiments, shorter esters such as formate, acetate, and propionate are used for ointments, feminine wash and lubricants which are applied frequently. In other preferred embodiments, longer esters such as enanthate and cypionate are used for products applied less frequently such as suppositories, tampons, maxipads, sanitary napkins, panty liners and douches. In either type of embodiment, dermal patches may be used if desired.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0167">Further, health care professionals should be cognizant of the difference that large systemic doses of catechins may have. For example, a man taking several herbal substitutes for weight loss with included 400 mg epigallocatechin-3-gallate, EGCg, daily developed acute but reversible liver failure. As a result, the United States Pharmacopeia have suggested, but not mandated, a warning, stating symptoms of liver injury be placed on any green tea extract monograph produced.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0168">Alternatively, data support that moderate systemic doses of catechins derived from green tea provide a protective role against the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancers. Green and black tea have shown therapeutic benefit in relation to gynecologic cancers. The topical application of green tea catechins (e.g., Veregen) to the external genitalia have proven safe and effective dosed three times daily for four months.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0169">The invention provides a method for treating a female sexual disorder comprising administering an effective amount of a pharmaceutical comprising between 1% and 10% catechin to an individual that suffers from the disorder.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0170">An &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount of therapeutic compound that is effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result. A &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; of a therapeutic compound may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual. A therapeutically effective amount may be measured, for example, by improved survival rate, more rapid recovery, or amelioration, improvement or elimination of symptoms, or other acceptable biomarkers or surrogate markers. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the therapeutic compound are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A &#x201c;prophylactically effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount of therapeutic compound that is effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically, but not necessarily, since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0171">An &#x201c;individual,&#x201d; &#x201c;subject&#x201d; or &#x201c;patient&#x201d; is a vertebrate.

It was during the initial testing of the first two patients in Set 1 that libido increase was discovered.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0189">Initial clinical tests of the present invention were carried out in private practice in Rockland County, N.Y. with two women who had been diagnosed with VVA, vestibulodynia, Genital Pelvic Pain Disorder (GPPD) and Sexual Interest Arousal Disorder (SIAD).</p><p id="p-0192" num="0190">Tests were performed on these patients using a Catechin Green Tea Ointment, 15% by weight catechin (Custom Scripts Pharmacy Wesley Hills, Fla.) applied to the affected external genital organs continuously once a day for 2-10 weeks and intermittently for up to one year. During that period of monthly treatment examinations of the affected areas were conducted.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0191">Patient 1. Post-menopausal 62-year-old female with atrophic vaginitis and a prior long history pre-menopausally of vestibulodynia. After menopause, intercourse was not possible because of pain (dyspareunia) in the vaginal introitus and decrease in vaginal lubrication within the vagina, symptoms typical of vulvovaginal atrophy. Clinically, there was evidence of decreased vaginal lubrication and erythema around the posterior fourchette with pain elicited with Q-tip palpation on exam.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0192">After initially applying samples of Veregen for a week and noting benefit the patient was switched to Green Tea Ointment, 15% (Custom Scripts Pharmacy) for two weeks once daily, the patient noted increase in vaginal mucous and noticeable decrease in pain in the vulvar vestibule thereby allowing intercourse to be pain free. Despite decrease in vestibular pain, however, she complained of some irritation and superficial desquamation of her vaginal mucosa and was switched to 5% Green Tea Ointment (Custom Scripts Pharmacy, Wesley Chapel, Fla.). A follow-up exam revealed a normal vaginal mucosa with increased vaginal lubrication, no erythema around the posterior fourchette, and no pain was elicited with Q-tip palpation. She had no complaints of irritation. She noted increases in her sexual desire that was maintained for over one year while using the 5% Green Tea Ointment. The patient continues to use Green Tea Ointment, 5% (Custom Scripts Pharmacy) intermittently, applying approximately 0.5 cm daily for a week at a time when she notes reoccurrence of symptomology. She has been followed for over a year.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0193">Patient 2. Patient 2 (SG) was unable to have intercourse and suffered from chronic genital pain. SG is a 68 y/o female who was followed by her gynecologist for the past 11 years prior to using 15% GTO. She had a normal menarche, 3 children delivered vaginally, and essentially no significant issues during her reproductive years. She developed menopausal symptoms in her early 40s and was started on low dose PREMPRO&#xae; and continued on that regimen through 2004. At that point she became increasingly nervous about taking hormones and the decision was made to attempt changing to a bio-identical regimen of hormones. After a year, she wanted to switch back to PREMPRO because she felt much better on that regimen and was experiencing increasing hot flashes, vaginal dryness and loss of libido on the bio-identicals. Low dose PREMPRO (0.3/1.5) was started and VAGIFEM was used for vaginal issues. She maintained this regimen and felt fairly good, despite no libido, until 2011 at which time she developed a benign breast lump and decided to stop all hormonal therapy. Her vagina became increasingly dry, sensitive and ultimately painful. Intercourse was essentially nonexistent due to her pain (dyspareunia), and she presented late in 2014 wanting to address this issue. Examination at that time revealed an atrophic vulva and vagina, mucosa was very dry and flat with some scarring at the perineum and skin changes consistent with Lichens Sclerosis. Green Tea Ointment, 15% catechin (Custom Scripts Pharmacy) was prescribed and lubrication issues reviewed in detail.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0194">PMH: Sulfa allergy</p><p id="p-0197" num="0195">Hx of osteoporosis, carpal tunnel syndrome</p><p id="p-0198" num="0196">Medications: Evista</p><p id="p-0199" num="0197">Significant Family hx: Ovarian Cancer in her maternal Grandmother</p><p id="p-0200" num="0198">Patient 2 returned approximately 10 weeks after starting the Green Tea Ointment, 15% catechin using 0.5 inches of material to vulva up to once daily her vulvar pain was gone and there was a noticeable improvement in her vaginal dryness. After two weeks she attempted intercourse several times but was unable to have vaginal penetration because of dyspareunia. Patient 2, however, demonstratively expressed that this regimen had changed her sexuality potential and her life in general because her arousal and desire had increased. The exam showed marked improvement in the skin around the perineal body, no tenderness, and healthy-appearing vaginal mucosa. Lubrication issues were again reviewed and a natural Vitamin E suppository was prescribed for additional help with lubrication. Subsequently, the patient did not request a renewal of the 15% Green Tea Ointment and was lost to follow-up.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0201" num="0199">Based on the results of the above testing, additional test subjects were recruited at random to further test efficacy and scope of the invention. Treatment with 15% by weight catechin preparation caused irritation and was not suitable for long term use. The benefits of treatment were mitigated. A custom catechin preparation was formulated at 5% which was much better tolerated. Some patients were referred from gynecologic healthcare professionals or from medical dermatology practice, primarily for complaints of Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPD), including dyspareunia and vulvodynia and/or vestibulodynia. The initial two subjects (Set 1) showed improvement not just in alleviation of Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPD), but also in Sexual Interest and Arousal Disorder (SIAD). Questionnaires were then introduced in this test Set 2 to elucidate whether these added therapeutic effects would be seen in other women whose primary complaint was dyspareunia or vulvodynia. The questionnaires were known in the art. (See DeRogatis et al., <i>J. Sex Med </i>5:357-364 (2008); DeRogatis et al., <i>J. Sex Med </i>6:175-183 (2009) Rosen et al., <i>J.

It was understood, however, by the subjects, that the catechin preparations of the present invention may (or may not) help relieve symptoms of Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPD). Patients were a mix of premenopausal and postmenopausal women. The age range was from 38 to 68 years old.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Test Parameters and Details</heading><p id="p-0203" num="0201">Compounding Pharmacy: Custom Scripts Pharmacy compounded and supplied the prescribed 5% Green Tea Ointment (&#x201c;GTO&#x201d;). It comprised 90% polyphenols from the water-soluble fraction of green tea. (Pharmacy Compounding Centers of America, Houston Tex.) It was formulated in petrolatum USP with no additives. The medication was supplied in a white opaque tube with 30 grams per tube from Custom Scripts Pharmacy.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0202">Subjects read, discussed and then signed a consent form for enrollment into the study, a consent form for use of their clinical photographs, a non-disclosure agreement, and an instruction sheet for use of GTO. They were asked to complete several standard questionnaires prior to use of the study medication.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0203">All patients were up to date and instructed to continue their regular gynecological care as recommended by their gynecologic healthcare professional. Physical examinations were performed by Wendy Epstein, M.D., F.A.A.D. along with her medical assistant. Pain was confirmed by Q-tip palpation of affected sites. Some of the postmenopausal subjects had a maturation index and vaginal pH taken before and after 4 weeks of GTO daily use. Most of the premenopausal subjects had a pre and post vaginal pH measured.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0204">Vaginal maturation index: is an indication of estrogenic effect on the vaginal epithelium. The test was done, in postmenopausal subjects, to demonstrate that the mechanism of action of GTO is independent or void of any estrogenic effects in the vagina and therefore safe for women who for a variety of medical or personal choice issues cannot or will not use estrogenic compounds or other hormones to treat their sexual disorder. A brushing of the lateral vaginal wall was, spread on a glass slide, fixative applied immediately and the sample allowed to dry then sent for evaluation of the vaginal maturation index to either Quest Diagnostics or LabCorp.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0205">Vaginal pH as another indication of estrogenic state was done using pH paper calibrated from 5.5-8.0</p><p id="p-0208" num="0206">The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a known standard questionnaire, designed and validated for assessment of female sexual function and quality of life in clinical trials or epidemiological studies. It is a multidimensional self-reporting measure of female sexual function designed to be a clinical trials assessment instrument. The 19-item assessment of overall sexual function is divided into 6 domains: desire, subjective arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. Every domain contributes a maximum of six points to the total score. Thus, the maximal score is 36. Higher scores indicate better sexual function. Significant and positive statistical differences have been observed in each domain between controls and women with female sexual arousal disorder. It has proven a valid indicator in the assessment of key dimensions of female sexual function. However, the FSFI is appropriately used only for subjects who have had some level of sexual activity during the measurement period.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0207">The Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R) is a known standard questionnaire to assess the frequency of personal distress that a woman may have been experiencing because of a sexual dysfunction during the past 30 days. It helps quantify the extent to which the sexual dysfunction is causing her emotional distress. It was developed to provide a standardized, quantitative measure of sexually related personal distress in women. The questionnaire was originally designed to validate a diagnosis of hypoactive sexual desire disorder which required a woman to be distressed about the lack of desire. Question 13 specifically assesses distress due to low sexual desire. The questionnaire was used more generally to validate that a woman has distress caused by any of the three disorders of female sexuality despite the lack of specific questions about pain or discomfort.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0208">The 13 items are rated on a 5-point scale from 0 (never) to 4 (always); thus, the total score ranges from 0 to 52, with lower scores indicating less distress. A score of &#x3e;11 indicates Female Sexual Dysfunction.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0209">The Vulvovaginal Symptom Questionnaire (VSQ) is a known standard questionnaire more specifically addresses female Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorders (GPPD's).

Web. 17 Mar. 2016.) The questionnaire's focus is to determine the nature and effect of a woman's vulvar symptoms. The VSQ is a 21-item written questionnaire with four scales: symptoms, emotions, life impact, and sexual impact.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0210">Sexual Activity Log (SAL) is a known standard questionnaire, tries to quantify the level of sexual desire experienced, the level of distress about the level of sexual desire experienced, the number of sexual activities, whether the sexual activity was satisfying, i.e. did the woman experience an orgasm. The SAL questionnaire was answered prior to beginning the study and at the end of each one of the four weeks during the one-month study. Following the one-month study period, subjects were allowed to continue the 5% GTO. The effects continued. Some individuals desired and tolerated higher concentrations of GTO 7.5% after several months of daily use.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0211">Patient's Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) was used to assess women's evaluation of the overall change in their SIAD or GPPD. It comprised one question: &#x201c;How is your condition (i.e., decreased sexual desire or pain or discomfort and feeling bothered by it) today compared with when you started study medication?&#x201d; and was rated on a 7-point scale from 1 (very much improved) through 4 (no change) to 7 (very much worse). Patient Benefit Evaluation (PBE) was a simple question with a Yes or No response to whether the medication was useful for them after one month of usage. &#x201c;Overall, do you believe that you have experienced a meaningful benefit from the study medication?&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0214" num="0212">The Narrative Questionnaire was developed with questions focused primarily on characterizing the nature of a woman's genitopelvic pain disorder, its impact on her emotional and sexual life and later on the benefit, if any, from the study medication.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0213">Participants are allowed to complete all questionnaires alone, in a private room.

The pain, dyspareunia, prevented intercourse with her husband causing her to feel guilty. The pain was a significant factor for why she was not having intercourse. She rarely became lubricated and always required use of lubricant. She was, however, able to have an orgasm most of the time but only sometimes during intercourse.

Compounds of the present invention resulted in a mean decrease of &#x2212;0.6 (p=0.172) in the sexual distress score.</p><p id="p-0433" num="0428">Thus, as can be seen from the foregoing, topical application of Green Tea Ointment (GTO) in accordance with aspects of the present invention demonstrates clinical efficacy for premenopausal and postmenopausal women by decreasing Genitopelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPD) including during penetration, increasing sexual interest and arousal or alleviating symptoms of Sexual Interest Arousal Disorder (SIAD), and enhancing orgasm intensity and/or frequency for symptoms of Female Orgasmic Disorder (FOD) therapeutic effects of GTO were demonstrated in women who applied topical GTO over a period of four weeks to their vulva and vaginal introitus with no significant side effects.</p><p id="p-0434" num="0429">Topical GTO was shown to be efficacious in reducing or completely eliminating vestibulodynia, a common cause of dyspareunia in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. This condition may be seen in 15% of all premenopausal women sometime in their lifetime. It is a cause of genital pain and dyspareunia in postmenopausal often unrelated to vulvovaginal atrophy. Vestibulodynia is a challenging disorder and there has been no definitive treatment for this condition despite use of a range of treatments. The catechin preparations of the present invention are the first and only chemical compound known to effectively treat vestibulodynia in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women.</p><p id="p-0435" num="0430">Vulvovaginal atrophy, also a cause of genital pain and dyspareunia, exerts a negative impact on the quality of life of fifty percent (50%) of all postmenopausal women. In contrast to topical or systemic estrogenic drugs, topical GTO was effective in reducing or eliminating genital pain and dyspareunia caused by vulvovaginal atrophy without causing therapeutically significant changes in the vaginal maturation index or the vaginal pH. This is evidence that GTO has no apparent estrogenic effects and is therefore safe in women with risk of breast or other reproductive malignancies, and carries no risk of stroke, deep venous thrombosis or dementia.</p><p id="p-0436" num="0431">Other aspects of the invention provide methods and compositions for improving male and female sexual function, treating a cutaneous inflammation, or increasing libido with an catechin such as Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg). In other embodiments, synthetic analogs of EGCg or other catechins present in green tea formulated to increase their stability or bioavailability are also contemplated by the invention. For example, synthetic oligomers of EGCg may be used if desired as well as any other suitable analog that improves stability or bioavailability. They may include methylation or similar known compounding techniques to improve or stability, efficacy, bioavailability or strength of the underlying effective ingredient. Also contemplated by the invention are the use of so-called EGCg &#x201c;prodrugs.&#x201d; (See, e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 8,193,377, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.).</p><p id="p-0437" num="0432">One such formulation of the present invention may include about 5-15% by weight per unit volume of a combination of the Epigallocatechin(s) and Epicatechin(s) mentioned above or substantially by themselves. One such formulation, for example, may include about 50% Epigallocatechin gallate, 25% Epigallocatechin, and 25% Epicatechin. However, other ratios are possible (e.g., 33% for each, etc.). Further, although a preferred embodiment may include at least some Epigallocatechin gallate, other embodiments may include just Epigallocatechin, and/or Epicatechin in a suitable mixture (e.g., 50% each, 75/25, etc., without substantially any EGCg).</p><p id="p-0438" num="0433">Another embodiment of the invention contemplated herein may include Epigallocatechin gallate, and/or an analog thereof, as a majority component (e.g., 50-95% of the 5-15% w/w with other components in any suitable mixture). In another embodiment, the active ingredient may be substantially about 100% Epigallocatechin gallate (e.g., emulsified in a suitable base such as petroleum or other waxes, gels, ointments, lotions, and the like). Further, the compounds of the invention disclosed herein may include embodiments having about 1%-50% by weight per unit volume of the active ingredients described above.</p><p id="p-0439" num="0434">One benefit of topically applied ointments of the present invention, as compounded (e.g., about 1-50% EGCg), is that the formulation is substantially colorless (milky white) and therefore does not stain the clothing or underwear of the user. This is in contrast to topically applied GTO that tends to have a rust or red brown color, stains underwear, and may require a prophylactic layer. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are more aesthetically pleasing, easier to use, and therefore preferable to the user.</p><p id="p-0440" num="0435">Furthermore, smaller amounts of the Epigallocatechin ointment may be used to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. Thus, it may be viewed as more effective on a unit volume by weight perspective as compared to GTO compounds.</p><p id="p-0441" num="0436">In some embodiments, the compositions of the invention can be applied on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7-day intervals for a duration of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more weeks as required to achieve the desired therapeutic results. EGCg may be useful either alone or in combination with other compounds for the indications noted herein including both male and female sexual indications. Various analogs of Epigallocatechin, EGCg or other green tea catechins may be used to improve stability, bioavailability or efficacy.</p><p id="p-0442" num="0437">For example, catechin compounds, which may include GTO components such as epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechins, epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin, or analogs thereof, may be combined with certain other compounds including vasodilators such as L-arginine, erectile dysfunction medications (some of which have vasodilator effects) such as alprostadil, tadalafil, vardenafil, sildenafil, and/or cannabinoids to treat both male and female sexual disorders. Further, it will be understood that aberrant, toxic sensations and decreased nipple sensory perception are considered included in the term &#x201c;sexual disorders&#x201d; that may be treated by the present invention.</p><p id="p-0443" num="0438">Cannabis has known applications in alleviating human suffering and treating various disease states. In some embodiments, epigallocatechins, epicatechin and/or EGCg is combined with a cannabinoid. Cannabinoids are pharmacologically-active compounds found in cannabis. In preferred embodiments, the cannabinoid is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is a strong anti-inflammatory and pain killer. THC is also psychoactive and may facilitate sexual interest and arousal. In other preferred embodiments, the cannabinoid is Cannabidiol (CBD). CBD is considered to have a wide scope of potential medical applications due to clinical reports showing the lack of side effects, particularly a lack of psychoactivity. (See, e.g., Nagarkatti et al., <i>Future Med. Chem. </i>1(7): 1333-1349 (2009), incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.)</p><p id="p-0444" num="0439">Further, certain natural or synthetic hormones or analogs of hormones may also be included in addition to the above. Examples include selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such Ospemifene (OSPHENA&#xae;), estrogens, phytoestrogens, androgens (testosterone and DHEA). For example, a compound contemplated by the present invention may include 1-25% EGCg (and/or epigallocatechins, epicatechin including analogs), a vasodilator such as L-arginine and/or alprostadil along with a Cannabinoid which may include THC and/or CBD. Suitable dosages may be between about 2-20 mg of a suitable THC/CBD product. One such example of a suitable cannabinoid preparation is the FORIA product currently available at foriapleasure.com, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Other compounds that may be added may include melatonin II and Bremelanotide (PT-141).</p><p id="p-0445" num="0440">For example, one specific embodiment may include about 5-25% EGCg or suitable analog, about 10 mg THC/CBD per dose, and a vasodilator such as L-arginine or alprostadil in an effective topical dose. Other compounds such as estrogen, a SERM (e.g., Osphimene), an androgen (e.g., DHEA, testosterone) melatonin II and/or Bremelanotide (PT-141) may also be added alone, or in any suitable combination, if desired.</p><p id="p-0446" num="0441">Another specific embodiment may include, for example, about 5-25% EGCg or suitable analog, a vasodilator such L-arginine or alprostadil in an effective topical dose. Other compounds such as melatonin II and Bremelanotide (PT-141) may also be added, if desired.</p><p id="p-0447" num="0442">In addition, certain embodiments of the present invention have a positive effect on male libido, performance and sexual sensation. This may include a GTO, EGCg or suitable analog preparations of about 5-50% and may further include a vasodilator such L-arginine, alprostadil, tadalafil, vardenafil, sildenafil in an effective topical dose and may also include a suitable absorption catalyst and/or acceleration agent in order to obtain a predictable and desirable time to onset of therapeutic effect. Other compounds such as androgens (e.g., Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone, a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) melatonin II, or Bremelanotide (PT-141)) may also be added alone or in any suitable combination, if desired. Such formulation may be prepared for both topical and oral formulations. For example, one suitable oral formulation in accordance with aspects of the present invention may include about 200-400 mg EGCg or suitable analog with known doses of a vasodilator, a hormone(s), or a SARM as described above may be used orally, or both orally and topically if desired to increase, improve or otherwise optimize therapeutic effect. This may include use of an ointment, liquid, spray application, dermal patch, specially designed underwear, etc. Any suitable application vector may be used if desired.</p><p id="p-0448" num="0443">Furthermore, any of the above preparations may be deposited or disposed on a male or female condom or other known devices for sexual enhancement (e.g., vibrator). Other embodiments may include a suitable application vector such as feminine hygiene products including tampons, sanitary napkins panty liners, underwear, dermal patches and the like. These embodiments include, but are not limited to, a physical or mechanical device designed to induce sexual pleasure or enhancement. This may include any of the GTO or catechin derived preparations described herein. For example, a condom may be combined with about a 5-35% EGCg preparation on the outside, the inside, or within the packaging. In further embodiments, the preparation combined with the condom includes a cannabinoid. In other embodiments, the preparation incudes a vasodilator. In other embodiments, the preparation incudes an androgen (DHEA, testosterone). In other embodiments, the preparation includes a SARM (Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator). For females only, other embodiments may contain a SERM or estrogen. In other embodiments, the preparation includes melatonin.</p><p id="p-0449" num="0444">The invention contemplates a male or female condom that is combined with GTO, EGCg, or another catechin preparation as described herein.

For example, topical preparations having EGCg concentrations of about 0.1%-10% may be used if desired. In some embodiments, this may be combined with retinoids (e.g., Retin A), vasoconstricting agents (e.g. brimonidine Mirvaso), topical or systemic antimicrobials, antibiotics, antiparasitics, ivemectin (Soolantra), azelaic acid (Finacea), tacrolimus (Protopic), or Elidel (pimecrolimus). In some embodiments, the topical regimen may be supplemented or replaced by systemic (oral) EGCg at about 200-500 mg daily.</p><p id="p-0452" num="0447">Other inflammatory indication(s) that may be treated with the above regimen include arthritis (e.g., psoriatic or rheumatoid arthritis). As described above, this may include a regimen of topically applying about 3%-50% EGCg (e.g., 25%) to affected areas such as joints and may optionally be supplemented (or replaced) by systemic (oral) EGCg at about 200-500 mg daily. Such a treatment regimen is less toxic than other immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, Azothiprine, certain biologics (e.g., Enbrel, Stelara, etc.), topical or systemic corticosteroids, Vitamin D analogs, retinoids, calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., Protopic, Elidel) and topical anthralins. Topical EGCg alone or in combination with corticosteroids would decrease the toxicity associated with corticosteroid treatments, i.e. EGCg would have a steroid sparing effect.</p><p id="p-0453" num="0448">In some embodiments, the topical EGCg is combined with a topical corticosteroid to enable steroid sparing in the treatment of a cutaneous inflammation. Co-administration of systemic EGCg would enable toxicity reduction or sparing from antimetabolites, biologics, corticosteroids, and other known drugs in the treatment of systemic inflammatory conditions including arthritis.</p><p id="p-0454" num="0449">Other inflammatory indication(s) that may be treated with the above regimen include dermatitis conditions (e.g., Psoriasis, Urinary Tract indications, Atopic Dermatitis, Seborrheic dermatitis, Nummular eczema, Stasis dermatitis, eczema, alopecia areata, lichen planopilaris and dandruff). As described above, this may include a regimen of topically applying about 5%-50% EGCg (e.g., 10-25%) to affected areas, and in the case of cutaneous inflammatory dermatoses of the scalp, may include the use of 5-35% EGCg shampoo and/or body wash. This may optionally be supplemented (or replaced) by systemic (oral) EGCg at about 200-400 mg daily. Shampoos containing EGCg may further comprise salicylic acid or selenium sulfide. In some embodiments, a suitable body wash or other general application vector may include soap or soap-like compounds and any suitable absorption, adhesion and/or wetting agent and may further include dermal patches and specially designed clothes or underwear. Scalp treatments may also be supplemented with the periodic use of a UV or laser comb (with &#x2dc;250-350 nm wavelength) as described in more detail below. In some embodiments, the topical EGCg may be combined with a topical Crisaborole (Eucrisa, a topical phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, calcineurin inhibitors or JAK inhibitors).</p><p id="p-0455" num="0450">Other indications that may be treated using topical and/or systemic administration described above include, but are not limited to: Alopecia (including androgenetic alopecia), alopecia areata, ankylosing spondylitis, celiac disease, chronic glomerulonephritis, chronic urticarial, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, giant cell arteritis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia purpura, multiple sclerosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, morphea, hypertrophic scarring, keloids, bullous dermatoses, type 1 diabetes, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel disease, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis.</p><p id="p-0456" num="0451">Preparations of the present invention have also been shown to be effective in treating certain other inflammatory cutaneous indications and their underlying systemic sequala. For example, an underlying inflammatory dermatosis such as hyperkeratosis of palms and soles may be treated with EGCg preparation of about 2-50% EGCg (e.g., 25%) and may include a salicylic acid and/or urea cream which may be mixed and/or used in a two-step process (e.g., to resolve thickened skin impediment (first) to allow for penetration of EGCg into affected area (second)) so that once stratum corneum is sufficiently thinned, it enables action of EGCg to treat the underlying inflammation.</p><heading id="h-0029" level="1">Example 3</heading><p id="p-0457" num="0452">Patients compared the effects of 5% EGCg to previous use of 5% GTO:</p><p id="p-0458" num="0453">Patient is a 67-year-old woman with vulvovaginal atrophy that complained of dyspareunia and vaginal dryness. She was taking Zoloft for anxiety. She had previously used 5% GTO (green tea ointment) and found that using it 3 times per week improved her vaginal lubrication and decreased pain during intercourse. She had run out of the 5% GTO for two months and was only using topical Vitamin E oil. After several days of using 5% EGCg ointment she commented on its superiority when compared to 5% GTO: &#x201c;The new one seems to be more effective and quicker acting. Also prefer the creamier consistency and the fact that it is white, not red. The dryness went away almost instantly.&#x201d; As with 5% GTO, she had irritation if she used it more than 3 times per week. Patient continues to use 5% EGCg 3 times per week with continued successful results.</p><heading id="h-0030" level="1">Example 4</heading><p id="p-0459" num="0454">Patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of vulvodynia and decreased libido who had benefited from using 5% GTO on a regular basis several times per week. She complained about the red-brown color and the staining from the 5% GTO. Furthermore, it would take about a week after discontinuation and restarting the 5% GTO before she noticed an increase in her libido. However, she no longer had symptoms of vulvodynia despite not using the 5% GTO for several weeks. The use of 5% GTO seemed to have at least temporarily resolved substantially all of her vulvodynia symptoms.</p><p id="p-0460" num="0455">Within about 24 hours of using 5% EGCg ointment, however, she noticed an increase in her libido and localized genital sexual sensations. She also noted an increase in vaginal lubrication during sexual activity. The effect continued even if she skipped a day of use. &#x201c;EGCg was more effective as rapid onset of effect and sustained effect vs GTO.&#x201d; She preferred the 5% EGCg because it was essentially white and colorless and did not stain her underwear. She continues to use the 5% EGCg on a daily basis.</p><p id="p-0461" num="0456">The same subject, had undergone prophylactic bilateral subcutaneous nipple sparing mastectomies 16 years prior, with both decreased light touch sensation and noxious painful sensation with pressure to both nipples. After application of 15% EGCg, she noted an increase in sexually pleasant light touch sensation after several days of twice daily application. She also noted an unanticipated decrease in noxious pain perception with pressure stimulation of both nipples that was delayed by several months. The further combination of 15% EGCg with Capsaicin 0.1% both increased touch sensation and decreased noxious painful sensation upon palpation.</p><p id="p-0462" num="0457">Cutaneous Inflammation</p><p id="p-0463" num="0458">Preparations of the present invention have also been shown to be effective in treating certain other inflammatory cutaneous indications and their underlying systemic sequala. For example, an underlying inflammatory dermatosis such as hyperkeratosis of palms and soles may be treated with EGCg preparation of about 3-50% EGCg (or suitable analog) and may include a salicylic acid and/or urea cream (or other suitable penetration and/or absorption agent) which may be mixed and/or used in a two-step process (e.g., to resolve thickened skin impediment (first) to allow for penetration of EGCg compound into affected area (second)) so that once stratum corneum is sufficiently thinned, it enables action of EGCg to treat the underlying inflammation.</p><heading id="h-0031" level="1">Example 5</heading><p id="p-0464" num="0459">One specific example of a suitable cutaneous inflammatory mediated indication that may be treated with the present invention include psoriasis and psoriasis-like indications. In psoriasis, underlying inflammation causes both dilated tortuous blood vessels and secondary hyperkeratosis or thickening of epidermis with both living and dead skin cells (stratum corneum). Treatment with a preparation of about 3-50% EGCg in addition to certain penetration, adhesion and/or adsorption agents as mentioned above may used as desired. In some embodiments, the topical regimen may be supplemented and/or replaced with systemic (oral) EGCg at about 200-400 mg daily to treat the underlying inflammation.</p><p id="p-0465" num="0460">A 51-year-old male with psoriasis on the upper quadrant of the buttocks, including typical extension into the intergluteal fold, was treated with topical 15% EGCg ointment for several days and realized significant relief in psoriasis signs and symptoms (i.e., decrease in scaling and inflammation and pruritus). The same indication was subsequently treated with a 25% EGCg (and then 50% EGCg) cream which resolved symptoms more quickly and substantially resolved both the signs and symptoms after about 7 days of daily topical application. Periodic follow up with additional topical applications can be used as indicated. In some embodiments, the topical regimen may be supplemented or replaced with a systemic (oral) EGCg at about 200-500 mg daily.</p><p id="p-0466" num="0461">In certain embodiments, treatment with topical EGCg and or GTO as described herein may be supplemented by periodic application of UV light to affected areas. For example, UV light between about 250-350 nm may be periodically applied to affected areas in addition to application of the various embodiments of the GTO/EGCg compounds described herein. In one such embodiment, UV light may be applied prior to application of GTO/EGCg compounds. For example, UV light between about 290-320 nm may be applied anywhere between about 30 seconds to 5 minutes to affected areas. After exposure to such UV light, GTO/EGCg compounds may then be applied shortly thereafter. This may be thought of essentially as &#x201c;concurrent&#x201d; use or treatment.</p><p id="p-0467" num="0462">In other embodiments, application of UV light may be given some time to have a desired effect, and GTO/EGCg compounds may be applied in an alternating fashion such that UV light is applied one day and GTO/EGCg compounds applied on the next day etc. Such treatments may also be alternated at other intervals as desired to meet therapeutic goals (at alternating 12, 24, 36, or 72-hour intervals, etc.). Other parameters of this two-tiered treatment approach may also be modified in order to achieve a desired effect may include altering the wavelength of the applied UV light and/or alerting duration of application of UV light as well as altering the strength and composition of the GTO/EGCg compounds (or a combination of the above).</p><p id="p-0468" num="0463">For example, longer wavelengths of UV light are known to have a superior penetration effect and thus may be preferred at the onset of treatment to penetrate initial plaque deposits. For example, a wavelength of about 250-290 nm may be applied initially and then raised to about 300-320 nm (e.g., 311 nm). It is generally desirable that such light penetrate to the basal layer to remodel plaques. Similarly, high concentrations of GTO/EGCg compounds with a penetration and/or absorption agent may be used initially and then reduced somewhat to maintain the desired therapeutic effect. For example, 40% by weight GTO/EGCg preparation may be used in conjunction with the application of about 290 nm UV light, which may, after a period of time be reduced to 5-15% concentration with UV applications at about 310 nm for a reduced period of time. Moreover, such treatments initially may be applied daily, every other day, 2-3 times a week or as needed (e.g., once per week) to obtain and maintain the desired results. Each patient will differ somewhat and may require optimization of the treatment protocol for best results. This may include changing the wavelength or duration of applied UV light and/or the strength and/or composition of the GTO/EGCg preparation</p><p id="p-0469" num="0464">Other light-based treatments that may also be used in accordance with the invention include the use of lasers such as an excimer laser at about 300-320 nm (e.g., 308 nm) in conjunction with the various GTO/EGCg preparations described herein. Some patients may respond better to such laser irritation than to UV light as described herein. Moreover, in some embodiments, exposure to laser light may reduce the amount of treatment time. Other treatments that may be combined with various GTO/EGCg preparations described herein may also include the oral psoralen and UVA light to resolve psoriasis.</p><p id="p-0470" num="0465">A similar approach may be used when treating a scalp. This may include a UV or laser comb at the wavelengths described above along with a shampoo or body wash having concentrations of about 1-15% GTO/EGCg. Moreover, such treatments initially may be applied daily, every other day, 2-3 times a week or as needed (e.g., one per week) to obtain and maintain the desired results. Each patient will differ somewhat and may require optimization of the treatment protocol for best results. This may include changing the wavelength or duration of applied UV light and/or the strength and/or composition of the GTO/EGCg preparation.</p><heading id="h-0032" level="1">Example 6</heading><p id="p-0471" num="0466">Enhancement of Male Sexual Function. The male patient of Example 5 topically applied 15% and 25% and 50 EGCg ointment to his glans penis at varying intervals. He noticed an increased libido, intensity and duration (length) of orgasm during sexual encounters, increased speed and ease with which climax was achieved. In some applications, such result began to occur within about 1-3 hours after application and remained for several hours. This outcome appears to be related to the improvement or enhancement of neurologic function or sensitivity of pathways that mediate sexual stimulation, orgasm and related sexual functions. Daily, periodic, or situational use may achieve these benefits. Combination with vasodilators and other known sexual enhancement compounds as described herein also are also contemplated by the present invention.</p><p id="p-0472" num="0467">Moreover, it was observed that higher concentrations of EGCg tended to have a greater efficacy and a more rapid onset of effect when treating sexual function indications. Accordingly, treatment with higher concentrations (and/or and absorption agent to accelerate uptake) may be used for periodic or situational use whereas lower concentrations are suitable for daily use. In addition, certain absorption agents may be used in conjunction with the EGCg in order to decease the time to onset of the therapeutic effect of GTO/EGCg preparations described herein.</p><p id="p-0473" num="0468">Applications with about 5% EGCg preparation may be applied regularly (e.g., daily or twice daily application) for a substantially continuous effect whereas about 25-50% EGCg preparations are used for a shorter time before or during a time period more immediately prior to sexual activity. In some embodiments, the more immediate time period includes one, two, three or four applications with about 24 hours prior to sex. In other embodiments, the time period is within about one to three hours before sexual activity.</p><p id="p-0474" num="0469">In other embodiments, certain patients may benefit from a &#x201c;loading&#x201d; period during which GTO/EGCg preparations described herein are applied 1-3 times a day for 2-5 days prior to sexual activity. This may enhance absorption and assimilation in neural pathways to provide the enhanced effect. Such a loading period may include concentrations between about 10-50% by weight GTO/EGCg and may further include absorption assimilation agents. After the initial loading period, once daily applications (or less. e.g., 2-3 times per week) may be used in order maintain the enhanced effect.</p><p id="p-0475" num="0470">Moreover, at least test subject (DI) showed marked improvement of her urinary tract indications using 5% GTO preparation. Accordingly, given the unique and shared embryological origin of the vestibular epithelium of the vulvar and parts of the urinary tract, in both males and females, the invention contemplated hereunder provides for the anti-inflammatory effects of catechins as efficacious in treating, alleviating symptoms of, or curing inflammatory conditions of the urinary tract in both males and females. Accordingly the embodiments of the invention described herein may also be used to treat such urinary tract indications (which may include systemic and/or topical treatments).</p><heading id="h-0033" level="1">OTHER OBSERVATIONS</heading><p id="p-0476" num="0471">Topical application of 5% EGCg ointment (per weight per unit volume of EGCg) to the vulvar vestibule and clitoris in a petroleum base was found to be effective, and, in some respects, superior to, a 5% Green Tea Ointment (GTO) in the treatment of FSD or increasing libido. EGCg appears to be more effective than a heterogeneous mixture of catechins and the ointment was found to be simpler to apply, more hygienic, without red brown color and staining of underwear, and more pleasant. The 5% EGCg had a smoother consistency compared to Green Tea ointment that has a more particulate consistency.</p><p id="p-0477" num="0472">EGCg ointments of 5%, 15% and 25% were formulated in a petrolatum base (US Pharmacy Lab, Northvale, New; Custom Scripts Pharmacy, Wesley Chapel Fla.).

The effect was reported as long lasting despite discontinuation of the application of the EGCg ointment. In fact, the ointment may have substantially &#x201c;cured&#x201d; the vulvodynia, vestibulodynia and other associated forms of discomfort. After one week of continuous use, the relief lasted for at least over two years.</p><p id="p-0478" num="0473">Topically applied 5% EGCg ointment has been observed to have a more rapid onset of action (as compared to GTO compounds in US20160271102). Improvements in sexual arousal, pleasurable sexual sensations, intensity of perceived sexual sensations, and orgasm were perceived. In some instances, the effect was enjoyed within hours of a single application.</p><p id="p-0479" num="0474">Topically applied 5% EGCg ointment alleviated and then eliminated pain from certain cutaneous indications including vulvodynia, vestibulodynia within about one week of daily topical application.</p><p id="p-0480" num="0475">Topically applied about 5%-25% EGCg directly to the nipples of a patient with neurological dysesthesia secondary to bilateral subcutaneous nipple sparing mastectomies partially restored light touch sexual sensations from both nipples as well as decreasing aberrant painful sensations occurring on pressure stimulation of both nipples. The addition of 0.05%-0.1% Capsaicin to the EGCg partially increased light touch sexual sensations and decreased aberrant painful sensations on pressure stimulation of both nipples in the same patient. The same formulations of EGCg and/or Capsaicin but in varying concentrations of Capsaicin 0.01-0.1% may be applied to normal intact nipples to enhance sexual sensations. In vitro studies have shown that topical EGCg can inhibit the growth of human mammary cancer cells. (Komori A, et al., J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 23:186-190 (1993), incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.). When applying medications to breast or nipples it is important to note that unlike estrogens, EGCg inhibits breast cancer.</p><p id="p-0481" num="0476">Furthermore, it will be understood that compounds based on EGCg such as modified molecular derivatives, and analogs determined using known techniques, may be used in place of, or in addition to, the GTO and EGCg and related catechin or sinecatechin derived compounds described herein.</p><p id="p-0482" num="0477">All publications and patent documents disclosed or referred to herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.
