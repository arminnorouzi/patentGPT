To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is concerned with the removal of heat from heat-generating electric and electronic components of telecommunications equipment received within an environmentally hardened housing. In a more specific aspect, the invention is concerned with wireless telecommunication equipment which is deployed outdoors and susceptible to environmental conditions requiring the use of environmentally hardened housings.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fixed wireless services typically use directional radio antennas on each end of a signal transmission channel. Such antennas are often mounted to buildings, transmission/repeater towers, poles, etc. Because they are designed for an outdoor environment, telecommunication antennas are typically housed in radomes or other housings that are weatherproof (i.e. environmentally hardened) to protect the delicate electronic and electric components associated with the antennas from ambient conditions such as rain, debris, air pollution, etc., while still permitting the unhindered propagation of electromagnetic radiation, particularly radio waves, to and from the protected antenna.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Development of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology for fixed wireless telecommunication systems, including 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution), has meant that a comparatively larger number of power-consuming, heat generating electronic components are housed in a common housing with the various antennas used. Typically, outdoors mounted enclosures for wireless transmission equipment, such as 4G LTE routers/modems, MIMO antenna base stations and modems, and the like, as well as stationary user equipment installed at (end) user premises, need to be rated &#x2018;dust and water tight&#x2019; (e.g. IP65 standard). Meeting such requirements in turn makes the removal of heat generated by the electronic and electric components from within the housing and its dissipation/transfer into the surrounding ambient air difficult. Fan forced convection cooling systems typically employed in the computer industry are unsuitable for use in the essentially hermetically sealed enclosures of 4G outdoor antenna equipment/modems.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In conventional, directional wireless transceiver units/modems, heat generated by electronic circuits and other components typically received on a printed circuit board (PCB) and associated with the antenna elements, is conducted to a (metallic) finned heat sink mounted on the side of the enclosure or housing opposite the radiating antenna elements. For that purpose, one or more heat conducting bodies are placed in direct contact with the heat generating components at the PCB as well as the heat sink. Waste heat, which if not efficiently removed adversely affects the performance of the electronics, is thus first conducted from within the housing to the heat sink from where it is in turn transferred into the ambient surroundings (air) by convection and radiation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The introduction of 5G, the 5th generation of mobile networks, requires a more dense deployment of outdoor modem/repeater/router units, hereinafter simply called mini base stations for ease of reference, which are specifically designed for the very localised wireless coverage of 5G, typically from 10 to a few hundred meters. These mini base stations provide &#x2018;in-fill stations&#x2019; for the larger macro network. These small cells and user equipment (UE) are essential for 5G networks as the mmWave frequencies 5G employs have a very short connection range.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Deployment of 4G LTE and 5G systems in their application in fixed wireless access and the desire/need to maintain reverse compatibility with 3G and 4G systems, thereby to service a larger number of frequency bandwidths, also means that dedicated outdoor 4G LTE and 5G mini base stations will typically have an increased number of electronic and antenna components received within a common housing.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The increase in electronic components to operate the various antennas for the specific frequency band widths allocated to 3G, 4G, 4G LTE and 5G, in particular where such are mounted on a common PCB as is planned, in turn means not only an increase in power consumption and thus heat generation within the sealed housing, but also increased heat source densities within a relatively small foot print enclosure/housing.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Noting that 4G LTE/5G outdoor fixed wireless mini base stations are to have an as small as possible form factor for the housing, inclusive of associated thermal load dissipating arrangements, it will be necessary to devise improved thermal load dissipation strategies to take account of the increased power consumption and heat generation of such units.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An additional issue arises from the use of the mmWave frequency bands in 5G. Signals transmitted in the mmWave frequency bandwidth &#x2018;bounce&#x2019; a lot during the day, either due to localised atmospheric changes or the temporary presence of objects in the radiation paths between mini base stations. In order to maintain optimal antenna performance in receiving/transmitting signals, re-orientation (about an axis in the radiation plane of the antenna(s) incorporated in the fixed modem/mini base station units) will need to take place more often than with traditional antennas used eg in 3G networks. It would be impractical to provide for manual re-orientation of the entire unit, therefore necessitating some mechanism that allows for automated mechanical re-orientation of mini base stations and UEs, without compromising the thermal load dissipation arrangement.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with a first aspect, the present invention provides an outdoor-mountable, telecommunications module, such as a fixed wireless modem/router module, comprising an environmentally hardened housing, telecommunications equipment encased within the housing and disposed for rotation about an axis within the housing, and a thermal load mitigation system employing (i) thermal conduction of heat from at least some heat-generating components of the telecommunications equipment which in one non-limiting embodiment comprises a PCB including mmWave antenna signal generation and processing components providing a plurality of heat sources, as well as signal radiators/receivers (antennas), to a rotatable heat sink received within the housing, (ii) primarily conductive heat transfer across a small air gap between the rotatable heatsink and a non-rotating, stationary heat sink component collocated within the housing, and (iii) convective heat dissipation into the environment from a radiator disposed outside of the housing and which is in direct heat conductive connection with the non-rotating heat sink component disposed inside of the housing.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the context of telecommunications equipment suitable for coverage of 3G, 4G, 4G LTE and 5G bandwidths, most if not all of the processors (ICs) used for 3G and 4G functionality generate a level of heat that can be allowed to radiated into the inside of the housing without a need to use dedicated heat mitigation or removal arrangements. Typically experienced heat loads are ultimately able to be &#x2018;dissipated&#x2019; through the housing walls into the surrounding environment without raising the temperature within the housing to a degree adversely affecting operation of the electronic processors.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">On the other hand, however, processors for 5G implementation generate heat amounts that require the use of dedicated heat transfer (i.e. removal) arrangements capable of removing larger heat amounts in shorter periods of time and direct the heat into the rotatable heat sink (as will be described in more detail below), then from the latter into the stationary heat sink that cooperates with the former, and from there into the housing-external convective radiator structure/arrangement.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Relevantly, the various structures and components that make up the thermal mitigation system will be designed and dimensioned such as to prevent the inside volume of the enclosure and in particular the heat generating electronic and electric components of the antenna signal generators housed on the rotatable PCB from reaching steady-state operating temperatures that negatively affect or over time degrade performance of the electric and electronic components, typically around environmental temperature levels of +55&#xb0; C. Selection of suitable components/structures of the thermal mitigation system, and optimisation of their size and shape, aims to create an as small as possible module size and footprint, whilst maintaining a steady operating temperature within the housing that reflects the specification (recommended maximum operating temperatures) of the internal electronic components of the telecommunications equipment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Embodiments and structures for the thermal mitigation system will be described below.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The thermal load mitigation system may optionally also provide means for (iv) convective heat removal from some of the lower-heat generating components into the housing through a finned heat sink thermally conductively coupled to these heat sources, and preferably also to the rotatable heat sink so that heat can also be directed into the latter.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Although air is usually viewed as an insulator when planning heat transfer management, the thermal mitigation system in accordance with the present invention makes use of an &#x2018;air gap&#x2019; in the heat transmission path inside the housing between the rotatable heatsink and the non-rotating heat sink component collocated within the housing, as there is a risk that any low-viscosity thermal interface material (fluid) disposed between the rotatable and the co-operating stationary heat sink bodies could seize at low temperature or degrade over time with the fluctuations in temperature expected during normal operation.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In order to provide for an as efficient as possible thermal conductance path between the enclosure-internal rotatable heat sink and the enclosure-internal stationary heat sink, which comprises air gaps, whilst maintaining free relative rotational capability between the two heat sink components, it is advantageous for both sink components to comprise a plurality of concentric annular fins that interleave with each other in a manner that an as small as possible but rotation-enabling air gap is maintained between facing surfaces of the fins. Thermal expansion and contraction of the fins in the temperature operating range of the modem, typically in external environmental conditions of between &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. to +60&#xb0; C., needs to be catered for. Preferably, the housing-internal, rotatable heat sink is made of the same metal alloy material as the co-operating housing-internal, stationary heat sink.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The width of the air gap between the fins of the rotatable and stationary enclosure-internal heat sink structures will be selected based on heat transfer efficiency, manufacturing machining tolerances as well as expected maximum and minimum operating temperatures within the housing, to cater for thermal expansion/contraction of the interacting components. Based on computer modelling, a possible iteration uses a gap of 1.0 to 1.5 mm between the surfaces of the concentric fins, which has been chosen for ease of manufacturing to the required tolerances. Using suitable aluminium alloys for the heat sink structures described, modelling suggests that this can achieve a 10&#xb0; C. temperature differential between the housing-internal heat sink and the housing-external heat radiator at an ambient temperature of +55&#xb0; C. in steady state operation of an outdoor 5G-enabled telecommunications module.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an advantageous embodiment, the housing-external convective radiator structure/arrangement is provided on/at a closure member for an access opening of the housing. In this manner, the same module housing may be used for PCBs carrying different types of heat generating components, and therefore different overall heat generation ratings can be catered for, whereby radiator structures optimised as regards a specific one or more of heat removal ratings can then be provided/mounted to the closure member.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A particularly advantageous module format is one consisting of a preferably cylindrical housing having either an integral but preferably separate bottom closure cap, and in which the closure member is a cap or top closure member of the main cylindrical housing part which in operation is arranged in a generally vertical orientation.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a preferred form, both the non-rotatable, housing-internal heat sink and the enclosure-external convective heat radiator are integrally formed with the closure member out of a suitable metal of high thermal conductivity, eg an aluminium alloy, thereby avoiding any interfaces in the heat conduction path between inside and outside of the enclosure (modem housing) comprising materials that conduct heat more poorly than an integral/unitary metallic body. It is possible though to manufacture the different heat transfer structures separately and assemble these together.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Advantageously, the enclosure-external convective heat radiator comprises a plurality of pin-like radiation elements in mutually spaced apart array configuration, such as concentric rows of upstanding pin elements spaced apart to maintain a predetermined small air gap with respect to each other, preferably no less than 0.5 mm, and more preferably around 1.0 to 2.5 mm. A different array configuration of the plurality of pins can of course also be selected, e.g. an orthogonal square array of interspaced pin rows.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Metallic pin elements that stand proud from and are integral with a base plate of the enclosure closure member, and spacing the plurality of pins appropriately, are selected to facilitate conductive but primarily convective heat transfer into the ambient air surrounding the housing (herein after also referred to as an enclosure).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The pins may be cylindrical, square or of other cross-sectional shape, and may not necessarily all have the same length (above the base plate), thereby creating a non-uniform temperature field across the entirety of pins which is conducive to thermally-induced air flow about the radiator.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The housing-external radiator employs a pin design because it is believed to be an effective form of heat transfer structure that does not require (additional) air flow or convection assisting structures or devices.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In accordance with other embodiments, fin-like structures instead of pin-like elements may be used in the convective radiator. The fins can have a variety of shapes and can be arranged in various configurations. The optimal combination of shapes and arrangements can be determined using software-based heat transfer optimisation models. In this context, although developed for a different purpose (heat removal from high-power LED lighting applications), finned heat radiator structures (heat sink) as proposed in the following documents could be used: &#x2018;Optimum design of a radial heat sink with a fin-height profile for high-power LED lighting applications&#x2019;, Daesok Jang, Se-Jin Yook, Kwa-Soo Lee, Applied Energy 116 (2014) p. 260-268, and &#x2018;Optimization of a chimney design for cooling efficiency of a radial heat sink in a LED downlight&#x2019;, Seung-Jae Park, Daesok Jang, Se-Jin Yook, Kwa-Soo Lee, Energy Conversion and Management 114 (2016) p. 180-187.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The fin-like structures may advantageously comprise a series of radially extending fins. In one form, the fins are all the same width and thickness and are arranged in concentric rings around the radiator. Each ring can have fins of a different height. The rings can increase in height towards the centre of the radiator to produce the appearance of a frustoconical shaped outer profile. Alternatively, the rings can decrease in height towards the centre of the radiator to form the appearance of a frustoconical shaped depression in the radiator. Heat transfer and heat dispersion from the heatsink can be optimised by changing the height of each ring or by changing the height of individual fins.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another form, the fins are all the same height and comprise fins that extend over most of the radius of the radiator interspersed between fins that extend less than the radial extent of the first mentioned fins, eg &#xbc; to &#x2153; or &#xbd; of the radius of the radiator structure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">From a practical perspective, noting the intended environment of use of the modem in outdoor conditions, the housing-external heat radiator structure will be devised to prevent water from pooling, trapping of debris, take account of solar loading, amongst others.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">An additional concept foresees the use of a chimney or funnel structure at the housing on top of the housing-external heat radiation structure. The chimney may be fitted on top of the radiator to further improve cooling efficiency. The chimney may comprise a pipe section with a flanged end, such that when the chimney is assembled onto the radiator the flanged end abuts a top surface of the fins.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Using a radiator design with a plurality of radial fins (instead of pins) has been investigated using thermal simulation tools. Use of a topping funnel structure allows for optimised convection airflow over the heat exchanger fins, i.e. the creation of an updraught of air entering radially into the zone of heat exchanger fins and discharging upwardly through the funnel. All else being equal, the presence of such funnel structure when used with a radiating heat sink having radiator fins, will in most cases improve overall cooling efficiency by a noticeable % degree as compared with modem embodiments devoid of such funnel structure. An advantage of the chimney/funnel structure is that it can serve to reduce the total amount of material required to manufacture the radiator component without compromising heat transfer capacity into the surrounding air. The chimney part can be moulded from the same plastic material as the main housing part and will also act as a solar shield and provide the heat sink structure with some protection from foreign materials.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a preferred embodiment, the thermal mitigation system uses at least one heat pipe for assisting with the conductive heat transfer away from the high heat generating IC components on the telecommunications equipment PCB. For such purpose, the heat pipe(s) is (are) directly thermally coupled to the components (but electrically isolated from these) or indirectly via a heat spreader body mounted to the PCB, and the rotatable heat sink.

The skilled person in telecommunications equipment, particularly fixed wireless equipment for use in 4G LTE and 5G, will appreciate however that there are a variety of suitable electronic components, antenna modules and driving circuitry components and arrangements that can be chosen for incorporation into a single PCB and various PCBA configurations.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Noting that the directional antenna modules <b>22</b><i>a </i>are mounted to the PCB <b>20</b> to essentially receive and radiated RF-signals from one face (or plane) of the sheet-like PCB only, and that signals transmitted and received in the mmWave frequency bandwidth &#x2018;bounce&#x2019; a lot directionally, PCB <b>20</b> is received and mounted with its principal plane perpendicular to the horizontal reference ground and for stepwise (or non-stepwise) rotation about a vertical central axis within housing <b>12</b> thereby to enable selective (re-)orientation of the directional antennas with one degree of rotational freedom.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">There are various ways of specifically implementing a suitable support arrangement of the PCB <b>20</b> within housing <b>12</b> that allows the PCB <b>20</b> to be rotated (and thus the antennas <b>22</b><i>b </i>re-oriented) and various drive arrangements to effect such rotational re-alignment can be chosen.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, the PCB support arrangement and rotational drive are illustrated merely schematically. In that embodiment, a rotary actuator or motor <b>26</b> is received within housing <b>12</b> and secured to the housing bottom <b>14</b>. The motor <b>26</b> is arranged to output torque and rotationally drive an axle of support fork <b>28</b> onto which PCB <b>20</b> is removably clamped.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In contrast, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>8</b></figref> illustrates in greater detail one practical implementation of the PCB support arrangement with rotational drive. Modem <b>100</b> there comprises a cylindrical (tubular) housing part <b>120</b>, with an open top <b>116</b>, closed in sealing fashion by upper cap member <b>170</b>. The lower open end of cylindrical housing part <b>120</b> is cylindrically flared to define a collar <b>115</b> which is adapted to receive a closing bottom cap <b>114</b>, preferably incorporating a not-illustrated sealing ring or packing. Cap <b>114</b> can (but need not) be made from a metallic material and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> may incorporate additional features to enable fastening of module <b>100</b> in an upright orientation to a support structure outdoors. Cap <b>114</b> has a tubular terminal rim portion <b>114</b><i>a </i>that provides a matching sealing surface that cooperates with and seats within collar portion <b>115</b> of housing <b>112</b>, and is secured using appropriate permanent (or non-permanent) fixing means, including adhesive bonding.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">An annular bearing flange <b>116</b> with a ring of radially-inward directed teeth <b>117</b> provides an annular gear element that is sandwiched between the upper terminal rim portion <b>114</b><i>a </i>of bottom cap <b>114</b> and a facing ledge or step which collar <b>115</b> forms with housing <b>120</b>, such that bearing flange <b>116</b> is secured against movement (rotation and axial). Additional measures can be provided to secure annular gear element/bearing flange <b>116</b> against rotation, such as glue, index features, etc. Annular gear element <b>116</b> could be made of metal but equally of a suitable polymer material, such as glass reinforced polyester or the like, having high impact resistance yet sufficient E-modulus to provide form stable teeth <b>117</b> into which comb a pinion <b>127</b> driven by the output axle of electric stepper motor <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Motor <b>126</b>, which may be a stepper motor, is fixed against movement in a suitable mounting structure <b>129</b> moulded integrally on the underside of a circular support plate <b>128</b> that has an annular skirt <b>125</b> on its bottom facing side.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Circular support plate <b>128</b> can be made from an electrically insulating metal but is preferably made from an electrically insulating, low friction polymer material. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the bottom-facing annular skirt <b>125</b> of support plate <b>128</b> locates in an annular space defined between the inner peripheral face of cylindrical housing <b>120</b> and an upper ring portion <b>118</b> of annular gear element <b>116</b> in such manner that support plate <b>128</b> remains free to rotate about the central axis defined by housing <b>120</b> with as little play as possible. That is, the geometries of the various components that interact with one another are chosen such as to prevent rotational jamming of the support plate <b>128</b> when supported at upper terminal ring bearing portion <b>118</b> of bearing flange/gear element <b>116</b> and at expected operational temperatures within module <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">It will be immediately appreciated that the chosen arrangement is such that actuation of motor <b>126</b>, which rotates with circular support plate <b>128</b>, causes its driven pinion <b>127</b> to rotationally move support plate <b>128</b> through its interaction with the stationary gear ring <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Finally, and again with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> but also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, it will be noted that a metallic block <b>140</b>, which forms part of the thermal mitigation system <b>130</b> as will be explained below, is secured to PCB <b>20</b>. That is, PCB <b>20</b> is carried at metallic block <b>140</b> which in turn is mounted to the top face of support plate <b>128</b> for rotation therewith, eg glued or otherwise shape-fittingly carried. Consequently, rotation of circular plate <b>128</b> will cause the PCB <b>20</b> to re-orient its main plane about the vertical rotation axis, as a function of the geared engagement between motor <b>126</b> and stationary gear ring <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The skilled person will appreciate that there are various ways of providing power supply not only to the drives <b>26</b>, <b>126</b> that rotate PCB <b>20</b>, but, more relevantly, to the PCBAs and all electronic components required for signal generation and transmission. Equally not shown, because these components are well known in the fixed wireless modem design and manufacturing industry, are a non-rotating PCBA for external interface ports of the modem, typically carried at the bottom <b>14</b> (or closure <b>114</b>) of housing <b>12</b>, <b>112</b>, with internal flexible power supply and controller cabling trees and management equipment.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In order to detect and know by how much the rotatable internal PCB <b>20</b> with its otherwise positionally fixed antenna modules <b>22</b><i>b </i>needs to be rotated such that the modem unit is appropriately &#x2018;tuned&#x2019; for optimal transceiver performance, the PCBAs incorporate programmed or programmable processors for measuring signal strength from different directions as received by directional antenna elements <b>22</b><i>b</i>. The sensor signals are processed by a dedicated controller which is operationally associated with the rotational actuator or motor <b>26</b>, <b>126</b> which is mechanically coupled to PCB <b>20</b>, thereby enabling selective angular re-orientation of the antenna <b>22</b><i>b </i>to point towards the direction with the best measured signal source. The PCBAs can also be fitted with suitable circuitry to monitor signal strength and re-measure if there is a significant change in signal strength or quality, for example if the original signal source has been blocked by something in the surrounding environment. This means that the moveable PCB <b>20</b> of the modem <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> is expected to remain stationary during most of its operating life with occasional periods of movement and measurement.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">This also means that the design of the thermal mitigation system (or arrangement) <b>30</b>, <b>130</b> needs to be considered when refining the design and placement of the antennas <b>22</b><i>b </i>to ensure that the metallic heat management components of system <b>30</b>, <b>130</b> do not prevent the antennas <b>22</b><i>b </i>from performing efficiently at the desired frequencies, yet allow the heat generated by the various components of the modem unit <b>10</b>, <b>110</b> such as the mmWave modem chip(s) <b>22</b><i>a</i>, to be effectively transferred to an internal heat sink and from there to an external heat radiator which dumps thermal load into the surrounding environment. That is, the antenna elements <b>22</b><i>b </i>need to be located on the PCB <b>20</b> such that the effective beam of the antenna radiation patterns should not intersect with heat sink and conduction arrangements.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Similarly, as noted above, wireless transmission modems with reverse compatibility which cater for various transmission standards leads to PCBA designs with a large number of components consuming up to 10 W each and creating hot spots on the PCB <b>20</b> which produce excess heat which needs to be conducted away from the PCBAs and heat-sensitive ICs, to enable the device to operate effectively up to a maximum (housing inside) operating temperature of +55&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Components required to drive 5G antennas have much larger transient power output levels that those used of other (e.g. 3G) antennas, and when taking account of an assumed duty cycle of TX to RX of 15%, this would mean a typical power output of a mmWave modem chip of approx. 18 W. Conventional thermal mitigation strategies and arrangements will not do the &#x2018;cooling job&#x2019; appropriately.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Thermal mitigation system <b>30</b>, <b>130</b> employs different components and heat transfer mechanisms to remove heat generated by various electric and electronic components of a PCB antenna arrangement, in particular mmWave antenna signal generation equipment received on the PCB, which is mounted within the water and dust tight housing <b>12</b>, <b>112</b> to allow rotational re-orientation of the directional antenna components, to an internal heat sink within the sealed housing (enclosure), and transfer of heat from the internal heatsink to an external, non-rotating heat transfer radiator.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the following will be described the various components/constituents of a prototype thermal mitigation system <b>30</b> of the invention's embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, devised for a mmWave modem unit of the type described above, in which all components of the PCBAs have a power consumption of around 39 W which, but for the power radiated by the antenna elements (including <b>22</b><i>b</i>), is essentially converted into a thermal load which needs to be dissipated away from the temperature-sensitive electronic components <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>c</i>, <b>22</b><i>d </i>of the PCBAs within the housing <b>12</b> into its ambient surroundings.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Subsequently, a furthermore elaborate embodiment of a modem <b>100</b> with modified thermal load mitigation system <b>130</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>8</b></figref>, noting that the principles employed in both systems <b>30</b>, <b>130</b> are the same but for one notable change.

Size, mass and design of finned heat sink <b>40</b> allows it to perform a heat load &#x2018;spreading&#x2019; function in that it takes-up heat from heat-generating electronic components mounted to the PCB <b>20</b> (as outlined above) and &#x2018;diffuse&#x2019; it for better cooling efficiency (i.e. heat removal from localised warm spots on PCB <b>20</b>).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The rear heat spreader <b>40</b> with parallel fins convectively transfers some of the heat received into the sealed housing <b>12</b> cavity (via its fins <b>42</b>) and minimises hot spots at the locations of individual components on the PCBAs. Simulations have showed that the rear heat spreader <b>40</b> needs to have a much smaller width than the internal diameter of hosing <b>12</b> to allow adequate convective airflow within housing <b>12</b> to transfer some of the thermal load generated.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The rear heat spreader <b>40</b> is furthermore also thermally coupled through a central portion of its base plate portion <b>46</b> with, and appropriately releasably secured to, a first, generally upright orientated, flat sectioned heat pipe <b>50</b> whose upper terminal end <b>51</b> is bent at 90&#xb0; to extend about parallel with the top end wall portion <b>44</b> of heat spreader <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">A second, generally horizontally orientated, flat-sectioned heat pipe <b>52</b> having a greater width than heat pipe <b>40</b> is thermally coupled with and appropriately releasably secured to the outside of common top wall portion <b>44</b> of rear heat spreader <b>40</b>, to remove heat from spreader <b>40</b> through heat conduction into horizontal heat pipe <b>52</b></p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The second, horizontally extending heat pipe <b>52</b> has a width that is greater than the first heat pipe <b>50</b> and about the same as the width of finned rear heat spreader <b>40</b>. It is releasably secured to the bent portion <b>51</b> of first heat pipe <b>50</b> on a bottom-oriented face thereof, and on its top oriented face to the underside of the essentially squat-cylindrically shaped upper heat spreader <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The upright heat pipe <b>50</b> is thermally coupled and releasably secured to the rear side/face of PCB <b>20</b> to lie above the more energy-consuming, and therefore hotter, heat generating electronic components of the PCBA (in particular the mmWave modem chip <b>22</b><i>a</i>). Relevantly, whilst in thermal contact with and secured to the PCB <b>20</b>, vertical heat pipe <b>50</b> (but also horizontal heat pipe <b>52</b>) is electrically isolated from the PCB and the PCBAs.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The heat pipes <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are custom-developed alcohol-filled, formed copper heat pipes to conduct heat away from the hot spots on the PCBAs. Alcohol-filled heat pipes are specified to meet the minimum operating temperature requirement of &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. without freezing.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">It has been found that such heat pipes <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are most effective when drawing heat upward from a heat source. Consequently, from a heat transfer management perspective, the stationary heat sink and radiator arrangement <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> is advantageously placed at the top of the modem housing <b>12</b>, and preferentially made integrally with closure cap <b>70</b>, whilst side-wise located external radiator structures like known in the prior art, are not believed to be at all viable or at least less viable for removing the heat which in particular is generated by mmWave signal generators received within small format modem housings, as is the case here.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">As has been noted, cylindrically-squat shaped upper heat spreader <b>60</b> is designed to have freedom of rotation relative to and within housing <b>12</b> and the co-operating stationary inner heat sink/transfer structure <b>74</b> of the combined heat sink and radiator arrangement provided at the top of housing <b>12</b>. Its upward facing side is cast with concentric annular fins <b>62</b> that mesh with the set of annular fins <b>75</b> on the downward-facing side of the heat sink <b>74</b>. This allows for a high surface area, which increases heat transfer, and enables rotation around the central axis with a narrow air gap between the moving and stationary parts.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Relevantly, as noted, upper heat spreader <b>60</b> is secured against rotation to the PCB <b>20</b>. This can be effected using mounting clamps or other mechanical (or adhesive) fasteners, not shown in the figures.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Although air is usually viewed as an insulator when planning heat management, this design makes use of an air gap because there is a risk that any low-viscosity thermal interface material (fluid) could seize at low temperature or degrade over time with the fluctuations in temperature expected during normal operation. The width of the air gap can be selected based on the required heat transfer efficiency and manufacturing machining tolerances. A possible iteration uses a 1.5 mm gap between the surfaces of the concentric fins, which has been chosen for ease of manufacturing to the required tolerances. This leads to a 10 degree difference in temperature between the upper heat spreader and external heat sink at an ambient temperature of +55 degrees Celsius. If a 0.5 mm gap were used the resulting temperature difference would be 5 degrees.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The heat spreaders and heat sinks <b>40</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>72</b>/<b>74</b> can be made from die-cast aluminium. The external surfaces of the heat sinks could be coated with a corrosion-resistant finish such as Dacromet, which does not impact the thermal properties of the underlying material.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Turning then to the modem embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>8</b></figref>, it will be seen that there are many commonalities in the thermal mitigation system <b>130</b> when compared to that of the first embodiment, and therefore the following description will primarily focus on constructional and/or lay-out differences.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The stationary upper heat sink and radiator arrangement <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> is in this embodiment also manufactured as a single integrally formed component and particularly advantageously unitary with top closure element or cap <b>170</b> which is used to sealingly close the open top <b>116</b> of housing <b>112</b>. The cap <b>170</b> here comprises a housing-facing annular skirt <b>171</b> that is internally threaded for cooperating with an externally threaded terminal annular top rim <b>113</b> of housing <b>112</b> to seal-off module <b>100</b>. However, instead of comprising a plurality of heat radiating pins <b>80</b>, the housing-external radiator structure <b>172</b> consists of a plurality of radially extending upright fins <b>180</b> that converge towards the longitudinal axis of housing <b>112</b>. Interleaving with fins <b>180</b> that have a radial extension such as to terminate closer to a central cylindrical void defined by the radially inner ends of the fins <b>180</b>, are a plurality of radially shorter fins to maximise fin density when packed into a radially converging convective heat radiating array or structure.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">As may be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the upper stationary heat sink structure <b>174</b> unitary with upper closure cap <b>170</b> is here also comprised of concentric annular fins <b>172</b> that face into the inside of housing <b>112</b>, are integral with central body part <b>176</b> of cap <b>170</b> and interleave with the plurality of concentric annular fins <b>162</b> of the rotatable upper heat spreader body <b>160</b>. For additional details, refer to the description of these heat transfer components provided with reference to the first module embodiment.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">It will be further seen that rather than having a finned heat spreader block <b>40</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, in the presently described embodiment the metallic heat spreader block <b>140</b> has no fins and instead has two parallel channels running along the height of block <b>140</b> and in which are received circular cross-section heat pipes <b>150</b> that are otherwise, from a heat transport perspective, similar in function to the main heat pipe <b>50</b> described previously. Suitable thermal putty ensures air-gap free fitting of heat pipes <b>150</b> in the receiving channels of heat spreader block <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">It will also be noted that a separate metallic circular top plate <b>144</b> is soldered or otherwise secured for gap-free thermal conduction to the top terminal face of block <b>140</b>, rather than being made integral with the latter, as was the case with the finned heat spreader block <b>40</b>. Top plate <b>144</b> is provided with semi-circular channels which accommodate the horizontally bent upper terminal ends <b>151</b> of heat pipes <b>150</b> in similar fashion as previously described. That is, in comparing the heat transfer systems <b>30</b> and <b>130</b>, with the exception of providing for convective heat transfer via fins into the inside of housing <b>112</b>, heat spreader block <b>140</b> together with top plate <b>144</b> perform the same heat conduction functionality towards the rotatable upper heat spreader <b>160</b> as block <b>40</b> but with less convective heat radiation surface area present within the housing <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The upper second heat transfer pipe <b>52</b> of the module embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref> is omitted altogether, and instead a thermal pad <b>152</b> is fixed in abutting contact with the upper face of top plate <b>144</b> and the bottom-facing surface of upper heat spreader <b>160</b>. The three components could be glued to each other but are preferably fastened to each other in a manner that allows these components to be taken apart, but ensures a rigid connection of upper heat spreader <b>160</b>, top plate <b>144</b> and heat spreader block <b>140</b>. As was mentioned previously, given that heat spreader block <b>140</b> is secured for rotation with circular support plate <b>128</b> at the bottom of housing <b>112</b>, this connection methodology enables upper heat spreader to rotate with block <b>140</b> and thus with PCB <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Thermal pad <b>152</b> is devised as a surge barrier, ie a member to electrically isolate the rotatable heat transfer components of system <b>130</b> from the upper, fixed heat sink body <b>174</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Finally, and best seen by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, rather than providing for essentially full contact between the PCB-facing side of heat spreader block <b>140</b> with all heat generating components of the telecommunications system carried on/at PCB <b>20</b>, discrete metallic pads <b>146</b> are shaped and located to come into heat conductive contact with the particularly &#x2018;hot running&#x2019; IC and chips carried at the PCB <b>20</b>, thereby to focus heat removal through conduction from these components into the central spreader block <b>140</b>. It is believed that these pads <b>146</b> in conjunction with block <b>140</b> improve overall heat removal efficiency towards the external convective heat radiating structure <b>172</b> at the top of the module <b>100</b>, through the various intermediary components <b>150</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>160</b> and <b>174</b> of the heat transfer system <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A to <b>9</b>C</figref> show different examples of fin arrangements that can be incorporated into the heat transfer/radiation structure <b>172</b> as previously described. Similar to the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>8</b></figref>, but in a lesser density of packing, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, the fins are all the same thickness and height. The fins comprise a set of long fins, that extend for a substantial part of the radius of the heat transfer/radiation structure, interspersed between smaller fins that extend about &#xbc; to &#x2153; radius of the heat transfer/radiation structure.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>B and <b>9</b>C</figref>, the fins are all the same thickness and width and are arranged in concentric rings around the heat transfer/radiation structure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, the rings increase in height towards the centre of the heat transfer/radiation structure to form the appearance of a frustoconical shaped outer profile. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref> the rings decrease in height towards the centre of the heat transfer/radiation structure to form the appearance of a frustoconical shaped depression in the structure.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">By changing the height of each ring, or by changing the height of individual fins, the heat transfer and convective heat dispersion into the surrounding air from the heat transfer/radiation structure can be optimised. Computer simulations have been conducted on each of the arrangements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A to <b>9</b>C</figref> and heat transfer plots of the results of the simulations are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A to <b>10</b>C</figref>, respectively. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A to <b>10</b>C</figref> the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> is the most effective at overall heat transfer. However, the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref> is most effective at dispersing the heat. For additional details see the two learned articles mentioned earlier.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows schematically a radiation fins arrangement as per <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> with a chimney <b>184</b> fitted on top of the heat transfer/radiation structure <b>172</b> in an attempt to further improve heat removal (i.e. cooling) efficiency. The chimney comprises a pipe section <b>186</b> with a flanged annular pate <b>188</b>, such that when the chimney <b>184</b> is assembled onto the heat transfer/radiation structure <b>172</b> the flanged end <b>188</b> abuts a top surface of the fins. It is believed that the fin arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> is most suited to being equipped with a chimney <b>184</b> because the fins, being all of the same height, provide a flush surface for the flange <b>88</b> to be seated on, and promotes a radially inwards and upwards directed draught of air that helps cooling the fins (i.e. convectively removing heat from module <b>100</b>). It is believed that the by incorporating a chimney <b>184</b> onto a heat transfer/radiation structure <b>172</b> the cooling efficiency can be improved by around 20%, and this might also make it possible for the overall manufactured mass of the heat transfer/radiation structure to be reduced by up to 60% while maintaining the cooling efficiency of the structure.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The skilled person will appreciate that variations of the two embodiments described and illustrated are possible without departing from the inventive gist.
