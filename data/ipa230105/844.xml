Prior to 2002, coronaviruses were not considered to be significant human pathogens. Other human coronaviruses such as HCoV-229E and HCoV-0C43 resulted in only mild respiratory infections in healthy adults. In 2002, however, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in Guangdong Province, China. While SARS-CoV predominantly impacted Southeast Asia, with significant outbreaks throughout China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Vietnam, the virus was carried outside the region.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was detected in a patient with severe respiratory disease in Saudi Arabia. The clinical features of MERS-CoV infection in humans range from asymptomatic to very severe pneumonia with the potential development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and multiorgan failure resulting in death. Since the first case of MERS-CoV infection was reported and the virus was isolated, significant progress has been made toward understanding the epidemiology, ecology, and biology of the virus. Several assays for the detection of acute infection with MERS-CoV by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR have been developed and are in widespread use.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In 2019, a novel coronavirus (nCoV) emerged in the world and is now known to cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS coronavirus-2 or SARS-CoV-2), a virus phylogenetically closely related to SARS virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the 2019-2020 coronavirus outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). For most patients, COVID-19 begins and ends in their lungs, because coronaviruses primarily cause respiratory diseases.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates generally to the fields of virology, infectious disease and medicine.

The timing of the coadministration is best determined by the medical specialist treating the patient. It is sometimes desired that the agents be administered at the same time. Alternatively, the drugs selected for combination therapy may be administered at different times to the patient. Of course, when more than one viral or other infection or other condition is present, the present compounds may be combined with other agents to treat that other infection or condition as required.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0043">As related to the present invention, the term &#x201c;treatment&#x201d;, &#x201c;treating&#x201d;, and the like, is defined as prior to prophylactic administration of the compounds in the methods described herein, prior to viral infection, or inhibiting viral activity after infection has occurred. In an embodiment, the term &#x201c;treating&#x201d; is meant to administer one or more compounds of the present invention to measurably inhibit the replication of a virus in vitro or in vivo, to measurably decrease the load of a virus in a cell in vitro or in vivo, or to reduce at least one symptom associated with having a CoV-mediated disease in a patient. Desirably, the inhibition in replication or the decrease in viral load is at least 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, 99%, as determined using a suitable assay. Assays that monitor replication of viruses include, but are not limited to, cytopathic viral assays, reporter-virus and reporter-cell assays, viral replicon assays, and gene-targeted viral assays. Viral load testing can be carried out using nucleic acid amplification based tests (NATs or NAATs) and non-nucleic acid-based tests on blood plasma samples to determine the quantity of virus in a given volume including viral RNA levels in plasma and tissue and total viral DNA. Alternatively, in certain embodiments, treatment is observed by a trained physician as an appreciable or substantial relief of symptoms in a patient with a CoV-mediated disease. Typically, a decrease in viral replication is accomplished by reducing the rate of RNA polymerization, RNA translation, protein processing or modification, or by reducing the activity of a molecule involved in any step of viral replication (e.g., proteins or coded by the genome of the virus or host important for viral replication). In an embodiment, the term &#x201c;treat&#x201d; refers to the ability of a compound or compounds of the present invention to inhibit or suppress replication of a virus, such as an RNA virus. In an embodiment, the term &#x201c;treat&#x201d; refers to the ability of a compound or compounds of the present invention to inhibit the cytopathic effect during a RNA virus infection.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0044">In some embodiments, an &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; or &#x201c;immune-stimulatory amount&#x201d; of a compound of the invention is an amount which, when administered to a subject, is sufficient to engender a detectable immune response. In other embodiments, a &#x201c;protective effective amount&#x201d; of an immunogenic composition is an amount which, when administered to a subject, is sufficient to confer protective immunity upon the subject. In other embodiments, a &#x201c;therapeutic effect amount&#x201d; of a compound is an amount which, when administered to a subject, is sufficient to treat a viral infection, such as increase viral clearance.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0045">As used herein, the term &#x201c;fraction of inspired oxygen&#x201d; or &#x201c;FiO2&#x201d; refers to an estimation of the oxygen content a person inhales, delivered in supplemental flow necessary to meet oxygenation goals, ideally targeting a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of between 90 and 96 percent. Typically &#x3c;10 L/min will yield a FiO2 of up to 60%.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0046">The agents and methods of the present invention may be utilized to treat a subject in need thereof.

Opaganib is a non-hygroscopic, white to off-white solid which is practically insoluble in water and ethyl acetate. In an embodiment, a medicine is prepared by filling opaganib in hard gelatin size 1 capsules that further comprise at least one pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier material. In an embodiment, the pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier material are selected from the following excipients: microcrystalline cellulose; colloidal silicon dioxide; magnesium stearate vegetal; titanium dioxide. In an embodiment, opaganib capsules contain 250 mg ABC294640 as the hydrochloride salt or 228.16 mg of ABC294640 free base. In an embodiment, opaganib capsules contain 375 mg ABC294640 as the hydrochloride salt or 342.24 mg of ABC294640 free base.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0059">In an embodiment, opaganib 250 mg capsules contain the agent ABC294640 as the hydrochloride salt along with excipients that are encapsulated in gelatin, white opaque body and cap, coni-snap capsules, size 1. In an embodiment, opaganib 375 mg capsules contain the agent ABC294640 as the hydrochloride salt along with excipients that are encapsulated in gelatin, white opaque body and cap, coni-snap capsules, size 1.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0060">Opaganib for treating coronavirus infection is generally administered in an amount ranging from about 250 mg to about 1500 mg per day. In an embodiment, opaganib 250 mg is administered as two capsules, twice per day, for a total daily dose of 1000 mg. In an embodiment, opaganib 250 mg is administered as two capsules, 500 mg, Q12 hours. In an embodiment, a patient with a confirmed coronavirus infection is provided with instructions to take a single 500 mg dose of opaganib (as two 250 mg capsules) every 12 hours (so 1000 mg opaganib per day), for a total of up to 2 consecutive weeks, or up to consecutive 14 days.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0061">The inventors have discovered the new use of opaganib after a lot of research. Opaganib has demonstrated antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic activity&#x2014;acting on both the cause and the effects of COVID-19. Opaganib targets sphingosine kinase-2, a human cell component involved in viral replication and not the virus itself. The mounting evidence of new SARS-CoV-2 mutations emerging globally underscores the importance of this unique mechanism, which potentially minimizes the risk of viral resistance to therapy.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0062">Provided herein are packaged pharmaceutical products, also known as pharmaceutical kits, that includes a container, a plurality of opaganib unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration in the container, and a legend (e.g., a label or an insert) associated with the container and indicating administration of opaganib for treating coronavirus infection. In an embodiment, the legend includes instructions for carrying out the methods described above and/or how to use the kit. Instructions included in the kit can be affixed as a label to packaging material or can be included as a package insert. While instructions are typically written or printed materials, they are not limited to such. Any medium capable of storing instructions and communicating them to an end user is contemplated by this disclosure. Such media include, but are not limited to, electronic storage media (e.g., magnetic discs, tapes, cartridges), optical media (e.g., CD ROM), and the like. As used herein, the term &#x201c;instructions&#x201d; can include the address of an internet site which provides instructions.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Combination and Alternation Therapy</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0063">The compounds described herein can be administered on top of the current standard of care for COVID patients, or in combination or alternation with any other compound or therapy that the healthcare provider deems beneficial for the patient. The combination and/or alternation therapy can be therapeutic, adjunctive, or palliative. When the methods include administering to a patient more than one active agent, the agents may be administered within 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 days; within 24, 12, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 hours, within 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5 or 1 minutes; or substantially simultaneously. The methods of the invention may include administering one or more agents to the patient by oral, systemic, parenteral, topical, intravenous, inhalational, or intramuscular administration.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0064">It has been observed that COVID patients can pass through various stages of disease, and that the standard of care can differ based on what stage of illness the patient presents with or advances to. COVID is noteworthy for the development of &#x201c;cross-talk&#x201d; between the immune system and the coagulation system. As the disease progresses, the patient can mount an overreaction by the immune system, which can lead to a number of serious implications, including a cytokine storm. Via the cross-talk between the immune system and the coagulation system, the patient can begin clotting in various areas of the body, including the respiratory system, brain, heart and other organs. Multiple clots throughout the body have been observed in COVID patients, requiring anticoagulant therapy. It is considered that these clots may cause long term, or even permanent damage if not treated and disease alleviated.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0065">More specifically, COVID-19 has been described as progressing through three general stages of illness: stage 1 (early infection), stage 2 (pulmonary phase), and stage 3 (hyperinflammation phase/cytokine storm).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0066">Stage 1 is characterized by non-specific, and often mild, symptoms. Viral replication is occurring, and it is appropriate to begin immediate treatment with the compounds described herein and perhaps in combination or alternation with another anti-viral therapy. Interferon-&#x3b2; may also be administered to augment the innate immune response to the virus. In one embodiment, therefore, a compound of the present invention is used in an effective amount in combination or alternation with interferon-&#x3b2; and or an additional anti-viral drug. Zinc supplements and or Vitamin C is also sometimes administered at this stage or as the illness progresses.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0067">Stage 2 of COVID-19 is the pulmonary phase where patients may experience acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. In fact, the primary organ failure of COVID-19 is hypoxemic respiratory failure. It has been shown that moderate immunosuppression via a steroid, for example, dexamethasone, can be beneficial to patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and/or patients on mechanical ventilation. In one embodiment, a compound the present invention is used in an effective amount in combination with a corticosteroid which may be a glucocorticoid. Non-limiting examples are budesonide (Entocort EC), bethamethasone, (Celestone), prednisone (Prednisone Intensol), prednisolone (Orapred, Prelone), triamcinolone (Aristospan Intra-Articular, Aristospan Intralesional, Kenalog), methylprednisolone (Medrol, Depo-Medrol, Solu-Medrol), hydrocortisone, or dexamethasone (Dexamethasone Intensol, DexPak 10 Day, DexPak 13 Day, DexPak 6 Day).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0068">The NS5B inhibitor Remdesivir has provided mixed results when given to COVID19 patients. It can only be administered in a hospital setting, and only by intravenous injection, typically three times a day, which makes it inappropriate for mild to moderate COVID19 patients. In one embodiment, a compound of the present invention is administered in combination or in alternation with Remdesivir to amplify the overall antiviral effect.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0069">Stage 3, the final stage of the disease, is characterized by progressive disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a condition in which small blood clots develop throughout the bloodstream. This stage also can include multi-organ failure (e.g. vasodilatory shock, myocarditis). It has also been observed that many patients respond to this severe stage of COVID-19 infection with a &#x201c;cytokine storm.&#x201d; There does appear to be a bi-directional, synergistic relationship between DIC and cytokine storm. To combat DIC, patients are often administered an anti-coagulant agent, which may, for example, be an indirect thrombin inhibitor or a direct oral anticoagulant (&#x201c;DOAC&#x201d;). Non-limiting examples are low-molecular weight heparin, warfarin, bivalirudin (Angiomax), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), dabigatran (Pradaxa), apixaban (Eliquis), or edoxaban (Lixiana). In one embodiment, a compound of the present invention is administered in combination or in alternation with anti-coagulant therapy. In some severe cases of clotting in COVID patients, TPA can be administered (tissue plasminogen activator).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0070">It has been observed that high levels of the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) are a precursor to respiratory failure and death in COVID-19 patients. To treat this surge of an immune response, which may constitute a cytokine storm, patients can be administered an IL-6-targeting monoclonal antibody, pharmaceutical inhibitor or protein degrader such as a bispecific compound that binds to IL-6 and also to a protein that mediates degradation.

During transportation the tissues were stabilized on a sheet of agarose, which was removed upon receipt. One insert was estimated to consist of approximately 1.2&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells. Kits of cell inserts (EpiAirway&#x2122; AIR-100) originated from a single donor, #9831, a 23-year old, healthy, non-smoking, Caucasian male. The cells have unique properties in forming layers, the apical side of which is exposed only to air and that creates a mucin layer. Upon arrival, the cell transwell inserts were immediately transferred to individual wells of a 6-well plate according to manufacturer's instructions, and 1 mL of MatTek's proprietary culture medium (AIR-100-MM) was added to the basolateral side, whereas the apical side was exposed to a humidified 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>environment.

Patients entered a screening period of up to 1 week. Eligible patients entered the treatment period for up to 2 weeks. All participants were followed for 2 weeks after their last dose of study drug, at the end of the 2 week treatment period, or once they had 2 consecutive daily negative viral swabs for the COVID-19 virus or at after premature drug discontinuation prior to Day 14. The maximum duration of study participation was 35 days (7 weeks). Study participants received opaganib, 2&#xd7;250 mg capsules (500 mg) Q12 hours, administered daily for up to a total of 14 days (2 weeks) or until 2 consecutive daily nasopharyngeal viral swabs were negative for COVID-19, whichever came first. Opaganib was administered with food (after a light to moderate meal) and followed by 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of water. If the patient was only able to take opaganib through a naso-gastric tube, the contents of the capsule were suspended in 20 cc normal saline solution and pushed through the naso-gastric tube and flushed adequately with sterile water. If the patient was being tube-fed, opaganib was administered shortly after (approximately 15-30 minutes) a tube feeding.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="2">Key Inclusion Criteria:</heading><p id="p-0136" num="0000"><ul id="ul0016" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0016-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0017" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0017-0001" num="0137">1.

In this small cohort of severe COVID-19 patients, opaganib was safe and well tolerated with improvement in both clinical and laboratory parameters in all treated patients.

The primary efficacy endpoint calculated for each patient the area under the curve of the supplemental oxygen requirement through day 14, using the trapezoidal rule after subtracting the baseline oxygen requirement at each day. Days where no supplementary oxygen was needed, were recorded as 0. If several values of oxygen requirement (L/min) are recorded in a certain day, for the primary analysis the highest of these values were taken. In the primary analysis, for patients who die before Day 14, or require intubation and mechanical ventilation, missing daily values were assigned the maximal supplemental oxygen flow requirement of 8 L/min. For patients discharged from hospital on supplemental oxygen prior to Day 14, if no values were collected by the site after discharge, the oxygen requirement (L/min) on the day of discharge were to be assigned thereafter for each day to Day 14.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0261">The primary analysis was based on the modified Intent to treat population (mITT), which consist of all patients that were randomized and treated with at least one dose of study drug (the population included a total of 40 subjects, 22 in opaganib and 18 in placebo group), Descriptive statistics of the baseline-adjusted AUC are presented by group along with 95% confidence interval for each group and for the difference in means between the groups. Supplemental oxygen requirement up to Day 14 was collected even if a patient discontinued treatment prior to Day 14 but continued in the study to Day 14. Further, it was assumed that loss to follow up such that vital status up to Day 14 were missing is unlikely. Therefore, the primary analysis assumed that in case that all supplemental oxygen values are missing after treatment discontinuation, the last value is carried forward&#x2014;until Day 14, or death, if occurred before. A sensitivity analysis to the above missing data handling approach was performed using an AUC summary statistics approach, in which groups AUC is calculated from the estimated parameters of a Repeated-Measures model.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0262">Within the mITT cohort, two subjects withdrew their consent due to grade 1 gastrointestinal AEs. In addition, one subject did not require any supplemental oxygen at baseline prior to initiating treatment and was removed from several analyses as mandated in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Thus, the post-hoc activity analysis population (&#x201c;mITT sensitivity&#x201d;) excluded these three patients from the analysis and included 37 subjects, 19 in opaganib and 18 in placebo.
