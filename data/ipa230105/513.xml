They are introduced into the artery or vein and advanced, preferably with X-ray monitoring, up to the narrowed or blocked area that is to be treated. A fragmentation tool drivable in a rotary manner by means of a rotary drive is arranged at the distal (front) end of the catheter.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the case of these catheters, a distinction should be made as a rule on the basis of two different fields of use:</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A) Atherectomy: This is the removal of, as a rule, hard deposits that have adhered to the vessel walls over many years.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">B) Thrombectomy: This is the removal of blood clots that accumulate at bottlenecks and lead to blockage of the blood vessels (emboli).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A rotational catheter disclosed, for example, in EP 0 267 539 B1 and intended for atherectomy has, as a cutting tool, a substantially ellipsoidal cutter whose surface is provided with abrasive material and that is driven via a flexible drive shaft by a rotary drive arranged at the proximal end of the catheter at a speed of up to 160,000 rpm. The cutter is connected to the flexible drive shaft. The drive shaft runs in a tubular sheath serving as a catheter tube. A guide wire, which is introduced into a blood vessel before the introduction of the catheter, is advanced to the area to be treated or slightly beyond, and serves as a guide for the cutter and the drive shaft, extends through the drive shaft.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the case of these known rotational catheters, the risk that the vessel wall will be injured and in certain circumstances even perforated, particularly in pronounced curves of the blood vessel, cannot be ruled out.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 5,226,909 A discloses another atherectomy catheter that has, on its working head, a sleeve-like or helical cutting element drivable by a rotary drive and/or displaceable in the axial direction. The opening of the working head is pressed against the deposits adhering to the vessel wall by means of a lateral inflatable balloon. These deposits are then comminuted by rotation or axial advance of the cutting element and are collected in a chamber.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Disadvantageously of this known solution is that the chamber must then be emptied from time to time by withdrawing the catheter. Continuous removal of comminuted deposited material is not envisaged.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 5,873,882 A describes a rotational catheter for atherectomy, whose working head includes a stationary stator, connected to a tube, and a rotor. The rotor is rotatable relative to the stator by means of a high-speed transport/drive screw. Both the stator and the rotor have, at their circumference, windows that can be caused to coincide. As a result of shearing between a cutting edge on the rotor and an opposite cutting edge on the openings of the stator, comminution of the parts projecting into or sucked into the openings is effected. The rotor may surround the stator on the outside (&#x201c;outer rotor&#x201d;) or may be arranged in the interior of the stator (&#x201c;inner rotor&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Catheters having inner and outer rotors with cutting edges that operate around the catheter axis may stir up blood and occlusion material, so that the blood flow from proximal to distal may wash away particles that may again produce blockages and blood flow problems in other areas of the blood circulation, particularly in small blood vessels.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">US 2006/0206133 A1 shows a removal device for removal of tumor tissue from a patient's body. The removal device comprises an elongated member having a proximal end and a distal end, a tissue removal member extending from the proximal end of the elongated member inside of the elongated member in direction of the distal end of the elongated member. The tissue removal member has a distal end spaced from the distal end of the elongated member, thereby defining a distal region of removal device extending from distal end of the tissue removal member in direction to the distal end of the elongated member which is free of rotational elements inside. The tissue removal member is provided with helically extending transport surfaces and is rotatable by a drive means. Suction openings for aspiration are provided in the distal region of the removal device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Disadvantageously of this known solution is that the stiff elongated member and the stiff removal member cannot be used as catheter in artery or vein due their stiffness.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Therefore, the object of the present invention is to overcome at least some of the disadvantages of the before described solution and to provide a catheter, in particular for atherectomy, that operates in an atraumatic manner and can aspirate and fragment thrombi and emboli in the blood vessel and transport them through the catheter tube continuously out of the vessel, whereby the risk of injury to walls of blood vessels is minimized. The advantages of known systems, in particular those of the system according to U.S. Pat. No. 5,873,882 A are however to be retained.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">This object is solved by the features of the independent claim. Advantageous developments are set out in the figures, in the description and in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the invention a catheter for aspiration, fragmentation and removal of removable material, in particular thrombi and emboli, from hollow bodies, in particular blood vessels, comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0017">a flexible tube, the flexible tube having a proximal end and a distal end,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0018">a flexible helical transport screw, the flexible helical transport screw extending from the proximal end of the flexible tube inside of the flexible tube in direction of the distal end of the flexible tube and the flexible helical transport screw having a distal end, wherein said flexible helical transport screw is provided with helically extending transport surfaces and is rotatable by a drive means,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0019">a stopper element for providing an abutment for the distal end of the flexible helical transport screw, wherein the stopper element is provided spaced apart from the distal end of the catheter, thereby defining a distal region of the catheter extending from the stopper element in direction to the distal end of the catheter, which is free of rotational elements inside,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0020">at least one suction opening for aspiration of said removable material into the inside of the flexible tube, wherein the at least one suction opening is provided in the distal region of the catheter.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">By such a catheter no shearing, cutting or rotating elements are exposed to the vessel wall during any treatment stages. The stopper element prevents the flexible helical transport screw from entering into the at least one suction opening during the use and, thereby preventing the flexible helical transport screw from being exposed to the vessel wall. Especially, during introduction of the catheter and/or during the use inside the vessels or vein the distal end of the flexible helical transport screw cannot protrude from the flexible tube. The flexible helical transport screw is a flexible element and can also be stretched longitudinally. Axial force and stretching can occur as an example as a result of a blockage or kinking in the flexible tube. This may result in the extension of the flexible helical transport screw (screwing out) in direction of the distal end of the flexible tube. Also in this case, the stopper prevents the flexible helical transport screw from entering into the at least one suction opening during the use.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">The stopper element also prevents the vessel wall from getting in contact with the flexible helical transport screw. The rotation of the flexible helical transport screw generates a negative pressure and provides a continuous aspiration and transportation of material outside the patient body.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">The catheter comprises at least one or more suction openings for aspiration. The number and the size of the of suction openings can be related to the safety and performance of the catheter.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">The flexible helical transport screw may have an inner support element such as a wire or tube. The inner support element may be attached to the flexible helical transport screw.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">The stopper element may be connected directly or by another means such as a connecting tube to the flexible tube. The connecting tube can be flexible for the intended use. The connecting tube is preferably designed or made from a material to be kink-resistant or is supported internally in a way that will not kink during the use.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">Preferably the stopper element having a distal end and a proximal end and the stopper element having a sleeve-like shape with a first inner diameter and a front opening having at least one circumferential surface and at least partly at least one abutment surface for abutment for the distal end of the flexible helical transport screw. Thereby, between distal end of the flexible helical transport screw and the at least one abutment surface of the stopper element a shearing effect is created in order to cut the material ready for transport. By this shearing effect the size of the particles is further reduced and the transport of the fragmented material is facilitated. The removable material will be crushed in particles when entering the at least one suction opening. However, by this shearing effect the size of the particles is further reduced and the transport is facilitated.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">As a further preferred alternative, the stopper element having a distal end and a proximal end and the stopper element having a sleeve-like shape with a first inner diameter and a front opening having at least a second inner diameter and at least one circumferential surface, whereby the at least second inner diameter is smaller than the first inner diameter. The removed material will enter the catheter through the front opening whereby&#x2014;as per venturi effects&#x2014;causes an additional strain to the aspirated material and thus contributes to fragmenting the aspirated material which is then removed by the flexible helical transport screw outside the body. In other words, axial change of the lumen area, which originates from the difference between the lumen area of the stopper in comparison to the lumen area of the distal region of the catheter and/or to the lumen area of the flexible tube. This axial change creates a pressure gradient which, from fluid dynamics point of view, results in an additional strain on the occluding material and helps for the cutting process.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028">Preferably the at least one circumferential surface of the front opening of the stopper element is conically shaped, in particular narrowing in the direction of the proximal end of the stopper element, whereby the venturi effects are enhanced.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0029">Preferred the stopper element comprising an additional abutment element for providing an abutment for the distal end of the flexible helical transport screw, whereby the shearing effect at the distal end of the flexible helical transport screw may be improved. Additionally or alternatively, by the additional abutment element a friction may be reduced at the distal end of the flexible helical transport screw which result in lower temperature levels at this region and a longer usability of the catheter. Furthermore, the rotation speed for rotating of the flexible helical transport screw may be increased what secures a faster transportation of the fragmented material and therefore reduces the duration of the procedure.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0030">In particular the additional abutment element is provided inside of the stopper element, whereby the aforementioned effects can be realized in an easy constructive way.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0031">Preferred the stopper element comprises at least partly from radiopaque material, whereby the user can easily use the catheter during surgical procedure. The stopper element can be made from different materials or a combination of different materials. Also, the material might change along the stopper element to make it atraumatic. Some examples of the materials for the stopper element are metals, such as stainless steel, or polymers, for example as a non-exhaustive list: Polyamide, Pebax&#xae; and Polyetheretherketon (PEEK). Should for any specific reason the selected material not be radiopaque, it will be either mixed with a radiopaque material or will feature a radiopaque marker.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0032">Preferably a catheter end piece is provided defining at least partly the distal region of the catheter, wherein the catheter end piece comprising the at least one suction opening and wherein catheter end piece is connected to the distal end of the flexible tube. This catheter end piece, may be called head piece or head of the catheter, can be formed according to the required functional needs. E.g., the catheter end piece is a section of the flexible tube whereby the at least one suction opening is provided at this section. Alternatively, the catheter end piece is a separate piece, optionally made from a material different from the material of the flexible tube. The material of such a catheter end piece is chosen according the respective requirements.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0033">Preferred the catheter end piece comprising at least two suction openings, thereby secure a removal of material also if one of the suction openings is blocked be aspirated material.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0034">In particular the at least two suction openings are arranged opposite of each other, whereby a good removal is secured. By this embodiment a removal takes also place, if the catheter end piece is placed inside emboli during the use of the catheter.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0035">Preferably the catheter end piece comprising at least one suction opening at the distal end of the catheter end piece, thereby secure a removal of material also from the distal end.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0036">Preferred the stopper element is an abutment surface provided inside of the catheter end piece, whereby an easy constructive embodiment can be realized.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0037">Preferably the catheter end piece comprising a guide wire opening for pass through the guide wire through the catheter end piece, whereby a correct guidance of the catheter inside of the hollow body is secured.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0038">Preferred the guide wire opening of the catheter end piece is arranged at least partly inside of the at least one suction opening, whereby a correct guidance of the catheter inside of the hollow body is secured.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0039">Preferably the catheter end piece comprising a connection section for connecting the catheter end piece to the flexible tube, whereby an easy connection between a separate catheter end piece and the flexible tube can be realized.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0040">The catheter end piece may be connected directly or by another means such as a connecting tube to the flexible tube. The connecting tube can be flexible for the intended use. The connecting tube is preferably designed or made from a material to be kink-resistant or is supported internally in a way that will not kink during the use.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0041">Instead of a fixation of the stopper element to the flexible tube, the stopper element may be connected directly or by another means to the catheter end piece.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0042">Preferred the catheter end piece comprises at least partly from radiopaque material, whereby the user can easily use the catheter during surgical procedure.
