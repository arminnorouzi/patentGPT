The fume extractor can be selectively configurable to accommodate various needs of the user. In some embodiments the fume extractor is portable. The fume extractor can be used alternately for both point-of-use filtration and zone filtration. The fume extractor can also provide work surface for welding operations. In some embodiments the fume extractor generates relatively low noise compared to some other fume extractors.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a perspective view of an example fume extractor <b>100</b> consistent with some embodiments. The fume extractor <b>100</b> is generally configured to extract fumes from a work area. The fume extractor <b>100</b> generally has an extractor housing <b>110</b>, a diffusion plate <b>130</b> coupled to the extractor housing <b>110</b>, and a hose <b>120</b> coupled to the extractor housing <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The extractor housing <b>110</b> is generally configured to contain various components. In some embodiments, the extractor housing <b>110</b> houses at least a fan and a filter (not currently depicted). The extractor housing <b>110</b> generally defines an outlet <b>106</b> of the fume extractor <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The extractor housing <b>110</b> can be constructed of various types of materials and combinations of materials. In some embodiments, the extractor housing <b>110</b> is a plastic. In some such embodiments, the extractor housing <b>110</b> is a molded plastic. In some embodiments, the extractor housing <b>110</b> is constructed of metal. In various embodiments the extractor housing <b>110</b> is configured to be portable. For example, the extractor housing <b>110</b> can have a handle (not currently depicted) such that a user can carry the fume extractor <b>100</b>. In various embodiments the extractor housing <b>110</b> can be openable and re-closeable such that a user can access the interior of the extractor housing <b>110</b> to, for example, replace or adjust components.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The hose <b>120</b> generally defines a first inlet <b>102</b> of the fume extractor <b>100</b>. The hose <b>120</b> defines an airflow pathway <b>121</b> into the extractor housing <b>110</b>. In various embodiments, the hose <b>120</b> defines an airflow pathway <b>121</b> to the fan disposed in the extractor housing <b>110</b>. The hose <b>120</b> can be coupled to the extractor housing <b>110</b> about a first housing opening <b>112</b> (represented with a dotted line).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The hose <b>120</b> is generally configured to be used by a user as a point-of-use fume extractor. As such, the first inlet <b>102</b> can be referred to as a point-of-use extractor inlet. In particular, a distal end <b>122</b> of the hose <b>120</b> is configured to be positioned adjacent to a work surface. The distal end <b>122</b> of the hose <b>120</b> can have a securing device <b>124</b> such as a clamp, brace, or mount that is configured to secure the distal end <b>122</b> of the hose <b>120</b> to a work surface. In some examples a magnetic mount is coupled to the distal end <b>122</b> of the hose <b>120</b> to magnetically couple the distal end <b>122</b> of the hose <b>120</b> to a work surface.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The hose <b>120</b> generally has sufficient flexibility to be wound about a hose channel <b>140</b> for storage (as will be described in more detail below), un-wound from the hose channel <b>140</b>, and be positioned in various locations and orientations relative to the extractor housing <b>110</b> to accommodate a variety of work surfaces and environments. In some embodiments the hose <b>120</b> can be constructed of a flexible plastic or rubber. In some embodiments the hose <b>120</b> can be constructed of a plurality of rigid segments that are joined at flexible joints. The hose <b>120</b> can have a length of at least 2 feet. In some embodiments the hose <b>120</b> has a length ranging from 1 foot to 8 feet.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The diffusion plate <b>130</b> generally defines a second inlet <b>104</b>. The diffusion plate <b>130</b> is configured to diffuse the airflow through the second inlet <b>104</b>. In particular, the diffusion plate <b>130</b> defines a plurality of openings <b>132</b> that cumulatively define the second inlet <b>104</b> of the fume extractor <b>100</b>. The diffusion plate <b>130</b> is generally configured to facilitate zone extraction. As such, the second inlet <b>104</b> can be referred to as a zone extraction inlet.

In some embodiments the diffusion plate <b>130</b> is configured to be an inlet for downdraft extraction. In some embodiments the diffusion plate <b>130</b> is positioned by a user to selectively achieve backdraft extraction or downdraft extraction. In some embodiments the fume extractor <b>100</b> is positioned by a user in a workstation to selectively achieve backdraft extraction or downdraft extraction, which will be described in more detail, below.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In various embodiments, the diffusion plate <b>130</b> is configured to selectively define a work surface for welding operations. As such, the diffusion plate <b>130</b> has a main surface <b>134</b> that is substantially planar, where the main surface <b>134</b> defines the plurality of openings <b>132</b>. Each of the plurality of openings <b>132</b> can be circular, in various embodiments. In some such embodiments, each of the plurality of openings <b>132</b> have a diameter of at least &#x215c;-inch, although other diameters are possible, as well. In various embodiments, each of the plurality of openings <b>132</b> can be threaded to receive mating fasteners such that the diffusion plate <b>130</b> can be used as a fixture table.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">To facilitate welding operations, the diffusion plate <b>130</b> can be constructed of an electrically conductive material, such as aluminum. In some embodiments, the diffusion plate <b>130</b> is constructed of steel. The diffusion plate <b>130</b> can have a thickness ranging from 0.01 inches to 1.5 inches or from 0.025 inches to 0.80 inches. In some particular embodiments, the diffusion plate <b>130</b> can be at least 0.25 inches thick. In the current example, the diffusion plate <b>130</b> defines plate flanges <b>136</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>extending substantially orthogonally from the main surface <b>134</b>, where &#x201c;substantially orthogonally&#x201d; is used to mean within +/&#x2212;5&#xb0; from orthogonal.

The plate flanges <b>136</b> a-c will be described in more detail, below.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Zone extraction, which is enabled by the diffusion plate <b>130</b>, can be distinguished from point-of-use extraction, which is enabled by the hose <b>120</b>. Generally, zone extraction and point-of-use extraction can be differentiated based on the intake area defined by the inlet of the fume extractor <b>100</b>. An intake area of less than 79.2 in<sup>2 </sup>will generally be considered point-of-use extraction, and an intake area of greater than 79.2 in<sup>2 </sup>will generally be considered zone extraction. Zone extraction can also be distinguished from point-of-use extraction based on the capture velocity, where the capture velocity is the velocity of the air passing through the intake area. The capture velocity V<sub>capture </sub>can be determined by the following equation, where the volumetric flow rate is defined by the volume of air passing through the fume extractor <b>100</b>:</p><p id="p-0031" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>V</mi>   <mi>capture</mi>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo>  <mfrac>   <mrow>    <mi>Volumetric</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mtext>   </mtext>    <mi>flow</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mtext>   </mtext>    <mi>rate</mi>   </mrow>   <mrow>    <mi>Intake</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mtext>   </mtext>    <mi>area</mi>   </mrow>  </mfrac> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">In some embodiments, a capture velocity of about 100 ft/min distinguishes zone extraction from point-of-use extraction at a flow rate of about 55 ft<sup>3</sup>/min.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">The first inlet <b>102</b> defined by the hose <b>120</b> generally has an intake area A<sub>1 </sub>that is less than about 79.2 in<sup>2</sup>, and the second inlet <b>104</b> defined by the diffusion plate <b>130</b> generally has an intake area A<sub>2 </sub>that is greater than about 79.2 in<sup>2</sup>.
