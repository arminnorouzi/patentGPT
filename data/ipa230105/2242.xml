Lithium-rich manganese-based cathode materials have great potential due to their advantages of large specific discharge capacity, low price, and environmental friendliness. At present, lithium-rich materials generally have some defects, such as fine particles, low sphericity, low tap density, poor cycle performance, and poor rate performance.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Therefore, lithium-rich carbonate precursors with high sphericity and tap density need further study.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure provides a lithium-rich carbonate precursor, a preparation method therefor, and an application thereof.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a lithium-rich carbonate precursor in an embodiment.
