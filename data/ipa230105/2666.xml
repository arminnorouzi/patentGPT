Squeeze generally consists of periodic injections of inhibitor into the reservoir from the producing well to prevent scale deposition (REBESCHINI, 2010<i>, &#x201c;Evaluation of chemical additives to dissolve inorganic scale of barium sulfate in oil wells. State University of Campinas, Campinas</i>&#x201d;). In the case of the presence of deposits, removal can take place mechanically (maceration, hydroblasting, scraping), if the location is easily accessible, as in surface installations, or chemically, when the location of deposits is difficult to access, or where mechanical methods are unfeasible, such as in the reservoir. The chemical treatment is usually done with the use of removers of acidic character. The scale removal techniques must be fast, considering the high cost of a workover operation; however, without damaging the formation. When choosing the most appropriate treatment, it is necessary to know some preliminary information, such as the location of the deposit, the amount, the chemical composition, and the texture of the solids present, in order to avoid their recurrence (REZENDE et al., 2009<i>, ROS&#x2014;Remote Operations Simulator. III National Meeting of Hydraulics of Wells, Campos do Jord&#xe3;o, S P, June </i>7 <i>to </i>10<i>; REBESCHINI, </i>2010<i>, Evaluation of the Mitigation of Inorganic Fouling of Barium Sulfate in Oil Wells with the Assistance of Numerical Simulation. Edition </i>52<i>, year </i>5 <i>volume </i>7).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The dissolution and/or scale removal treatments and the squeeze treatment of scale inhibitor in oil producing reservoirs and wells are currently carried out in different steps and using different chemicals. These treatments imply the interruption of production in the well, generating production losses, in addition to the risks associated with multiple processes for carrying out these treatments separately.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, there are several products applied in the inhibition of inorganic scale in the oil industry, which have the function of preventing the formation of saline deposits of calcium carbonate and barium and strontium sulfates, the most common types of scale in operations of oil production. Among these inhibitors, organophosphonic acids (phosphonates) stand out, which are more efficient in inhibiting. Particularly, considering the high solubility of calcium carbonate in acidic medium, a certain level of dissolution of the reservoir rock can be reached by using organophosphonic compounds (phosphonates) in acidic solution, followed by retention of the inhibitor molecule in the rock formation for future inhibition of scale formation in the porous medium.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In &#x201c;Cardoso, G.

The permeability analyses in Table 1 corroborate that the treatment in which there was greater intensity in the dissolution of the calcium carbonate sample was the one that contained ATMP as active matter, since it has a greater amount of phosphonic acid groups, requiring a greater amount of calcium carbonate to neutralize the same. This analysis also evidenced the higher dissolution capacity of EABMP compared to a commercial phosphonate. The commercial phosphonate did not present sufficient dissolution efficiency for the proposed combined treatment, with no increase in permeability after treatment (stimulation).</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 2: Analysis of Retention and Release of Scale Inhibiting Active Matter</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0022">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, curves were obtained to evaluate the retention of the scale inhibitor during the injection of the solution (main treatment).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">The inhibitor solution that contained the EABMP molecule showed satisfactory behavior of dissolution of carbonates, retention in the rock, and release above the minimum effective concentration to inhibit the precipitation of carbonates in the aqueous medium, as evidenced by the concentration of phosphorus in the effluent. As the acid treatment dissolves the calcium carbonate rock sample while retaining the scale-inhibiting molecule, large amounts of calcium carbonate are solubilized in the aqueous medium, increasing the concentration of calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) in solution.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">Since the ATMP molecule in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions forms a Ca-ATMP complex of low solubility, precipitating in the pores of the rock sample, it was not possible to obtain the phosphorus concentration curve in the effluent as a function of the porous volume of water from injected formation to evaluate the release of ATMP phosphonate in the aqueous phase.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, when analyzing the curve from the moment the injection starts to the point where the inhibitor completely saturates the medium (the reactivity of the medium tends to equilibrium), it is noted that there was a retention of the inhibitor in the porous medium during sample dissolution.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 3: Scale Inhibitor Release Analysis</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0026">In addition, the release of the scale inhibitor was evaluated in the flow experiment in a porous medium. After the squeeze treatment, the inhibitor was released into the fluid stream during production, inhibiting scale formation for a certain period of time. The objective was to determine the scale inhibition potential of the used solutions containing organophosphonic acids, after the dissolution of a calcium carbonate rock sample, simulating the reopening of the well for production.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">The experiments with EABMP and commercial phosphonate showed potential to inhibit scale, and were gradually released into the aqueous fluid stream. In the experiment that contained ATMP as active matter, there was precipitation of the Ca-ATMP complex in the porous medium, and the inhibitor release curve was not obtained with the injection of formation water into the rock.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">In both experiments with EABMP and commercial phosphonate, the inhibitor concentration remained above the Minimum Inhibitor Concentration (MIC) required for inhibition. Accordingly, these inhibitors are therefore effective in inhibiting calcium carbonate throughout its useful life (release into the aqueous stream).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">The experiment that contained commercial phosphonate in the composition of the main treatment solution had a significant useful life, demonstrating potential to inhibit scale over a certain period of time. However, the commercial phosphonate showed unsatisfactory dissolution for the proposed combined treatment.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">The EABMP was efficient in the combined and simultaneous treatment (using a single fluid) of dissolution and inhibition of calcium carbonate scale. There were observed the efficient dissolution, retention and subsequent release of the inhibitor to the aqueous stream at a concentration above the minimum required one, without causing damage, and stimulating the porous rock. The proposed process can be expanded to other classes of organophosphonic acids (phosphonates) that are tolerant to precipitation in the presence of high concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">It should be noted that, although the present invention has been described in relation to the attached figures, it may undergo modifications and adaptations by technicians skilled on the subject, depending on the specific situation, but provided that it is within the inventive scope defined herein.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>- A COMBINED TREATMENT PROCESS FOR REMOVING AND INHIBITING SCALE, characterized in that there is the combination of two distinct treatments in just a single treatment (removal and inhibition), minimizing the intervention time in producing wells.</claim-text></claim><claim id="CLM-00002" num="00002"><claim-text><b>2</b>- THE COMBINED TREATMENT PROCESS FOR REMOVING AND INHIBITING SCALE according to <claim-ref idref="CLM-00001">claim 1</claim-ref>, characterized in that there is the use of a treatment solution based on inhibitors derived from organophosphonic acid, in acidic medium, which acts in the dissolution of the scale of calcium carbonate and the inhibition of the fluid produced.</claim-text></claim><claim id="CLM-00003" num="00003"><claim-text><b>3</b>- A COMBINED TREATMENT METHOD FOR REMOVING AND INHIBITING SCALE, characterized in that it comprises the following steps:<claim-text>a.
