The display device <b>473</b> includes the touch panel. When the user touches a button or a key displayed on the screen, the touch panel detects the instruction corresponding to the touched position.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The network I/F <b>91</b> is a communication interface that transmits and receives various types of data to and from an external device (e.g., the information processing apparatus <b>2</b>) inside a local area, or on the internet.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The storage device <b>8</b> is a large-capacity storage device such as a hard disk drive (HDD) and a solid-state drive (SSD). The storage device <b>8</b> contains various control programs, and includes a schedule storage region <b>80</b>. In the schedule storage region <b>80</b>, schedule information indicating a task designated by the user (e.g., printing task, scanning task, or transfer task), and date and time that the task is to be executed.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a table showing an example of a data structure stored in the schedule storage region <b>80</b>. In the schedule storage region <b>80</b>, the information including the task information and the date and time of execution is stored, in association with a reference number assigned to each piece of the schedule information. The task information includes the type of the task and detail information. The controller <b>100</b> registers the schedule information designated by the user in the schedule storage region <b>80</b>, according to the user's instruction inputted through the operation device <b>47</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The printing task is the task of printing the document stored in the information processing apparatus <b>2</b>. In the schedule storage region <b>80</b>, the storage location of the document to be printed, and print settings (e.g., color or B/W, paper size, simplex or duplex printing) are stored as the detail information of the printing task. The storage location of the document may be indicated, for example, by a file path.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The scanning task is the task of causing the document reading device <b>5</b> to read a document. In the schedule storage region <b>80</b>, the name of the document to be scanned (to be read), and the contact address for notifying that the time for scanning the document is drawing near (contact address for notifying that the scanning is ready), are stored as the detail information about the scanning task. The contact address can be exemplified by an e-mail address.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The transfer task is the task for transferring the document stored in the information processing apparatus <b>2</b>, to a predetermined transfer destination. In the schedule storage region <b>80</b>, the storage location of the document to be transferred, and the transfer destination of the document are stored as the detail information of the transfer task.
