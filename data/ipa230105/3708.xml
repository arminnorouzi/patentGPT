the surface. The fluid may be analyzed at the surface to characterize the depositional environment and optimize drilling therethrough. For example, the fluid analysis may allow an operator to identify and quantify fluids such as oil, gas, water, and/or other formation fluids at various depths within the subterranean formation.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Typical surface equipment to perform this analysis, such as a gas detector and a gas extractor, may each be positioned at separate surface locations, requiring a substantial amount of space at a rig site with a limited amount of space. Further, this separation between the gas detector and the gas extractor may require additional time, cost, and/or space to rig up additional gas lines to connect the gas extractor to the gas detector. Further, gas samples may become contaminated with moisture while passing through the gas lines from the gas extractor to the gas detector.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">These drawings illustrate certain aspects of some examples of the present disclosure and should not be used to limit or define the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an open-path laser detection device (OPDD), in accordance with examples of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a standalone integrated gas extraction and detection system including the OPDD, in accordance with examples of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates another standalone integrated gas extraction and detection system including the OPDD and a mixing chamber, in accordance with examples of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an operative flow sequence for the standalone integrated gas extraction and detection systems, in accordance with examples of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a standalone integrated gas extraction and detection system implemented at a rig site, in accordance with examples of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure generally relates to gas extractors, and, more particularly, examples relate to systems and methods for integrating a gas detector into a gas extractor and using open-path laser detection to provide a standalone gas analysis unit for deployment to a rig site. In particular examples, an open-path laser detection device (OPDD) may include a gas detection chamber mounted onto or integrated into a gas extraction chamber. The OPDD may employ spectroscopy to determine a type and quantity of at least one component/molecular species within a wellbore fluid. For example, the OPD may utilize deuterated triglycine sulfate (DTGS), mercury cadmium telluride (MCT), or other suitable methods, to provide molecular species detection or total hydrocarbon detection in a drilling fluid.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some examples, the OPDD may operate similar to Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, chirped laser dispersion spectroscopy, tunable diode laser (TDL) spectroscopy or other spectroscopy that may function on an open path. The OPDD may replace total gas detection, gas chromatography, or other gas detection methods.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">For example, the gas detection chamber may be coupled to an infrared (IR) energy source, such as, a laser. The laser may utilize a single wavelength, a tunable diode, or quantum cascading to emit radiation. In some examples, the laser may include a monochromatic filter, an adjustable mirror to control wavelength, and/or a reference cell filled with a desired gas for laser calibration. A detector may also be coupled to the gas detection chamber and may detect and convert the energy emitted from the energy source within the gas detection chamber, into measurable signals. Based on the signals, the type and quantity of at least one component/molecular species within the wellbore fluid may be determined.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some examples, a set of reflective surfaces may be mounted in the gas detection chamber. The reflective surfaces may be flat or curved to reflect/bounce a laser beam between the surfaces to maximize a free path length (i.e., a maximum traveled distance by the laser beam).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Additionally, the gas detection chamber may be vibrationally isolated from adjacent structures/supports via active or passive vibration dampening/canceling systems. An active vibration isolation system may include a sensor, an actuator, and a controller to produce an opposing vibration to cancel/counteract an incoming vibration; whereas, the passive vibration isolation system may include dampeners, rubber, springs, airbags, and/or other mechanical structure(s) that are not actively operated.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some examples, a shaft may pass through the gas detection chamber to rotate a gas extraction device within the gas extraction chamber. The gas extraction device may include, for example, a rotor to facilitate the gas extraction via rotation. The shaft may pass through a soft connector (e.g., a hose) or a hard connector (e.g., a pipe).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some examples, a carrier gas may pass into the gas extraction chamber to carry extracted gas from drilling fluid into the gas detection chamber. In other examples, a mixing chamber may be utilized to receive and mix the carrier gas and the extracted gas, for passage into the gas detection chamber.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an OPDD <b>100</b>, in accordance with examples of the present disclosure. The OPDD <b>100</b> may include a detection chamber <b>101</b> to receive a desired gas for analysis. The gas may be acquired during wellbore operations, such as drilling for example. The detection chamber <b>101</b> may include a set of reflective surfaces <b>102</b> (e.g., mirrors), which may be disposed along a perimeter <b>104</b> within the detection chamber <b>101</b>, for example. In non-limiting examples, the reflective surfaces <b>102</b> may form a polygon within a circular detection chamber <b>101</b>. The reflective surfaces <b>102</b> may be flat or curved and may be disposed along the perimeter <b>104</b> (e.g., a wall) to reflect/bounce a laser beam <b>108</b> between the reflective surfaces <b>102</b> to maximize a free path length (i.e., a maximum traveled distance by the laser beam <b>108</b> within the detection chamber <b>101</b>).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The laser beam <b>108</b> may pass through an exit <b>110</b> from the detection chamber <b>101</b> after moving along the free path length. In some examples, an obstruction, such as, for example, a shaft (e.g., shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may pass through the detection chamber <b>101</b> (e.g., a center passage <b>111</b> of the detection chamber <b>101</b>) to actuate or rotate a gas extraction device within a gas extraction chamber (e.g., shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The laser beam <b>108</b> may include a travel path that avoids any obstruction(s) within the gas detection chamber <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">An energy source <b>112</b>, such as, for example, a laser may be coupled (e.g., weld, fasteners) to the detection chamber <b>101</b>. The energy source <b>112</b> may utilize a single wavelength, a tunable diode, or quantum cascading. In some examples, the energy source <b>112</b> may include a monochromatic filter <b>114</b>, an adjustable mirror <b>116</b> to control wavelength, and/or a reference cell <b>118</b> filled with a desired gas for calibration of the energy source <b>112</b> (e.g., laser calibration).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A detector <b>120</b> (e.g., a radiation transducer, a photon detector) may also be coupled to the detection chamber <b>101</b> and may convert radiation (e.g., photons) within the detection chamber <b>101</b> into measurable signals (e.g., electrical signals). The detector <b>120</b> may be disposed adjacent to the exit <b>110</b> of the detection chamber <b>101</b> to receive the laser beam <b>108</b>. In some examples, the detector <b>120</b> may be an open laser path detector rather than a single laser point detector. For example, the sample gas may intersect a laser beam before contacting a single laser point. Open-path detectors may also be cost-effective in scenarios where a row of point detectors might be implemented to achieve the same coverage/detection area.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The energy source <b>112</b> and the detector <b>120</b> may be in communication with a system controller <b>122</b> via communication paths <b>124</b> (e.g., wires or wireless). The system controller <b>122</b> may include a display, a storage unit, and/or any instrumentality or aggregate of instrumentalities operable to compute, estimate, classify, process, transmit, receive, retrieve, originate, switch, store, display, manifest, detect, record, reproduce, handle, or utilize any form of information, intelligence, or data for business, scientific, control, or other purposes. For example, the system controller <b>122</b> may be a computer, a network storage device, or any other suitable device and may vary in size, shape, performance, functionality, and price. The system controller <b>122</b> may include a processing unit (e.g., microprocessor, central processing unit, programmable logic controller (PLC), etc.) that may process data by executing software or instructions obtained from a local non-transitory computer readable media (e.g., optical disks, magnetic disks). The non-transitory computer readable media may store software or instructions of the methods described herein. Non-transitory computer readable media may include any instrumentality or aggregation of instrumentalities that may retain data and/or instructions for a period of time. The non-transitory computer readable media may include, for example, storage media such as a direct access storage device (e.g., a hard disk drive or floppy disk drive), a sequential access storage device (e.g., a tape disk drive), compact disk, CD-ROM, DVD, RAM, ROM, electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and/or flash memory; as well as communications media such wires, optical fibers, microwaves, radio waves, and other electromagnetic and/or optical carriers; and/or any combination of the foregoing.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The system controller <b>122</b> may also include input device(s) (e.g., keyboard, mouse, touchpad, etc.) and output device(s) (e.g., monitor, printer, etc.). The input device(s) and output device(s) provide a user interface. For example, the system controller <b>122</b> may enable an operator to select and perform analysis, view collected data, view analysis results, and/or perform other tasks.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a system <b>200</b> including the OPDD <b>100</b>, in accordance with examples of the present disclosure. The OPDD <b>100</b> may be vertically integrated into the system <b>200</b> (e.g., a standalone gas analysis unit in a stacked configuration). As noted previously, a shaft <b>202</b> may pass through the OPDD <b>100</b> via the detection chamber <b>101</b> to actuate or rotate a gas extraction device <b>204</b> (e.g., a rotor) within a gas extraction chamber <b>205</b> via a motor <b>206</b>. In some examples, the gas extraction device <b>204</b> may be operable to extract gases from the sample fluid based on a density and/or a viscosity differential between the various fluid components of the sample fluid.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The shaft <b>202</b> may be disposed within a sleeve <b>207</b> (e.g., a soft connector, flexible hose) that may also include a conduit <b>209</b> fluidly coupling the detection chamber <b>101</b> to the extraction chamber <b>205</b>. In some examples, the soft connector may be employed because alignment of the mirrors and electromagnetic source to the detector may be affected by vibration. Additionally, vibration may add noise to the signal.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The gas extraction chamber <b>205</b> may include an inlet <b>208</b> (e.g., a valve) and an outlet <b>210</b> (e.g., a valve) to pass a wellbore fluid therethrough. Non-limiting examples of the wellbore fluid may include a drilling fluid, a production fluid, a completion fluid, a fracking fluid, a wellbore treatment fluid, a reservoir fluid, a gas, oil, or water. For example, the system <b>200</b> may be implemented into a rig site such a drilling rig or production platform. In some examples, the system <b>200</b> may implemented at the possum belly, the mud tanks, and/or a header box associated with a fluid processing unit (e.g., a shale shaker).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The gas extraction chamber <b>205</b> may also include an inlet <b>212</b> (e.g., a valve) for ingress of a carrier gas to transport at least one extracted gas from the wellbore fluid in the gas extraction chamber <b>205</b> to the detection chamber <b>101</b> via the conduit <b>209</b> to receive emitted energy from the energy source <b>112</b> for detection by the detector <b>120</b>. The carrier gas may be an inert gas including, but not limited to, nitrogen, helium, neon, or argon. In some examples, the carrier gas may be an atmospheric gas, a non-atmospheric gas, or a gas with a sufficient oxygen content to allow for increased sensitivity and reduced contamination from helium, water, or sulfur, for example.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The chamber <b>101</b> may include an outlet <b>214</b> to remove gases from the chamber <b>101</b> after detection via the detector <b>120</b> (e.g., an open path detector).

An active vibration isolation system may include a sensor <b>218</b>, an actuator <b>220</b>, and a controller <b>222</b> to produce an opposing vibration to cancel/counteract an incoming vibration. In contrast to the active vibration isolation system, the passive vibration isolation system may include dampeners, rubber, springs, airbags, and/or other mechanical structure(s).

It should be noted that although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a land-based drilling rig, the principles described herein also apply to subsea drilling operations that may employ floating or sea-based platforms and rigs.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A pump <b>520</b> (e.g., a mud pump) circulates a fluid <b>522</b> (e.g., a drilling fluid, wellbore fluid) through a feed pipe <b>524</b> and into the drill string <b>508</b>. The fluid <b>122</b> may be conveyed through the drill string <b>508</b> and the drill bit <b>514</b> and out into the wellbore <b>116</b>. The fluid <b>522</b> is then circulated back to the surface via an annulus <b>526</b> defined between the drill string <b>508</b> and the walls of the wellbore <b>516</b>. At the surface, the circulated fluid <b>522</b> exits the annulus <b>526</b> and may be conveyed, continuously or periodically, to the system <b>200</b> or the system <b>300</b>, for spectral analysis before being returned back into the circulatory system. In some examples, the system <b>200</b> or the system <b>300</b> may be disposed at a flow line <b>525</b>. In other examples, the system <b>200</b> or the system <b>300</b> may be placed at another suitable location within the circulatory system such as at the possum belly, the mud tanks, and/or a header box associated with a fluid processing unit <b>528</b> (e.g., shale shaker). The system <b>200</b> or the system <b>300</b> may employ spectroscopy via open path detection, as previously described, to determine a type and quantity of at least one component/molecular species within the fluid <b>522</b>. For example, the system <b>200</b> or the system <b>300</b> may utilize deuterated triglycine sulfate (DTGS), mercury cadmium telluride (MCT), or other suitable methods, to provide molecular species detection or total hydrocarbon.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">After passing the system <b>200</b> or the system <b>300</b>, the circulated fluid <b>522</b> may pass into the fluid processing unit <b>528</b>. After passing through the fluid processing unit <b>528</b>, a &#x201c;clean&#x201d; fluid <b>522</b> is deposited into a mud pit <b>532</b>. One or more chemicals, fluids, or additives may be added to the fluid <b>522</b> via a mixing hopper <b>534</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Once the chemical composition of the fluid is determined, the data may be used by an analyst, mud logger, geochemist, geologist, petrophysicist, or other well to identify, for example, a hydrocarbon-bearing zone. Additionally, the data may be used to alter drilling parameters or a drilling fluid composition.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Accordingly, the systems and methods of the present disclosure may allow for open-path spectral analysis of an extracted gas by integrating a gas detector into a gas extractor.
