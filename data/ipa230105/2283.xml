Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates generally to a method of forming structures from glass and quartz and, more specifically, to a method wherein glass is a major component that is mixed with quartz, resin (binder) and a coupling agent to form a structure that is stronger and more translucent than conventional quartz surfacing and that can be used in a thinner format for countertops using standard cabinet perimeter support. The thin format and translucency provide for backlighting capabilities and through-body veins. The quartz and glass aggregate structure and resin binder enable the addition of specific mineral components to obtain desired aesthetics and properties. The additives may include aluminum trihydrate for enhancing the whiteness and translucency of pure white marble designs and nano-glass crystals for improving hardness while retaining translucency.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Specific natural mineral components may be added to the glass/quartz/resin composite structure to provide the aesthetics of specific natural stones. The glass/quartz/resin composite structure may also be crushed into large decorative chips (1.0-2.0 cm) to provide the look of the natural calcite crystals in metamorphic marble. In the morphism of sedimentary rock into metamorphic rock (marble, Dolomite quartzites, etc.), the calcite in limestone will recrystallize forming a mass of interlocking calcite crystals and more complex silicate structures may be formed. The large chips produced from majority crushed glass and quartz may be customized with minerals and pigments to produce decorative chips that provide the aesthetics of specific natural stones.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Engineered stone may refer to a composite material comprised of crushed stone which may be bound together by an adhesive (binding resin). An example of an engineered stone may include quartz and feldspar, the two most prevalent minerals in the earth's crust. Engineered stone is commonly used in the construction industry, with quartz in particular finding particular appeal for use as kitchen and bath countertops.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Quartz has desirable structural, performance, and maintenance attributes that make it desirable for use in construction applications in place of natural stone, being stronger, harder, and more stain resistant than granite and marble. However, quartz surfacing lacks the strength required for use as thin format slabs (1.2-1.5 cm) for countertops without full underlayment support and lacks the translucency of onyx, quartzite aesthetics and the white background of pure white marbles. In the U.S., more than 70% of the quartz countertops used are in 3 cm thickness and the remainder in 2 cm thickness. There is a need for a thinner format for countertop applications that will consume less raw materials, reduce handling burden, resulting in reduced handling costs and installation costs, and health &#x26; safety benefits for workers doing the handling and installation, and provide the necessary structural strength for use as countertops. Moreover, thin format slabs will enable use of conventional cutting tools such as ceramic tile cutting tools for cutting and fitting of countertops, thus avoiding additional work in the fabrication facility during installation. Moreover, quartz raw materials needed for premium natural white marbles and quartzites may need to be secured in various foreign countries, resulting in volatility in the overall cost of producing quartz products locally.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the market demand for quartz, there is a need for a thinner slab format for countertops which can be lighter and more economical and also a demand for aesthetics that resemble premium white marbles and quartzite designs. Various aspects of the present disclosure address these needs, as will be discussed in more detail below.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure contemplates various apparatuses for overcoming the above drawbacks accompanying the related art. One aspect of the embodiments of the present disclosure is a glass/quartz composite structure comprising of glass grit, quartz powder, a custom binding resin and additional minerals that enhance the performance properties and provide specific desired aesthetics of premium natural stones.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The glass/quartz composite structure may further comprise a silane coupling agent. The silane coupling agent may be in an amount of 1.0-2 percent by weight of the composite structure. The binding resin may be in an amount of 10-14 percent by weight of the composite structure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The glass grit which may be in an amount 35%-52% of the total composite structure by weight may comprise of conical-shaped or cube-shaped glass grit. The glass grit may be in an amount greater than any other single material by weight of the composite structure. The glass grit may be within the range of 100 microns to 1200 microns and may be sized to pass through a sieve ranging from 16 mesh to 120 mesh. The shape of the glass grit and surface porosity allow for efficient bonding of the resin and the glass grit. The efficiency of the bond is also enhanced by the 1.0%-2.0% silane coupling agent in the resin. The glass grit will remain a larger component of the aggregate as compared to quartz powder, quartz grit or other aggregate additives such as nano-glass crystals. Aluminum trihydrate (alumina) powder (typically 400 mesh to 800 mesh microparticles) or other microparticles are added in an amount 2-6% of the total composite structure to help fill the voids between the larger aggregate grit and enhance the packing density of the aggregate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">At least 98% of the quartz powder may be sized to pass through a 325-mesh sieve (45 microns). Quartz powder accounts for 30-35% of the aggregate ingredients by weight. The migration of the quartz powder with the resin into the glass grit improves the density of the aggregate.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The quartz grit may be sized to pass through a sieve ranging from 70 mesh to 120 mesh or from 8 mesh to 16 mesh as needed to achieve desired aesthetics and maintain &#x3c;40% of the aggregate content in combination with quartz powder and a lower content by weight than glass grit of the total composite structure. Glass (e.g., nano-glass crystals) may be used in place of quartz grit in the mix in order to achieve an all-glass aggregate that can be combined with the quartz powder and binding resin. The nano-glass crystals may provide the scratch resistance and hardness that would otherwise be provided by quartz grit while at the same time reducing the airborne silica dust that would be generated from the quartz grit during fabrication.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The glass grit may comprise soda-lime-silica and may be produced from various types of glass including windowpane plate glass trim, stemware and crystal glass, glass used for lighting and glass used for bottles. Glass typically has a tensile strength of 1,000 psi. But theoretically it can have a tensile strength up to 2,500,000 psi due to glass's strong chemical bonds. Factors such as imperfections in the glass such as scratches or fissures may impact the strength of the composite structure and will be discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The binding resin may comprise of an unsaturated polyester resin. The binding resin may contain 28-34% styrene, 1.0-1.5% catalyst, 1.0-2.0% silane coupling agent, 0.008-0.01% cobalt accelerator; have a viscosity of 600-850 cPs at 25&#xb0; C. (after silane addition) and a gel time of 4-8 minutes. The higher viscosity and shorter gel time with the binding resin used with the glass and quartz powder aggregate may provide better adhesion between the resin and the glass surface while providing good migration of the resin and powder within the glass aggregate structure. The typical unsaturated polyester resin used with quartz surfacing contains 37% styrene, has a viscosity of 350-400 cPs and a gel time of 8-12 minutes. The gel time may be defined as the time for when the polymer first starts to turn into a solid immersed in a water bath at 85 degrees C.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The quartz (and/or nano-glass crystals) and glass aggregate structure and custom resin binder provide the structure that is stronger and more translucent than conventional quartz surfacing and can be used in a thinner format for countertops and walls. The quartz, glass and resin binder structure also enable the addition of specific natural mineral components when needed to provide specific aesthetics of natural stones and have the majority ingredients in the aggregate be natural minerals. Feldspar grit (10%-20% by weight) may be added to the aggregate sized to pass through sieves ranging from 8 mesh to 120 mesh for earth-tone aesthetics of limestones and concretes. Aluminum trihydrate (&#x201c;alumina&#x201d;, 2-6% by weight) may be added to the quartz-glass aggregate in a fine powder (sized to pass through sieves ranging from 400 mesh to 800 mesh) for the aesthetics of pure white marbles. Nano-glass crystals produced with molten glass quenched in water may be used to replace quartz grit and provide hardness and scratch resistance. The all-glass aggregate will provide aesthetic features of translucent white quartzites while retaining the hardness and scratch resistance of glass-quartz composite surfaces. Decorative majority glass chips may be added to simulate calcite and dolomite crystals in limestones and marbles. The glass/quartz composite surface with additional natural mineral ingredients provide the aesthetics and feel of natural stones. When added for aesthetic benefit, the combination of alumina or feldspar with quartz powder and quartz grit will provide a majority content of natural mineral ingredients by weight of the total engineered composite structure. However, the quartz grit, nano-glass crystals, and powder content in the aggregate will remain lower by weight than glass grit content in the aggregate for the flex and impact strength required for use in thin format slabs.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another aspect of the embodiments of the present disclosure is a method of manufacturing a glass/quartz composite slab with mineral ingredients for the aesthetic of natural stones and the strength to use in thin format slabs. The method includes mixing glass grit, quartz powder, and a binding resin, and pouring the mixture in a mold. The compaction of the mixture in the mold using a high viscosity resin with 1.0-2.0% silane coupling agent requires sufficient time during the compaction process for the resin and quartz powder to migrate through the aggregate structure. The compaction process time is 250-320 seconds with the present disclosure using an unsaturated polyester resin with 1.0-2.0% silane coupling agent, 10-14 resin percent by weight of the composite structure and a resin viscosity of 600-850 cPs at 25&#xb0; C. The vibration during compaction allows for the resin/filler paste to migrate throughout the structure. Another aspect of the present disclosure is using a vibration compaction process time of preferably 250-320 seconds for the 600-850 cPs resin and filler quartz to migrate fully through the glass aggregate structure. The resin migration can be further improved by a multi-stage vibration compaction process which increases the compaction power gradually to provide more time for the resin migration in the early stages. A typical compaction process time with Breton equipment is much shorter, approximately 70 seconds, which provides limited time for a gradual compaction power increase. A key aspect of the pressing and vibrating process is the use of a vacuum environment to remove entrained air during pressing. The efficiency of the compacting, vacuum, vibrating process is enhanced by improving the packing density of the aggregate during the mixing process. A closely packed mix and effective adhesion with the resin paste will increase the internal strength of the aggregate to use in thin format slabs or countertop applications using standard cabinet perimeter support. The impact crushing of the glass to produce the desired cubic and conical shapes is highly important in forming the tight interlock achieved with the vibrating, compacting and vacuum process.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The method may further comprise heating the compacted mixture in an oven. The oven heating drives the reaction of the resin to bind the aggregate and form a slab which will be polished into a finished product which can be used in a 1.2 cm-1.5 cm thin format for countertops and walls. Another aspect of the present disclosure is the time the slabs are kept in the oven. The process for producing thin format slabs may require reducing stresses in the oven after the reaction of the resin to bind the aggregate and form the slab as well as provide a controlled slab cool down. The slabs are kept in the oven for 90 minutes to 150 minutes instead of 50 minutes typical for a Breton process with quartz surfacing to release internal stresses from the polymer reaction. The polymerization reaction is generally 95% complete after 25 minutes in the oven but the remaining time is used to cure the slabs and reduce stresses from the reaction so as to minimize bending of the slabs during cooling and storage and before polishing. The slabs are stored flat on a metal rack for 24 hours after removal from the oven to keep the slabs flat during cooling before polishing.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The mixing may include preparing a dry mix of the quartz grit and the glass grit, mixing the binding resin with the dry mix to produce a wet mix, and mixing the quartz powder (and possibly aluminum trihydrate powder) with the wet mix.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The mixing may include preparing a dry mix of the quartz grit, the glass grit, and inorganic pigment color powder, and mixing the quartz powder and the binding resin with the dry mix to produce a wet mix.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The method may include dispersing wet mixture pieces produced from the wet mix of a previously manufactured glass/quartz composite slab in the mold. The wet mix of the previously manufactured glass/quartz composite slab may include pigment.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The method may further comprise mixing a silane coupling agent with the binding resin.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The method may further comprise impact breaking glass from plate glass trim pieces or other glass in a vertical shaft impact (VSI) crusher to produce the glass grit and quartz grit in cube or conical shapes. The method may further comprise crushing window plate glass trim and other glass in a cone crusher prior to the vertical shaft impact crusher to reduce the size of the glass pieces. With the VSI crusher, the glass pieces break on impact with other glass pieces and are not crushed by balls as with the ball mill grinder. This method reduces the internal cracks and fissures in the glass that reduces the tensile strength from the glass's strong chemical bonds. The mixing and addition order of the aggregate materials into the mix is highly important for improving the packing density of the aggregate mix and for reducing the entrapped air (void volume).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The materials used in the aggregate dry mix are added in order from the largest particle size to the smallest particle size and mixed for two minutes. The binding resin is then added and mixed for two minutes so that the aggregates are well coated with resin. Microparticles are then added to fill the micro-cavities of the aggregate used in the recipe and reduce the void volume. These microparticles facilitate compaction during the pressing cycle. The filler powder (quartz or cristobalite) is the last ingredient added to the wet mix and forms the adhesive paste that binds the aggregate during polymerization. The final mixing is done for a total of two minutes with the final minute of mixing at a reversed rotation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The method may further comprise dispersing decorative chips of glass or of previously manufactured glass/quartz composite slabs on a surface of the mixture in the mold. The decorative chips may be greater than one centimeter at their largest dimension.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Another aspect of the embodiments of the present disclosure is a glass/quartz composite structure comprising glass grit in an amount greater than any other single material by weight of the composite structure, nano-glass crystals in an amount 5%-10% by weight of the composite structure to provide increased hardness and scratch resistance, quartz powder in an amount 30-35% by weight of the composite structure, and a binding resin. The nano-glass crystals may eliminate the need for quartz grit in the structure. The glass grit &#x26; nano-glass crystals would enable an all-glass composite grit for aesthetic benefits. The all-glass aggregate may be produced from cubical and/or conical pieces. The nano-glass crystals, 2-6% microparticles, and binding resin may produce a structure that is closely packed and provide a noted reduction in airborne silica generated during fabrication. It is believed that airborne silica generated during fabrication is less in the case of an all-glass aggregate than in the case of an aggregate containing quartz grit (especially a majority quartz aggregate).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Nano-glass crystal material may be produced by quenching molten glass into water. These crystals can be added into an all-glass aggregate formula to provide the needed hardness and scratch resistance typically provided by quartz grit. Nano-crystalline glass slabs may be produced when the crystalline glass crystals formed by quenching molten glass into a water bath are placed into a mold and reheated with air.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Another aspect of the embodiments of the present disclosure is a method of mixing quartz and glass aggregates. The method may comprise preparing a dry mix of quartz grit and glass grit, mixing a binding resin with the dry mix to produce a wet mix, mixing a 400-800 mesh microparticle with the wet mix, and, thereafter, mixing quartz powder having a particle size larger than 400 mesh with the wet mix.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The preparing of the dry mix may include preparing a first dry mix of quartz grit and glass grit having a first particle size and adding a second dry mix of quartz grit and glass grit to the first dry mix, the second dry mix having a second particle size smaller than the first. At least 98% of the quartz powder may be sized to pass through a 325-mesh sieve.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Another aspect of the embodiments of the present disclosure is a method of manufacturing a glass/quartz composite slab. The method may comprise preparing a mixture of quartz grit, quartz powder, glass grit, a binding resin, and microparticles to fill a void volume between the quartz grit and glass grit and increase packing density, the microparticles being in an amount 2-6 percent by weight of the mixture, pouring the mixture in a mold, and compacting the mixture in the mold.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">These and other features and advantages of the various embodiments disclosed herein will be better understood with respect to the following description and drawings, in which like numbers refer to like parts throughout, and in which:</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flowchart outlining an exemplary methodology of forming a glass/quartz composite slab; and</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart outlining an exemplary methodology of crushing quartz or glass aggregates.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of certain embodiments of a glass/quartz composite structure, a slab formed therefrom, and a related method of forming the same and is not intended to represent the only forms that may be developed or utilized. The description sets forth the various structure and/or functions in connection with the illustrated embodiments, but it is to be understood, however, that the same or equivalent structure and/or functions may be accomplished by different embodiments that are also intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present disclosure. It is further understood that the use of relational terms such as first and second, and the like are used solely to distinguish one entity from another without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between such entities.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present disclosure generally relates to a method of forming a structure from glass and quartz. The quartz used in the glass/quartz composite structure may be primarily filler where quartz is ground into a powder and becomes part of a composition of resin/filler paste to achieve proper compaction of aggregates. Unit-weight may measure the volume that the graded aggregate quartz and glass and the voids between them will occupy in the resin/filler paste.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The glass grit in combination with the coupling agent absorbs more resin and improves the binding and strength of the structure. The highly compacted mix may contain more glass than quartz, 10-14% resin, and 1.0-2% coupling agent and 2-6% microparticles. For example, the glass grit may be in an amount greater than any other single material by weight of the composite structure (e.g. a combined weight of the quartz grit, quartz powder, glass grit, resin, and coupling agent), the coupling agent may be in an amount of 1.0-2% by weight of the composite structure, and the binding resin may be in an amount of 10-14% by weight of the composite structure. In the process, the resin/filler paste tends to bond more effectively with rough-surfaced aggregates. In this case, glass and quartz provide more area to which the filler/resin paste can bond. Furthermore, by incorporating glass grit, which has the property of having more micro-porosity, desired aesthetic attributes may be achieved while increasing the strength of the glass/quartz composite structure as needed for thin format slabs for use in countertops. By incorporating 2-6% microparticles to fill the voids between the larger particles, it increases the packing density and reduces the void volume in the mix. The thinner format structures in combination with more translucent glass raw materials enable aesthetic and design advantages of premium natural quartzites that add to the value of the countertop designs. Moreover, glass grit with properties which add to the countertop flex and impact strength and translucency and can be found locally may reduce the cost for raw materials with premium quartz designs and enable thinner structures which consume less raw materials.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Previous examples of various aspects of such a process were shown in Applicant's provisional patent application No. 62/692,215, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference as noted above. In that application, various examples were given as to the size of the quartz and glass grit which could be used to form the glass/quartz composite structure. This disclosure provides further examples of such possible combinations and further discloses aspects of the resultant structures.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the process of forming the glass/quartz composite structure may generally include mixing quartz grit <b>12</b> (output of quartz processing <b>24</b>), glass grit <b>16</b> (output of glass processing <b>30</b>) and inorganic pigment powder <b>17</b> to form a dry mixture <b>18</b>. The total amount of glass grit <b>16</b> is preferably more than 50 percent by weight of the quartz/glass aggregate which includes the quartz grit <b>12</b> and filler quartz powder <b>14</b>. The total amount of quartz <b>20</b> may be minimized without compromising aesthetic or structural characteristics if the packing density is maintained through the use of conical and cubic shaped glass grit <b>12</b> within the range of 100 microns to 1200 microns (16 mesh to 120 mesh) and filler quartz powder <b>14</b>. An exemplary standard which applies to quartz surfaces and which may be met by the glass/quartz composite structures made by the methodology described herein may include the IAPMO IGC 340-2017 standard.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">With regard to obtaining desired sizes of the filler quartz <b>14</b>, a desired high purity filler quartz <b>14</b> will have a median particle size D50 between 13 to 14 microns and over 95% will pass through a sieve size 325 mesh (45 microns). The filler quartz <b>14</b> may be integrated in the wet mixing process step <b>36</b>. Completely inert and pH neutral, the filler quartz <b>14</b> will not alter or initiate when incorporated with the wet mix (e.g. containing a polyester resin <b>38</b>). The filler quartz <b>14</b>, having low surface area and hardness, may offer minimal absorption for high loading and stiffening for thermoset high-performance polyester resin systems.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one exemplary process, the quartz grit <b>12</b>, an inorganic or organic pigment color powder <b>17</b>, and glass grit <b>16</b> are added to produce the dry mixture <b>18</b> before the step of producing the wet mixture <b>36</b>, where the resin <b>38</b> &#x26; coupling agent <b>40</b> are then mixed with the quartz grit and glass grit <b>16</b>. As a final step of the wet mixture <b>36</b> process, the filler quartz <b>14</b> may then be added and mixed perfectly until the wet mixture reaches a complete homogeneity of wetness as is desirable for the mold process <b>42</b>. The filler quartz <b>14</b> may form 30-35% by weight of the composite structure.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">More specifically, the steps of producing the dry mixture <b>18</b> and subsequent wet mixture <b>36</b> may proceed as follows and may be performed using a Fournier mixer, for example. First, to produce the dry mixture <b>18</b>, one or more sizes of quartz grit <b>12</b> and glass grit <b>16</b> may be added, preferably beginning with larger sizes grit and proceeding to smaller size grit. For example, in a Step <b>1</b>, a 40-70 mesh grit may be added to the mix at a feeding speed of 8 Hz, and thereafter, in a Step <b>1</b>A, a 70-120 mesh grit may be mixed in at a feeding speed of 8 Hz. At each such stage, mixing may be performed for 2 minutes at a mixing speed may of 15 to 20 Hz, for example. The dry mixing may allow homogenization of the different particle sizes of mineral aggregates. These steps (Steps <b>1</b> and <b>1</b>A) may also make it possible to ensure good dispersion of dry powder colors (e.g., pigment color powder <b>17</b>), making it possible to determine the color of the product.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">After Steps <b>1</b> and <b>1</b>A, the wet mixture <b>36</b> may be produced. For example, in a Step <b>2</b>, a Polyester resin (PER) may be mixed in so that each of the quartz/glass aggregates is well coated with resin over its entire microscopic surface, allowing optimum adhesion to be obtained during the subsequent Steps <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. The wet mixing step may have a feeding speed of 8 Hz and a mixing speed of 15-20 Hz for 2 minutes, for example. The process may then continue with a Step <b>3</b> of mixing in microparticle filler (e.g., alumina, typically 400 to 800 mesh), which may be fed at 8 Hz and mixed at 15-20 Hz for 1 minute, for example. This step may fill the microcavities of the mineral aggregate crystals used in the recipe, facilitating ultra-compaction during the later pressing cycle. With Step <b>3</b> serving as a preliminary step before the addition of 45-micron powder, the process may continue with Step <b>4</b>, in which 45-micron filler (e.g., filler quartz <b>14</b>) is mixed in, for example, at a feeding speed of 8 Hz and mixing speed of 15-20 Hz for 1 minute. Step <b>4</b> may be the last step in the sequence of mixing the different ingredients of the product. The mixture and its homogenization with the PER make it possible to eliminate any form of voids during the subsequent pressing of the mixture by vibro-compaction under vacuum. The mixing may provide motivation for the aggregate to migrate and align into a closely packed environment, with the smaller alumina or other microparticles filling the void between the glass and quartz in the mix. The vibrator force combined with an ultra-homogenization of the ingredients allows the product to obtain high performance physical properties once the polymerization is complete. Lastly, in a Step <b>5</b>, a final mixing stage may make it possible to standardize the wetness of the mixture before the pressing stage. The high velocity of the mixer at this stage (e.g., 35 Hz for 1 minute, followed by inverted rotation mixing at 45 Hz for 1 minute) ensures that the powder microparticles are well bound to the mineral aggregate crystals.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As noted above, the dry mixture <b>18</b> may be formed by mixing the glass grit <b>16</b>, the quartz grit <b>12</b>, and inorganic or organic pigment color powder <b>17</b> to form the desired dry mixture <b>18</b> before the step of preparing the wet mixture <b>36</b>. The wet mixture <b>36</b> may be formed by adding the aforementioned resin <b>38</b>, along with a coupling agent <b>40</b>, to the dry mixture <b>18</b>. The resin <b>38</b> used in forming the quartz slab <b>10</b> may be polyester orthophthalic unsaturated resin, although other resins known in the art may also be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The coupling agent <b>40</b> may be a silane coupling agent and may be 1.0-2 percent by weight of the composite structure. The coupling agent <b>40</b> binds the inorganic materials ((filler quartz <b>14</b>, quartz grit <b>12</b>, glass grit <b>16</b> and organic matter (resin <b>38</b>)) and increases the flexural and impact strength of the quartz slab <b>10</b> or other end product. An exemplary silane coupling agent is XIAMETER&#xae;OFS-6030 silane, which may be used to improve adhesive of free radical cured resins, although other coupling agents <b>40</b> known in the art may also be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">After pouring the wet mixture <b>36</b> in a mold <b>42</b> having a cavity in the size and shape corresponding to a rough out of the final quartz/glass blend slab <b>10</b> or other product, the wet mixture <b>36</b> may be compacted and vibrated under vacuum in the mold <b>42</b> to remove entrained air from the wet mixture <b>36</b>. Aggregates have low internal friction and move closer together within the layer under less compaction energy. This is one of the features to obtain excellent physical properties as described below. Cubic and conical shape glass aggregates have low internal friction and move close together within the aggregate mix to become closely packed. Alternatively, or in addition, the structure may be placed in an oven <b>44</b> at 85-90 degrees C. to initiate the polymerization of the resin/filler paste in order for the quartz/glass blend slab <b>10</b> to reach optimum physical properties. The end product of the above steps is an unfinished slab <b>46</b>, which can then be calibrated (e.g. ground) and polished to produce the finished quartz/glass blend slab <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It should be noted that the 400-800 mesh microparticle is smaller than the filler quartz powder (e.g., 325 mesh powder). The microparticle fills the voids between the grit and some of the microporosity in the glass so that there is less void volume. The grit becomes more &#x201c;highly compacted&#x201d;. This also reduces the resin needed and improves the efficiency of the vibration compaction vacuum process. 325-mesh powder (45-micron powder) may be mixed with the resin to form the wet mix. The resin/powder mix binds the particles when the resin polymerizes during the oven heating process. By using the 400-800 mesh microparticles with the resin, these microparticles help to fill the voids after the dry mixing of the aggregate. The quartz powder is then added to the wet mix and it flows through the aggregate in the final mixing. The wet mix is then pressed &#x26; vibrated to fill the voids and the air in remaining voids is removed with the vacuum.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As noted above, specific natural mineral components (e.g. quartz, feldspar, bauxite, nano-glass, etc.) may be added in order to provide the aesthetics of specific natural stones. Such mineral components may be added to the wet mixture <b>36</b> for example, either before or after the wet mixture <b>36</b> is placed in the mold <b>42</b>. It is also contemplated that such mineral components may be added to the dry mixture <b>18</b>. The natural mineral components, which may include the quartz grit <b>12</b> and filler quartz powder <b>14</b>, may be greater than 30% by weight of the composite structure, and the resulting finished quartz slab <b>10</b> may constitute agglomerated stone or a crystalline glass slab for purposes of U.S. Customs and Border Protection classification (depending on whether an all-glass aggregate plus filler quartz powder or a quartz-glass aggregate is used).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In order to produce decorative veins and other aesthetic features in the finished quartz slab <b>10</b>, pieces of previously manufactured finished quartz slabs <b>10</b> may be fed back into the manufacturing process as decorative chips <b>48</b>. For example, unused pieces derived from scraps and/or discarded slabs <b>10</b> may be crushed and formed into decorative chips <b>48</b> that may be about 1 centimeter or greater in length (e.g. 1.0-2.0 cm). With the wet mixture <b>36</b> having been poured in the mold <b>42</b>, the decorative chips <b>48</b> may then be dispersed (e.g. by hand) on the surface of the wet mixture <b>36</b> to form veins or other arrangements of the decorative chips <b>48</b>. The dispersing the decorative chips <b>48</b>, the wet mixture <b>36</b> may be compacted and vibrated under vacuum in the mold <b>42</b> to remove air from the wet mixture <b>36</b> and/or the structure may be placed in an oven <b>44</b> as described above. Compaction may be achieved, for example, with the use of a vacuum vibration press (&#x201c;VVP&#x201d;) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,221,190, the entire disclosure of which is hereby wholly incorporated by reference. The resulting unfinished slab <b>46</b> may then be calibrated (e.g. ground) and polished to produce the finished quartz/glass blend slab <b>10</b> with the arrangement of decorative chips <b>48</b> on the surface thereof. In this way, the decorative chips <b>48</b> may be used to simulate the appearance of calcite crystals and other mineral deposits in natural stone in the finished quartz slab <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Instead of or in addition to the decorative chips <b>48</b> being derived from previously finished quartz slabs <b>10</b>, the decorative chips <b>48</b> may be glass chips derived from product glass <b>28</b>. By dispersing decorative chips <b>48</b> of glass that are greater than one centimeter (e.g. 1.0-2.0 cm) at their largest dimension on the surface of the wet mixture <b>36</b> while it is in the mold <b>42</b>, the finished quartz slab <b>10</b> may be made in a way that results in a categorization as an agglomerated stone slab or a glass slab for purposes of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (depending if the composite grit is made with all glass components). It is contemplated that the finished slabs <b>10</b> may have these features as well. For example, a sufficiently large quantity of crushed glass <b>16</b> that is 0.2 mm or larger and therefore visible may be produced by a 70 mesh screen and added to the dry mixture <b>18</b> as described above.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Alternatively, or in addition, wet mixture pieces (e.g. balls) may be produced from the majority glass wet mix <b>36</b>, including pigment additives <b>17</b>, to be used to decorate subsequently produced wet mixtures <b>36</b> in the mold <b>42</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, wet mixture balls <b>37</b> may be removed from the wet mixture <b>36</b> and thereafter incorporated into the wet mixture <b>36</b> of a batch having different color or other properties.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The decorative chips <b>48</b> and/or wet mixture pieces <b>37</b> (e.g. greater than 1 cm in width) may be used to expand the design flexibility for providing the aesthetics of natural stones. Decorative chips <b>48</b> produced from slab pieces may be placed in the slab veins to simulate calcite crystals in white marble designs. In some cases, the slab veins may be produced by a stamp or roller prior to placing the decorative chips <b>48</b>. Glass chips of greater than 1 cm in width crushed from glass trim may be used to simulate quartz crystals in large grain designs. Majority glass wet mixture pieces <b>37</b> (e.g. balls) produced from the wet mixture raw materials and pigment powder may be dispersed on the surface of the wet mixture to provide decorative accent chips in concrete and limestone designs. It is also contemplated that the wet mixture pieces <b>37</b> may be placed in the bottom of the mold <b>42</b> prior to filling the mold <b>42</b> with the wet mixture <b>36</b>. As the wet mixture <b>36</b> is compacted and vibrated in the mold <b>42</b>, the wet mixture pieces <b>37</b> may spread out in the wet mixture <b>36</b> without mixing in completely, thus producing the desired localized design elements.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The final quartz/glass blend slab <b>10</b> may have a thickness of, for example, 1.2-1.5 cm. Such a thickness may provide a number of properties. For example, a 1.2 cm thick quartz/glass blend slab <b>10</b> may have a flex strength greater than 120 MPA (dry) per the ASTM C880 standard. The ASTM C880 test method covers a procedure for determining the flexural strength of stone by use of a simple beam using quarter-point loading. When testing in a dry condition, specimens are placed in an oven for at least 48 hours at 140 degrees Fahrenheit until three successive hourly weight measurements give the same value. Alternatively, specimens can be tested in a wet condition by immersing the specimens in water for 48 hours at room temperature. Upon completion of conditioning, each specimen is placed onto the testing machine and the quarter point loading blocks are brought into contact with the specimen. A load is applied at a constant stress rate of 600 psi/min until failure is observed and the maximum load is recorded.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The 1.2 cm thick quartz/glass blend slab <b>10</b> may have an impact resistance of greater than 40 J/m on an ASTM D256 standard Izod impact test. The ASTM D256 test is a pendulum impact test that indicates the energy to break standard test specimens of specified size under stipulated parameters of specimen mounting (using an un-notch sample) and pendulum velocity-at-impact.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The 1.2 cm thick quartz/glass blend slab <b>10</b> may have a breaking strength of greater than 1300 lbf. in an ASTM C648 test and a 2 cm thick quartz/glass blend slab <b>10</b> may have a breaking strength of greater than 4100 lbf. The ASTM C648 test method provides means for establishing whether or not a lot of ceramic tile meets the strength requirements which may appear in tile specifications. Tile strength is the force in pounds-force (or newtons), as read from a pressure gauge, necessary to cause the tile to break. In the ASTM C648 test, the tile is loaded into a three-point support and the load applicator is positioned directly in the center of the tile. Force is applied to the test specimen at a constant rate until the tile breaks into two or more pieces.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition, the finished quartz/glass blend slab <b>10</b> may have various qualitative features. For example, the finished quartz/glass blend slab <b>10</b> may be translucent, either through the veining, or through other portions of the slab. The translucency allows for at least some portion of light from a light source placed on one side of the quartz/glass blend slab <b>10</b> to be visible on the other side. This property may be utilized in installations where lighting is placed under a slab being used as a countertop. The light then shows through to a top of the countertop, where it is visible to a user.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Obtaining good flex and impact strength for the glass/quartz composite structure requires a highly compacted 1.2-1.5 cm slab <b>10</b> or other product where the glass grit shapes interlock well with the quartz shapes and are bound together with the resin <b>38</b>. The silane or other coupling agent <b>40</b> helps the resin <b>38</b> to link the organic material with the inorganic material. Because the glass has more micro-porosity than quartz aggregates, it allows some absorption of the resin/filler paste into the glass. In the recipe preparation, unit-weight preferably measures the volume that the graded aggregate quartz and glass and the voids between them will occupy in the resin/filler paste. A technique of void volume calculation may be used to perfectly balance the % volume of aggregates and % volume of resin/filler paste used. The impact crushing of the glass to produce the desired cubic and/or conical shapes is highly important in forming the tight interlock achieved with the compacting press. In the process, the resin/filler paste tends to bond more effectively with rough-surfaced aggregates such as glass, and rough-surfaced particles provide more area to which the filler/resin paste can bond.

After crushing the glass <b>50</b> or quartz <b>51</b> aggregates in the cone or jaw crusher <b>60</b>, the resulting particle size glass <b>50</b> or quartz <b>51</b> aggregates are transferred to a dryer unit <b>63</b> before being introduced into a VSI (Vertical Shaft Impact) crusher <b>64</b> for a second crushing step.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">The VSI crusher <b>64</b> can provide cube shaped aggregate with less dust than a ball mill crusher. The VSI crusher <b>64</b> provides for the particles to impact themselves and produces cube shaped particles with less internal cracks and fissures and with less waste than the ball mill crusher. The ball mill crusher produces spherical and round particles but generates more dust and the potential for cracks and fissures in the glass grit which may reduce the tensile strength of the glass grit. The air circulation within the VSI crusher <b>64</b> maintains a low level of fine dust produced, which may be less than 20% of the smallest sieved fraction for each particle size of glass <b>50</b> or quartz <b>51</b> aggregate.
