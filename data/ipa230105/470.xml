Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an ultrasound diagnostic apparatus, which performs polarization processing on a plurality of ultrasound transducers that an ultrasound endoscope comprises, and an operation method of an ultrasound diagnostic apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As an ultrasound diagnostic apparatus for the purpose of biliary-pancreatic observation using the transgastrointestinal tract, an ultrasound endoscope in which an ultrasound observation portion is provided at the distal end portion of an endoscope is used. Such an ultrasound diagnostic apparatus acquires an ultrasound image of the inside of a body cavity of a subject by transmitting and receiving ultrasound waves by driving a plurality of ultrasound transducers inside the body cavity of the subject. In the ultrasound diagnostic apparatus, it is necessary to avoid a reduction in sensitivity in a state in which the ultrasound diagnostic apparatus is placed inside the body cavity of the subject.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the ultrasound diagnostic apparatus, the plurality of ultrasound transducers are, for example, single crystal transducers that are piezoelectric elements, and are usually used in a polarized state. The ultrasound transducer that is a single crystal transducer can receive ultrasound waves with high sensitivity, but a depolarization phenomenon in which the degree of polarization decreases as the driving time increases may occur. In a case where a depolarization phenomenon occurs, the reception sensitivity of the ultrasound transducer decreases, which may affect the image quality of the ultrasound image. For this reason, as a measure against depolarization of the single crystal transducer, restoring the sensitivity by performing repolarization processing (hereinafter, also simply referred to as polarization processing) is also known.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The risk of depolarization is correlated with the thickness of the transducer, that is, the resonance frequency of the transducer. The risk decreases as the thickness of the transducer increases (as the frequency of the transducer decreases). For this reason, the risk of depolarization is avoided by using a transducer using a single crystal transducer for body surface in a low frequency band of 1 MHz to 6 MHz (refer to JP2013-005137A (JP5874208B)).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, in the case of transmitting and receiving ultrasound waves by driving each ultrasound transducer inside the body cavity of the subject, since it is necessary to set the frequency of the ultrasound wave to a high frequency band of 7 MHz to 8 MHz level, a transducer having a relatively small thickness is used. However, as the thickness of the transducer decreases, the risk of occurrence of a depolarization phenomenon increases. Therefore, in the case of a thin transducer, a process of repolarization is required (refer to JP2017-143353A and JP6158017B).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For this reason, techniques for countermeasures against depolarization in the ultrasound diagnostic apparatus have been developed so far. For example, an ultrasound sensor as a piezoelectric sensor apparatus described in JP2013-005137A (JP5874208B) has a piezoelectric element having a piezoelectric body and a pair of electrodes interposing the piezoelectric body therebetween, a detection circuit for performing detection processing for detecting a detection signal output from the piezoelectric element, and a dedicated polarization processing circuit for performing polarization processing by applying a polarization voltage to the piezoelectric element. In the ultrasound sensor described in JP2013-005137A (JP5874208B) having such a configuration, it is possible to restore polarization by detecting depolarization from a difference in characteristics between the piezoelectric elements using the detection circuit and performing polarization processing using the dedicated polarization processing circuit. The polarization processing is performed at a timing at which the electric power is supplied, a timing at which a request signal for executing detection processing is input (each reception timing), or a timing at which a predetermined standby transition time has passed after the end of detection processing, for example. Therefore, even in a case where a depolarization phenomenon occurs in the piezoelectric element, the piezoelectric element can be polarized again. As a result, it is possible to maintain the reception sensitivity of the piezoelectric element.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As another example, the ultrasound sensor described in JP2017-143353A has a piezoelectric element and a driving circuit for driving the piezoelectric element. The driving circuit drives the piezoelectric element with a driving waveform having a first step of maintaining the polarization of the piezoelectric element with a first potential V1, a second step of transmitting an ultrasound wave to the piezoelectric element by applying a maximum potential VH and a minimum potential VL at least once, a third step of causing the piezoelectric element to stand by at a second potential V2, a fourth step of increasing the second potential V2 to a third potential V3, a fifth step of maintaining the third potential V3 while the piezoelectric element receives an ultrasound wave, and a sixth step of returning the third potential V3 to the first potential V1. In the ultrasound diagnostic apparatus described in JP2017-143353A having such a configuration, it is possible to drive the piezoelectric element while maintaining the polarization of the piezoelectric element by driving the piezoelectric element with the driving waveform having the above-described six steps. That is, JP2017-143353A describes that depolarization is prevented by studying the waveform for driving the piezoelectric element.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The ultrasound apparatus described in JP6158017B has an ultrasound transducer for transmitting and receiving ultrasound waves to and from a subject and a transmission and reception circuit comprising a power supply circuit, a transmission pulse output unit, a heating pulse output unit, a polarization voltage output unit, a reception beam former, and a polarization controller, or an integrated circuit further comprising a temperature detection unit in addition to the transmission and reception circuit.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the ultrasound apparatus described in JP6158017B, the heating pulse output unit and the polarization voltage output unit are provided separately from the transmission pulse output unit. By outputting the polarization voltage of a necessary DC voltage from the polarization voltage output unit to the ultrasound transducer in a state in which the heating pulse from the heating pulse output unit is output to the ultrasound transducer to heat the ultrasound transducer, the ultrasound transducer is polarized. The technique described in JP6158017B can make the polarization voltage, which is higher than the voltage of the transmission pulse output from the transmission pulse output unit to the ultrasound transducer in order to transmit an ultrasound wave at the room temperature, lower than that at the room temperature by heating the ultrasound transducer.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As described above, in the ultrasound sensor and the ultrasound apparatus described in JP2013-005137A (JP5874208B), JP2017-143353A, and JP6158017B, it is possible to restore or maintain the polarization of the ultrasound transducer and the piezoelectric element formed of a piezoelectric body.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, as in the ultrasound sensor described in JP2013-005137A (JP5874208B), providing a dedicated circuit for performing repolarization, a depolarization detection mechanism, and the like is a large hardware change factor. Accordingly, there is a problem that it is very difficult to mount those described above in the existing system.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the ultrasound sensor described in JP2017-143353A, in order to prevent depolarization and maintain polarization, the pulse length of the driving waveform is increased by inserting a DC component into each driving waveform. Accordingly, there is a problem that the frame rate is reduced to affect the image quality of the ultrasound image. In addition, in order to prevent depolarization using such a driving waveform, there is a problem that there is a tradeoff between the image quality and the risk of depolarization.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the ultrasound apparatus described in JP6158017B, repolarization can be performed only by the ultrasound apparatus. However, since a transmission pulse, a heating pulse, and a polarization voltage that is a DC voltage are output by the same integrated circuit or the same transmission and reception circuit, there is a problem that the circuit size increases to cause a cost increase.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, in the ultrasound apparatus described in JP6158017B, it is necessary to heat the ultrasound transducer. However, in a case where this is applied to an ultrasound endoscope used within the body cavity of the subject, there is a problem that heating during the endoscope examination causes an increase in the temperature of a distal end of a probe, which is not preferable.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is an object of the invention to provide an ultrasound diagnostic apparatus and an operation method of an ultrasound diagnostic apparatus capable of performing polarization processing of ultrasound transducers using an existing transmission circuit for transmitting a transmission signal to ultrasound transducers of an ultrasound endoscope, in a non-diagnosis time different from a time for acquiring an ultrasound image, without affecting the image quality of the ultrasound image and without causing a significant change in the circuit configuration and an increase in the circuit size by solving the aforementioned problems in the related art.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In order to achieve the aforementioned object, an ultrasound diagnostic apparatus according to a first aspect of the invention is an ultrasound diagnostic apparatus acquiring an ultrasound image and an endoscope image.

In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, for example, at a sensitivity level of &#x2212;20 dB or more, the probe frequency band for acquiring an ultrasound image is about 2.7 MHz to about 11.7 MHz as shown by the broken line, while the band of the main lobe of the driving waveform of the polarization driving pulse shown by the solid line is about 2.3 MHz or less. That is, the band characteristic of the frequency of the polarization driving pulse and the band characteristic of the frequency of the diagnostic driving pulse do not overlap each other at a sensitivity level of &#x2212;20 dB or more.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">That is, in the invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, in the driving waveform of the polarization driving pulse, it is preferable that the frequency band of the main lobe and the probe frequency band shown by the broken line do not overlap each other at a sensitivity level of &#x2212;20 dB or more. In addition, it is preferable that the frequency band of the main lobe is lower than the probe frequency band at a sensitivity level of &#x2212;20 dB or more. The reason is that, in the polarization processing, it is necessary to reduce an influence on the ultrasound image by preventing excessive ultrasound wave output and to reduce an influence on the body cavity of the subject due to temperature rise by preventing the temperature rise. In particular, the upper limit temperature of the distal end portion of the ultrasound endoscope <b>12</b> inserted into the body cavity of the subject is strictly limited so as not to affect the body cavity and the like, and it is necessary to prevent the temperature rise.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">In the invention, since the polarization driving pulse (main lobe) is transmitted outside the probe frequency band, the energy input to the ultrasound transducer <b>48</b> is reduced. Therefore, the temperature rise can be suppressed. In addition, since the outside of the probe frequency band is the outside of a resonance band in which the ultrasound transducer <b>48</b> resonates.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, it is preferable that all the maximum sensitivities of the side lobes within the probe frequency band are equal to or less than &#x2212;10 dB and the average sensitivity of the side lobes is equal to or less than &#x2212;20 dB. The reason is as follows.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">In general, the specification of the frequency characteristic of the probe is expressed in the &#x2212;20 dB band of the transmission and reception sensitivity. This is because the signal of 1/10 or less from the peak of the sensitivity hardly affects an image. On the other hand, the band of the transmission wave is different from that in the case of the probe. Since only a transmission portion is taken into consideration, the level of 20 dB/2=10 dB is the threshold value. For this reason, &#x2212;10 dB is more preferable in a case where a transmission component is considered.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">In the invention, the driving waveform of the polarization driving pulse is not particularly limited, and may be a bipolar waveform shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>. However, the driving waveform of the polarization driving pulse is preferably a unipolar waveform as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>.
