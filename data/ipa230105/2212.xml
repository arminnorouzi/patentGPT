Crosstalk is an issue often faced by MUTs.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In MEMS devices, use of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates has become more common. SOI wafers enable the manufacture of the most advanced MEMS, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS), power, and radio frequency (RF) components used in consumer, automotive, industrial, and healthcare applications. SOI wafers provide high-quality, single-crystalline silicon layers over a high-quality silicon dioxide layer (buried oxide or BOX) which can be used in the design of several MEMS devices. SOI wafers provide precise control of several material parameters which enable design and manufacture of unique device configurations.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Despite these advantages, conventional SOI wafer technology runs into challenges where precise control of geometries is needed for advanced MEMS devices which need three-dimensional (3D) vertical integration with CMOS circuitry. These challenges have been mitigated by using double-SOI technology, which layers two SOI substrates.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Double SOI technology may also improve the functionalities of various microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices, such as micromachined ultrasonic transducers (MUTs), including piezoelectric MUTs (pMUTs) and capacitive MUTs (cMUTs). Use of double SOI technology may enable designers with more flexibility to size and position cavities (or waveguides) and trenches for etching in the devices' buried oxide (BOX) and semiconductor layers. Thus, a double SOI design may improve acoustic wave transmission (e.g., by increasing wave output power) and reduce crosstalk.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, the multi-SOI process disclosed herein may enable better critical dimension control during the process of etching trenches and cavities in the MUT device, enhancing design flexibility.

In specific embodiments disclosed herein, the multi-SOI structure is a double-SOI structure.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The multi-SOI structure disclosed may confer many benefits to MUT array designers. The depth of the device, resulting from adding additional SOI layers, enables buried cavities and trenches to be etched to be longer than in single-SOI structures. The disclosed system can enable designers to have flexibility when choosing where to place trenches and how large to make the cavities and trenches in MEMs devices and arrays. This flexibility can enable enhanced ability for a MEMS MUT array to increase the output power of a generated acoustic signal for deep penetration into a subject, and to mitigate the effects of crosstalk from interfacial waves traveling through the array's silicon substrate.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Increasing the output power can be performed through the etching of buried cavities, or waveguides, in the multi-SOI substrate. The cavities may be etched so that they span multiple layers of the multi-SOI substrate. The methods disclosed herein for multi-SOI MEMS device manufacturing may enable precise control of the thickness and depth of the cavities, through multiple iterations of etching and masking. To keep the edges of cavities pristine, a layer of oxide may be applied to the cavity. The oxide may be applied by thermally growing the oxide or depositing it (e.g., by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD)).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">To mitigate the effects of crosstalk, a designer may place buried trenches at various locations within the multi-SOI substrate. A trench may introduce an impedance mismatch between the substrate of the MEMS device and whatever material is within the cross-talk trench. This impedance mismatch can disrupt cross-talk waves through attenuation, reflection, and scattering. Designers may etch trenches to various depths and at various locations near cavities. In many cases, the pattern of trenches etched need not be uniform across a MEMS device (e.g., MUT) array.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The disclosed system may enable electronic devices to communicate with one another using a through-silicon via (TSV). A TSV may be a vertical conducting structure to connect multiple silicon dice stacked vertically in a single package. Using a multiple-SOI system, a designer may be able to produce vertical electrical connections capable of connecting many devices. Using a TSV may increase interconnect and device density, shortening connections between devices, thus reducing electrical losses. A TSV may be encoded in the multi-SOI substrate from the top layer of the device to the bottom layer. For example, one may form a recess in the multi-SOI substrate, using a mask to define the width of the recess. Then, one may etch (e.g., by an anisotropic process), the recess where it is defined in the substrate. One may then fill the recess with a conducting material, such as a metal, metal alloy, or conductive ceramic compound, such as TiN or doped semiconductor or semiconductor alloys.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The multi-SOI process disclosed herein may enable better critical dimension control during the process of etching trenches and cavities in the MUT device, enhancing design flexibility. Additionally, the multi-SOI process may provide more precise alignment tolerances, mitigating effects from alignment errors. For example, the multi-SOI process may reduce tolerances necessary to compensate for alignment errors from on the order of 10 micrometers (&#x3bc;m) to on the order of 3 &#x3bc;m. Cavities and trenches in the multi-SOI structure may be etched from the top of an SOI layer, rather than from the bottom, as SOI structures are commonly etched. This may prevent the formation of artifacts, such as tapers, from the etching process.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Certain Definitions</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Unless otherwise defined, all technical terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.

In this embodiment, the device is a pMUT device. In other embodiments, multi-SOI MEMS devices may have 3, 4, 5, 6, or 10 or more SOI layers. Although the semiconductor used in the embodiment is silicon, in other embodiments, the semiconductor material may be germanium, silicon-germanium, carbon-doped silicon, carbon-doped silicon-germanium, or another material.

The conducting layers may comprise electrodes, which may be made of multiple layers comprising SRO (SrRuO<sub>3</sub>), titanium, and platinum. When a voltage is applied to the conducting layers, the piezoelectric layer can become stressed. This stressing may actuate a membrane below the piezoelectric and conducting layers to create an acoustic output wave. The piezoelectric layer may be made of a piezoelectric material such as PZT, KNN, PZT-N, PMN-Pt, AlN, Sc&#x2014;AlN, ZnO, PVDF, and LiNiO3. The thicknesses of the piezoelectric layer may vary between 100 nm and 5 &#x3bc;m or possibly more.

The insulating layer may be an oxide layer, which may be referred to as a buried oxide layer (BOX). However, the insulating layer may also be composed of a non-oxide insulator, such as sapphire. The insulating layer may serve to reduce parasitic capacitance in the MEMS device by physically separating conducting layers from one another, preventing them from accumulating electric charge.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The silicon membrane layer may facilitate the transmission and receipt of acoustic waves by the pMUT transducer. The transducer may transmit an acoustic wave when the piezoelectric layer is stressed, actuating the silicon membrane layer. When a reflected wave is incident on the transducer, it may provide pressure to the membrane layer, which can induce a change in charge in the piezoelectric layer.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The silicon membrane layer may be bonded to the insulating layer using silicon direct or fusion bonding. In another example, the silicon and oxide layers may be bonded using the following method: a silicon wafer may be oxidized and then implanted with an etch stop layer. Then, the oxidized layer may be bonded to a silicon wafer beneath it. Then, the bonded layers may be annealed. The silicon wafer may be polished and etched down to the etch stop layer. Finally, the etch stop layer may be removed and the top silicon layer further polished.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The first SOI layer <b>540</b> may comprise a silicon layer disposed above an insulating layer, itself disposed above a silicon substrate.

For example, the cavity may be etched to a depth spanning the semiconducting layer and insulating layers, as well as cutting into the silicon substrate to a depth. A designer may also modify the width of the cavity. Modifying the depth and width of the cavity <b>550</b> may serve to shape the output wave produced by the transducer, to provide for better penetration into the acoustic medium. Increasing the number of layers of the multi-SOI devices can increase the depth to which the cavity <b>550</b> may be etched. In some embodiments, the cavity <b>550</b> may be in a vacuum, but in other embodiments, the cavity may be filled with a gas at a predetermined pressure.

Take the generalized example of a MUT array in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. In this case, the MUTs are represented by the movable diaphragms <b>101</b><i>a</i>, <b>101</b><i>b</i>, <b>101</b><i>c </i>which are formed in or on top of the substrate <b>100</b> by cavities <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, and <b>120</b><i>c</i>. The diaphragms <b>101</b><i>a</i>, <b>101</b><i>b</i>, <b>101</b><i>c </i>are coupled acoustically to the semi-infinite acoustic medium <b>200</b> at an interface <b>110</b>. The acoustic medium <b>200</b> can be any substance, or a plurality of substances; common media include air, water, tissue, electrolytic gel, metal, silicone rubbers used as matching layers to the body, etc.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">During operation, the diaphragms <b>101</b><i>a</i>-<b>101</b><i>c </i>are excited into motion, primarily in the z-direction. The excitation is generally created by a piezoelectric effect (for piezoelectric MUTs (pMUTs)) or a capacitive effect (for capacitive MUTs (cMUTs)). In both cases, the motion of the diaphragm creates pressure waves that transmit into the acoustic medium <b>200</b>. However, the diaphragm motion also creates unwanted waves outside the acoustic medium <b>200</b>. The most common unwanted waves are elastic compression waves that travel within and through the substrate <b>100</b>, and interfacial waves that travel along the interface <b>110</b> between the substrate <b>100</b> and the acoustic medium <b>200</b>, as well as other interfaces attached to the substrate <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">All energy radiated outside the acoustic medium <b>200</b> is generally unwanted. Not only is it wasted power, but it can interfere with the MUT's functioning. For example, in medical imaging, the elastic compression waves will rebound off other surfaces and cause artifacts such as a static image over the medically relevant image formed from the reflected energy from the acoustic medium <b>200</b>. As another example, the interfacial waves that travel along the interface <b>110</b> will create cross-talk in medical imaging, creating a spot-lighting effect and unwanted ghost images.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">A generalized example of a MUT array <b>210</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.

The first SOI layer may comprise a first silicon layer, a buried oxide layer, and a second silicon layer, with the first silicon layer and second silicon layer typically being single-crystal silicon. An oxide layer (typically silicon dioxide) may be deposited over the first silicon layer.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">(b) A cavity and one or more cross-talk trenches may be patterned and etched in the first SOI layer to form a &#x201c;handle&#x201d; wafer. The trench etch may comprise four steps: (1) etching the oxide layer, (2) etching the first silicon layer via DRIE, (3) etching the BOX (typically via dry RIE etching, or in some cases, via wet etching), and (4) etching the second silicon layer via DRIE to the desired depth. Following etching, an oxide layer may be deposited above the cavity and the trenches and may serve to narrow the trench if desired. A second SOI &#x201c;device&#x201d; wafer may then be fusion bonded to the &#x201c;handle&#x201d; to form the buried trenches and cavity in the double-SOI substrate. The &#x201c;device&#x201d; wafer may form the second SOI layer of the double-SOI substrate, with the first silicon layer of the first SOI layer forming the second silicon layer of the second SOI layer.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">Most SOI wafers are silicon, meaning that the silicon layers of the &#x201c;device&#x201d; and &#x201c;handle&#x201d; wafers will typically be single crystal silicon. The insulator BOX, in this case, is typically a silicon dioxide thermally grown. A silicon SOI wafer with single crystal silicon handle and device layers with an oxide BOX may typically be used. The device layer may be 5 &#x3bc;m, but typically varies between 100 nm and 100 &#x3bc;m, while the handle layer thickness typically varies between 100 &#x3bc;m and 1000 &#x3bc;m.

Typically, this is a combination of films that adhere to the substrate, prevent diffusion of the piezoelectric, aid the piezoelectric in structured deposition/growth, and which is conductive. SRO (SrRuO<sub>3</sub>) may be used for structured film growth, on top of Pt for a diffusion barrier and conduction, on top of Ti as an adhesive layer (for Pt to SiO<sub>2</sub>). Usually, these layers are thin, less than 200 nm, with some films 10 to 40 nm. Stress, manufacturing, and cost issues will usually limit this stack to less than 1 &#x3bc;m. The conductor (Pt) is typically thicker than the structuring layer (SRO) and adhesion layer (Ti). Other common structuring layers, rather than SRO, include (La0.5Sr0.5)CoO3, (La0.5Sr0.5)MnO3, LaNiO3, RuO2, IrO2, BaPbO3, to name a few. Pt can be replaced with other conductive materials such as Cu, Cr, Ni, Ag, Al, Mo, W, and NiCr. These other materials usually have disadvantages such as poor diffusion barrier, brittleness, or adverse adhesion, and Pt is the most common conductor used. The adhesion layer, Ti, can be replaced with any common adhesion layers such as TiW, TiN, Cr, Ni, Cr, etc.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">(h) A piezoelectric material <b>410</b> can then be deposited.

This second metal layer <b>412</b> may be similar to the first metal layer <b>408</b> and may serve similar purposes. For M2, the same stack as M1 may be used, but in reverse: Ti for adhesion on top of Pt to prevent diffusion on top of SRO for structure.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">(j) The second metal layer or M2 <b>412</b> may then be patterned and etched, stopping on the piezoelectric layer.

In many embodiments for manufacturing cMUTs and pMUTs described herein, any number of ways of etching may be used, and the photoresist is typically stripped after most pattern and etch steps.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">(k) The piezoelectric layer may then be similarly patterned and etched, stopping at the first metal layer or M1 <b>408</b>.

This layer can provide connectivity between M1 and M2 and other connections (e.g., wirebonds, bump bonds, etc.). An RDL can be formed by first adding a dielectric such as oxide, etching vias in the dielectric, depositing a conductor (typically Al), and finally patterning the conductor. Additionally, one might add a passivation layer (typically oxide+nitride) to prevent physical scratches, accidental shorting, and/or moisture ingress.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0092" num="0092">It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art based on the teachings herein that other processes may be used to achieve similar end results.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0000">Method of Manufacture for cMUT with Trenches</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">(a) First, a first SOI layer typically with a first layer of single crystal silicon, a buried oxide layer, and a single crystal silicon substrate, may be provided.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">(b) The first SOI layer may then be thermally oxidized.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">(c) The cavities may be patterned and etched in the oxide to generate a &#x201c;handle&#x201d; wafer.

Initially, the first layer is a 65 &#x3bc;m SOI wafer including a BOX layer of 1 &#x3bc;m. In other embodiments, the SOI wafer may be between 40 and 80 &#x3bc;m, and the BOX layer may be between 1 and 5 &#x3bc;m. The SOI layer has been oxidized. Beneath the SOI wafer is a semiconductor substrate, which may be a &#x201c;handle&#x201d; wafer 300-700 &#x3bc;m thick.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Prior to etching, a photomask may be used to define the cavity. The photomask may define a height and a width of the cavity, or heights and widths of cavities for a MEMS array.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In a first operation <b>710</b>, the cavity may be etched. First, the oxide may be etched, using a wet or a dry etching method. Then, the silicon layer of the SOI wafer may be etched using DRIE etching. The BOX layer may be again etched using a wet or a dry (e.g., ME) etching method. Finally, the silicon substrate may be etched. In this embodiment, the cavity is etched to a depth of 80 &#x3bc;m+/&#x2212;2 &#x3bc;m (65 &#x3bc;m all the way through the first SOI layer and 15 &#x3bc;m into the handle layer).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In a second operation <b>720</b>, after etching the cavity is complete, the cavity may then be oxidized. Oxidation can keep the cavity shape intact, preserving the ability of the cavity to serve as a waveguide. If the oxide is not applied to the cavity, the cavity may have tapered edges instead of straight edges.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In a third operation <b>730</b>, the first SOI layer may be bonded to a 5 &#x3bc;m SOI wafer (which makes up the second SOI layer). The second SOI layer can additionally include an oxide thermally grown or deposited above the silicon layer.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Although the above steps show process <b>700</b> in accordance with many embodiments, a person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize many variations based on the teaching described herein. The steps may be completed in a different order. Steps may be added or omitted. Some of the steps may comprise sub-steps. Many of the steps and sub-steps may be repeated as often as beneficial.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some embodiments, the cavity may not be etched into the semiconductor or silicon layer below the top layer of the device. In some embodiments, the cavity may be etched into the top layer. In other embodiments, particularly in embodiments with more than two layers, a cavity may be etched into a layer lower than the layer just below the top layer of the device.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Variable Cavity and Trench Depth Process</heading><p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a process <b>800</b> for etching cavities and trenches in the &#x201c;handle&#x201d; wafer of a double-SOI substrate.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In a first operation <b>810</b>, the operator defines a trench size. This may be performed by using a photomask to determine a location of the trench on the wafer. The photomask may be configured to define a particular pattern or configuration of trenches throughout the substrate. For example, the locations on the wafer where transducer elements may be placed may be regularly spaced within the mask, but different configurations of trenches may be placed alongside the spaces designated for the transducer elements. Following the masking process, operator may etch the oxide layer of the &#x201c;handle&#x201d; wafer to define the trench. The oxide layer may be dry (e.g., RIE) etched or wet (e.g., hydrofluoric acid (HF)) etched.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In a second operation <b>820</b>, photoresist may be applied to the oxide surface of the wafer, using a spin coating method. The photoresist layer may be a polymeric material sensitive to ultraviolet light. In other embodiments, alternate methods may be used to coat the oxide surface of the wafer, including spraying, roller coating, dip coating, and extrusion coating.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In a third operation <b>830</b>, the photoresist layer may be pattern etched to define a cavity. Pattern etching may be performed by exposing the photoresist layer to ultraviolet light through a mask to obtain the desired pattern. An infrared aligner may align the mask on the wafer to precisely etch the pattern.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In a fourth operation <b>840</b>, the cavity may be partially etched, while the trench opening is still protected by the photoresist layer. Thus, the etching of the cavities and the trenches (which may be etched to different depths), may be controlled separately. Were the photoresist layer not applied, an etchant used to etch the cavity may partially etch the trench as well.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In a fifth operation <b>850</b>, the photoresist may be stripped (e.g., chemically). After the photoresist is stripped, the oxide layer may serve as a hard mask to complete the etching of the trenches and cavities.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The operator may use oxide as a mask to etch the cavity below the BOX layer, and etch the trench. The operator may then deposit an oxide onto the cavity. Applying an oxide to the cavity enables the cavity to have straight edges, rather than tapered edges, enabling better shaping of an acoustic wave.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In MEMS devices with additional layers, an operator may continue to use below oxide layers as masks to etch deeper cavities and trenches.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Although the above steps show process <b>800</b> in accordance with many embodiments, a person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize many variations based on the teaching described herein.
