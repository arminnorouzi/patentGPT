Additionally, when particular features, structures, and/or characteristics are described in connection with one embodiment, it should be understood that such features, structures, and/or characteristics may also be used in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described unless clearly stated to the contrary.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The following detailed description should be read with reference to the drawings in which similar elements in different drawings are numbered the same. The drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, depict illustrative embodiments and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Walls and wall structures may have various designs, may have various dimensions, and may be made from various materials. In some cases, the designs, dimensions, and materials of a wall or wall structure may depend, at least in part, on the purpose of the wall.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Typical walls and wall structures may be provided for various decorative and/or functional purposes. For example, walls and wall structures may be provided for decorative purposes and may include painted artwork, sculpted artwork, wood designs, and/or other decorative features. Further, walls and wall structures may be provided to allow people to see through (e.g., a wall or wall structure including one or more windows), to keep people, animals, weather, and/or objects in or out of a building, to protect occupants of a building, and/or to provide one or more other functional and/or decorative purposes</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some cases, walls or wall structures may be configured to be ballistic resistant. In one example, a wall or wall structure may be provided with a decorative or functional purpose to protect people and things on one side of the wall or wall structure from people, animals, bullets, ballistic material, and/or other uninvited things on another side of the wall or wall structure.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, walls or wall structures may be generally configured in a grid-like pattern or other pattern, where a wall panel may be supported by panel supports. Examples of such walls or wall structures may be storefront wall systems, curtainwall wall systems, and/or other wall systems. Curtainwall wall systems and/or other wall systems may typically comprise a grid-like framework usually made of aluminum or steel transoms (e.g., structures that typically run horizontally) and mullions (e.g., structures that typically run vertically), where the framework typically may be attached to a building structure and may typically receive glazing or window panels and/or non-transparent panels.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some cases, walls or wall structures may be movable to cover and/or provide access to other walls or wall structures, windows, doors, doorways, etc. An example of such a wall structure may be and/or may include a shutter panel, a slider panel, and/or other suitable panels that may be movable to cover and/or protect a window.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Ballistic resistant walls or wall structures may typically include a ballistic resistant wall panel (e.g., a panel of ballistic resistant glass or other panel including ballistic resistant material) surrounded by wall supports or brackets to join adjacent ballistic resistant wall panels. A &#x201c;ballistic resistant&#x201d; thing or material may be defined as a thing or material that provides protection to a person or object positioned behind the thing or material against complete penetration of a projectile (e.g., a bullet or other projectile), passage of fragments or projectiles therethrough, or fragmentation of the thing or material in response to a projectile engaging the thing or material. Example ballistic resistant materials, walls, and wall structures are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 9,976,306, filed on Mar. 31, 2017, and titled WALL SUPPORT STRUCTURES AND SYSTEMS, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The standards set by the current UL 752 may be utilized to determine a level of ballistic resistance for a thing or material (e.g., wall panel, wall support, material thereof, and/or other thing or material). Under the current UL 752 standard, a ballistic resistant thing or material having a protection level of Level 1 will protect against handguns of medium power (e.g., hand guns firing 9 mm full metal copper jacket with lead core ammunition or handguns having a muzzle energy of 380-460 foot pounds or 515-624 Joules), a ballistic resistant thing or material having a protection level of Level 2 will protect against handguns of higher power (e.g., handguns firing 0.357 magnum jacket lead soft point ammunition or handguns having a muzzle energy of 548-663 foot pounds or 743-899 Joules) Joules, a ballistic resistant thing or material having a protection level of level 3 will protect against handguns of super power (e.g., handguns firing 0.4 magnum lead semi-wadcutter gas checked ammunition or having a muzzle energy of 971-1,175 foot pounds or 1,317-1,593 Joules), a ballistic resistant thing or material having a ballistic resistance level of Level 4 will protect against low caliber rifles (e.g., .30 caliber rifle lead core soft point (.30-06 caliber), a ballistic resistant thing or material having a ballistic resistance level of Level 5 will protect against one shot of rifle ammunition (e.g., 7.62 mm rifle lead core full metal copper jacket, military ball (.308 caliber)&#x2014;1 shot), and a ballistic resistant thing or material having a ballistic resistance level of Level 8 will protect against five shots of rifle ammunition (e.g., 7.62 mm rifle lead core full metal copper jacket, military ball (.308 caliber)&#x2014;5 shots). These are just some example levels of ballistic resistance as set by the current UL 752 standard, but the current UL 752 standard has additional levels. Additionally, other standards (e.g., National Institute of Justice Body Armor Classification standards and/or other standards) may be utilized for determining a level of ballistic resistance for a thing or material.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Turning to the Figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a schematic plan view of an illustrative panel system <b>2</b> including a panel <b>10</b>. In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the panel <b>10</b> may be a movable ballistic resistant shutter panel configured to provide movable ballistic resistant protection along a window <b>12</b> in a wall system <b>14</b>. The panel <b>10</b> may be mounted (e.g., secured) to and/or with respect to the wall system <b>14</b> and/or an adjacent ceiling or flooring such that the panel <b>10</b> may be moved behind the window <b>12</b> (e.g., on a safe side of the window <b>12</b>) to secure the window <b>12</b> from an outside attacker. Although the panel <b>10</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as being movable to secure the window <b>12</b> from an outside attacker, the panel <b>10</b> may be mounted adjacent a door/doorway <b>13</b> of the wall system <b>14</b> to secure the door/doorway <b>13</b> from an outside attacker.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The panel <b>10</b> may be mounted so as to be movable in any suitable manner. For example, the panel <b>10</b> may be mounted with one or more mounts that facilitate the panel(s) <b>10</b> being slidably movable, pivotally movable, rotatably movable, linearly movable, and/or movable in any other suitable manner.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the panel <b>10</b> is pivotally mounted via a hinge mount, such that the movable panel <b>10</b> may be rotated about a pivot axis of the hinge. Although the panel <b>10</b> is shown as being pivotable about ninety degrees in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the panel <b>10</b> may be configured to pivot less than ninety degrees or more than ninety degrees. Further, the panel <b>10</b> may be mounted such that the panel <b>10</b> may be stored against a wall of the wall system <b>14</b> when not in use securing a window or door/doorway from an outside attacker and moved (e.g., swung) to a desired position to secure the window or door/doorway from the outside attacker when the attacker is or is anticipated to be present.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some cases, the panel(s) <b>10</b> may be configured, as discussed herein, so as to be quickly and/or easily movable from a closed or non-securing position to an opened or securing position. Further, the panel system <b>2</b> and the panel(s) <b>10</b> thereof may be concealed or designed to fit in with a space, such that an attacker that may be unfamiliar with the space may believe the panel system <b>2</b> and/or the panel(s) <b>10</b> may be regular wall structures and/or functional/decoration features within a space.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The movable panel <b>10</b> may be mounted with any suitable mount <b>15</b> to meet a weight load and/or movement range of the specified panel <b>10</b>. Example mount types include, but are not limited to a hinge, a continuous geared hinge, load bearing ball bearing hinges, slide systems, drawer slide systems, and/or other suitable mount types. In some cases, the panel <b>10</b> may be mounted to the wall via a header type panel that may be attached to the wall before and/or after finishes, such that the header type panel may become the pivot point for the panel <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The panel <b>10</b> may include a lock, such as a floor bolt <b>16</b> and/or a ceiling bolt configured to engage the floor and/or the ceiling, respectively, adjacent the wall system <b>14</b>. The floor bolt <b>16</b> and/or the ceiling bolt may be configured to facilitate the panel <b>10</b> maintaining a set or desired position. In some cases, the floor bolt <b>16</b>, the ceiling bolt, and/or other locking mechanisms may be reinforced and configured to withstand an attack on the panel <b>10</b>. In addition to or as an alternative to the floor bolt <b>16</b> and/or the ceiling bolt, a wall catch or other retention device may be utilized to limit undesired movement of the panel <b>10</b> (e.g., by an attacker). Alternatively or additionally, the panel <b>10</b> may include one or more other suitable locking mechanisms configured to secure panel(s) <b>10</b> at a fully closed position, at a fully opened position, and/or at a position between the fully closed position and the fully opened position.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The foot or base of the panel <b>10</b> may be configured to remain as close to the floor as possible. To facilitate such a configuration and/or for other purposes, the panel <b>10</b> may include a wheel <b>18</b> (e.g., on a safe side of, attacker side of, and/or in the panel <b>10</b>) to allow for easier movement when moving (e.g., swinging, sliding, rotating, etc.) the panel <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Further, in some cases, a wall stiffener <b>20</b> (e.g., a vertical wall stiffener) may be applied to and/or adhered to (e.g., via an adhesive and/or other connector) a wall of the wall system <b>14</b> and the panel <b>10</b> may be secured to the wall system <b>14</b> through the vertical wall stiffener <b>20</b>. In some cases, the wall stiffener <b>20</b> may include a decorative finish and decorative screws and/or other suitable fasteners may be utilized to attach the wall stiffener <b>20</b> to the wall system <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> depict schematic elevation views of illustrative configurations of the panel <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an illustrative wall or door-height configuration of the panel <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an illustrative partial wall or door-height configuration of the panel <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the wall or door-height <b>10</b> is depicted as having a mount <b>15</b> that is a hinge (e.g., a hinge <b>22</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, which may be a continuous hinge, and/or other suitable hinge or mount structure) that runs along a height of the wall or door-height panel <b>10</b>. The continuous hinge may facilitate rotation of the wall or door-height panel <b>10</b> about the hinge <b>22</b> as needed to secure a space behind a window and/or door/doorway.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The movable wall or door-height panel <b>10</b> may have any suitable dimensions. In some cases, the wall or door-height panel <b>10</b> may be configured to extend entirely or approximately entirely between a ceiling and a floor adjacent a wall of a wall system. In one example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the wall or door-height panel <b>10</b> may have a height of ninety-six (96) inches and a width of forty eight (48) inches. In some cases, about 0.5 inches may be left between the panel <b>10</b> and the floor and/or the ceiling, but this is not required. Other suitable dimensions are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the partial wall or door-height configuration of the panel <b>10</b> is depicted as having mount <b>15</b> (e.g., a continuous hinge and/or other suitable mount) that runs along a height of the partial wall or door-height panel <b>10</b>. Although the mount <b>15</b> runs along the height of the partial wall or door-height panel <b>10</b>, the mount <b>15</b> may include one or more mounts and may extend less than the full height of the panel <b>10</b>. The mount <b>15</b> may facilitate rotation of the partial wall or door-height panel <b>10</b> about an axis thereof as needed to secure a space behind a window and/or door/doorway.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The partial wall or door-height panel <b>10</b> may have any suitable dimensions. In some cases, the partial wall or door-height panel <b>10</b> may be configured to extend partially between a ceiling and a floor adjacent a wall of a wall system (e.g., to cover an opening in a wall systems, such as a window and/or other suitable opening). In one example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the wall or door-length panel <b>10</b> may have a height of forty-eight (48) inches and a width of forty-eight (48) inches.
