part such as a semiconductor chip and an LED (Light Emitting Diode) chip on a substrate has been proposed. As the method of electrically connecting a chip part to a substrate, wire bonding connection, NCF bonding using an NCF (Non Conductive Film), ultrasonic bonding, solder bonding, and the like have been known. For example, the following Patent Literature 1 describes a technology for connecting an LED chip to a substrate by wire bonding connection.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0003">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2006-108411</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Incidentally, for example, in the case where a chip part connected to a substrate is defective and electrical conduction cannot be achieved, it is necessary to perform an operation of removing the chip part from the substrate and newly connecting a normal chip part to the substrate (referred to also as repair). However, since the above-mentioned wire bonding connection, NCF bonding, and ultrasonic bonding are irreversible connection methods, a chip part once connected to a substrate cannot be easily removed. If a physical force is applied to a chip part to mechanically remove the chip part in order to remove the chip part from the substrate, there is a possibility that the substrate side is damaged. For this reason, there is a problem that the repair yield is reduced. Further, in the case of solder bonding, a chip part can be removed by reheating the solder to melt the solder. However, since the solder remains on the substrate even after the chip is removed, there is a possibility that the remaining solder deteriorates the repair yield. Further, there is a possibility that the heat during solder bonding is repeatedly applied to the substrate, resulting in a damage to the substrate.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present disclosure to provide an electronic part and a method of producing an electronic part that facilitate the removal of a chip part connected to a substrate.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure is, for example, an electronic part, including:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">a chip part having a first main surface and a second main surface opposite to the first main surface, a wiring portion being derived from the chip part;

For this reason, in the case where the result of the inspection is abnormal (NG), there is a high possibility that the substrate is damaged because it is necessary to peel the adhesive for repairing. Therefore, it is desirable that the chip part is not completely fixed to the substrate at the stage of an electrical inspection. Meanwhile, in the case where the electrical inspection is normal, it is desirable that the chip part is stably fixed to the substrate.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further, in a generally known QFP (Quad Flat Package) package, there is an element in the package and the element is connected to a lead frame via wire bonding to make electrical connection. The size of the chip part increases because it is packaged, and thus, it is desirable that the wiring for making electrical connection is derived from the element itself. Embodiments of the present disclosure made in view of the above viewpoint will be described in detail.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">[Configuration Example of Chip Part]</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a side view of a chip part (chip part <b>1</b>) according to a first embodiment.

The shape of the chip body portion <b>2</b> is, for example, a rectangular parallelepiped shape having a length, a width, and a height of approximately several mm. The shape of the chip body portion <b>2</b> may be any shape such as a columnar shape and prismatic shape. The chip body portion <b>2</b> has an upper surface <b>3</b>A that is an example of a first main surface and a bottom surface <b>3</b>B that is an example of a second main surface.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A wiring portion <b>4</b> is derived (pulled out) from the chip body portion <b>2</b>.

The wiring portion <b>4</b> is, for example, a thin plate-shaped foil having a rectangular shape in a top view.

As shown in Part A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, for example, a downward weight (stress) WE is applied to the upper surface <b>3</b>A of the chip body portion <b>2</b>. When the weight WE is applied, the chip body portion <b>2</b> is displaced downward (direction toward the gap S), a weight is applied to the wiring <b>4</b>A and the wiring <b>4</b>B, and thus, the wiring <b>4</b>A and the wiring <b>4</b>B re cut as shown in Part B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Since the wiring <b>4</b>A and the wiring <b>4</b>B are each in the form of a thin foil, they can be easily cut even with the slight weight WE. The application of the weight WE may be performed mechanically or manually. As described above, in the electronic part according to this embodiment, the wiring <b>4</b>A connected to the pad <b>7</b>A and the wiring <b>4</b>B connected to the pad <b>7</b>B can be cut by applying a weight to the upper surface <b>3</b>A.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The chip part <b>1</b> in which the wiring <b>4</b>A and the wiring <b>4</b>B have been cut is removed from the substrate <b>5</b>.

Therefore, it is possible to easily remove the chip part <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further, since the wiring portion <b>4</b> can be cut by only applying the slight weight WE, it is possible to cut the wiring portion <b>4</b> without a complicated process such as cutting using a laser or the like. It goes without saying that the wiring portion <b>4</b> may be cut using a laser or the like.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, since the bottom surface <b>3</b>B of the chip part <b>1</b> is not fixed to the pad forming surface <b>6</b> of the substrate <b>5</b> at the stage of the electrical inspection, it is possible to remove the chip part <b>1</b> without damaging the substrate <b>5</b> even in the case where the result of the electrical inspection is NG and the chip part <b>1</b> is to be removed. Meanwhile, in the case where the result of the electrical inspection is OK, since also the gap S between the chip body portion <b>2</b> and the substrate <b>5</b> is filled with the resin RE, it is possible to stably fix the chip part <b>1</b> to the substrate <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Further, since the number of pads is set to even multiples of the number of wirings, it is possible to connect, at the time of repair, the wiring portion <b>4</b> of the new chip part <b>1</b> to the pad on which no wiring remains. As a result, it is possible to perform electrically stable connection.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, since it is unnecessary to apply heat when removing the chip part <b>1</b> from the substrate <b>5</b>, the number of times of applying heat can be suppressed even in the case of using solder.
