When a DC-DC converter outputs a large current in the process of converting a voltage, a bulky output inductor is required. In the case of the inductor, since the size is larger than that of other devices, the switch may be driven at a high frequency for miniaturization of the output inductor. In order to reduce the switching loss, a switch such as SiC or GaN may be applied, but there is a disadvantage in that the cost increases compared to the Si MOSFET. Therefore, there is a need for a converter capable of operating an output inductor at a high frequency at a low switching frequency.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Subject</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The technical problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide an isolated DC-DC converter using a Delta-Wye transformer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The problems of the present invention are not limited to the problems mentioned above, and other problems not mentioned will be clearly understood by those skilled in the art from the description below.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to solve the above technical problem, a DC-DC converter according to an embodiment of the present invention comprises: a switch unit that receives a first DC voltage which is to be separated and outputted as three-phase voltages;

DC-DC converters for data centers can usually be manufactured to specifications. For example, the height may be 4 cm, the width may be 7 cm, and the vertical width may vary according to required specifications. Since the size of the inductor among the elements comprising the data center DC-DC converter is larger than that of other elements, the size of the inductor can be reduced by using a DC-DC converter according to an embodiment of the present invention, thereby reducing the overall size of the DC-DC converter. In addition, even if the capacity of the DC-DC converter is increased, it is advantageous to manufacture it according to the standard, so the design freedom of a DC-DC converter can also be increased.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Hereinafter, each configuration of the DC-DC converter <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The switch unit <b>110</b> receives a first DC voltage and separately outputs into three-phase voltages.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">More specifically, the switch unit <b>110</b> may receive a first DC voltage.

When a pair of switches are conducted complementarily, when one switch is shifted from OFF to ON, the other switches are switched from ON to OFF. When the switch is switched from ON to OFF, the voltage value fluctuates rapidly, which can cause large switching losses; the voltage may not be changed from the predetermined voltage corresponding to ON to 0 V immediately; and the voltage may become 0 V only after a predetermined period has elapsed. In particular, when a MOSFET is used as a switch, the switch is turned ON and OFF using the switch gate voltage, even if the gate voltage of the switch is turned off, it takes a certain amount of time for the voltage generated between the drain and the source to become 0 V. As such, when a residual voltage exists, a switching loss may occur, and a switching error may also occur, thereby reducing the efficiency or accuracy of transforming the voltage. In order to reduce such an error, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, when controlling the switch from OFF to ON, a predetermined time interval may be applied until the voltage applied to the other pair of switches becomes 0 V. That is, a dead time is applied in which both switches which are being complementarily conducting for a predetermined time are put to an OFF state. During this dead time, a zero-voltage switching (ZVS) is performed.
