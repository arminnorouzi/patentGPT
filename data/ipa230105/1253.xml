Field of Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an exercise machine and, more particularly, to a loading device for use on an exercise machine.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Related Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">An exercise machine includes a loading device operable to control a load or resistance against a person who exercises with the exercise machine. The loading device can include a spring, a set of weights or a system of levers.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Where a loading device includes a spring, it is impossible for a user to adjust the load provided by the spring because the load provided by the spring gets heavier as extension of the spring gets longer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Where a loading device includes a set of weights, a user is allowed to adjust the load by using different combinations of the weights. However, the adjustment of the load is not delicate for two reasons. Firstly, each of the weights is made with a considerable weight. Secondly, the number of the combinations is limited.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,758,479 for example, an exercise machine is provided with a left loading device and a right loading device. The left and right loading devices are identical to each other in structure and are mirror images to each other in position. For the briefness of the description, only the left loading device will be described. The left loading device includes a lever <b>30</b>, two pulleys <b>34</b> and <b>70</b>, a pneumatic cylinder <b>36</b>, a cable <b>40</b> and a coupling device <b>50</b>. The lever <b>30</b> includes multiple holes <b>42</b> arranged along the lever <b>30</b>. A pivot <b>32</b> is used to connect an end of the lever <b>30</b> to an upright member <b>14</b> of the exercise machine. The pulley <b>34</b> is supported on the lever <b>30</b>, near another end of the lever <b>30</b>. The pulley <b>70</b> is attached to a lower support member <b>16</b> of the exercise machine. The cable <b>40</b> is wound on the pulleys <b>34</b> and <b>70</b>. An end of the cable <b>40</b> is tied to a lower support member <b>16</b> of the exercise machine. Another end of the cable <b>40</b> is tied to a handle <b>44</b> to be held by a user. The coupling device <b>50</b> includes a body <b>52</b> and a handle <b>54</b>. The body <b>52</b> is supported on the lever <b>30</b>. The handle <b>54</b> is formed with a pin <b>54</b><i>a </i>and a flange <b>54</b><i>d</i>. A spring <b>54</b><i>b </i>is compressed between the flange <b>54</b><i>d </i>and an internal portion of the body <b>52</b>. An upper end of the pneumatic cylinder <b>36</b> is pivotally connected to the body <b>52</b>. A pivot <b>38</b> is used to connect a lower end of the pneumatic cylinder <b>36</b> to the lower support member <b>16</b>. The distance between the pivot <b>32</b> and the upper end of the pneumatic cylinder <b>36</b> sets a first moment arm while the distance between the pivot <b>32</b> and a center of the rollers <b>34</b> sets a moment arm. The body <b>52</b> is movable on the lever <b>30</b> so that the first moment arm is adjustable. In use, the pin <b>54</b><i>a </i>is inserted in a selected one of the holes <b>42</b> to keep the upper connected end of the pneumatic cylinder <b>36</b> in a selected one of multiple positions relative to the pivot <b>32</b>, i.e., keep the first moment arm in a selected one of multiple values. The spring <b>54</b><i>b </i>keeps the while pin <b>54</b><i>a </i>in the selected hole <b>42</b> and retains two contact portions <b>53</b> of the body <b>52</b> against the lever <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The use of the loading devices is not without any problem. The sliding of the body <b>52</b> on the lever <b>30</b> and the insertion of the pin <b>54</b><i>a </i>in one of the holes <b>42</b> are manual. Hence, the use of the loading devices is not convenient. Moreover, the use of the handle <b>54</b> to keep the upper end of the pneumatic cylinder <b>36</b> in position relative to the pivot <b>32</b> is not firm.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is therefore intended to obviate or at least alleviate the problems encountered in the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is the primary objective of the present invention to provide an exercise machine with a delicately adjustable loading device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve the foregoing objective, the loading device includes a lever, a coupler, a cylinder unit and a driving unit.

The positioner <b>40</b> includes two portions extending perpendicular to each other. The portions of the positioner <b>40</b> are pivotally connected to each other. The first portion of the positioner <b>40</b> is connected to the lever <b>11</b>. Preferably, the first portion of the positioner <b>40</b> is a ferrule extending around the lever <b>11</b>. Alternatively, the first portion of the positioner <b>40</b> is connected to the lever <b>11</b> by welding. The second portion of the positioner <b>40</b> is connected to the driving unit <b>41</b>. The driving unit <b>41</b> is located behind the lever <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The driving unit <b>41</b> includes a shell <b>41</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), a motor <b>43</b>, a threaded sleeve <b>45</b> and a threaded rod <b>46</b>.

The motor <b>43</b> includes a mandrel <b>43</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>).
