patent application is based on and claims priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 119(a) to Japanese Patent Application No. 2021-108736, filed on Jun. 30, 2021, in the Japan Patent Office, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to an image forming system.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a post-processing apparatus of an image forming apparatus, there is known a technology in which a two-ply sheet (laminate film) in which two sheets are overlaid and bonded (or joined) at one side is fed and separated (or peeled), then a sheet fed from the image forming apparatus is sandwiched between the separated sheets of the two-ply sheet, and the two-ply sheet is laminated by heat pressing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in the related art, since the two-ply sheet is separated in the post-processing apparatus and further an inner sheet (e.g., a sheet of paper or a photograph) is sandwiched between the separated sheets, the types and shapes of inner sheets that can be set into a two-ply sheet are limited to sheets that can be fed from a sheet feed tray or the image forming apparatus. In addition, in the related art, a post-processing apparatus does not have a function of feeding a sheet in which an inner sheet is set and simply performing heat pressing on the sheet, and does not substitute for a laminator that performs only heat pressing.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, an image forming system that includes a sheet processing apparatus, a heat presser, an image forming apparatus, and control circuitry. The sheet processing apparatus separates a two-ply sheet in which two sheets are overlaid and bonded together at a portion of the two-ply sheet, and sandwiches a sheet medium between the sheets of the two-ply sheet. The heat presser heats and presses the two-ply sheet. The image forming apparatus forms an image on the sheet medium. The control circuitry performs a first mode to cause the sheet processing apparatus to sandwich the sheet medium, on which an image has been formed by the image forming apparatus, between the two sheets of the two-ply sheet and cause the heat presser to laminate the two-ply sheet, and a second mode to cause the heat presser to laminate a sheet set that includes the sheet medium sandwiched between the two sheets of the two-ply sheet by a user.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of

Here, the speed at which the inner-sheet set sheet PS is fed and conveyed is a speed determined in advance based on a combination of items of &#x201c;sheet feed setting&#x201d;. After the inner-sheet set sheet PS is conveyed into the sheet laminator <b>200</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, the inner-sheet set sheet PS is conveyed as it is without being separated by a separation mechanism including, for example, the separation claws <b>116</b>, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>, lamination processing is performed by the heat pressing rollers <b>120</b>.
