For example, information relating to vehicle states includes a vehicle speed, engine revolution speed, detection status of a vehicle traveling in front that is being followed, and the like. Information regarding the vehicle surroundings includes, for example, a distance to the vehicle traveling in front, the temperature outside the vehicle, the weather, and the like. Information relating to the travel route includes, for example, junction guidance display (Turn by Turn display), traffic congestion information, and the like, and is coordinated with a car navigation system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the display device of the first aspect, vehicle travel conditions can be communicated to an occupant in a manner that is easy to understand by using the content image to express the progress of the vehicle on the display unit when about to travel through a curve on the travel path, and when traveling through the curve.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A display device for a vehicle of a second aspect is the first aspect, wherein the controller makes a change to the content image according to a steering angle of a steering wheel.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The display device of the second aspect enables a change in the travel path to be ascertained using a simpler configuration than in cases in which the curvature of a curve is detected using a camera or the like.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A display device for a vehicle of a third aspect is the first aspect or the second aspect, wherein the content is information relating to the vehicle, and the controller shifts an image of the information so as to be displayed at the same side of the display unit to which the travel path curves.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The display device of the third aspect shifts the content image in the same direction as the direction in which the travel path curves, enabling the gaze of the occupant to be guided in the direction in which the travel path curves.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A display device for a vehicle of a fourth aspect is the first aspect or the second aspect, wherein the content image is a pair of lines simulating the travel path, and the controller causes an upper portion of the pair of lines to curve in the same direction as the direction in which the travel path curves.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The &#x201c;pair of lines simulating the travel path&#x201d; are, for example, lines simulating white lines or a curb on each side in the vehicle width direction. The &#x201c;pair of lines&#x201d; are not limited to a pair of unbroken lines, and may be lines of any continuation of line segments such as two sets of double lines or a pair of dotted lines. The display device of the fourth aspect enables an occupant to easily recognize that they are passing through a curve on the travel path.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A display device for a vehicle of a fifth aspect is the fourth aspect, wherein the display unit includes a first display unit that is provided at a meter display, and a second display unit that is provided at a projection surface of a head-up display, and that is above and adjacent to the first display unit in a line of sight of the occupant.

Alternatively, for example, information relating to the shape of the travel path detected based on information acquired from the various sensors by the camera ECU <b>58</b> may be reflected as changes to the lines (the double lines <b>120</b> and the double lines <b>122</b>).</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
