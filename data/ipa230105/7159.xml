disclosure relate to digital photography, and, more particularly, to reducing a shadow incident from an electronic device or user by controlling a flash brightness of the electronic device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, camera modules for use in electronic devices, such as portable terminals, include a flash which may provide light for photographic capture in dark environments.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When these cameras are used to capture a subject, a photographic condition may depend upon a degree of illuminance in the surrounding environment. With indoor and nighttime photography in particular, environmental illumination is very low, and consequently, a flash is often utilized to generate a burst of light for to adequately capture subjects into photography. The light generated by a flash may sometimes be similar or identical to that of sunlight, in terms of quantity of light, color temperature. The flash is often a burst generated for a very short period of time, and may thus improve environmental illumination in capture in such environments, assuming an appropriate degree of exposure.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When a portable terminal, such as a mobile phone, is used to capture images, the terminal itself may cast a shadow on the subject being photographed. When the subject is shadowed, the resulting photograph may not possess the quality desired by the user. For example, the subject may be hard to perceive, and alphanumeric characters included therein may be difficult to read.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To avoid this result, a user will reposition the portable terminal such that the shadow is no longer cast over the subject. However, even here, changing the angle or position of the mobile terminal may interfere with the desired composition of the photograph. Similarly, if the flash function is triggered, the brightness of the flash is constant regardless of the photographic situation, and thus, the quality of the resulting photograph is unpredictable for the user.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Technical problems to be solved by the disclosure are not limited to the above-mentioned technical problems, and other technical problems not mentioned herein
