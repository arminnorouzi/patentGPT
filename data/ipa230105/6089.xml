Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a solar panel cutting unit, and more specifically to a solar panel cutting unit that can separate layers of a solar panel from each other at once.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Background Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention was made with government support under the national R&#x26;D program of South Korea (Project Identification Number: 1485017207; Project Number: 2020003100003; Ministry Name: Ministry of Environment; Project Management (Specialized) Institute Name: Korea Environmental Industry &#x26; Technology Institute; Research Program Title: Technology Development Program for Improvement in Cyclical Availability of Recycling Inhibitory Product; Research Project Title: Technology Development of Collecting Discarded Solar Panel and Collecting Crush-Based Valuable Material; Contribution Ratio: 1/1; Project Performing Agency Name: WonKwang S&#x26;T Co., Ltd.; Research Period: May 21, 2020 to Dec. 31, 2022) awarded by Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The solar power generation industry is an eco-friendly power generation industry in which a fossil fuel is not used and has been steadily growing since early 2000. The growth of the solar power generation industry results in a steady increase in the number of solar panels which are installed throughout South Korea, and thus a problem of disposing of old solar panels arises. A service life of a solar panel is about 15 to 25 years, although it may be different for each product. Recently, as performance of the solar panel is improved, a solar panel having low power generation efficiency is culled early, and thus the number of discarded solar panels is rapidly increased.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The number of discarded solar panels is expected to gradually increase in the future, and thus various technologies for disposing discarded solar panels are currently proposed. One of the common methods for disposing solar panels is a method to first physically separate an aluminum frame from the solar panel and then crush and bury a panel substrate or to recycle extractable metal or the like such as copper or silver through a chemical treatment. However, a chemical treatment method is limitedly used because of a possibility of causing another problem of environmental pollution. In addition, there is no easy method for separating a glass plate and a backsheet layer from the solar panel, and thus a separation process or apparatus needs to be improved.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, since an adhesive layer provided between layers of a solar panel to connect the layers has a thin thickness, it is difficult to separate the layers from each other with accuracy, and it is also difficult to separate a plurality of layers simultaneously. Hence, a problem arises in that layers of the solar panel are not easy to separate from each other by an existing process or apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A technical object to be achieved by the present invention is to provide a solar panel cutting unit that can separate layers of a solar panel from each other at once.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Technical objects of the present invention are not limited to the technical object mentioned above, and the following description enables those skilled in the art to clearly understand other unmentioned technical objects.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present invention, there is provided a solar panel cutting unit that separates a plurality of thin layers of a solar panel from each other, the solar panel cutting unit including: a frame; a panel transporting mechanism that is provided at the frame and lowers the solar panel in a vertical direction such that adhesion lines of the thin layers are arranged downward; a pair of guide roller units that is positioned below the panel transporting mechanism and guides and lowers the solar panel; and a wire cutting mechanism that includes a pair of support rollers and cutting wires which connect the support rollers to each other and extend in the same direction as the adhesion lines such that the wire cutting mechanism separates the thin layers of the solar panel from each other.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">At least one of the wire cutting mechanism and the pair of guide roller units may be moved to match locations of the adhesion lines and the cutting wires.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The solar panel cutting unit may further include an image recognition unit that is provided below the cutting wires, images the solar panel and the cutting wires, and locates of the adhesion lines and the cutting wires.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The solar panel may have a plurality of the adhesion lines formed in parallel between the plurality of thin layers.

The solar panel <b>30</b> has a structure in which a glass plate <b>31</b>, a solar cell layer <b>32</b>, and a backsheet layer <b>33</b> are stacked sequentially. In other words, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the solar panel <b>30</b> has a structure in which the glass plate <b>31</b>, a first adhesive layer <b>35</b><i>a</i>, the solar cell layer <b>32</b>, a second adhesive layer <b>35</b><i>b</i>, and the backsheet layer <b>33</b> are stacked sequentially and adhered to each other.

The solar panel cutting unit <b>1</b> cuts from a lower end portion toward an upper end portion of the vertically upright solar panel <b>30</b> and cut along the adhesion lines by using thin wires. When the solar panel <b>30</b> is cut in a horizontal state, a cutting force is applied in a horizontal direction and the force of gravity is applied in a vertical direction, thus the thin layers press the wires in the direction of gravity. Hence, accuracy is decreased, and the cutting force is remarkably decreased. The solar panel cutting unit <b>1</b> has an efficient structure of standing the solar panel <b>30</b> vertically upright and cutting the solar panel by inhibiting the accuracy and the cutting force from being decreased.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The solar panel cutting unit <b>1</b> separates a plurality of thin layers in a vertically upright state by causing cutting wires to pass along the adhesion lines between the thin layers.
