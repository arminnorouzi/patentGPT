For example, there are conventional commercial products such as DARK TRACE and CISCO firewalls which implement software clients to identify departure from normal network behavior (such clients can run, for example, on various servers communicating with the network). Identifying such anomalies is useful in determining whether there is a malicious actor in the network or if the network is malfunctioning.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are two basic approaches in the telecom market to anomaly detection. One approach involves (as mentioned above) software clients which detect abnormal network activity and report to a central manager. Another approach monitors activity in the network without a client. In this latter approach, physically dedicated hardware (e.g., hardware probes inside the network) can be located in front of one or more servers and/or at one or more points of entry into the network. Also, in this latter approach, a baseline of activity for each node is developed and alerts are generated when anomalies or abnormalities are detected.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, which are not necessarily drawn to scale, and wherein:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of a communication network in accordance with various aspects described herein.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of a system (which can function fully or partially within the communication network of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in accordance with various aspects described herein.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of a system (which can function fully or partially within the communication network of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in accordance with various aspects described herein.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a method in accordance with various aspects described herein.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a method in accordance with various aspects described herein.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a method in accordance with various aspects described herein.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of a virtualized communication network in accordance with various aspects described herein.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example, non-limiting embodiment of a computing environment in accordance with various aspects described herein.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example, non-limiting embodiment of a mobile network platform in accordance with various aspects described herein.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example, non-limiting embodiment of a communication device in accordance with various aspects described herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The subject disclosure describes, among other things, illustrative embodiments for anomalies management in a network.

The Anomalies Detection Manager <b>212</b> can then (e.g., responsive to the information message(s)) inform the Carrier Network <b>214</b> and/or the External Network <b>216</b> of such one or more anomalies. In addition (or in the alternative), the Anomalies Detection Manager <b>212</b> can (e.g., responsive to the information message(s)) instruct the Enterprise Network Anomalies Detector UPF-2 <b>208</b> to take corrective action.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As described herein, in various embodiments a plurality of UPFs (User Plane Functions) are distributed (see e.g., elements <b>202</b> and <b>208</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) and each of the UPFs communicates with a centralized gateway (see, e.g., elements <b>206</b> and <b>212</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) In one example, data is routed from a Session Management Function (SMF) of a 5G core network (see, e.g., element <b>506</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) to each respective UPF. In another example, the traffic would flow as defined by the 3GPP standards from the SMF to the UPF. In another example, the SMF would interface with an Anomalies Detector Manager (see, e.g., elements <b>206</b> and <b>212</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Reference will now be made to a system according to an embodiment that can operate as follows: (1) One or more UPFs is generated and configured. In one example, each UPF (sometimes referred to herein as a network virtual function (NVF)) can be generated and configured by a provisioning interface (see, e.g., the provisioning interface of element <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and/or the provisioning interface of element <b>216</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). (2) Each network virtual function can be provided to (and reside in) a respective end user enterprise premises (see, e.g., the enterprise network <b>204</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and/or the enterprise network <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) or a home. (3) Each UPF can have a front end called a Network Anomalies Detector (sometimes referred to herein as NAD). (4) Each NAD can be a tightly coupled NVF virtual function. (5) Each UPF can communicate with a control plane Anomalies Detection Manager (c-ADM) residing in (or otherwise in communication with) the carrier core network (see, e.g., Anomalies Detection Manager <b>212</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and 5G Core Network <b>206</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). (6) Each UPF can inspect traffic flowing through its respective UPF gateway (see, e.g., the UPF-1 <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and/or the UPF-2 <b>208</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). (7) Each UPF (see, e.g., the UPF-1 <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and/or the UPF-2 <b>208</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) can establish a respective baseline of what it considers normal behavior. (8) In one example, normal behavior can be defined as traffic that conforms to network expectations and is consistent with a historical pattern. (9) In one specific example, each UPF looks at traffic that occurs over a 1-week period of time. This traffic can include network protocols, IP addresses etc. This traffic can then be considered a baseline of behavior for the particular UPF. (10) If a given UPF detects behavior which is outside of its baseline, the core network ADM is alerted by that UPF. (11) The ADM reports the anomaly to a security event manager database (see, e.g., the security events manager of Carrier Network <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and/or the security events manager of External Network <b>216</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). (13) The ADM residing in (or otherwise in communication with) the core can have an external provisioning gateway for end-user configuration.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In another example, prior to the reporting of the one or more anomalies by the ADM to the security event manager database in step (11) above, the ADM can compare the one or more anomalies reported by given UPF with pre-provisioned profile(s) defining what is normal for a user plane function gateway (then, based upon this comparison, the ADM can decide whether or not to carry out step (11)).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In another example (which can replace or operate together with steps (6)-(10) above), the c-ADM can inspect the traffic, create a baseline, and/or determine abnormal behavior. For instance, the c-ADM centralized core function can inspect traffic flowing through one or more UPF gateways (see, e.g., the UPF-1 <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and/or the UPF-2 <b>208</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) and based upon this the c-ADM centralized core function can establish a baseline of what it considers normal behavior.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one specific example: An enterprise can deploy a UPF gateway function (the gateway of this example routes traffic from a manufacturing facility to a cloud services provider such as MICROSOFT AZURE). The NAD detects anomalies and that affect performance since abnormal amounts of data are being transferred. The NAD reports these anomalies to the core c-ADM. The UPF gateway function is then reconfigured to prevent these anomalies and security event databases are updated.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one specific example: A home has a 5G network deployed with a UPF gateway to route traffic directly to the Internet instead of to the core carrier network. The UPF of this example is also connected to the carrier core for control purposes. The UPF detects unusual amounts of traffic flowing through the home network. The UPF also detects traffic which are not consistent with previous baselines of behavior. The NAD software residing in the UPF alerts the c-ADM residing in the core. The home UPF is reconfigured dynamically. The anomalies are reported to the Security Events database.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one specific example: The core c-ADM control function determines that a change of network behavior is expected for a particular UPF user plane gateway. The core c-ADM alerts the UPF of the change in behavior expected. The anomalies baseline is updated. No action is taken.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one specific example: A UPF is configured to transmit video from a home or an enterprise location. The UPF NAD determines that video data is being transmitted to Internet Protocol addresses (IPs) which are outside of the normal baseline. The NAD alerts the core c-ADM. The core c-ADM manager records and alerts security databases of the anomaly. Depending upon the provisioning database, the core c-ADM instructs the UPF gateway to stop video transmissions to the suspicious IP address(es) or to continue to allow and gather reporting data.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, this is a block diagram illustrating an example, non-limiting embodiment of a system <b>250</b> (which can function fully or partially within the communication network of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in accordance with various aspects described herein.

In various embodiments, this cloud networking architecture is an open architecture that leverages application programming interfaces (APIs); reduces complexity from services and operations; supports more nimble business models; and rapidly and seamlessly scales to meet evolving customer requirements including traffic growth, diversity of traffic types, and diversity of performance and reliability expectations.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In contrast to traditional network elements&#x2014;which are typically integrated to perform a single function, the virtualized communication network employs virtual network elements (VNEs) <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, etc. that perform some or all of the functions of network elements <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>, etc. For example, the network architecture can provide a substrate of networking capability, often called Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI) or simply infrastructure that is capable of being directed with software and Software Defined Networking (SDN) protocols to perform a broad variety of network functions and services. This infrastructure can include several types of substrates. The most typical type of substrate being servers that support Network Function Virtualization (NFV), followed by packet forwarding capabilities based on generic computing resources, with specialized network technologies brought to bear when general purpose processors or general purpose integrated circuit devices offered by merchants (referred to herein as merchant silicon) are not appropriate. In this case, communication services can be implemented as cloud-centric workloads.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">As an example, a traditional network element <b>150</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), such as an edge router can be implemented via a VNE <b>330</b> composed of NFV software modules, merchant silicon, and associated controllers. The software can be written so that increasing workload consumes incremental resources from a common resource pool, and moreover so that it's elastic: so the resources are only consumed when needed. In a similar fashion, other network elements such as other routers, switches, edge caches, and middle-boxes are instantiated from the common resource pool. Such sharing of infrastructure across a broad set of uses makes planning and growing infrastructure easier to manage.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In an embodiment, the transport layer <b>350</b> includes fiber, cable, wired and/or wireless transport elements, network elements and interfaces to provide broadband access <b>110</b>, wireless access <b>120</b>, voice access <b>130</b>, media access <b>140</b> and/or access to content sources <b>175</b> for distribution of content to any or all of the access technologies. In particular, in some cases a network element needs to be positioned at a specific place, and this allows for less sharing of common infrastructure. Other times, the network elements have specific physical layer adapters that cannot be abstracted or virtualized, and might require special DSP code and analog front-ends (AFEs) that do not lend themselves to implementation as VNEs <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> or <b>334</b>. These network elements can be included in transport layer <b>350</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The virtualized network function cloud <b>325</b> interfaces with the transport layer <b>350</b> to provide the VNEs <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, etc. to provide specific NFVs. In particular, the virtualized network function cloud <b>325</b> leverages cloud operations, applications, and architectures to support networking workloads. The virtualized network elements <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> and <b>334</b> can employ network function software that provides either a one-for-one mapping of traditional network element function or alternately some combination of network functions designed for cloud computing. For example, VNEs <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> and <b>334</b> can include route reflectors, domain name system (DNS) servers, and dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) servers, system architecture evolution (SAE) and/or mobility management entity (MME) gateways, broadband network gateways, IP edge routers for IP-VPN, Ethernet and other services, load balancers, distributers and other network elements. Because these elements don't typically need to forward large amounts of traffic, their workload can be distributed across a number of servers&#x2014;each of which adds a portion of the capability, and overall which creates an elastic function with higher availability than its former monolithic version. These virtual network elements <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, etc. can be instantiated and managed using an orchestration approach similar to those used in cloud compute services.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The cloud computing environments <b>375</b> can interface with the virtualized network function cloud <b>325</b> via APIs that expose functional capabilities of the VNEs <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, etc. to provide the flexible and expanded capabilities to the virtualized network function cloud <b>325</b>. In particular, network workloads may have applications distributed across the virtualized network function cloud <b>325</b> and cloud computing environment <b>375</b> and in the commercial cloud, or might simply orchestrate workloads supported entirely in NFV infrastructure from these third party locations.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, there is illustrated a block diagram of a computing environment in accordance with various aspects described herein.

Wi-Fi is a wireless technology similar to that used in a cell phone that enables such devices, e.g., computers, to send and receive data indoors and out; anywhere within the range of a base station. Wi-Fi networks use radio technologies called IEEE 802.11 (a, b, g, n, ac, ag, etc.) to provide secure, reliable, fast wireless connectivity. A Wi-Fi network can be used to connect computers to each other, to the Internet, and to wired networks (which can use IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet). Wi-Fi networks operate in the unlicensed 2.4 and 5 GHz radio bands for example or with products that contain both bands (dual band), so the networks can provide real-world performance similar to the basic 10BaseT wired Ethernet networks used in many offices.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an embodiment <b>500</b> of a mobile network platform <b>510</b> is shown that is an example of network elements <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>, and/or VNEs <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, etc. For example, platform <b>510</b> can facilitate in whole or in part network anomalies management (e.g., network anomalies detection and/or repair). In one or more embodiments, the mobile network platform <b>510</b> can generate and receive signals transmitted and received by base stations or access points such as base station or access point <b>122</b>. Generally, mobile network platform <b>510</b> can comprise components, e.g., nodes, gateways, interfaces, servers, or disparate platforms, that facilitate both packet-switched (PS) (e.g., internet protocol (IP), frame relay, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)) and circuit-switched (CS) traffic (e.g., voice and data), as well as control generation for networked wireless telecommunication. As a non-limiting example, mobile network platform <b>510</b> can be included in telecommunications carrier networks, and can be considered carrier-side components as discussed elsewhere herein. Mobile network platform <b>510</b> comprises CS gateway node(s) <b>512</b> which can interface CS traffic received from legacy networks like telephony network(s) <b>540</b> (e.g., public switched telephone network (PSTN), or public land mobile network (PLMN)) or a signaling system #7 (SS7) network <b>560</b>. CS gateway node(s) <b>512</b> can authorize and authenticate traffic (e.g., voice) arising from such networks. Additionally, CS gateway node(s) <b>512</b> can access mobility, or roaming, data generated through SS7 network <b>560</b>; for instance, mobility data stored in a visited location register (VLR), which can reside in memory <b>530</b>. Moreover, CS gateway node(s) <b>512</b> interfaces CS-based traffic and signaling and PS gateway node(s) <b>518</b>. As an example, in a 3GPP UMTS network, CS gateway node(s) <b>512</b> can be realized at least in part in gateway GPRS support node(s) (GGSN).

Data streams (e.g., content(s) that are part of a voice call or data session) can be conveyed to PS gateway node(s) <b>518</b> for authorization/authentication and initiation of a data session, and to serving node(s) <b>516</b> for communication thereafter.

The embodiments (e.g., in connection with automatically managing network anomalies) can employ various AI-based schemes for carrying out various embodiments thereof. Moreover, the classifier can be employed to determine a ranking or priority of each network anomaly. A classifier is a function that maps an input attribute vector, x=(x1, x2, x3, x4, . . . , xn), to a confidence that the input belongs to a class, that is, f(x)=confidence (class). Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to determine or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. A support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs, which the hypersurface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches comprise, e.g., na&#xef;ve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">As will be readily appreciated, one or more of the embodiments can employ classifiers that are explicitly trained (e.g., via a generic training data) as well as implicitly trained (e.g., via observing UE behavior, operator preferences, historical information, receiving extrinsic information). For example, SVMs can be configured via a learning or training phase within a classifier constructor and feature selection module. Thus, the classifier(s) can be used to automatically learn and perform a number of functions, including but not limited to management of network anomalies, etc.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">As used in some contexts in this application, in some embodiments, the terms &#x201c;component,&#x201d; &#x201c;system&#x201d; and the like are intended to refer to, or comprise, a computer-related entity or an entity related to an operational apparatus with one or more specific functionalities, wherein the entity can be either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution.
