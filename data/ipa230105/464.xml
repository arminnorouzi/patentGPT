Specifically, this disclosure relates to remotely controlling a main processing console of an ultrasound system using an ultrasound remote controller based on input received at the ultrasound remote controller from a user of the ultrasound system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Ultrasound imaging is a widely used for examining a wide range of materials and objects across a wide array of different applications. Ultrasound imaging provides a fast and easy tool for analyzing materials and objects in a non-invasive manner. As a result, ultrasound imaging is especially common in the practice of medicine as an ailment diagnosis, treatment, and prevention tool. Specifically, because of its relatively non-invasive nature, low cost and fast response time ultrasound imaging is widely used throughout the medical industry to diagnose and prevent ailments. Further, as ultrasound imaging is based on non-ionizing radiation it does not carry the same risks as other diagnosis imaging tools, such as X-ray imaging or other types of imaging systems that use ionizing radiation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Ultrasound imaging is accomplished by generating and directing ultrasonic sound waves into a material of interest, first in a transmit phase and subsequently in a receive phase. During the transmit phase, an ultrasonic signal is transmitted into a material of interest by applying continuous or pulsed electronic signals. During the receive phase, reflections generated by boundaries between dissimilar materials are received by receiving devices, such as transducers, and converted to electrical signals. Signals can then be processed to determine the locations of the echo sources. The resulting data can be used to display images of inside a material of interest, e.g. by displaying images using a display device, such as a monitor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Ultrasound imaging can offer a wealth of clinical information. Specifically, ultrasound imaging can be used in abdominal ultrasound (to visualize abdominal tissues and organs), bone sonometry (to assess bone fragility), breast ultrasound (to visualize breast tissue), Doppler fetal heart rate monitors (to listen to a fetal heart beat), Doppler ultrasound (to visualize blood flow through a blood vessel, organs, or other structures), echocardiogram (to view a heart), fetal ultrasound (to view a fetus in pregnancy), ultrasound-guided biopsies (to collect a sample of tissue), ophthalmic ultrasound (to visualize ocular structures) and ultrasound-guided needle placement (in blood vessels or other tissues of interest). Ultrasound imaging has also been used in describing various disease states, such as diseases of the liver, breast, prostate, thyroid or other organs through single measurements of stiffness or shear wave velocity.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typically ultrasound systems include a main processing console and an ultrasound transducer. The ultrasound transducer is positioned away from the main console and actively controlled by an operator in gathering ultrasound image data. In turn, an operator has to be able to control a number of functions away from the main system console. In the past this was accomplished via a foot pedal or having an assistant present to operate the main system console separately from the operator. However, the use of foot pedals is awkward and can lead to difficulties in controlling or inabilities to control the main system console. Further, the use of separate assistants can present additional challenges in controlling the main system console, e.g. the need for effective communication skills and an increased potential from errors created by unskilled assistants.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additionally, in many ultrasound imaging scenarios, an operator needs two hands to operation an ultrasound transducer. This requires the operator to dedicate their full attention to operating the ultrasound transducer. In turn, this makes foot pedals of the use of assistants to control a main system console nearly impossible, as the focus of the operator is to both of their hands and manipulating the ultrasound transducer. In particular, this is important for interventional procedures where operators have to biopsy or aspirate an area of tissue.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There therefore exist needs for systems and methods that allow an operator to remotely control a main system console of an ultrasound system. Specifically, there exists a need for systems and methods for allowing an operator to remotely control a main system console of an ultrasound system while the operator manipulates an ultrasound transducer of the ultrasound system. More specifically, there exists a need for systems and methods that are integrated along with an ultrasound transducer to allow an operator to control a main processing console of an ultrasound system while the operator manipulates the ultrasound transducer. Further, there exists a need for systems and methods for allowing an operator to remotely control a main processing console of existing ultrasound systems without having to purchase an entire new ultrasound system.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to various embodiments, an ultrasound remote controller is configured to remotely control a main processing console of an ultrasound system.

The ultrasound system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is merely an example system and in various embodiments, the ultrasound system <b>100</b> can have less components or additional components. Specifically, the ultrasound system <b>100</b> includes is an ultrasound system where the receive array focusing unit is referred to as a beam former <b>102</b>, and image formation can be performed on a scanline-by-scanline basis. System control can be centered in the master controller <b>104</b>, which accepts operator inputs through an operator interface and in turn controls the various subsystems. For each scan line, the transmitter <b>106</b> generates a radio-frequency (RF) excitation voltage pulse waveform and applies it with appropriate timing across the transmit aperture (defined by a sub-array of active elements) to generate a focused acoustic beam along the scan line. RF echoes received by the receive aperture <b>108</b> of the transducer <b>110</b> are amplified and filtered by the receiver <b>108</b>, and then fed into the beam former <b>102</b>, whose function is to perform dynamic receive focusing; i.e., to re-align the RF signals that originate from the same locations along various scan lines.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The image processor <b>112</b> can perform processing specific to active imaging mode(s) including 2D scan conversion that transforms the image data from an acoustic line grid to an X-Y pixel image for display. For Spectral Doppler mode, the image processor <b>112</b> can perform wall filtering followed by spectral analysis of Doppler-shifted signal samples using typically a sliding FFT-window. The image processor <b>112</b> can also generate the stereo audio signal output corresponding to forward and reverse flow signals. In cooperation with the master controller <b>104</b>, the image processor <b>112</b> also can format images from two or more active imaging modes, including display annotation, graphics overlays and replay of cine loops and recorded timeline data.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The cine buffer <b>114</b> provides resident digital image storage for single image or multiple image loop review, and acts as a buffer for transfer of images to digital archival devices.

Specifically, the IMU can gather geometric data that includes one or a combination of motion, position, and orientation of the ultrasound remote controller <b>300</b>. The IMU <b>314</b> can include applicable sensors for measuring one or a combination of motion, position, and orientation of the ultrasound remote controller <b>300</b>. Specifically, the IMU <b>314</b> can include an applicable combination of corresponding sensors to gather geometric data for one to nine degrees of freedom at the ultrasound remote controller <b>300</b>.

For example, geometric information from the IMU <b>314</b> can be used by the ultrasound system to keep track of the relative position of the ultrasound remote controller <b>300</b>. Further in the example, the geometric information can be used to display a position of the ultrasound remote controller <b>300</b> in a body marker image.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In various embodiments, geometric data of the ultrasound remote controller <b>300</b> can correspond to geometric data of an ultrasound transducer. In particular, when the ultrasound remote controller <b>300</b> is affixed to an ultrasound transducer, geometric data of the ultrasound remote controller <b>300</b> can correspond to geometric data of the ultrasound transducer, e.g. a position of the ultrasound transducer. For example, the ultrasound remote controller <b>300</b> can be affixed above an ultrasound transducer, and a position of the ultrasound remote controller <b>300</b> with respect to a patient can be a position of the ultrasound transducer with respect to the patient. In turn, the corresponding geometric data of the ultrasound transducer, as determined based on geometric data of the ultrasound remote controller <b>300</b>, can be used to remotely control operation of a main processing console of an ultrasound using the ultrasound remote controller <b>300</b>. Specifically, geometric data of an ultrasound transducer, e.g. a tracked position of the ultrasound transducer, can be sent to a main processing console of an ultrasound system, e.g. by a communication interface.
