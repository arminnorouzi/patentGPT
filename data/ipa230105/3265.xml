The electrified axles have included gearboxes with clutches allowing the gear ratio in the gearbox to be adapted based on various operating conditions. Dog clutches have been deployed in gearboxes in electrified drive axles as well as combustion engine transmissions. Synchronization mechanisms, commonly referred to as synchromesh devices, are utilized in automatic transmissions to facilitate smooth dog clutch engagement and avoid noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) occurring when clutch teeth are in a blocked position during clutch engagement. Certain electrified axle gearboxes have also utilized dog clutches designed to engage and disengage gearbox components such as planetary gears.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the inventors have recognized several drawbacks with previous electric drive axles and clutches. For instance, previous electric drive axles have not achieved a desired amount of gear selectability. Furthermore, dog clutches when paired with other gearboxes clutches may not be able to smoothly engage due to constraints on the dog clutch by other clutches. Consequently, blocked shift conditions may occur in the dog clutch, in certain scenarios, leading to increased NVH and shift delays in the gearbox. Customer satisfaction may be decreased as a result of the elevated NVH levels and shift delays.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To overcome at least some of the aforementioned drawbacks a clutch assembly is provided. The clutch assembly comprises, in one example, a locking clutch with a gear including a plurality of teeth having at least one tooth with a tapered end. The locking clutch further includes an indexing shaft rotationally connected to an output shaft and a shift collar mounted on the indexing shaft. The locking clutch is also configured to translate on the indexing shaft into an engaged and disengaged configuration and includes a plurality of teeth on a face. At least one tooth in the plurality of teeth in the shift collar includes a tapered end. The locking clutch further includes an indexing mechanism coupled to the shift collar and the indexing shaft. The indexing mechanism allows for indexing between the indexing shaft and the shift collar during shift collar engagement. In this way, the profile of the clutch teeth and indexing mechanism work in conjunction to decrease the likelihood of a blocked condition in the clutch. As a result, noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) emanating from the clutch assembly is reduced along with the likelihood of clutch shift delay and malfunction.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another example, the indexing mechanism may be configured to inhibit indexing between the indexing shaft and the shift collar caused by inertial load during gear train operation. In this way, the indexing mechanism allows for shift collar indexing during clutch engagement but prevents unwanted indexing during other modes of gear train operation, further decreasing NVH in the gear train.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It should be understood that the summary above is provided to introduce in simplified form a selection of concepts that are further described in the detailed description. It is not meant to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter, the scope of which is defined uniquely by the claims that follow the detailed description.

To achieve the smooth tooth engagement the locking clutch includes teeth with tapered ends and an indexing mechanism allowing for rotational &#x201c;compliance&#x201d; between a shift collar and an indexing shaft in the clutch. As such, when the teeth are in a blocked position with regard to one another, as the shift collar teeth are pushed toward the gear teeth the shift collar is allowed to index and the shift collar teeth slide into mated engagement with the gear teeth. Consequently, clutch noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) may be reduced and the chance of clutch shift delays and in some case malfunction may be decreased. Further, in one example, the indexing mechanism may be configured to substantially inhibit indexing between the shift collar and the indexing shaft caused by inertial load during gear train operation. In this way, indexing may be avoided in the clutch during gear train operating modes outside of clutch engagement, further decreasing NVH emanating from the locking clutch.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically illustrates a vehicle with an electric drive axle system designed with multiple gear ratios. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref> illustrate different views of an example of an electric drive axle system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional view of an electric motor-generator included in the electric drive axle system, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional view of an input shaft and intermediate shaft included in a gear train in the electric drive axle system, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional view of an intermediate shaft and an output shaft in the gear train in the electric drive axle system, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the output shaft included in the gear train in the electric drive axle system, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a detailed view of clutch assemblies in the electric drive axle system, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>12</b></figref> show an engagement sequence in an interface of a locking clutch. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>14</b></figref> show different views of an indexing shaft and a face of a shift collar in a locking clutch. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>-<b>16</b></figref> show different cross-sectional views of an example of an indexing mechanism in an indexing shaft and the shift collar. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows another example of an indexing shaft and a shift collar in a locking clutch. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> shows an indexing mechanism included in the locking clutch, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> shows a method for operation of a clutch assembly in an electric drive axle system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>-<b>22</b></figref> show exemplary gear train power paths occurring during different modes of system operation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> shows an exemplary embodiment of a one-way clutch.

Arrows <b>109</b> signify the energy transfer between the electric motor-generator <b>106</b> and the energy storage device <b>108</b> that may occur during different modes of system operation. The electric motor-generator <b>106</b> may include conventional components for generating rotational output (e.g., forward and reverse drive rotational output) and/or electrical energy for recharging the energy storage device <b>108</b> such as a rotor electromagnetically interacting with a stator, to provide the aforementioned energy transfer functionality. The electric motor-generator <b>106</b> is shown including a rotor shaft <b>180</b> with a first bearing <b>181</b> and a second bearing <b>182</b> coupled thereto. The first bearing <b>181</b> may be a fixed bearing and the second bearing <b>182</b> may be a floating bearing. Although the second bearing <b>182</b> is shown positioned within the motor-generator, it will be understood that in some embodiments, bearing <b>182</b> may be coupled to the input shaft to facilitate rotation thereof. Other bearing arrangements with regard to the motor-generator have been contemplated such as arrangements with alternate quantities and/or types of bearings.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The vehicle may take a variety of forms in different embodiments. For example, the vehicle <b>100</b> may be hybrid vehicle where both the electric motor-generator <b>106</b> and an internal combustion engine (not shown) are utilized for motive power generation. For instance, in one use-case hybrid vehicle configuration, the internal combustion engine may assist in recharging the energy storage device <b>108</b>, during certain conditions. In another use-case hybrid vehicle configuration, the internal combustion engine may be configured to provide rotational energy to a differential <b>110</b> or other suitable locations in the gear train <b>104</b>. In yet another use-case hybrid vehicle configuration, the engine may provide rotational input to another drive axle (not shown). Further, in other examples, the vehicle may be a battery electric vehicle (BEV) where the internal combustion engine is omitted.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The rotor shaft <b>180</b> of the electric motor-generator <b>106</b> is coupled to an input shaft <b>112</b>. For instance, the rotor shaft <b>180</b> may be transition fit, slip fit, mechanically attached, in splined engagement, combinations thereof, etc., with an end of the input shaft <b>112</b>. A first gear <b>114</b> is positioned or formed on the input shaft <b>112</b>. A bearing <b>183</b> is shown coupled to the input shaft <b>112</b>. The bearing <b>183</b> may be a fixed bearing, in one example. However, in other examples, the bearing <b>183</b> may be another suitable type of bearing or in some cases may be omitted from the system.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A second gear <b>116</b> is rotationally coupled to the first gear <b>114</b> and resides on an intermediate shaft <b>118</b>. As described herein, rotational coupling between gears or other components may include an interface between the gears where teeth of the gears mesh to facilitate rotational energy transfer therebetween. As such, rotational coupling of the components allows for rotational energy transfer between the corresponding components. Conversely, rotational decoupling may include a state between two components when rotational energy is substantially inhibited from being transferred between the components.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A third gear <b>120</b> and a fourth gear <b>122</b> are additionally included on the intermediate shaft <b>118</b>, although other gearing arrangements have been envisioned. Bearings <b>184</b> (e.g., tapered roller bearings) are coupled to either axial end of the intermediate shaft <b>118</b> to support the shaft and facilitate rotation thereof. The tapered roller bearings may decrease the axle package width when compared to other types of bearing such as ball bearings. However, other suitable intermediate shaft bearing types and/or arrangements have been envisioned. The bearing arrangement on the intermediate shaft as well as the other bearing arrangements described herein may be selected based on expected shaft loading (e.g., radial and thrust loading), gear size, shaft size, etc.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Continuing with the gear train description, the fourth gear <b>122</b> is rotationally coupled to a fifth gear <b>124</b> and the third gear <b>120</b> is rotationally coupled to a sixth gear <b>126</b>. The first gear <b>114</b>, the second gear <b>116</b>, the third gear <b>120</b>, the fourth gear <b>122</b>, the fifth gear <b>124</b>, and the sixth gear <b>126</b> are included in a gear assembly <b>130</b>, in the illustrated embodiment. However, the gear assembly may include an alternate number of gears and/or have a different layout, in other embodiments. The number of gears in the assembly and the assembly layout may be selected based on end-use design goals related to desired gear range and packaging, for instance.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first gear <b>114</b>, the second gear <b>116</b>, the fourth gear <b>122</b>, and the fifth gear <b>124</b>, may be included in a first gear set <b>127</b>. Additionally, the first gear <b>114</b>, the second gear <b>116</b>, third gear <b>120</b>, and the sixth gear <b>126</b>, may be included in a second gear set <b>129</b>. The first gear set <b>127</b> may have a higher gear ratio than the second gear set <b>129</b>, in one example. However, other gear arrangements in the different gear sets may be used, in other examples. Clutch assemblies in the system <b>102</b> allow the first gear set <b>127</b> or the second gear set <b>129</b> to be placed in an operational state. To elaborate, the clutch assemblies allow the gear ratio delivered to drive wheels <b>128</b> on driving surfaces <b>133</b>, by way of the gear assembly <b>130</b>, a planetary gear assembly <b>138</b>, and the differential <b>110</b>, to be adjusted. For instance, the clutch assemblies may be operated to engage the first gear set <b>127</b>, during certain conditions (e.g., towing, lower speed vehicle operation, etc.), and engage the second gear set <b>129</b>, during other conditions (e.g., higher speed vehicle operation). As such, the system may transition between the different gear sets based on vehicle operating conditions, driver input, etc. In this way, the gear train has distinct selectable gear ratios, allowing the gear train to be adapted for different driving conditions, as desired. It will be appreciated that the gear ratio adjustability may also be utilized to increase electric motor efficiency, in some cases.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The system <b>102</b> may specifically include a first clutch assembly <b>132</b> and a second clutch assembly <b>134</b>. The first clutch assembly <b>132</b> is configured to rotationally couple and decouple the fifth gear <b>124</b> from an output shaft <b>136</b>. Likewise, the second clutch assembly <b>134</b> functions to rotationally couple and decouple the sixth gear <b>126</b> from the output shaft <b>136</b>. The first clutch assembly <b>132</b> may include a one-way clutch <b>185</b> (e.g., sprag clutch) and a locking clutch <b>186</b> working in conjunction to accomplish the coupling/decoupling functionality, in a compact arrangement. The structure and function of the one-way and locking clutches are described in greater detail herein. The second clutch assembly <b>134</b> may be a wet friction clutch providing smooth engagement/disengagement, in one embodiment. However, in other examples, the second clutch assembly <b>134</b> may include additional or alternate types of suitable clutches (e.g., hydraulic, electromagnetic, etc.).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The output shaft <b>136</b> is rotationally coupled to the planetary gear assembly <b>138</b>, in the illustrated embodiment. The planetary gear assembly <b>138</b> may include an annulus <b>187</b> also referred to as a ring gear, a carrier <b>188</b> with planet gears <b>189</b> mounted thereon, and a sun gear <b>190</b> providing a space efficient design capable of providing a relatively high gear ratio in comparison to non-planetary arrangements. In the illustrated embodiment, the sun gear <b>190</b> is rotationally coupled to the output shaft <b>136</b> and the carrier <b>188</b> is rotationally coupled to the differential <b>110</b> (e.g., a differential case). However, in alternate examples, different gears in the planetary assembly may be rotationally coupled to the output shaft and the differential. Further, in one example, the components of the planetary gear assembly <b>138</b> may be non-adjustable with regard to the components that are held stationary and allowed to rotate. Thus, in one use-case example, the annulus <b>187</b> may be held substantially stationary and the carrier <b>188</b>, planet gears <b>189</b>, and the sun gear <b>190</b> and the gears stationary/rotational state may remain unchanged during gear train operation. In the illustrated embodiment, the annulus <b>187</b> is fixedly coupled to the motor-generator housing, to increase system space efficiency. However, the annulus may be fixedly coupled to other vehicle structures, in other instances. By using a non-adjustable planetary assembly, gear train operation may be simplified when compared to planetary arrangements with gears having rotational state adjustability. However, adjustable planetary arrangements may be used in the system, in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Various bearings may be coupled to the output shaft <b>136</b> and the planetary gear assembly <b>138</b> to enable rotation of components coupled to the shaft and assembly and in some cases support the components with regard to radial and/or thrust loads. A bearing <b>191</b> (e.g., needle roller bearing) is shown coupled to the output shaft <b>136</b> and the second clutch assembly <b>134</b>. Additionally, a bearing <b>192</b> (e.g., tapered roller bearing) is shown coupled to the second clutch assembly <b>134</b>. A bearing <b>193</b> (e.g., floating bearing) is also shown coupled to the second clutch assembly <b>134</b> and the output shaft <b>136</b>. A bearing <b>194</b> (e.g., thrust bearing) may also be positioned axially between and coupled to the sixth gear <b>126</b> and the first clutch assembly <b>132</b>. A bearing <b>196</b> (e.g., fixed bearing) may also be coupled to the one-way clutch <b>185</b>. Additionally, a bearing <b>197</b> (e.g., ball bearing) is shown coupled to the planetary gear assembly <b>138</b> and a bearing <b>198</b> (e.g., ball bearing) is shown coupled to the differential case <b>142</b>. However, other suitable bearing arrangements have been contemplated, such as arrangements where the quantity and/or configurations of the bearings are varied.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts the planetary gear assembly <b>138</b> directly rotationally coupled to the differential <b>110</b>. Directly coupling the planetary gear assembly to the differential increases system compactness and simplifies system architecture. In other examples, however, intermediate gearing may be provided between the planetary gear assembly and the differential. In turn, the differential <b>110</b> is designed to rotationally drive an axle <b>140</b> coupled to the drive wheels <b>128</b>. The axle <b>140</b> is shown including a first shaft section <b>141</b> and a second shaft section <b>143</b> coupled to different drive wheels <b>128</b>. Furthermore, the axle <b>140</b> is shown arranged within (e.g., co-axial with) the output shaft <b>136</b> which allows more space efficient design to be achieved. However, offset axle-output shaft arrangements may be used, in other examples.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further in one example, the axle <b>140</b> may be a beam axle. A beam axle, also referred to in the art as a solid axle or rigid axle, may be an axle with mechanical components structurally supporting one another and extending between drive wheels coupled to the axle. Thus, wheels coupled to the axle may move in unison when articulating, during, for example, vehicle travel on uneven road surfaces. For instance, the beam axle may be a structurally continuous axle spanning the drive wheels on a lateral axis, in one embodiment. In another embodiment, the beam axle may include co-axial shafts receiving rotational input from different gears in the differential and structurally supported by the differential.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The differential <b>110</b> may include a case <b>142</b> housing gearing such as pinion gears, side gears, etc., to achieve the aforementioned energy transfer functionality. To elaborate, the differential <b>110</b> may be an electronic locking differential, in one example. In another example, the differential <b>110</b> may be an electronic limited slip differential or a torque vectoring dual clutch. In yet other examples, an open differential may be used. Referring to the locking differential example, when unlocked, the locking differential may allow the two drive wheels to spin at different speeds and conversely, when locked, the locking differential may force the drive wheels to rotate at the same speed. In this way, the gear train configuration can be adapted to increase traction, under certain driving conditions. In the case of the limited slip differential, the differential allows the deviation of the speed between shafts <b>144</b> coupled to the drive wheels <b>128</b> to be constrained. Consequently, traction under certain road conditions (e.g., low traction conditions such as icy conditions, wet conditions, muddy conditions, etc.) may be increased due to the wheel speed deviation constraint. Additionally, in the torque vectoring dual clutch example, the differential may allow for torque delivered to the drive wheels to be independently and more granularly adjusted to again increase traction during certain driving conditions. The torque vectoring dual clutch may therefore provide greater wheel speed/torque control but may, in some cases, be more complex than the locking or limited slip differentials.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The vehicle <b>100</b> may also include a control system <b>150</b> with a controller <b>152</b>. The controller <b>152</b> includes a processor <b>154</b> and memory <b>156</b>. The memory <b>156</b> may hold instructions stored therein that when executed by the processor cause the controller <b>152</b> to perform the various methods, control techniques, etc., described herein. The processor <b>154</b> may include a microprocessor unit and/or other types of circuits. The memory <b>156</b> may include known data storage mediums such as random access memory, read only memory, keep alive memory, combinations thereof, etc. Furthermore, it will also be understood that the memory <b>156</b> may include non-transitory memory.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The controller <b>152</b> may receive various signals from sensors <b>158</b> coupled various locations in the vehicle <b>100</b> and the electric drive axle system <b>102</b>. The sensors may include a motor-generator speed sensor <b>160</b>, an energy storage device temperature sensor <b>162</b>, an energy storage device state of charge sensor <b>164</b>, wheel speed sensors <b>166</b>, clutch position sensors <b>168</b>, etc. The controller <b>152</b> may also send control signals to various actuators <b>170</b> coupled at different locations in the vehicle <b>100</b> and the electric drive axle system <b>102</b>. For instance, the controller <b>152</b> may send signals to the electric motor-generator <b>106</b> and the energy storage device <b>108</b> to adjust the rotational speed and/or direction (e.g., forward drive rotational direction and reverse drive rotational direction) of the motor-generator. The controller <b>152</b> may also send signals to the first clutch assembly <b>132</b> and the second clutch assembly <b>134</b> to adjust the operational gear ratio in the gear train <b>104</b>. For instance, the first clutch assembly <b>132</b> may be disengaged and the second clutch assembly <b>134</b> may be engaged to place the second gear set <b>129</b> in an operational state (transferring rotational energy between the electric motor-generator <b>106</b> and the output shaft <b>136</b>) or vice versa. Specifically, in one example, the controller may include instructions stored in the memory causing the controller to transition a locking clutch in the first clutch assembly into an engaged state in response to receiving a request to initiate a reverse or regeneration mode, for example. The other controllable components in the vehicle and gear system may function in a similar manner with regard to command signals and actuator adjustment. For instance, the differential <b>110</b> may receive command signals from the controller <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The vehicle <b>100</b> may also include an input device <b>172</b> (e.g., a gear selector such as a gear stick, gear lever, etc., brake pedal, accelerator pedal, console instrument panel, touch interface, touch panel, keyboard, combinations thereof, etc.). The input device <b>172</b>, responsive to driver input, may generate a mode request indicating a desired operating mode for the gear train. For instance, in a use-case example, the driver may shift a gear selector into a gear mode (e.g., first gear mode or second gear mode) to generate a gear set modal transition request at the controller. In response, the controller commands gear train components (e.g., the first clutch assembly <b>132</b> and the second clutch assembly <b>134</b>) to initiate a transition into a first gear mode, where the first gear set <b>127</b> is operational, from a second gear mode, where the second gear set <b>129</b> is operational, or vice versa. Other modality transitions have also been contemplated such as a modal transition into a forward drive mode from a reverse drive mode or vice versa responsive to driver input received from the input device <b>172</b>. However, in other examples more automated gear train mode transitions may be implemented. For instance, the controller may automatically place the gear train in the first gear mode or the second gear mode based on vehicle speed and/or load, for example. The controller <b>152</b> may also be configured to transition the electric drive axle system <b>102</b> into a regenerative mode. In the regenerative mode, energy is extracted from the gear train using the electric motor-generator <b>106</b> and transferred to the energy storage device <b>108</b>. For instance, the electric motor-generator <b>106</b> may be placed in a generator mode where at least a portion of the rotational energy transferred from the drive wheels to the generator by way of the gear train is converted into electrical energy. A variety of different modal control strategies have been contemplated. The power paths unfolding during the different system modes are discussed in greater detail herein with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>-<b>22</b></figref>. In one example, the controller, responsive to receiving a request to reverse or regeneration mode transition, induces engagement of a locking clutch in the first clutch assembly <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an electric drive axle system <b>200</b>.

As such, at least a portion of the functional and structural features of the electric drive axle system <b>102</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be embodied in the electric drive axle system <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> or vice versa, in certain examples.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The electric drive axle system <b>200</b> again includes an electric motor-generator <b>202</b> and a gear train <b>204</b>. The electric motor-generator <b>202</b> has an electrical interface <b>206</b> which is illustrated as a bus bar in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. However, other suitable electrical interfaces may be used, in other examples. The electric motor-generator <b>202</b> further includes a housing <b>208</b>. The gear train <b>204</b> may include an input shaft <b>210</b>, an intermediate shaft <b>212</b>, and an output shaft <b>214</b>. The input shaft <b>210</b> receives rotational input (forward or reverse drive rotation) from the electric motor-generator <b>202</b>, while the system is operating in forward and reverse drive modes. Different gears in a gear train <b>204</b> are coupled to the different shafts, expanded upon in greater detail herein with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Rotational axes <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, and <b>220</b> of the input shaft <b>210</b>, the intermediate shaft <b>212</b>, and the output shaft <b>214</b> are provided for reference in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>18</b> and <b>20</b>-<b>23</b></figref>, when applicable. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> additionally shows a planetary gear assembly <b>222</b> rotationally coupled a differential <b>224</b> in the gear train <b>204</b>. It will be appreciated that placing the planetary gear assembly <b>222</b> next to the differential <b>224</b> allows less torque to be carried through the gear train <b>204</b>, enabling the drive train to have fewer and/or smaller components, if wanted.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The planetary gear assembly <b>222</b> can achieve a targeted gear ratio (e.g., a relatively high gear ratio, such as a ratio greater than 20:1) in a compact arrangement relative to non-planetary gear arrangements. Thus, the planetary gear assembly can achieve a desired gear ratio with less components (e.g., gears and shafts) than non-planetary gear assemblies, if desired. Furthermore, in embodiments where the planetary gear assembly exhibits a relatively high torque output, the planetary assembly can attain a more compact packaging due to the load sharing between the planet gears, if desired.

The z-axis may be a vertical axis, the x-axis may be a lateral axis, and/or the y-axis may be a longitudinal axis, in one example. However, the axes may have other orientations, in other examples.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the electric drive axle system <b>200</b> with the electric motor-generator <b>202</b>, input shaft <b>210</b>, intermediate shaft <b>212</b>, output shaft <b>214</b>, and gear train <b>204</b>. The gear train <b>204</b> may include a first gear <b>300</b> coupled to the input shaft <b>210</b>. As described herein, the descriptor &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; may indicate one component is structurally coupled to or formed with another component. For instance, the first gear <b>300</b> may be machined from a flange on the input shaft <b>210</b>, in one example, or separately manufactured and subsequently mechanically attached (e.g., welded, bolted, press-fit, etc.) to the input shaft <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A second gear <b>302</b> is coupled to the intermediate shaft <b>212</b>.

Additionally, a fifth gear <b>308</b> and a sixth gear <b>310</b> are coupled to the output shaft <b>214</b>.

To elaborate, the first gear <b>300</b>, the second gear <b>302</b>, the fourth gear <b>306</b>, and the fifth gear <b>308</b> may be included in a first gear set <b>312</b>.

It will be understood that the first and the second gear sets <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> have different gear ratios. In this way, the gear train may include multiple gear ratios to increase gear train adaptability. Additionally, the gear sets may share a few common gears (i.e., the first and second gears in the illustrated embodiment). Fixing the first ratio (i.e., the first and second gears) in the gear train can allow the accuracy of the gears to be increased, if wanted, thereby reducing NVH in the axle system. However, embodiments where the gear sets do not include overlapping gears have been envisioned. Clutches, described in greater detail herein, are included in the gear train <b>204</b> to enable the first gear set <b>312</b> and the second gear set <b>314</b> to be coupled/decoupled to/from the output shaft <b>214</b>. In this way, the different gear sets may be operationally selected to, for example, more aptly suite the driving environment and/or increase electric motor efficiency. Thus, the first and second gear sets <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> may be conceptually included in a selectable gear assembly <b>316</b>.

However, gear trains with gears positioned between the planetary assembly and the differential have been contemplated. It will be appreciated that in some embodiments, the gear ratio corresponding to the planetary gear assembly <b>222</b> may be greater than the gear ratio corresponding to the first gear set <b>312</b> or the second gear set <b>314</b>. The planetary gear assembly <b>222</b> allows a desired gear ratio to be realized in a compact arrangement. For instance, the planetary gear assembly <b>222</b> may achieve a relatively high gear ratio and space efficiency, if desired. However, non-planetary gear arrangements may be used, in other examples. Furthermore, the planetary gear assembly <b>222</b> and the differential <b>224</b> are shown positioned on a lateral side <b>322</b> of a housing <b>208</b> the electric motor-generator <b>202</b>. A lateral axis <b>324</b> of the motor-generator is provided for reference. Offsetting the output shaft <b>214</b> and the intermediate shaft <b>212</b> from the input shaft <b>210</b> allows the planetary gear assembly <b>222</b> to be positioned on the side <b>322</b> of the motor-generator. It will be appreciated that the planetary gear assembly may be located adjacent to the motor's lateral side <b>322</b> due to the planetary gear assembly's ability to be integrated into the gear train without a mating gear parallel thereto, if wanted. In this way, the planetary gear assembly may be placed in a spaced which has remained unused in certain electrified gearboxes. Thus, positioning the planetary gear assembly on the side of the motor allows the compactness of the axle system to be increased. As a result, packaging constraints arising during axle installation in the vehicle may pose less of an issue. However, in other examples, the planetary gear assembly <b>222</b> may be positioned in other suitable locations. For instance, the planetary gear assembly may be coupled to a section of the output shaft extending away from the motor-generator.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a side view of the electric drive axle system <b>200</b> with the input shaft <b>210</b>, intermediate shaft <b>212</b>, and the output shaft <b>214</b>.

To elaborate, the first clutch assembly <b>800</b> includes a locking clutch <b>900</b> and a one-way clutch <b>902</b>, in the illustrated example. The one-way clutch <b>902</b> is designed to freely rotate about the output shaft <b>214</b> when receiving rotational input in a first direction (reverse drive rotational direction) from the fifth gear <b>308</b> or when it is overrun via the output shaft. The one-way clutch <b>902</b> is also configured to transfer torque to the output shaft <b>214</b> when receiving rotational input in a second direction (e.g., front drive rotational direction) from the fifth gear <b>308</b>. The one-way clutch <b>902</b> may be a sprag clutch, in one example. However, other suitable types of one-way clutches may be used in other examples, such as ratcheting clutches. Additionally, a section <b>903</b> of the output shaft <b>214</b> below the one-way clutch <b>902</b> may be locally thicker due to the contact stress and deflection of shaft along the one-way clutch, in one example. Further, in some examples, snap rings <b>905</b> may be used to axially retain the one-way clutch <b>902</b> and/or the bearing <b>700</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">An embodiment of a one-way clutch is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>. The sprag clutch <b>2300</b> includes a plurality of sprag mechanisms <b>2302</b> mounted on carrier rings <b>2304</b>. The sprag mechanisms <b>2302</b> may be spring loaded and rotate about axis <b>2306</b>. The sprag mechanisms <b>2302</b> include curved surfaces <b>2308</b> having asymmetric profiles. When the fifth gear (e.g., fifth gear <b>308</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) attached to the sprag clutch rotates in the forward drive direction, at a speed greater than the output shaft (e.g., output shaft <b>214</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>), the curved surfaces <b>2308</b> frictionally engage an outer surface of the output shaft and an inner surface of the fifth gear to allow the fifth gear and the output shaft to rotate in unison. Contrariwise, when the fifth gear is rotated in the reverse drive direction or the output shaft speed exceeds the gear speed, the curved surfaces <b>2308</b> in the sprag mechanisms <b>2302</b> disengage and allow the fifth gear <b>308</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, to freewheel with regard to the output shaft <b>214</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, referred to herein as a freewheel configuration. The sprag clutch allows for quick and robust engagement between the clutch and the shaft when transitioning from the freewheel configuration to the engaged configuration. The sprag clutch may also have less drag in the freewheel configuration when compared to other types of one-way clutches, such as one-way clutches including ratcheting mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The locking clutch <b>900</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, is designed to rotationally couple and decouple the fifth gear <b>308</b> from the output shaft <b>214</b>. To elaborate, the locking clutch <b>900</b> may be a dog clutch with teeth <b>904</b> on an axially adjustable shift collar <b>906</b> designed to mate with teeth <b>908</b> in the fifth gear <b>308</b> when engaged. Conversely, when the dog clutch is disengaged the teeth <b>904</b> on the shift collar <b>906</b> may be spaced away from the teeth <b>908</b> on the fifth gear <b>308</b>. The teeth <b>908</b> are shown positioned radially inward from gear teeth <b>909</b> on the fifth gear <b>308</b>. However, other arrangements of the clutch teeth on the fifth gear may be used, in other examples. The bearing <b>700</b> (e.g., needle roller bearing) coupled to the fifth gear <b>308</b> is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. It will be appreciated that the bearing <b>700</b> may pilot the one-way clutch <b>902</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The shift collar <b>906</b> may be rotationally attached to the output shaft <b>214</b> by way of an indexing shaft <b>910</b>. Furthermore, the indexing shaft <b>910</b> may be attached to the output shaft via press-fitting, a splined interface, combinations thereof, etc. The indexing shaft <b>910</b> may therefore be fixedly coupled to the output shaft <b>214</b> and co-rotate therewith during gear train operation. Although, in the illustrated embodiment, the shift collar <b>906</b> is designed to axially translate along the indexing shaft <b>910</b> during locking clutch engagement and disengagement, it will be understood that locking clutch (e.g., dog clutch) embodiments where the clutch is configured for radially translation during actuation have been envisioned. In such an example, the clutch's sleeve may be a radially translating sleeve with involute or straight teeth.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">An actuator <b>911</b> (e.g., shift fork) is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> coupled to the locking clutch <b>900</b>. Various types of actuators have been envisioned such as an electromagnetic actuator (e.g., a solenoid), a hydraulic actuator, a pneumatic actuator, combinations thereof, etc. Thus, the actuator <b>911</b> may be designed to place the shift collar <b>906</b> in an engaged configuration where teeth <b>904</b> are mated with the teeth <b>908</b> in the fifth gear <b>308</b>. Furthermore, the locking clutch <b>900</b> is designed with self-indexing functionality to provide smoother clutch engagement. To elaborate, the clutch may be designed with features for reducing the chance of (e.g., avoiding) clutch teeth misalignment. As a result, clutch NVH caused by clutch teeth misalignment is reduced and the likelihood of a blocked condition impeding clutch engagement is significantly reduced (e.g., avoided). To achieve the self-indexing clutch engagement the clutch includes tapered teeth and an indexing mechanism allowing the teeth to land in a desired mated position when transitioning into an engaged (e.g., &#x201c;locked&#x201d;) configuration. These features are discussed in greater detail herein with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>18</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">A thrust bearing <b>912</b> (e.g., needle roller thrust bearing) is also shown positioned at an interface between the indexing shaft <b>910</b> and the fifth gear <b>308</b> to enable a desired spacing to be maintained between the components while allowing rotation therebetween. Additionally, the thrust bearing <b>912</b> may be preloaded via a spring <b>914</b> (e.g., a wave spring, helical spring, elastomeric spring, etc.). However, other suitable gear train arrangements may be used in other examples such as gear trains where the spring <b>914</b> and/or thrust bearing <b>912</b> are omitted. A bearing <b>916</b> (e.g., a fixed bearing) is also shown attached to an extension <b>918</b> (e.g., axial extension) of the fifth gear <b>308</b> interfacing with the one-way clutch <b>902</b>. However, in other examples the bearing <b>916</b> may be omitted from the gear train. The bearing <b>916</b> is specifically depicted as a ball bearing. The ball bearing may be used in the system, due to cost and packaging. However, the bearing <b>916</b> may be a spherical roller bearing, a tapered roller bearing, four point contact bearing, etc., in other embodiments. In one example, the bearing <b>916</b> may be fixed on both sides to allow the spring <b>914</b> to apply a preload to the thrust bearing <b>912</b> and the sixth gear <b>310</b>. The one-way clutch <b>902</b> is also shown positioned between the extension <b>918</b> of the fifth gear <b>308</b> and an outer surface <b>919</b> of the output shaft <b>214</b>. However, alternate locations of the one-way clutch have been contemplated.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The second clutch assembly <b>802</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> as a wet friction clutch. Using a wet friction clutch enables load transfer in both forward and reverse directions, allowing the drive train to forego a locking clutch in the second clutch assembly, in some instances. However, alternate types of clutches such as hydraulic clutches, electromagnetic clutches, and the like may be deployed, in other arrangements. The wet friction clutch includes friction plates <b>920</b> engaging one another when the clutch is activated to transfer torque from the sixth gear <b>310</b> to the output shaft <b>214</b>. Likewise, when the wet friction clutch is disengaged, the friction plates <b>920</b> are frictionally decoupled and torque transfer from the sixth gear <b>310</b> to the output shaft <b>214</b> is inhibited. To elaborate, a first set of friction plates <b>921</b> are coupled to the sixth gear <b>310</b> and a second set of friction plates <b>923</b> are coupled to the output shaft <b>214</b> to enable coupling/decoupling action in the clutch.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Various bearings may enable the wet friction clutch to be rotated as well as provide axial and radial support to the clutch. The bearing corresponding to the wet friction clutch may include for example, a pilot bearing <b>922</b> (e.g., floating pilot bearing), a roller bearing <b>924</b> (e.g., needle roller bearing, a thrust bearing <b>926</b> (e.g., needle roller thrust bearing), and a roller bearing <b>928</b>.

As such, the gear train's gear ratio may be adjusted as desired based on vehicle operating conditions, driver input, etc.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, showing the planetary gear assembly <b>222</b> rotationally coupled to the output shaft <b>214</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> also illustrates the planetary gear assembly <b>222</b> with a sun gear <b>810</b> rotationally coupled to output shaft <b>214</b>. The sun gear <b>810</b> is rotationally coupled to planet gears <b>812</b> residing on planet pins <b>814</b> on a carrier <b>816</b>. In turn, the carrier <b>816</b> is shown coupled to the differential <b>224</b>. However, planetary arrangements with other components (e.g., carrier or annulus) coupled to the output shaft <b>214</b> and other components (e.g., sun gear or annulus) coupled to the differential <b>224</b>, have been envisioned. The planetary gear assembly <b>222</b> also includes an annulus <b>818</b> rotationally interacting with the planet gears <b>812</b>. Bearings <b>820</b> (e.g., needle roller bearings) arranged between the planet pins <b>814</b> and the planet gears <b>812</b> may allow the planet gears to rotate.

However, planetary gear arrangements where alternate components are held fixed and alternate components are allowed to rotate may be utilized, in other examples. For instance, the annulus may be allowed to freely rotate and the carrier may be held stationary, in one example, or the sun gear may be held stationary and the carrier and the annulus may be allowed to rotate, in other examples. In one embodiment, the components in the planetary gear assembly that are allowed to rotate and held stationary may not be adjustable. To elaborate, the components in the planetary gear assembly that are allowed to rotate and held substantially stationary may remain in the same state (a substantially fixed state or a rotational state) during gear train operation, in some embodiments. The planetary gear assembly can therefore achieve even greater space efficiency, in such an embodiment. In other embodiments, planetary components whose fixed/rotational state can be adjusted during gear train operation have also been contemplated.

As such, the surfaces <b>1026</b> and <b>1028</b> of the teeth <b>1014</b> and <b>1018</b> may be planar in one example. However, in other examples, at least a portion of the surfaces of the teeth may be curved.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The angles <b>1022</b> and <b>1024</b> may be selected based on various parameters, such as the actuator force imparted to the shift collar via the locking clutch actuator (e.g., shift fork) and/or the spring force of an indexing mechanism in the locking clutch, for example. In one use-case example, the angle <b>1022</b> and/or the angle <b>1024</b> may be greater than 5&#xb0;. In another use-case example, the angle <b>1022</b> and/or the angle <b>1024</b> may be between 20&#xb0; and 40&#xb0;. However, numerous suitable angles and angle ranges have been contemplated. It will also be appreciated that the angle <b>1022</b> and the angle <b>1024</b> may be substantially equivalent, in some embodiments, to allow the teeth to smoothly engage and induce shift collar indexing. However, in other examples, the angle <b>1022</b> may not be substantially equivalent to the angle <b>1024</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> specifically depicts the toothed face <b>1002</b> in the gear <b>1004</b> and the toothed face <b>1006</b> in the shift collar <b>1008</b> in a blocked condition where the ends of the teeth in the gear and the shift collar are aligned (e.g., substantially aligned along axes <b>1025</b>) such that they are impeding the gear and collar from mating. It will be appreciated that there may be no relative motion between the indexing shaft and the gear <b>1004</b> when the one-way clutch (e.g., the one-way clutch <b>902</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) coupled to the output shaft (e.g., output shaft <b>214</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) is engaged. Therefore, if the one-way clutch is engaged when the teeth of the locking clutch (toothed face <b>1002</b> and toothed face <b>1006</b>) are in a blocked condition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, indexing of the shift collar may be needed to enable clutch engagement. As such, the locking clutch includes an indexing mechanism allowing for relative motion between the shift collar and the indexing shaft during clutch engagement. The indexing mechanism is described in greater detail herein with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>16</b> and <b>18</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, due to the tapered profiles of the teeth in the toothed face <b>1002</b> and the toothed face <b>1006</b> as well as an indexing mechanism, the teeth <b>1018</b> in the shift collar <b>1008</b> are allowed to move (e.g., rotate such that their radial position is altered) with regard the teeth <b>1014</b> in the gear <b>1004</b>. As a result, the teeth <b>1018</b> in the shift collar <b>1008</b> and the teeth <b>1014</b> in the gear <b>1004</b> slide toward a mated position where the teeth are in a targeted engagement position. Specifically, the surface <b>1028</b> of the tooth <b>1014</b> slides along the surface <b>1026</b> of the tooth <b>1014</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows the locking clutch <b>1000</b> in an engaged configuration where the teeth <b>1014</b> in the gear <b>1004</b> and the teeth <b>1018</b> in the shift collar <b>1008</b>. When engaged, the ends <b>1016</b> of the teeth <b>1014</b> are adjacent to (e.g., abut) a face <b>1200</b> in a clutch recess <b>1202</b> of the shift collar <b>1008</b>. Conversely, during engagement the ends <b>1020</b> of the teeth <b>1018</b> are adjacent to (e.g., abut) a face <b>1204</b> in a clutch recess <b>1206</b> in the gear <b>1004</b>. In this way, the teeth in the locking clutch <b>1000</b> are allowed to smoothly land in a desired mated position. Consequently, the NVH occurring during clutch engagement is reduced and the chance of tooth misalignment occurring during clutch engagement is decreased. It will be appreciated that the gear <b>1004</b> and the shift collar <b>1008</b> may be constructed out of a metal such as steel, iron, aluminum, combinations thereof, etc. in one example.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows an example of an indexing shaft <b>1300</b> in the locking clutch <b>1000</b> as well as another section of the shift collar <b>1008</b>. The indexing shaft <b>1300</b> includes a spline <b>1302</b> with teeth <b>1304</b> coupled to a spline <b>1306</b> with teeth <b>1308</b> in the shift collar <b>1008</b>. An indexing mechanism <b>1310</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> including a spring loaded ball <b>1312</b>. The spring loaded ball <b>1312</b> interfaces with a ramp <b>1314</b> in the spline <b>1306</b> of the shift collar <b>1008</b>. The spring loaded ball <b>1312</b> is designed to retract into the indexing shaft <b>1300</b> during clutch engagement to allow the shift collar <b>1008</b> to index with regard to the indexing shaft <b>1300</b>. In turn, when the shift collar indexes, teeth <b>1018</b> in the shift collar <b>1008</b> can land in a desired position to seamlessly mate with teeth <b>1014</b> in the gear <b>1004</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows a detailed view of the indexing shaft <b>1300</b> with the spline <b>1302</b> having the teeth <b>1304</b>. The indexing mechanism <b>1310</b> is again shown. The indexing mechanism <b>1310</b> is specifically illustrated including two spring loaded balls <b>1312</b> which are axially aligned along the shaft. However, indexing mechanisms with an alternate number and/or arrangement of spring loaded balls have been envisioned. For instance, the balls, in another embodiment, may be positioned side by side by side such that they have a similar axial position but different radial positions. Further still in another embodiment, additional balls may be included in the indexing mechanism, such as balls arranged at different radial positions (e.g., symmetric radial positions) on the indexing mechanism. The spring loading of the balls may be selected, in one example, to prevent self-indexing resulting from inertial load during gear train operation but allow for indexing during clutch engagement. In this way, the indexing mechanism allows the shift collar to index when needed and inhibits indexing during other gear train operating conditions. The material construction, shape, and/or size of the springs may be selected to achieve a desired spring rate.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> also shows a park gear <b>1400</b> arranged on the indexing shaft <b>1300</b>. However, it will be appreciated that in other examples, the park gear may be omitted from the indexing shaft.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the indexing mechanism <b>1310</b> in the locking clutch <b>1000</b>. The shift collar <b>1008</b> and the indexing shaft <b>1300</b> are again illustrated. Additionally, the ball <b>1312</b> and a spring <b>1500</b> positioned in a recess <b>1502</b> of the indexing shaft <b>1300</b> are also illustrated. It will be understood that the spring <b>1500</b> is configured to exert an outward radial force on the ball <b>1312</b>. The spring <b>1500</b> may be a helical spring, a wave spring, an elastomeric spring, combinations thereof, etc. It will be appreciated that the ball <b>1312</b> may retract at least partially into the recess <b>1502</b> during indexing. As such, the diameter <b>1504</b> of the recess <b>1502</b> may be larger than the diameter <b>1506</b> of the ball <b>1312</b>. Furthermore, the ball <b>1312</b> is shown interacting with the ramp <b>1314</b> in the shift collar <b>1008</b> to maintain the shift collar <b>1008</b> in a non-indexed position with regard to the indexing shaft <b>1300</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> additionally illustrates the spline <b>1306</b> in the shift collar <b>1008</b> mated with the spline <b>1302</b> (e.g., torque carrying member) in the indexing shaft <b>1300</b> via teeth <b>1304</b> and <b>1308</b>. However, the specific profile of the spline <b>1302</b> (e.g., torque carrying member) in the indexing shaft may take a variety of forms. For instance, spline <b>1302</b> may have an involute shape, a tab shape, a pin shape, a tongue and groove shape, etc. Regardless of the specific shape of the splines, the splines <b>1302</b> and <b>1306</b> are profiled with backlash <b>1508</b> therebetween. Backlash indicates a gap between sequential teeth in an interface. In this way, the relative radial position of the indexing shaft <b>1300</b> and the shift collar <b>1008</b> may be changed during certain conditions. Put another way, the splines may be profiled to achieve rotational compliance and allow for indexing between the indexing shaft <b>1300</b> and the shift collar <b>1008</b>. The amount of backlash between the teeth of the splines may be selected to enable the shift collar teeth in the clutch to rotate by a desired degree such that the teeth shift from a blocked position to a mated position during clutch engagement.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The ball <b>1312</b> is shown mated with the ramp <b>1314</b> where the backlash <b>1508</b> is at or near a larger value (e.g., maximum value). However, when an axial load on the clutch teeth <b>1014</b> and <b>1018</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, exerted via an actuator (e.g., actuator <b>911</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) such as a shift fork, exceeds the spring force of the spring <b>1500</b> coupled to the ball <b>1312</b>, the shift collar <b>1008</b> indexes with regard to the indexing shaft <b>1300</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> also shows an interior spline <b>1510</b> that may be configured to mate with a spline in an output shaft (e.g., output shaft <b>214</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). Thus, the indexing shaft <b>1300</b> co-rotates with the output shaft.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows another cross-sectional view of the indexing shaft <b>1300</b> and the shift collar <b>1008</b> in the locking clutch <b>1000</b>. It will be appreciated that the cross-section shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is viewed from an opposite axial side of the shaft and collar arrangement in comparison to the cross-sectional view, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, an arrangement between the indexing shaft <b>1300</b> and the shift collar <b>1008</b> where the backlash <b>1508</b> is decreased to allow the teeth <b>1014</b> and <b>1018</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, in the locking clutch <b>1000</b> to land in a mated position, is illustrated. In other words, the distance between sequential mated spline surfaces is decreased to enable the indexing shaft and shift collar arrangement to gain compliance for a smooth landing between faces in the clutch. To gain the compliance, the ramp <b>1314</b> in the indexing mechanism <b>1310</b> pushes the ball <b>1312</b> at least partially into the recess <b>1502</b>, thereby compression the spring <b>1500</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows another example of a gear <b>1700</b> and a shift collar <b>1702</b> in a locking clutch <b>1704</b>. It will be understood that the gear <b>1700</b> and shift collar <b>1702</b> may be examples of the fifth gear <b>308</b> and the shift collar <b>906</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, and therefore may be included in the gear train <b>204</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>9</b></figref>. Again, the gear <b>1700</b> includes a body <b>1706</b> with a plurality of teeth <b>1708</b> extending therefrom and the shift collar <b>1702</b> includes a body <b>1710</b> with a plurality of teeth <b>1712</b> extending therefrom. The teeth <b>1708</b> in the gear <b>1700</b> are again tapered at their ends <b>1714</b> (e.g., distal ends). Likewise, the teeth <b>1712</b> in the shift collar <b>1702</b> are also tapered at their ends <b>1716</b>. However, the teeth <b>1708</b> include two tapered surfaces <b>1718</b> and <b>1720</b>. To elaborate, for each tooth the tapered surfaces are shown converging at apexes <b>1722</b>. However, in other examples, the ends of the teeth may have a flat (e.g., blunt surface) or curved surfaced at their convergence. Additionally, the tapered surfaces <b>1718</b> and <b>1720</b> are shown arranged at a similar angle <b>1724</b> with regard to a radial plane. However, embodiments where the surfaces have different angles have been contemplated. The teeth <b>1712</b> also include two tapered surfaces <b>1728</b> and <b>1730</b> converging at an apex <b>1732</b>. The angles <b>1734</b> of the tapered surfaces <b>1728</b> and <b>1730</b> may be similar (e.g., substantially equivalent) to the angles <b>1724</b>. Furthermore, the teeth in the gear and shift collar shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> are in a blocked condition where the apexes <b>1722</b> and <b>1732</b> of the teeth are axially aligned with one another.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> shows an indexing mechanism <b>1800</b> included in the shift collar <b>1702</b> and an indexing shaft <b>1802</b> of the locking clutch <b>1704</b>. The indexing mechanism <b>1800</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> again includes a ball <b>1804</b> and a spring <b>1806</b> housed in a recess <b>1808</b>. The indexing mechanism <b>1800</b> also includes a bi-directional ramp <b>1810</b> with two angled surfaces <b>1812</b> converging at an apex <b>1814</b>. The ball <b>1804</b> is shown aligned with the apex <b>1814</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. However, when the shift collar <b>1702</b> is axial loaded, during clutch engagement, and the resulting radial load from the tapered teeth exceeds the spring force on the ball <b>1804</b>, the shift collar <b>1702</b> indexes in either direction <b>1816</b> or direction <b>1818</b>. In this way, the indexing mechanism <b>1800</b> may function as an over-center device.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> shows a method <b>1900</b> for operation of an electric drive axle system. The method <b>1900</b> may be implemented by one or more of the electric drive axle systems, components, etc., described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>18</b></figref>, in one embodiment, or may be implemented by another suitable electric drive axle, in other embodiments. Furthermore, the method <b>1900</b> may be implemented by a controller including a process and memory, as previously discussed.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">At <b>1902</b>, the method includes determining operating conditions. The operating conditions may include a locking clutch position, friction clutch position, brake pedal position, accelerator pedal positon, one-way clutch state, vehicle speed, vehicle load, motor-generator temperature, motor-generator output speed, battery state of charge, etc.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Next at <b>1904</b>, the method includes determining whether to engage the locking clutch. Such a determination may take into account the operating conditions. For instance, in one use-case example, it may be determined that locking clutch engagement is desired responsive to receiving a reverse gear shift request generated via a gear selector or other suitable input device. In other examples, the vehicle controller may determine the vehicle is slated to operate in a regeneration mode responsive to brake pedal actuation or accelerator pedal release, for example.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">If it is determined that the locking clutch should not be engaged (NO at <b>1904</b>), the method proceeds to <b>1906</b>, where the method includes maintaining locking clutch disengagement.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Conversely, if it is determined that the locking clutch should be engaged (YES at <b>1904</b>) the method advances to <b>1908</b> where the method includes transitioning the locking clutch into an engaged state. It will be appreciated, that in one example, the one-way clutch may be engaged when the locking clutch transitions into an engaged state. In this example, the relative position between the indexing shaft and the fifth gear may remain substantially fixed. Therefore, if after one-way clutch engagement, the tapered clutch teeth in the shift collar and the gear are in a blocked or partially blocked position they may remain blocked until the locking clutch transitions into a locked state. As such, during locking clutch engagement, if the clutch teeth are in a blocked or partially blocked state, the tapered ends of the teeth and the indexing mechanism in the locking clutch work in conjunction to smoothly transition the gear teeth into the locked state.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>-<b>22</b></figref> show the gear train <b>204</b> operating in different modes. As such, the gear train <b>204</b> may be placed in different operational modes via a controller, such as the controller <b>152</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The modes may include a first gear mode where the first gear set <b>312</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, transfers rotational energy between the electric motor-generator <b>202</b> and the planetary gear assembly <b>222</b>. The modes may also include a second gear mode where the second gear set <b>314</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, transfers rotational energy between the electric motor-generator <b>202</b> to the planetary gear assembly <b>222</b>. The modalities may also be partitioned based on a reverse and forward drive motor arrangement. To elaborate, the electric motor-generator <b>202</b> may produce rotational output in a first direction corresponding to forward drive and may produce rotational output in a second direction opposing the first corresponding to reverse drive. As such, the gear train modalities may include a forward drive first gear mode, a reverse drive first gear mode, a forward drive second gear mode, and/or a reverse drive second gear mode. It will also be understood that the gear train may be operated in a regenerative mode where torque input from the drive wheels, such as the drive wheels <b>128</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, is transferred to the electric motor-generator and the electric motor-generator converts at least a portion of the drive train's rotational energy into electrical energy. In turn, in the regenerative mode the electric energy may be transferred from the motor-generator to an energy storage device, such as the energy storage device <b>108</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, illustrating the gear train <b>204</b> of the electric drive axle system <b>200</b> arranged in forward drive first gear mode where the electric motor-generator <b>202</b> produces forward drive rotational output, the second clutch assembly <b>802</b> is disengaged, and the first clutch assembly <b>800</b> is engaged (e.g., configured to transfer energy from the fifth gear <b>308</b> to the output shaft <b>214</b> via the one-way clutch <b>902</b>).

It will be understood, that the one-way clutch <b>902</b> is overrun due to the ratio of the mesh between the third gear <b>304</b> and sixth gear <b>310</b> being lower than the ratio of the mesh between the fourth gear <b>306</b> and the fifth gear <b>308</b>, resulting in no load being transferred between the fourth and fifth gear.
