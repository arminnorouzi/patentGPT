In alternative embodiments, provided are therapeutic combinations or formulations of drugs comprising triple monoamine reuptake inhibitors (TRIs) (which inhibits the reuptake of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine via blocking central serotonin transporter (SERT), dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET)), melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHRT) antagonists and diazoxide or diazoxide or its formulations, and various combinations thereof, and these in combination with other drugs or active agents. In alternative embodiments, provided are methods for administering triple monoamine reuptake inhibitors (TRIs), melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHRT) antagonists or diazoxide or its formulations, whose dosages are determined using a method as provided herein including empirical methods for safe and predictable titration and to determine the initial therapeutic dose; model-based methods for safe and predictable titration and to determine the initial therapeutic dose and to determine the lowest therapeutic dose or to determine an optimal effective dose, including use of Bayesian pharmacometric models. In alternative embodiments, provided are methods for the treatment of various conditions, including genetic confirmed syndromes, and diseases, using therapeutic combinations and formulations of drugs as provided herein. In alternative embodiments, provided are PK-guided, precision dosing methods using the above mentioned pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation methods, or similar modeling and simulation methods, and a population PK/PD model of formula I to treat hyperphagia, hyperphagia in PWS, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), obesity in hypothalamic-injury induced obesity, and binge eating disorder (BED) with an oral dosage of Formula I or deuterated versions thereof.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare, serious, complex genetic neurodevelopment disorder present in 1/15,000 to 1/30,000 individuals. PWS is caused by the loss of paternally expressed genes on chromosome 15q11-13. In approximately 70% of cases, PWS is due to a paternal deletion at 15q11-q13. Approximately 25% of PWS cases are due to maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD), or when both copies of chromosome 15 are inherited from the mother, and 5% to translocations or imprinting center mutations.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Today, the only therapy currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat PWS is human growth hormone, which is used to increase linear growth. There are no therapies approved to treat the hallmark features of PWS, specifically hyperphagia, anxiety, and obsessive and compulsive symptoms. There is no approved pharmaceutical treatment for hyperphagia or associated behavioral symptoms associated with PWS.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Hypothalamic obesity or Hypothalamic injury-induced obesity (HO or HIO) is caused by injury to the hypothalamus. The most common cause is related to a rare non-cancerous tumor called a craniopharyngioma. When this tumor is removed, the hypothalamus can get damaged leading to the symptoms of hypothalamic obesity, a disorder sharing many aspects of the phenotype of PWS, such as hyperphagia, excessive day time sleepiness, ADHD, autonomic imbalance; growth hormone-, gonadotropins and thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiency.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Narcolepsy, a chronic, disabling neurologic disorder of hypersomnolence affects an estimated 20-67 people per 100,000 worldwide. The onset of narcolepsy most commonly occurs in the second decade of life, though diagnosis is often delayed by several years. Symptoms of narcolepsy include excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), which, although not specific to narcolepsy, is a characteristic of the disorder present in all patients, as it is a requirement for diagnosis. Cataplexy, an involuntary loss of muscle tone during wakefulness that is typically evoked by strong emotions, occurs in up to 60% of patients. Other symptoms are disturbed night-time sleep; hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations, which occur while falling asleep and waking up, respectively; and sleep paralysis. There is no cure for narcolepsy. Various medications modulating the monoamine systems such as serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and histamine, and &#x3b3;-aminobutyric acid B (GABAB) receptors have been used in clinic to manage the symptoms. It is believed that narcolepsy especially narcolepsy with cataplexy is attributed to the deficiency of orexin/hypocretin.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Getting the optimal dose for an individual patient is very important to achieve the clinical benefit and minimize adverse events. Due to the individual variance in body weight, body composition, metabolic enzyme CYP P450 polymorphism, drug transporters such as PGP polymorphism, drug-drug integration with the use of multiple drugs, it is challenging for physicians to prescribe the optimal dose to a patient and often involve empirical titration which is inefficient to find the optimal dose. It is more challenging for pediatric, intellectually disabled and clinically fragile patients.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The case of tesofensine underscores the importance of dosing to achieve clinical benefit and minimize adverse events. Initial clinical studies with tesofensine using standard dosing showed some promise in managing weight in HIO and hyperphagia in PWS (Saniona Corporation Presentation June 2020). However, disclosed data also showed that the plasma drug concentrations can vary significantly in PWS patients (Saniona Corporation Presentation March 2019). By just using a standard mg/day dosing, 2/3 patients had plasma drug levels exceeding the safety levels and discontinued the treatment due to adverse events (excessive increase of dopamine due to DAT inhibition can cause CNS side effect or exacerbate existing CNS disorders in patients), while the patients with the appropriate plasma drug level had the hyperphagia controlled completely. On the other hand, also in the case of tesofensine, using standard mg/day dosing, lowering the dosing for all patients led to no efficacy.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">New paradigms are needed to ensure safe and effective dosage regimens for these high risk patients.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In alternative embodiments, provided are therapeutic combinations, pharmaceutical dosage forms, drug delivery devices or products of manufacture, comprising one or more of any of the active agents or drugs comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0011">(a) (i) a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor (TRI) and a melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) antagonist or inhibitor,        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0012">(ii) a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor (TRI) and a diazoxide (or PROGLYCEM&#x2122;) or a diazoxide Choline Controlled-Release (DCCR formulation),</li>            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0013">(iii) a melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) antagonist or inhibitor and a diazoxide (or PROGLYCEM&#x2122;) or a diazoxide Choline Controlled-Release (DCCR formulation), or</li>            <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0014">(iv) a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor (TRI) a melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) antagonist or inhibitor, and, a diazoxide (or PROGLYCEM&#x2122;) or a diazoxide Choline Controlled-Release (DCCR formulation);

Thus, a preparation of a compound will inherently contain small amounts of deuterated isotopologues. For compounds as provided herein, or as used to practice methods as provided herein, which include pharmaceutical preparations and formulations, when a particular position is designated as having deuterium (&#x201c;-D&#x201d;), it is understood that the abundance of deuterium at that position is greater than, or substantially greater than, the natural abundance of deuterium, which is 0.015%. For example, alternative embodiments of the invention comprise analogs of drugs or compounds as provided herein, or drugs or compounds used to practice methods as provided herein, having greater than 0.02%, or greater than about 0.1% deuterium. In one embodiment, the deuterium substitution, or &#x201c;enrichment&#x201d;, occurs at a specific position or positions. In one embodiment, the deuterium enrichment is no less than about 1%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95% or more or between about 1% and 100%.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0451">In one embodiment, the deuterated (or otherwise substituted) compounds as provided herein, or as used to practice methods as provided herein have a slower rate of metabolism, for example, slower rate of hydroxylation, than a corresponding protonated (non-deuterated, non-substituted) compound.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0452">Regarding providing novel sites for deuterating Formula II, a significant metabolic pathway of Formula II was found to comprise its N-acetylation via N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT-2), which produces 1-(2-acetyl-5-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-pyrido[4,3-b]indol-7-yl)-4-((5-fluoropyridin-2-yl)methoxy)pyridin-2(1H)-one, i.e., the structure below:</p><p id="p-0175" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00020" num="00020"><img id="EMI-C00020" he="41.99mm" wi="75.35mm" file="US20230002377A1-20230105-C00020.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0176" num="0453">The amount of this metabolite was found to be very significant comparing to parent compound Formula II in healthy volunteers in phase I clinical trial. This metabolite does not contribute to the pharmacology of MCHR1 antagonism. Combining Formula II with a NAT-2 inhibitor such as acetaminophen is expected to reduce this metabolite and increase the effective concentration of Formula II in patients, hence lowering the dose needed. By substituting the hydrogens with deuterium on the carbon(s) adjacent to the nitrogen which is acetylated (see for example, Examples 5 to 7), acetylation process can be slowed down to reduce the formation of this metabolite.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Stereoisomers</heading><p id="p-0177" num="0454">In alternative embodiments, compounds, active agents or drugs as provided herein, or as used to practice methods as provided herein, exist as (comprise) individual respective stereoisomers that are substantially free from another possible stereoisomer.

Central transporter occupancy is a powerful pharmacodynamic marker to assess the target engagement of a transporter inhibitor and guide the dosing in efficacy clinical trials. Occupancies measured by positron emission tomography (PET) has been reported for several reuptake inhibitors. SERT occupancy of 65-85% are reported at the efficacious doses of SSRIs and SSNRIs (Meyer J H et al, Am J Psychiatry. 2004 May; 161(5):826-35; Herold N et al, J Neural Transm (Vienna). 2006 May; 113(5):659-70; Klein N et al, Psychopharmacology (Berl). 2007 April; 191(2):333-9.). Interestingly, SERT occupancy by clinical doses of sibutramine is of modest magnitude of 25-46%, implying that serotonin reuptake inhibition may be necessary but is not sufficient for sibutramine's efficacy in humans, supporting preclinical data that the hypophagic effect requires the co-inhibition of both SERT and NET (Talbot P S et al, Neuropsychopharmacology. 2010 February; 35(3):741-51). DAT occupancy are reported for bupropion (14-26%), modafinil (51-57%) and methylphenidate (40-74%) at various approved doses (Volkow N D et al, Am J Psychiatry. 1998 October; 155(10):1325-31; Kim W et al, Int J Neuropsychopharmacol. 2014 May; 17(5):697-703, Kim W et al, Int J Neuropsychopharmacol. 2014 May; 17(5):697-703.). DAT occupancy of 50%-70% for tesofensine was reported and suggested as the optimal weight loss doses (Appel L et al, Eur Neuropsychopharmacol. 2014 February; 24(2):251-61). The radioligand for NET was just recently developed which allowed for the assessment of NET occupancy. At efficacious doses, the NET occupancies were reported ranging from approximately 30-50% for duloxetine (Moriguchi S et al, Int J Neuropsychopharmacol. 2017 Dec. 1; 20(12):957-962) and 8-61% for venlafaxine (Arakawa 2014). The reported transporter occupancy range for approved monoamine reuptake inhibitors referenced above are summarized in Table 9 for the purpose of easier viewing.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Reported Transporter Occupancy Range for Approved Monoamine</entry></row><row><entry>Reuptake Inhibitors at Efficacious Doses</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Range</entry><entry>SERT</entry><entry>DAT</entry><entry>NET</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Lowest</entry><entry>25%</entry><entry>14% (Bupropion)</entry><entry>8% (Venlafaxine)</entry></row><row><entry>Occupancy</entry><entry>(Sibutramine)</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>65% (SSRIs)</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Highest</entry><entry>85%</entry><entry>74%</entry><entry>61%</entry></row><row><entry>Occupancy</entry><entry>(Sertraline)</entry><entry>(Methylphenidate)</entry><entry>(Venlafaxine)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0266" num="0577">The PET study was a part of a strategy in previous clinical development of the compound of formula I to evaluate in healthy male volunteers with respect to safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics as well as DAT and SERT occupancy.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0578">In the study, SERT occupancy of 65-75% were reached for multiple doses of 30-60 mg the compound of formula I at steady state. Pronounced and dose-dependent DAT occupancies were achieved with up to about 60% following multiple doses of 60 mg the compound of formula I. A near linear relationship between plasma the compound of formula I concentration and DAT occupancies, using of the individual values, is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. The relationship between plasma the compound of formula I concentration and SERT occupancies, using the individual values, is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The numeric values for the individual SERT and DST occupancy and the corresponding plasma concentrations are tabulated in Example 12.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0579">Although notable variabilities of plasma concentrations of a compound of Formula I versus doses were observed in a few cohorts as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, generally, the magnitude of the plasma concentrations corresponded well with the magnitude of the estimated occupancies. This PK/PD relationship established will be used to guide the dosing in the future studies.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0580">When the PET study was initiated there were no adequate methods available to estimate NET occupancy in the human brain. Based on ex vivo occupancy data in the brain of mice, however, it is expected that the NET occupancies are almost in line with the DAT occupancies after administration of a compound of Formula I.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0581">Taken together the results of this PET study and the preclinical results, it is concluded that Formula I is a potent, competitive and selective triple reuptake inhibitor of DAT, SERT and NET in human. Further, Formula I has a unique profile of triple reuptake inhibition that will allow for dosing within the therapeutic ranges of approved single and dual SERT, DAT and NET inhibitors in efficacious doses. Particularly, Formula I can achieve near efficacious level of SERT occupancy seen in SSRIs across a safe dosing range while allowing for dialing in DAT occupancy up to approximately 60% in the PET study conducted in healthy males. This unique TRI profile of Formula I allows for the flexibility in gradual titration for better tolerability and efficacy tailored to individual patient.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0582">Given the near linear relationship between plasma concentrations and DAT occupancies, the anticipated large variation in dose and plasma drug concentration, using a concentration-controlled dosing approach, utilizing the PK/PD relationship established in the PET study of Formula I, can provide precision dosing to individual patients with optimal outcome.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0583">Example 1, above, describes exemplary methods and compositions for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome and related disorders, and Example 2, above, describes methods and compositions for the treatment of hypothalamic injury-induced obesity (HO) and related disorders, with Formula I as described herein and a deuterated analogue thereof, for example, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0584">A patient is given a subtherapeutic dose between 1 mg to 20 mg per day for one day, one week, two weeks, three weeks or four weeks. Blood sample is taken periodically to determine drug concentration at steady state and to determine the nearest target dose needed to achieve DAT occupancy of between 15% to 75% with or without the aid of a pharmocometrics modelling method that also utilizes the PK/PD data; optionally the near target dose is determined by achieving a plasma drug concentration value between 100 ng/ml to 4000 ng/ml at steady state; optionally the near target dose is determined by achieving a plasma drug concentration value between 200 ng/ml to 2000 ng/ml at steady state; optionally the near target dose is determined by achieving a plasma drug concentration value between 400 ng/ml to 2000 ng/ml at steady state. Every 3 months or 6 months, or when a patient has significant changes in medications, body weight and other physical changes can impact the drug absorption and metabolism, blood drug level will be retested to adjust the dosing if necessary; optionally, patients will start a low dose of between 5 mg to 20 mg per day and gradually increase dose by 5 mg or 10 mg or 20 mg interval until safely reach efficacy for hyperphagia and/or neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms. A clinician can accelerate titration, slow down the titrate if necessary, and re-accelerate titration later based on the tolerability of the patient.</p><heading id="h-0046" level="1">Example 11</heading><p id="p-0274" num="0585">In alternative embodiments, provided are methods comprising administering a drug in an amount sufficient to achieve a therapeutic level range of plasma concentration (optionally human plasma concentration) at a steady state, and this example describes an exemplary analytical method to determine the concentration of Formula I in human plasma using an LC-MS-MS method known to the people skilled in the art, and an exemplary bioanalysis method to determine the concentration of formula I in human EDTA plasma.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0586">A LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the quantitation of Formula I in 0.250 mL of human EDTA plasma in a total of 7 runs, out of which 1 run was rejected. The method utilized stable labeled Formula I as an internal standard. After the addition of the internal standard (equivalent to 285.4 ng/mL in human EDTA plasma) and 0.250 mL of each quality control (QC) sample and calibration standard, 0.525 mL of methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE) was added to the 96-well sample tubes. The organic layer was removed and evaporated to dryness using a liquid-liquid extraction (LLE). The residue was reconstituted and injected into the LC-MS/MS system. Chromatographic separation was achieved through gradient elution on an Acquity UPLC, BEH Shield RP18&#x2122;, 50&#xd7;2.1 mm, 1.7 &#x3bc;m particle size column. The mobile phase contained water, acetonitrile, ammonium formate, and formic acid. Detection was accomplished using a Sciex API 4000 tandem mass spectrometer in positive ion electrospray SRM mode. The standard curves, which ranged from 1.00 to 1000 ng/mL for Formula I, were fitted to a 1/&#xd7;2 weighted linear regression model. The intra-assay precisions, based on four levels of analytical QCs (low, mid, GM, and high), were within 4.2% CV and inter-assay precisions were within 7.2% CV for the analyte. The assay accuracy, expressed as % DEV, was within 6.4% of the nominal concentration values for the analyte. At the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) at 1.00 ng/mL for Formula I, the deviations of the predicted concentrations from the nominal values were within 14.1% for all LLOQ samples from six different matrix lots. The LLOQ response ratio, when compared to the QCO response ratio, was &#x3e;, 5 in all matrix lots. The analyte was stable in human EDTA plasma for at least 24 h at room temperature, for at least 14 days at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C., and following at least 3 freeze-thaw cycles. The processed samples were stable for 72 hours (h) at room temperature.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0587">Based on the results of this validation, the acceptance criteria for sample analysis are as follows:</p><p id="p-0277" num="0588">1) the predicted concentrations of at least three-fourths of all calibration standards shall be within +15.0% of their nominal concentrations with the exception of the LLOQ, which will be within &#xb1;20.0%.
