The switch control circuit comprises a first control switch, a first capacitor and a field-effect transistor switch. When the first control switch is switched off, a charging voltage released by the first capacitor can control the switching-on of the field-effect transistor switch. At this moment, since the first control switch is switched off, and a power source signal cannot reach a gate electrode of the field-effect transistor switch, power source noise cannot be coupled to a line where source and drain electrodes of the field-effect transistor switch are located.

By inputting a high level or a low level to the gate electrode of the MOSFET, the MOSFET is controlled to be turned on or off.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the noise of the gate electrode voltage may be coupled into the circuit where the source and drain electrodes are located, through the parasitic capacitor between the gate electrode and the source electrode of the MOSFET, thereby greatly impairing the signal-to-noise ratio. The gate electrode voltage of the switch is usually connected to the power source or reference ground, therefore, the use of the switches puts forward higher requirements for reducing power source noise.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to reduce the power source coupling noise, the existing general method is to use a low dropout regulator (LDO) with a high power source rejection ratio to generate the power source voltage.
