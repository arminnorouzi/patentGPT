An appropriate amount of arginine may be converted to nitric oxide by nitric oxide synthase to enhance vasodilation and assist in treating various physiological diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, erectile dysfunction, atherosclerosis, vascular headache and chest pain [RH Boger, The pharmacodynamics of L-Arginine [J]. Nutr, 2007, 137 (6):1650S-1655S.]. It has been confirmed that the abnormal concentration of arginine is related to tumors. In different types of cancer, the concentration of plasma arginine is generally lower than a normal level. For example, the concentration of arginine is 80&#xb1;3 &#x3bc;M in breast cancer and colon cancer, 76&#xb1;5 &#x3bc;M in pancreatic cancer, 41.9&#xb1;13.4 &#x3bc;M in esophageal cancer, but 90-150 &#x3bc;M at the normal level [N Verma, et al. L-arginine biosensors: A comprehensive review[J].BB Reports,2017,12: 228-239.]. Therefore, arginine may be used as a tumor biomarker.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In terms of food safety, especially for fermented juice and wine, the content of arginine affects the quality of food. In a biological fermentation process of a winery, if the content of arginine in grape juice used for winemaking is too high, a large amount of urea accumulates and spontaneously reacts with ethanol to form ethyl carbamate (a carcinogen), resulting in food safety problems [CA Uthurry, et al. Ethyl carbamate production by selected yeasts and lactic acid bacteria in red wine [J]. Food Chem, 2006, 94:262-270.]. It is reported that if the content of arginine in the grape juice exceeds 1000 mg/L, the potential content of ethyl carbamate in the brewed wine may exceed the limit value (15 &#x3bc;g/L). Therefore, it is necessary to detect arginine [CS Ough, et al. Preliminary comments on effects of grape vineyard nitrogen fertilization Oil the subsequent ethyl carbamate formation in wines [J]. Am. J. En01. Vitic, 1989, 40(3):219-220.].</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traditional quantitative arginine detection methods include spectrophotometry, capillary electrophoresis, ion exchange chromatography, liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, and the like [O.Y. Saiapina a b, et al. Development and optimization of a novel conductometric bi-enzyme biosensor for 1-arginine determinations[J]. Talanta, 2012,92:8-64.]. All these methods are relatively time-consuming and require expensive instruments. As a novel detection technology, photoelectrochemical detection has received wide attention in recent years due to its advantages, such as high signal intensity, low cost, simplicity, high portability, and ease of large-scale mass production.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Photoelectrochemical detection combines the advantages of traditional electrochemical detection and optical detection, on the one hand, inherits the advantage of a simple device of the electrochemical detection, and on the other hand, achieves high sensitivity as a background signal is extremely low due to complete isolation of an excitation source (light) and a detection signal (electrical).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Among various photocatalytic materials used in photoelectrochemical bioanalysis, semiconductor metal oxides have attracted much attention due to their low cost and high photocatalytic activity. Photocatalytic materials, such as TiO<sub>2</sub>, ZnO, SnO<sub>2 </sub>and WO<sub>3 </sub>have been used in photoelectrochemical sensors, but need to be driven by an ultraviolet light source due to their wider band gap and low visible light response. CuO (1.2-1.7e V) with a narrower band gap shows great development potential when being used, as a photosensitive material, for visible light-driven photoelectric sensors. However, CuO and other CuO-based multi-element oxides (CuBi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, CuFeO<sub>2</sub>, CuAlO<sub>2</sub>) suffer severe photocorrosion in a test environment, which greatly limits their application in photoelectrochemical sensors. This problem needs to be solved urgently.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To solve the problems in the prior art, the present invention proposes a CuV<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>-based photoelectric sensor and application thereof in detection of arginine.
