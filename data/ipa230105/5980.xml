(FFTI) are being used in recent years. In a solid-state image sensor having FFTI, pixels are separated by insulators, and the pixels are therefore electrically isolated from each other. It is therefore necessary for the individual isolated pixels to include contact electrodes for setting a semiconductor substrate to a ground potential, for example. To reduce the surface area of the contact electrodes when viewed in plan view, a solid-state image sensor has been proposed in which the contact electrodes are formed with part of the FFTI being used as an active region (e.g., PTL 1).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">[PTL 1]</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">JP 2016-39315 A</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In such a solid-state image sensor, an impurity region serving as a source/drain of a transistor, which is a region having a high impurity concentration, and the contact electrodes are in close contact or in proximity with each other, in order to reduce the size of the sensor.

It is preferable to use silicon or another semiconductor material doped with P-type or N-type impurities, or a metal, as the conductive film. For example, polycrystal silicon, amorphous silicon, epitaxially-grown silicon, or the like is preferable as the silicon.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Insulating Part</heading><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The insulating part <b>13</b> is an insulating layer that is provided between the embedded conductor part <b>12</b> and the high-concentration impurity diffusion layer <b>42</b> on the top surface of the substrate <b>2</b> (the transistor formation side surface). By providing the insulating part <b>13</b> between the embedded conductor part <b>12</b> and the high-concentration impurity diffusion layer <b>42</b>, a situation where the embedded conductor part <b>12</b> and the high-concentration impurity diffusion layer <b>42</b> are in close contact with each other and a strong electrical field arises between the embedded conductor part <b>12</b> and the high-concentration impurity diffusion layer <b>42</b> is suppressed.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The insulating part <b>13</b> is formed by Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) or an insulating film. For STI, any commonly used material can be used, such as silicon oxide, for example. As the insulating film, it is preferable to use an oxide film, and particularly preferable to use a silicon oxide film. The insulating part <b>13</b> is formed by embedding an oxide film, for example, as an insulating film in a trench formed on the top surface (the transistor formation side surface) of the substrate <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">By providing such an insulating part <b>13</b>, the embedded conductor part <b>12</b> and the high-concentration impurity diffusion layer <b>42</b> (described later) are not in close contact with each other, and the distance between the embedded conductor part <b>12</b> and the high-concentration impurity diffusion layer <b>42</b> is greater as a result. This makes it difficult for a strong electrical field to arise between the embedded conductor part <b>12</b> and the high-concentration impurity diffusion layer <b>42</b>, and improves the stability of the output of the solid-state image sensor <b>100</b>. Additionally, by providing such an insulating part <b>13</b>, the embedded conductor part <b>12</b> and the high-concentration impurity diffusion layer <b>42</b> are separated with respect to the vertical direction (the depth direction of the substrate <b>2</b>). Therefore, the occurrence of a strong electrical field between the embedded conductor part <b>12</b> and the high-concentration impurity diffusion layer <b>42</b> can be suppressed without increasing the size of the solid-state image sensor <b>100</b> in plan view, making it possible to both reduce the surface area of the solid-state image sensor <b>100</b> and improve the stability of the output. The deeper the insulating part <b>13</b> and the embedded conductor part <b>12</b> are formed, the greater the distance, in the vertical direction, between the embedded conductor part <b>12</b> and the high-concentration impurity diffusion layer <b>42</b> becomes. Therefore, it is possible to suppress the occurrence of a strong electrical field by forming the insulating part <b>13</b> and the embedded conductor part <b>12</b> at a depth that corresponds to the magnitude of current flowing in the solid-state image sensor <b>100</b>, for example.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Well Layer</heading><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The well layer <b>21</b> is a P-type region in which impurities of P-type (an example of a first conductivity type) are diffused at a low concentration.
