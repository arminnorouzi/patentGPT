Electromyography (EMG) makes it possible to determine the force with which a muscle is tensioned. Measurements on superficial muscles are also called sEMG. Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a non-invasive technique for assessing the health of muscles, whereby the properties of individual muscles or muscle groups or even the composition of muscles and microscopic structures of muscles can be investigated. Myomechanography (MMG) is a method for detecting elastic, viscous and plastic qualities of muscles. The parameter Pmus represents a variable derived from an EMG signal (electromyogram), an sEMG signal (surface electromyogram), an EIM signal (electrical impedance myogram) or an MMG (mechnomyogram) signal, which signals are detected by measurement. The parameter Pmus indicates here a pressure level, which has been elicited on the basis of a muscle breathing effort of a patient. The cause of the muscle breathing effort may have been initiated by the patient himself in the form of a spontaneous breathing activity and/or it may have been elicited by means of an external, for example, electrical, magnetic or electromagnetic stimulation. The muscle breathing effort may be derived, on the one hand, indirectly from electrical, electromagnetic or magnetic signals. Muscle breathing efforts may also be detected directly by measurement as a pressure difference against a reference pressure, for example, by means of a pressure measurement oar the thorax of a patient. The ambient pressure or also a pressure level that is provided by a ventilator may be selected as a reference pressure. Pressure levels typically provided by ventilators are, for example, an inspiratory pressure level, usually called inspiratory pressure or inspiration pressure Pinsp, as well as, for example, an expiratory pressure level, usually called expiratory pressure or expiration pressure Pexp; a special case of an expiratory pressure level is represented by the so-called PEEP (positive end expiratory pressure), which describes a pressure level which can be detected by measurement at the end of the exhalation in the airways of the patient as a pressure difference against the ambient pressure. Both the inspiration pressure Pinsp and the expiration pressure Pexp are detected as pressure differences against the ambient pressure and are usually stated in the unit mbar. Such a parameter Prints may also be called a respiratory muscle pressure Pmus.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0028">The terms &#x201c;muscle airway pressure,&#x201d; &#x201c;respiratory muscle pressure&#x201d; are used in the description and/or in the patent claims within the framework of the present invention or inventions with wordings such as &#x201c;parameter Pmus,&#x201d; &#x201c;pressure parameter Pmus,&#x201d; &#x201c;pressure parameter or parameter P, Pmus, which indicates a pressure which has been caused by a muscle breathing effort of a patient,&#x201d; &#x201c;a breathing pressure Pmus generated by the muscles of a patient&#x201d; as terms haying the same meaning and producing the identical effect, so that reference can mutually be made concerning the term.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0029">The parameter Flowmus represents a variable derived from the parameter Pmus. Higher frequencies in the signal curve of the parameter Pmus may provide an indicator of muscle-related components, flow direction and reversal of the flow direction of the airway flow. The high-pass filtering of the parameter Pmus may be used to determine the parameter Flowmus. Flow rates that flow into the patient, are inhaled, or which flow out of the patient during phases of exhalation, i.e., are exhaled, are designated by the term airway flow. The parameter Flowmus indicates here a flow rate with a flow direction, wherein the cause of the flow is based on a muscle breathing effort of a patient. The cause of the muscle breathing effort may have been initiated by the patient himself in the form of a spontaneous breathing activity and/or it may have been elicited by means of an external, for example, electrical, magnetic or electromagnetic stimulation. Such a parameter Flowmus may also be called a muscle airway flow or even as a respiratory muscle flow Flowmus. The signal processing with high-pass signal filtering of the signal curve of the parameter Pmus makes it possible to determine/find muscle-related breathing phase changes and times in the parameter Flowmus, at which a reversal of the sign of the parameter Flowmus takes place. The reversal of the sign of the parameter Flowmus indicates here times at which a breathing phase change occurs between inhalation phases (inhalation) and exhalation phases (exhalation), which are based on muscle breathing efforts of the patient.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0030">The terms &#x201c;muscle airway flow,&#x201d; &#x201c;respiratory muscle flow&#x201d; are indicated in the description and/or in the patent claims within that framework. of the present invention with wordings such as &#x201c;parameter Flowmus,&#x201d; &#x201c;flow parameter Flowmus,&#x201d; flow parameter or parameter flow, Flowmus, which indicates a pressure, which has been caused by a muscle breathing effort of a patient,&#x201d; &#x201c;a flow rate produced by a muscle breathing effort of a patient, Flowmus&#x201d; as terms having the same meaning and producing the identical effect, so that reference can mutually be made concerning the term.

These include, among other things, the external intercostal muscles (acting during inhalation) and the internal intercostal muscles (acting during exhalation) and the abdominal muscles acting during exhalation. It was thus determined that the diaphragm becomes atrophied due to long ventilation times and an excessively high level of support of the spontaneous breathing, making a complicated weaning necessary. On the other hand, the respiratory muscles may become exhausted and damaged (fatigue) by increased respiratory load (obstruction, restriction). Some patients tend to have in certain situations excessively great intrinsic efforts, which may, in turn, damage the lungs.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0038">It is described in the state of the art how respiratory muscles can be stimulated. All muscles can be stimulated directly by activation of the muscle fibers or of the supplying efferent nerves. For example, the muscle fibers of the diaphragm can be stimulated directly transcutaneously. As an alternative, the phrenic nerve, which is responsible for the contraction of the diaphragm, can be stimulated. Activation of the muscles and contraction occur in both cases. The goal of these methods is to improve the weaning, to promote the removal of secretion and possibly also to avoid ventilation or breathing assistance. Unlike in the case of ventilation or assisted spontaneous breathing, administration of a breathing gas is not necessary in this case.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0039">A flow and pressure sensor is used in US 20170252558A1 as well as in Cattapan, S.

Parameters of the mechanics of breathing must be taken from the graphic user interface of the ventilator and be entered manually into the separate stimulator. It is, furthermore, not possible to rely on the indicated values of the mechanics of breathing, which are calculated from pneumatic signals, in conventional ventilators as long as the patient is breathing spontaneously to a great degree, i.e., the determined indicator of the work of breathing is only a rough estimate.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0040">Accordingly, there is no method so far that can adequately adjust and coordinate the ventilation and the stimulation especially in view to the work of breathing to be performed. It is self-evident and known, for example, from WO 2019154834 (which is hereby incorporated by reference). WO 2019154837 which is hereby incorporated by reference); WO 19154839 (which is hereby incorporated by reference), WO 2020079266 (which is hereby incorporated by reference), and US 2017/0252558A1, that stimulation and ventilation must be coordinated in their basic mechanism. However, there is no method so far that can predefine the degree of assistance and of stimulation, e.g., depending on a therapy, goal. The minute. volume necessary for the patient as well as threshold values and limits of the mechanical pressure assistance (triggers, pressures, frequencies) are usually set. The component to be contributed by the patient can hardly be set, because there is no sufficiently precise possibility so far for splitting the work of breathing between machine and patient. A process in which mechanics of breathing parameters of the ventilator used are transferred manually and are then used in the stimulator is practically unaffordable: The parameters change e.g., after repositioning of the patient. Consequently, they would have to be entered repeatedly. In addition, the are very inaccurate as long as only pneumatic signals were used in the ventilator for determining the parameters. Consequently, the actual contribution of the patient is hardly known, since it would be necessary for this to know the contribution of the patient to the driving pressure (Pmus) or breathing gas flow (FlowMus). DE 10 2019 006 480 describes the estimation of these work of breathing components by means of electromyography of the respiratory muscles.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0041">The electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) is recorded by means of a modified gastric probe equipped with electrodes in order to control the pressure assistance of the ventilator proportional y to this electrical activity in processes with &#x201c;Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist&#x201d; (NAVA), as described, e.g., in: Sinderby et al.: &#x201c;Is One Fixed Level of Assist Sufficient to Mechanically Ventilate Spontaneously Breathing Patients?,&#x201d; <i>Yearbook <b>0</b>f Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine, </i>2007 (which is hereby incorporated by reference), as well as in Sinderby et at: &#x201c;Neural Control of Mechanical Ventilation in Respiratory Failure,&#x201d; <i>Nature Medicine, </i>1999 (which is hereby incorporated by reference).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0042">An especially proportionally assisting NAVA process with the use of a signal for the electrical activity of the diaphragm, whose peculiar feature is that the electrical activity of the diaphragm, which is needed for a defined tidal volume (the so-called neuroventilatory efficiency shall be maintained at a con-tan value by means of a &#x201c;closed-loop&#x201d;control, is known from U.S. Pat.

The measured airway flow always also contains the component of the flow that originates from the assistance by the ventilator. It is a further discover that the respiratory muscle pressure Pmus, which is an indicator the breathing effort of the patient, describes the spontaneous breathing activity directly, because it represents the spontaneous component of the driving pressure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0054">Exemplary embodiments therefore create a process for determining a patient component of an airway flow of a ventilation gas of a patient being ventilated. The process comprises a determination of a time course of a respiratory muscle pressure of the patient and a high-pass filtering of the time course of the respiratory muscle pressure in order to obtain a time course of a filtered respiratory muscle pressure. The process comprises a determination of the patient component of the airway flow based on the time course of the filtered respiratory muscle pressure. Exemplary embodiments can thus determine a patient component of the airway flow based on the more rapid changes in the respiratory muscle pressure of a patient.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0055">The process may comprise, for example, a transformation of the time course of the respiratory muscle pressure into a frequency domain and the high-pass filtering may take place in the frequency domain in order to obtain a filtered spectrum. Filtering in the frequency domain may be carried out by simply cutting out the spectrum. The process may then comprise a transformation of the filtered spectrum into a time domain in order to obtain the time course of the filtered respiratory muscle pressure. An efficient signal processing can thus be brought about via a frequency domain transformation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0056">The high-pass filtering may also be carried out in the time domain in some exemplary embodiments. This can make possible a more rapid filtering, because no block-by-block signal processing or signal processing of parts is necessary.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0057">The patient component of the airway flow may comprise, e.g., a minute volume or a tidy volume, which is based on the spontaneous activity of the patient.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0058">Different indicators, especially those preferred by the clinical staff, are conceivable in exemplary embodiments for stating. the patient component.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0059">The determination. of the time course of the respiratory muscle pressure may be carried out, for example, oh the basis of an electromyographic signal, of a pneumatic signal or of a mechanical signal. For example, mechanomyographically detected signals, signals detected by means of a strain sensor and/or signals detected by means of an ultrasound sensor, may be used. Non-invasive signal detection methods may be advantageous here.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0060">In further exemplary embodiments, the process may comprise a determination of a high-pass characteristic for the high-pass filtering from the time course of the respiratory muscle pressure. The filter characteristic can then advantageously be determined directly from the signal and thus be adapted to the signal curve. For example, the high-pass characteristic is determined by a time constant. This can then also be checked and adapted in the further course.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0061">The determination of the high-pass characteristic can be carried out on the basis of a kinetic equation for the breathing circuit of the patient. Such a kinetic equation can describe a model of the breathing apparatus of the patient id thus be used as the basis for the determination of the filter characteristic. The process may comprise in some exemplary embodiments the carrying out of a linear regression, of a Kalman filtering or of an estimation method, An efficient means is thus available for the determination of the high-pass characteristic.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0062">Determination of a time course of the patient component of the airway flow can be carried out in further exemplary embodiments. A change in the patients breathing component thus also becomes apparent and a trend diagram and further actions, for example, for adapting ventilation parameters, can be derived from this. A curve of FlowMus (with a high time resolution) can be used as the basis for further indicators, e.g., trigger event, minute volume, tidal volume, etc.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0063">Moreover, determination of times at which a breathing effort of the patient begins from the patient component of the airway flow can be carried out in some exemplary embodiments. These times can then be used as triggers for further actions during the ventilation. Consequently, the process may also comprise an output of a trigger signal for a ventilator based on the times at which a breathing effort of the patient begins, Exemplary embodiments can thus achieve an improved synchronization between the spontaneous breathing activity of the patient and a ventilation assistance by a ventilator. In addition or as an alternative, a determination of times at which a breathing effort of the patient ends can analogously be carried out from be patient component of the airway flow. The process can then comprise an output of a cycling-off signal for a ventilator based on the times at which a breathing effort of the patient ends. These times may be used analogously for the synchronization or setting of ventilation parameters.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0064">In further exemplary embodiments, the process may comprise a determination of a spontaneous respiration rate of the patient from the patient component of the airway flow. The spontaneous respiration rate may, for example, be outputted in order to be made available to the clinical staff or else to influence the further therapy or ventilation configuration.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0065">A further exemplary embodiment is a computer program with a program code (computer-readable medium storing instructions) for carrying out one of the processes being described here when the program code is executed on a computer, on a processor or on a programmable hardware component.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0066">Exemplary embodiments create, moreover, a device of a measuring device for a ventilation device and for determining a patient component of an airway flow and for determining a patient component of an airway flow of a ventilation gas of a patient being ventilated. The device comprises one or more interfaces, which are configured for the exchange of information with the measuring device or with the ventilation device.

It designates the muscle effort of the patient to generate a respiratory muscle pressure in order to bring about a flow in the airway. If occlusion is performed during the breathing effort, i.e., &#x26;the airway how is interrupted by blockage, no flow develops in the airway, even though a respiratory muscle pressure (which can be measured as &#x201c;mouth pressure&#x201d; (pressure in the mouth area) if the airways are open) is generated. There is an isometric contraction of the respiratory muscles in this case. A physiological work always corresponds to the breathing effort, but the physiological work cannot be measured directly. A physical work, which is, by contrast, measurable, is only performed when the contraction is not generated isometrically, i.e., when a flow s generated in the airway.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Breathing Assistance:</heading><p id="p-0078" num="0121">The breathing assistance is a ventilatory pendant to the muscle breathing effort. The ventilator assists the patients breathing effort detected (by triggering) synchronously with an assistance stroke. The patient consequently sets the breathing rhythm. It may be a pressure controlled assistance (the airway pressure is set) or&#x2014;more rarely&#x2014;a volume-controlled assistance (the breath volume is set). Physical work is performed by the ventilator in all cases, i.e., a part of the total work of breathing to be performed is taken from the patient.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">(Mandatory) Ventilation:</heading><p id="p-0079" num="0122">The total work of breathing is eliminated from the patient during mandatory ventilation. The breathing rhythm is determined by the machine. The patient is normally passive during the mandatory ventilation, so that there will be no conflict between the human/patient and the machine. The passivity of the patient is often brought about by sedatives and relaxants.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">WOB&#x2014;Work of Breathing:</heading><p id="p-0080" num="0123">This is the physiological or physical work, which is performed for the breathing or/and ventilation. Even though no physical work is performed in case of isometric contraction in the sense of the kinetic equation, as it will be described below in the further course of the description, other definitions of work, e.g., the so-called pressure-time product (time integral), can be used.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">WOBtot&#x2014;Total Work of Breathing:</heading><p id="p-0081" num="0124">This is the total physiological or physical work, which is performed for the breathing or/and ventilation.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">WOBvent&#x2014;Machine/Ventilator-Side Work of Breathing:</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0125">This is the component of the work of breathing that is contributed by the ventilator.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">WORmus&#x2014;Patient-Side (Muscle) Work of Breathing:</heading><p id="p-0083" num="0126">This is the component of the work of breathing that is performed solely by the patient both with and without stimulation of the muscles.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">WORspon&#x2014;Spontaneous (Patient-Side) Work of Breathing</heading><p id="p-0084" num="0127">This is thea work of breathing performed by spontaneous intrinsic breathing of the patient.

The breathing, pattern is preferably assumed to be an energy optimised pattern. The work of breathing or the driving pressure can be generated on the patient side or land on the machine side. The latter would happen in case of a (mandatory) ventilation.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="2">Breathing Load:</heading><p id="p-0093" num="0136">The breathing load can be determined by detecting the work of breathing or the driving pressure, which work of breathing or driving pressure is actually generated. The breathing load is normally higher than the basic breathing load, since the breathing rhythm of the patient is not energy-optimized, e.g., the patient seeks to have a higher volume, e.g., based on shortness of breath than is needed or there is an asynchronism between the patient and the ventilator. The ventilator assumes a part of the breathing load in case of breathing assistance.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="2">Activation Signal:</heading><p id="p-0094" num="0137">This is a signal that detects the neuronal activation of the muscle (caused either by stimulation or by spontaneous breathing effort), e.g., the (s)EMG (surface electromyogram), EIM (electrical impedance myogram), MMG (mechanomyogram). As an alternative, signals that are detected by means of novel optical or acoustic (e,g., ultrasound) technology are also considered. The enveloping curve of the EMU will be used below as an activation signal (designated by &#x201c;EMG&#x201d; for simplicitys sake), without excluding other signals. It shall not be ruled out hereby that there are different activation signals of different muscle groups (e.g., diaphragm and intercostal muscles which yield an activation of their own each. The diaphragm activation signal is in the foreground in the context of the stimulation of the diaphragm (for example, by magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerve).</p><heading id="h-0023" level="2">Activatability</heading><p id="p-0095" num="0138">This is the ability, electrically to stimulate (activate) the muscles, for example, by electrical or magnetic stimulation. The activation is preferably elicited by a so-called magnetic twitch stimulation, by a transient stimulation pulse with high intensity, which leads to a. maximum contraction of the stimulated muscle, as described, for example, in Walker, D. J.: &#x201c;Prediction of the esophageal pressure by the mouth closing pressure following magnetic simulation of the phrenic nerve,&#x201d; Dissertation University of Freiburg, 2006. Other stimulation patterns would be conceivable as well. The activation may be detected by means of an activation signal, preferably with EMG.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="2">Efficiency:</heading><p id="p-0096" num="0139">The efficiency is a pneumatic target variable (pressure or volume), which is achieved by a muscle activation. The &#x201c;neuromechanical efficiency&#x201d; (or &#x201c;neuromuscular efficiency&#x201d;) NME relates the muscle pressure produced and the &#x201c;neuroventilatory efficiency&#x201d; NVE relates the volume produced to the EMG, as is described, for example, in WO 2018143844, Liu et al.: &#x201c;Neuroventiiatory efficiency and extubation readiness in critically ill patients,&#x201d; <i>Critical Care, </i>2012, as well as in Jansen D., et al,: &#x201c;Estimation of the diaphragm neuromuscular efficiency index in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients,&#x201d; <i>Crifical Care, </i>2018. The determination of the efficiency often requires maneuvers, e.g., occlusions or changes in the breathing assistance. As is described there, the values have a diagnostic significance, e.g., in the assessment of the progression of the weaning from the ventilator.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="2">Maximum Possible Breathing Effort:</heading><p id="p-0097" num="0140">This corresponds to the work of breathing WOBmusMax, to the volume VolMusMax or to the muscle pressure PmusMax, which work of breathing, volume or muscle pressure can be achieved by maximum effort of the respiratory muscles. PmusMax is most likely to be able to be measured in a standardized manner. Thus, the value Plmax is frequently used in the literature as the indicator of the maximum possible muscle pressure, i.e., the maximum pressure produced during mouth closing. Since the voluntary contraction of the diaphragm leads to unreliable events, a so-called (usually magnetic) twitch stimulation, which can be per independently from the ability of the patient to cooperate, is frequently used recently to elicit the contraction. The PmusMax is normally detected by tt ea.&#x20ac;ts of an esophageal catheter, but the mouth closing pressure, which can be measured in a more simple manner, as it is described, for example, in Cattapan, S. E et al.: &#x201c;Can diaphragmatic contractility be assessed by airway twitch pressure in mechanically ventilated patients?,&#x201d; <i>Thorax, </i>2003, has likewise proved to be meaningful. Triggering of the stimulation is advantageous here, as it is also described, for example, in Walker, D. J.; &#x201c;Prediction of the esophageal pressure by the mouth closing pressure following magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerve,&#x201d; Dissertation, University of Freiburg 2006.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="2">LI Load (Load Index):</heading><p id="p-0098" num="0141">This is an indicator that depends on the ratio of the work of breathing produced to the maximum possible work of breathing, but the muscle pressure or another indicator may also be used instead of &#x201c;work.&#x201d; The load can be defined for the muscle pressure as</p><p id="p-0099" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>LI=Pmus/PmusMax. </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><heading id="h-0027" level="2">LBC&#x2014;Load Bearing Capacity:</heading><p id="p-0100" num="0142">This is the ability of the muscles to exert by contraction a defined force or&#x2014;in case of the respiratory muscles&#x2014;pressure and thus to be able to perform work. To quantify the load hearing capacity, the muscle pressure/work of breathing produced by the soles is usually related to the muscle pressure/work of breathing that can be maximally produced. The load bearing capacity can thus be determined quantitatively as a function of the ratio of the basic breathing load to the maximum possible breathing effort. When the basic breathing load exceeds a defined part of the maximum possible breathing effort, the load bearing capacity is no longer present for exclusive spontaneous breathing and ventilation is mandatory.

FlowMus or its integral over time, the volume VoiMus, may be advantageous under some circumstances, cf, US 2017 0252558 A1. It would be advantageous for this for the clinical staff to be very familiar with the terms flow and volume contrary to muscle pressure or work of breathing. The splitting of the flow or volume into patient and machine components is a basis in exemplary embodiments. When FlowMus is available, VolMus (as a time course), but also VTmus (tidal volume produced by muscles) or MVmus (minute volume contributed by muscles) can be determined in a very simple manner by an integration. These variables may be important for the respiratory diagnostics and therapy.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0169">Exemplary embodiments can make it possible to calculate the patient component of the airway flow, for example, for triggering and automation during the ventilation. Exemplary embodiments can thus be divided, e.g., into two parts A and B, which are divided into a process for calculating the airway flow component and, the process <b>10</b> for determining a pattient component, the patient component being based directly on the spontaneous breathing activity. The use of exemplary. embodiments may-, however, differ markedly. Automation during the ventilation is involved in A, and the triggering and the cycling-off of assistance strokes is involved in B. The automation during ventilation is especially necessary in situations in which the patient displays spontaneous breathing efforts but is not able at the same time to ensure an adequate ventilation of the lungs. Processes for the automation therefore frequently employ indicators that detect the spontaneous breathing activity of the patient. Thus, some systems, for example, SmartCare of Dr&#xe4;ger, etc., make use of the spontaneous respiration rate (fspn, spontaneous respiration rate), i.e., the number of breaths triggered by spontaneous breathing per minute. Furthermore, the spontaneous tidal volume (VT) achieved during the triggered breathing pressure assistance is used to adapt the degree of pressure assistance together with the end-tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>value. Other processes likewise use fspn during the adaptation of the ventilation.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0170"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a time course of a pressure <b>310</b> generated by a ventilator (top), a volume flow <b>320</b> between ventilator and patient (center) and a curve <b>330</b> of spontaneous breathing efforts of a patient (bottom). The true spontaneous respiration rate is higher by a factor of nearly 2 than the rate of the pressure-assisted strokes, cf. E1<b>0</b>, which is suggested by the arrows at the respective curves. It is disadvantageous that the spontaneous respiration rate needed detects only the number of triggered breaths but not, e.g., all breathing efforts of the patient. For example. the so-called missed efforts are thus left out of consideration. These occur especially frequently when the pressure assistance is (excessively) high (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Furthermore, it is a drawback that the achieved tidal volume (VT) depends directly on the degree of pressure assistance For example, a patient may breathe such that be triggers breaths with minimal energy. At the same time, a considerable spontaneous tidal volume is achieved based on the assistance, but this tidal volume is hardly correlated with the breathing effort, An automat on scheme, which will take into consideration the volume that the patient has reached solely based on his spontaneous breathing effort, cannot make use of the above-mentioned VT. An indicator of the respiratory muscle exertion can also be proposed or used for the control of the ventilation, especially for the triggering and the cycling-off, M addition to pneumatic signals (such as flow, pressure, volume). A so-called &#x201c;improvised effort signal&#x201d; is proposed in DE 100 2015 011 390 A1. A signal, which detects the activation of the diaphragin is used via an esophageal catheter in DE 10 2015 011 390 A1.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0171">It is described in US2021205561 (A1) and DE 10 2007 062 214 B3 how a muscle pressure signal can be determined from the respiratory surface electromyogram. What is used in all these cases is an indicator of the muscle exertion or the respiratory drive. The muscle pressure signal Pmus can also be calculated if an estimate of the pleural pressure signal (detected by means of an esophageal catheter) and the estimate of the chest wall elastance are available. Triggering based on such indicators of the respiratory muscle exertion is difficult, because the signals are not equal to zero during the presumably passive phases (e.g., during passive exhalation), either. It is thus necessary to determine a threshold, which must, moreover, frequently be readjusted dynamically (on-line), because the activity level fluctuates. The start of the breathing effort is detected in case of an overshooting of this (possibly dynamic) threshold and a corresponding event is possibly elicited, for example, with the goal of triggering an assistance stroke. The cycling-off can be achieved analogously, but it then requires an additional (possibly dynamic) threshold. It is less problematic if a relative threshold (e.g., drop by x %) can be used for the cycling-off. The above-mentioned drawbacks can be avoided if the component of the airway flow (or the component of the volume integral of the flow), which is based directly on the spontaneous breathing activity, is determined. The measured airway flow also always contains the component of the flow that originates from the assistance by the ventilator. When a patient is being ventilated mechanically and is, in addition, breathing spontaneously, the flow of gas between the ventilator and the patient results from a superimposition of the mechanical ventilation and the spontaneous breathing. When the patient is inhaling, the gas flows from the ventilator to the patient. The volume Vol and the volume flow Vol&#x2032; are stated with a positive sign when the patient is inhaling, When the patient is exhaling, the gas flows from the patient to the ventilator (negative sign of flow/flow rates).</p><p id="p-0153" num="0172">The following references will be used below, and the following variables are variable over time; as this is indicated in Table 1 below:</p><p id="p-0154" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="182pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Vol<sub>ges</sub>,</entry><entry>The total volume or the total volume flow, which flows from</entry></row><row><entry>Vol&#x2032;<sub>ges</sub></entry><entry>the ventilator to the patient or in the opposite direction</entry></row><row><entry>Vol<sub>mus</sub>,</entry><entry>The volume or the volume flow which the patient achieves</entry></row><row><entry>Vol&#x2032;<sub>mus</sub></entry><entry>with his respiratory muscles, usually not measurable</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>directly</entry></row><row><entry>Vol<sub>vent</sub>,</entry><entry>The volume or the volume flow which the ventilator</entry></row><row><entry>Vol&#x2032;<sub>vent</sub></entry><entry>achieves</entry></row><row><entry>P<sub>aw</sub></entry><entry>the pressure present at the ventilator</entry></row><row><entry>P<sub>drv</sub></entry><entry>The total pressure acting on the lungs (driving, pressure)</entry></row><row><entry>P<sub>vent</sub></entry><entry>The pressure generated by the ventilator</entry></row><row><entry>P<sub>mus</sub></entry><entry>The pressure which the patient generates with, his</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>respiratory muscles</entry></row><row><entry>R, E</entry><entry>Resistance and elasticity of the respiratory system,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>comprising the lungs and the chest</entry></row><row><entry>PEEP</entry><entry>End-expiratory pressure</entry></row><row><entry>iPEEP</entry><entry>Intrinsic end-expiratory pressure, which remains in the</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>lungs after a breath</entry></row><row><entry>&#x3c4;, tau</entry><entry>Respiratory time constant of the respiratory system,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>which is considered to be a linear system</entry></row><row><entry>S</entry><entry>The frequency (complex number)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0155" num="0173">The volume flow Vol'mus may also be triggered by a magnetically or electrically stimulated breathing of the patient.

The ventilator operates in this exemplary embodiment in a pressure-controlled manner, i.e., the now becomes established, and the pressure is predefined. As an alternative, it would also be possible to carry out the control the other way around, but this is rather not made use of during, spontaneous breathing, but only in case of mandatory ventilation. The lower curve shows the intrinsic breathing efforts of the patient, measured as esophageal pressure Pes. It can be seen that the spontaneous respiration rate is twice the frequency of the ventilation strokes. the ventilator is not synchronized optimally with the in insic breathing activity of the patient.

The process <b>10</b> may accordingly comprise a transformation of the time course of the respiratory muscle pressure into a frequency domain. For example, a Fourier transformation or a fast Fourier transformation (FFT) can be used for this purpose. The high-pass filtering can then be carried out in the frequency domain in order to obtain a filtered spectrum. The filtering in the frequency domain may be carried out, for example, by simply cutting off the, signal components in a lower frequency domain. The process <b>10</b> then comprises a transformation of the filtered spectrum into a time domain in order to obtain the time course of the filtered respiratory muscle pressure. This can be brought about analogously by using the correspondingly inverse transformation. The process <b>10</b> can also perform the high-pass filtering in exemplary embodiments in the time domain, which may have a favorable effect on the calculation times. The time domain processing may take place, for example, from one sample value to the next, whereas the frequency domain processing may require a block-by-block processing.

The determination <b>12</b> of the time course of the respiratory muscle pressure can be carried out on the basis of an electromyographic signal, of a pneumatic signal or of a mechanical signal. Combinations of these signals are conceivable as well; for example, Pmus can be calculated from Paw and Flow. For example, the parameters of the kinetic equation can be estimated in the time ranges in which the patient is passive (Pmus can consequently be assumed to be zero) and Pmus can then be calculated with the estimated parameters. The device <b>20</b> may correspondingly comprise electrodes for detecting the electromyographic signal, sensors for detecting a pneumatic signal or sensors for detecting a mechanical signal. Many different electrodes are conceivable now, and rt ton-invasive signal detection should be given preference.

The ventilatable volume will increase again only after opening the atelectatic region (in the sense of the so-called recruitment, especially by setting a sufficiently high PEEP). If atelectatic lungs are ventilated normally, the characteristic (volume per pressure) is highly nonlinear, so that the simple equation is no longer valid. The equation for the high-pass filtering would then be correspondingly different.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0186">The idealized model can be used in practice as the starting point, because the determination of the parameters for more complex respiratory systems may be difficult and inaccurate and is also time-consuming. When the signal is also needed in its scaling (for example, when absolute volumes are to be determined by integration), an estimat on of the airway resistance or of the elastance can additionally be employed. Now, tan R can be determined in a more simple manner than E if tau is known in some exemplary embodiments.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0187"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows examples of time courses of ventilation signals, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows curves of Paw <b>410</b> and Flow <b>420</b> at the top, curves of the sEMG signals (Costmar <b>430</b> (signal at the lower costal arch) and Intercost <b>440</b> (signal of the intercostal muscle)) in the center and of the muscle signals Pmus <b>450</b> and V&#x2032;mus=fasts <b>460</b> at the bottom.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0188">The vertical broken lines <b>470</b> show the times at which the breathing effort begins, the lines <b>480</b> show the end of the breathing effort.

The patient has COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and suffers from &#x201c;dynamic hyperinflation&#x201d; or intrinsic PEEP. This is recognized from the fact that the Paw signal <b>410</b> drops long before the flow <b>420</b> has its zero crossing. The patient consequently must work hard to bring, the flow to zero from negative values (exhalation). A p0.1 occlusion is triggered at the time t=396.5 sec.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0189">The diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows in the center the time e course of an electrical signal, which was genera ed by means of sEMG. Costmar <b>430</b> shows the time course that was obtained on the basis of two measuring electrodes close to the diaphragm. Intercost <b>440</b> shows the time course that was obtained on the basis of two electrodes at the level of the ribs (auxiliary respiratory muscles). For example, Rich a signal can be detected in the second intercostal space, counted from the top, to the left and right of the sternum (in order to have as little as possible into the region of the muscles of the chest and arm). The signal segments in the heartbeat time periods (ErgR=ECG removal) were removed in the two raw signals by calculation, which has led to gaps. The gaps were interpolated in the curves shown in the figures. The two solid lines (curves) are an indicator of the spontaneous breathing of the patient. Pmus is approximately equal in this case to Intercost with reversed sign (multiplied by (&#x2212;1)). In general, Pmus is estimated depending on Costmar and intercost, for example, as described in E14. For example, Pmus is calculated from Costimar <b>430</b> and intercost <b>440</b> as a linear combination (with the. coefficients NNE<b>1</b> and NME<b>2</b>).</p><p id="p-0179" num="0190">For application B (triggering/cycling-off), the calculated V&#x2032;mus can be treated in exactly the same manner as the flow V&#x2032;during a flow triggering. What is ultimately involved here is the detection of the time at which the signal crosses the zero line, both for the triggering of a stroke and for the cycling-off it is not necessary to set a defined absolute threshold. This is due, among other things, to the fact that a possible offset is removed by the DT-1 high-pass filtering.

It is then also possible to output a cycling-off signal for a ventilator based on the times at which a breathing effort of the patient ends. Moreover, the patient component of the airway flow may comprise a minute volume or a tidal volume, which is based on the spontaneous activity of the patient. Information on the minute volume or on the tidal volume can then be made available to a clinical staff.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0195">For application A, automation of the ventilation, a substantially improved spontaneous respiration rate can be determined from the triggering process described by counting the number of detected efforts per minute.

The threshold necessary for this can be set in a comparatively simple manner, e.g., at a value between 10 mL and 50mL.

For example, the time constant tau may be determined from the time course of Pmus.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0198">The time constant may also be calculated from the volume and the flow signal (an e curve is obtained during passive exhalation) and the quotient of the volume and flow yields the desired tau because of the derivation. As an alternative. R and E may be determined by means of regression (or another estimation method) and tau can be determined from, this. Pmus may also play an indirect role and the time ranges in which Pmus!=0 (Pmus not equal to 0) are not suitable for determining the parameter/parameters.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0199">Knowledge of Pmus is required for the calculation of V&#x2032;mus. However, if Pmus is known, both R and E, i.e, also the time constant tau=R/E, can be determined based on Equation (1), e.g., by means of linear regression, Kalman filtering or another estimation method. In addition or as an alternative, the sEMG signals can be used as indications or model signals for Pmus. If, e.g., sEMG=0, then Pmus is also zero and the regression can be calculated.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0200">When sEMG!=0, i.e., &#x201c;SEMCs is not equal to zero,&#x201d; then sEMG can be included in the kinetic equation (simplest model hypothesis: Pmus=NME&#xb7;EMG). If R and E or NME are then known, Pmus can be estimated, doing so either &#x201c;pneumatically&#x201d; (Pmus=R&#xb7;Flow+E&#xb7;Vol&#x2212;Paw) or &#x201c;electromyographically&#x201d; (Pmus=NME&#xb7;Flow) or as an averaging between them.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0201">Accordingly, the high-pass characteristic can be determined on the basis of the kinetic equation for the breathing circuit of the patient.

The Flow <b>420</b> is the time course of the volume flow Vol&#x2032;ges [L/sec], wherein segments above the zero line designate an inhalation process. Paw <b>410</b> is the time course of the pressure Pvent in [mbar}, which the ventilator achieves and which is always greater than or equal to zero, especially when PEEP &#x3e;0 is set. Each line <b>470</b> shows the start of an attempt of the patient to inhale air. When PEEP=0 and the patient is inhaling intensely, the airway pressure may briefly collapse when the ventilator is unable to resupply a sufficient quantity of flow. Then, Pvent &#x3c;0 could become true. The ventilation strokes are triggered in the example being shown by the curve of Pmus <b>450</b>, which is determined, for example, on the basis of one or more sEMG signals, see above. The ventilation strokes lag behind the spontaneous breathing of the patient, which is suggested by the vertical lines <b>470</b>. This can be seen best for t=398.8. The patient is already attempting. to inhale air.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">Since Flow&#x3c;0, the ventilator does not yet detect the inhalation effort. The ventilator can trigger only when the condition is met (t=399) and respond with an assistance stroke. Only the PEEP controller is running before that, i.e., the ventilator is trying to resupply Flow as best as it can in order to maintain the PEEP at a constant level. However, it cannot succeed in view to the enormous breathing effort of the patient, which is manifested in the collapse of the Paw pressure between T=398.8 and t=399.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">Consequently, the ventilator is at first always still in the phase of exhalation and attempts to maintain the PEEP, When the patient now wants to inhale, then the ventilator slightly adjusts the flow, but it does not lag behind. Therefore, the pressure collapses slightly. The patient does not have to breathe against the device, and the device just simply does not assist. This happens only, when the flow sensor has detected a positive Flow. The process is then switched over into the phase of inhalation and a pressure stroke is triggered. The Flow developing now originates (to a low extent) from the patient, who has triggered, and mostly from the ventilator, which has responded with the stroke. If the ventilation strokes were ideally synchronized with the spontaneous breathing of the patient, the pressure would already have to rise at the lines <b>470</b>, and in practice shortly thereafter. The ventilator ideally supplies the volume such that a set assistance pressure will be reached as rapidly as possible. A zero crossing of V&#x2032;mus (start of inhalation) consequently triggers a ventilation stroke. Exemplary embodiments thus make a better synchronization possible. In particular, the start and the end of a ventilation stroke are better synchronized with the spontaneous breathing activity of the patient, both in terms of the time and in terms of the intensity.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">The contribution of the spontaneous breathing to the minute volume Vol&#x2032;ges is detected in further exemplary embodiments.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">The diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> (bottom) shows the time course of the pressure Pmus <b>450</b> and that of the volume flow Vol&#x2032;mus <b>460</b>, which the spontaneous breathing of the patient achieves. The lines <b>470</b> indicate when the patient begins to inhale. The respective next zero crossing of Vol&#x2032;mus <b>480</b> indicates when the patient begins to exhale. The pressure Pmus drops already before the start of the exhalation.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">The aspects and features that are described in connection with one or more of the examples and figures described in detail above may also be combined with one or more of the other examples in order to replace an identical feature of the other example or in order to additionally introduce the feature into the other example.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">Examples may, furthermore, be or pertain to a computer program with a program code (provided as a non-transitory, tangible medium (or media)) for executing cane or more of the above processes when the computer program is executed on a computer or on a processor.
