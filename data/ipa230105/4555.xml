Oftentimes, individual users have multiple online accounts over a plurality of online platforms, which providers may wish to merge, integrate, or otherwise de-duplicate. In response, methods of comparing, merging, and migrating online accounts spread across multiple online platforms to a single online platform have been developed and implemented. However, traditional methods of identifying when two online accounts are associated with the same user (and therefore should be merges or otherwise consolidated) typically rely on matching information provided by the user, including names, dates of births, other personally identifiable information, as well as account-identifying indicia, such as email addresses or usernames. However, information provided by users may include significant (intentional or accidental) inaccuracies, and reliance on such matching can lead to improper merging or migrating of non-related online accounts, and a significant impact accounts comprising sensitive information, including financial information, for example. Improper mergers or migrations can lead to individual users or businesses being locked out of their accounts, or more significantly, can lead to financial information being shared or disclosed to non-authorized third parties. As such, what is needed is a way to accurately identify related accounts, and to merge or migrate online accounts that reduces or eliminates the frequency of improper account mergers.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the invention solve the above-mentioned problems by providing techniques for migrating and merging account information sets.

In some embodiments, network <b>214</b> may be Internet <b>132</b>, or alternatively, may be local area network (LAN), wide-area network (WAN), virtual private network (VPN), or other network for providing communication between the various components of system <b>200</b> is contemplated. As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in some embodiments, first online platform <b>202</b> and second online platform <b>208</b> may be further connected to or otherwise in communication with a first comparison system <b>216</b>. In some embodiments, first online platform <b>202</b> and second online platform <b>208</b> may be connected or otherwise in communication with comparison system <b>216</b> via network <b>214</b>. In some embodiments, first online platform <b>202</b> and second online platform <b>208</b> are connected by a first network <b>214</b> and to comparison system <b>216</b> via a different network.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, comparison system <b>216</b> may be a system for comparing at least one online account <b>204</b> associated with first online platform <b>202</b> with at least one online account <b>210</b> associated with second online platform <b>208</b> to thereby identify accounts associated with a common user. In some embodiments, comparison system <b>216</b> may be configured to compare a plurality of online accounts <b>204</b> associated with first online platform <b>202</b> with a plurality of online accounts <b>210</b> associated with second online platform <b>208</b>, at once and in a batch review to determine matching pairs of accounts from first online platform <b>202</b> and second online platform <b>208</b>. Alternatively, in some embodiments comparison system <b>216</b> may be configured to compare a single online account <b>204</b> with a single online account <b>210</b> to determine whether they are associated with a common user. In still other embodiments, comparison system <b>216</b> may be configured to review a single online account <b>204</b> with a plurality of second online accounts <b>210</b> to determine a matching second online account <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, comparison system <b>216</b> may compare personally identifiable information <b>206</b> of online accounts <b>204</b> with personally identifiable information <b>212</b> of online accounts <b>210</b>. Alternatively or in addition, comparison system <b>216</b> may further compare email addresses or usernames associated with online accounts <b>204</b> and online accounts <b>210</b>. The comparison performed by comparison system <b>216</b> may utilize decision tables, machine learning, and/or statistical algorithms to compare online account <b>204</b> and online account <b>210</b> to determine a likelihood that the online accounts are a match. Alternatively, in some embodiments, comparison system <b>216</b> may present potential pairs of one online account <b>204</b> and one online account <b>210</b> to a user for manual review.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, and as described in greater detail below, comparison system <b>216</b> may further generate a confidence value or score, representing a determined likelihood that at least one online account <b>204</b> is a match with at least one online account <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, during the comparison between first online account <b>204</b> and at least one online account <b>210</b> certain information may be given greater weight than other information when determining the confidence value. For example, in some embodiments, comparison system <b>216</b> may compare personally identifiable information <b>206</b> associated with at least one online account <b>204</b> and personally identifiable information <b>212</b> associated with at least one online account <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, the compared personally identifiable information may comprise unique, near unique, or other information that would otherwise be unlikely to be shared between pairs of distinct users. For example, personally identifiable information that should be unique, such as social security numbers or driver's license numbers, may be given more weight when determining the confidence value. Conversely, some personally identifiable information that is not unique or may otherwise be associated with more than one user, such as first names and birth dates, may be given less weight when determining the confidence value.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, and as described in greater detail below, the confidence value determined by comparison system <b>216</b> may provide a threshold for performing additional comparison or, alternatively, for automatically creating new user accounts. For example, in some embodiments, if the determined confidence value for a first online account <b>204</b> associated with first online platform <b>202</b> and a second online account <b>210</b> associated with second online platform <b>208</b> is below a certain minimum threshold, a determination may be made that there is no match between the accounts. Alternatively, in some embodiments, if the determined confidence value is above a certain minimum threshold, then a determination may be made that there may be a possible match between the two compared accounts. In some embodiments, following a determination that the confidence value is above a certain minimum threshold, a secondary comparison may be used, providing for a secondary validation of the comparison performed by comparison system <b>216</b>. In some embodiments, if the confidence value is above a second, higher, threshold, no secondary requirement may be performed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, system <b>200</b> may further comprise a secondary comparison system <b>218</b>, for providing a secondary comparison or validation of results determined by comparison system <b>216</b>. In some such embodiments, secondary comparison system <b>218</b> may be communicatively connected to comparison system <b>216</b> either through a direct connection, such as an ethernet connection, or indirectly by network <b>220</b>. In some embodiments, network <b>220</b> may be Internet <b>132</b>, or alternatively, may be a LAN, WAN, VPN, or other network for providing communication between the various components of system <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, secondary comparison system may optionally or additionally be communicatively coupled to first online platform <b>202</b>, second online platform <b>208</b>, or both.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, secondary comparison system <b>218</b> may be a system for providing an additional level of comparison between at least one first online account <b>204</b> associated with first online platform <b>202</b> and at least one second online account <b>210</b> associated with second online platform <b>208</b> following the initial comparison by comparison system <b>216</b>. Alternatively, in some embodiments, secondary comparison system <b>218</b> can be used as an initial (or only) comparison of at least one first online account <b>204</b> and at least one second online account <b>210</b>. A secondary validation, such as that performed by secondary comparison system <b>218</b>, may be particularly advantageous when reviewing data sourced from unreliable sources, or sources lacking (or having less stringent) data verification processes.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, secondary comparison system <b>218</b> may be a system for comparing the personally identifiable information, email addresses, and or other identifying information of at least one first online account <b>204</b> associated with first online platform <b>202</b> with at least one second online account <b>210</b> associated with second online platform <b>208</b>. Like comparison system <b>216</b>, secondary comparison system <b>218</b> may compare accounts many-to-many, one-to-many, or one-to-one. Also like comparison system <b>216</b>, the comparison performed by secondary comparison system <b>218</b> may utilize decision tables, machine learning, and/or statistical algorithms to compare online account <b>204</b> and online account <b>210</b> to determine a likelihood that the online accounts are a match. Alternatively, in some embodiments, comparison system <b>218</b> may present potential pairs of one online account <b>204</b> and one online account <b>210</b> to a user for manual review.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, secondary comparison system <b>218</b> may detect spurious (e.g., unlikely or improbable) data values for accounts and eliminate their use in comparing account information. For example, when setting up an online account, a user selecting a birth date from a drop-down menu, rather than scrolling to find the correct birthdate, might select the default value of January 1 as their birth date, even if incorrect. For this reason, if a user's account lists January 1 as the birth date, the birth date field might be excluded (or given reduced weight) in matching that user account. Similarly, a user who does not wish to disclose their true name may provide a common alias like &#x201c;John Doe&#x201d; when prompted for their name, and the name field might be excluded or given reduced weight in matching that user account.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Such spurious data values may be supplied in advance or automatically determined during the process of comparing user accounts. For example, this may be the case for the example of the name &#x201c;John Doe&#x201d; given above. Where such data values are supplied in advance, secondary comparison system <b>218</b> can exclude such data fields from the comparison, or alternatively, give the data fields less weight when making a determination of a possible match. Further, in some embodiments the algorithm may be able to identify impossible or patently false values as spurious, such as social security numbers comprising more or fewer than 9 digits, users having birthdates that are in the future, or other values that are would otherwise be impossible to be correct. Additionally, some data fields and personally identifiable information may have known or otherwise predictable distributions, and data values not conforming to this distribution can be retroactively excluded after data set has been analyzed. For example, it will be appreciated that birth dates may have a roughly even distribution across a calendar year, and accordingly, an even distribution of users having birthdates can be expected. If, after matching accounts, it is determined that 10% of users have listed their birth date as January 1, this value can be denoted as spurious and be retroactively excluded from use as a data point for matching user accounts.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, secondary comparison system <b>218</b> may utilize machine learning algorithms to compare accounts. In some embodiments, the machine learning algorithm may be trained to detect known improbable values (i.e., incorrect information associated with an online account that could result in an increased rate of false mergers or accounts, or which otherwise constitute incorrect information) embedded or otherwise present within the personally identifiable information or other information associated with online accounts <b>204</b> and/or online accounts <b>210</b>. In some embodiments the algorithm may be trained to detect patently incorrect data fields.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, secondary comparison system <b>218</b> may optionally or additionally detect unusual or improbable sequences. For example, in some embodiments, one data field that may be used to compare online account <b>204</b> with online account <b>210</b> may be social security numbers or birth dates. by way of non-limiting example, a social security number comprising sequential digits may be determined to be improbable or unlikely, and accordingly, the secondary comparison system <b>218</b> can either exclude that data field from the comparison, or alternatively, give that data field less weight when making a determination of a possible match.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, secondary comparison system <b>218</b> may optionally or additionally detect duplications of unique data fields. For example, certain data fields, including, but not limited to social security numbers, account numbers, usernames, or other fields should be unique identifiers, used to identify a particular account or user. Secondary comparison system <b>218</b> can detect duplications of such unique data fields associated with more than one user, and can either exclude such duplications from the comparison, or alternatively, give the data fields less weight when making a determination of a possible match.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, secondary comparison system <b>218</b> may optionally or additionally be trained to detect user patterns or preference to assist in making a determination of a possible match between at least one online account <b>204</b> with at least one online account <b>210</b>. For example, in some embodiments, metadata associated with online account <b>204</b> and/or online account <b>210</b> may be used to track or monitor a user's behavior or patterns. For example, a user associated with online account <b>204</b> on first online platform <b>202</b> may have a pattern of use when using online platform <b>202</b>, such as for example, watching a particular genre of television shows on particular days or times, playing a set amount of time of an online video game, placing a sports bet on a particular sports team or sports league, or any other pattern of use associated with the different embodiments of online platform <b>202</b>. Likewise, a user associated with online account <b>210</b> on second online platform <b>208</b> may similarly have a pattern of use or behavior. In some embodiments, machine learning algorithms can match accounts across platforms based on these patterns of use. For example, a machine learning algorithm may be trained to detect such patterns and used during the comparison of online account <b>204</b> and online account <b>210</b> and/or in making the determination if online account <b>204</b> and online account <b>210</b> are a match.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a flowchart illustrating an exemplary method of comparing and consolidating or migrating two or more online accounts associated with two or more online platforms or systems in accordance with embodiments of the invention is depicted and generally referenced by numeral <b>300</b>. In some embodiments, method <b>300</b> may provide for the eventual migration of online accounts on a first online platform and/or a second online platform. In some embodiments, method <b>300</b> may optionally provide for the creation of online accounts on the first online platform and/or the second online platform.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Initially, at step <b>302</b>, a first online platform comprising at least one online account is selected for comparison with a second online platform comprising at least one online account. In some embodiments, the at least one online account associated with each of first online platform and second online platform may be, for example, any of the online accounts described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Additionally, in some embodiments, the first online platform, the second online platform, or both, may be, for example, any of the online platforms as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In some embodiments, additional online platforms may be selected for comparison, and for example, three, four, five, six, or more online planforms comprising one or more online accounts may be added to the comparison of method <b>300</b>. In some embodiments, each of the online platforms selected for comparison may be communicatively coupled, and for example, may be coupled together through a network, the internet, or other communicative methods.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, at step <b>304</b>, in some embodiments a first comparison between the online accounts associated with the first online platform with online accounts associated with the second online platform may be performed. In some embodiments, the first comparison may be performed by the first comparison system as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the first comparison between the online accounts associated with the first online platform and online accounts associated with the second online platform may, for example, comprise a comparison between one selected online account associated with the first online platform and a selected online account associated with the second online platform. Alternatively, in some embodiments the first comparison may comprise a comparison between a plurality of online accounts associated with the first online platform with a plurality of online accounts associated with the second online platform. In still other embodiments, the comparison may comprise a comparison between one online account associated with the first online platform with a plurality of online accounts associated with the second online platform.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">At step <b>306</b>, a confidence value may be determined as a result of the first comparison of step <b>304</b>. In some embodiments, the confidence value may be a numerical value representing the likelihood that at least one online account associated with first online platform and at least one online account associated with second online platform are a match or are otherwise associated with the same user. For example, in some embodiments, the confidence value may be a numerical value within a range of 1-100, by way of non-limiting example. In some embodiments, a score of 70 or above may be an indicator that there is an acceptable likelihood of probability that at least one online account associated with first online platform and at least one online account associated with second online platform are a match or are otherwise associated with the same user. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the confidence value may be a textual or otherwise descriptive identification on the likelihood that the accounts may be a match. For example, in some embodiments, the confidence value may provide a description on the likelihood that at least one online account associated with first online platform and at least one online account associated with the second online platform are a match or are otherwise associated with the same user. For example, in some embodiments, the confidence value may be provided by a written description providing indicators such as &#x201c;high likelihood&#x201d;; &#x201c;medium likelihood&#x201d;; or &#x201c;low likelihood.&#x201d; Alternatively, in some embodiments, the confidence value may be a binary report indicating affirmatively that either that: (a) at least one online account associated with the first online platform and at least one online account associated with the second online platform are a match or are otherwise associated with the same user; or (b) at least one online account associated with the first online platform and at least one online account associated with the second online platform are not a match or are otherwise not associated with the same user. A person of skill in the art, having reviewed this disclosure, will appreciate that a variety of types of confidence score may be utilized in place of those described, and all such types of confidence score are contemplated as being within the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">At test <b>308</b>, a determination can be made of whether the determined confidence value has met or exceeded a predetermined minimum threshold of likelihood that at least one account associated with the first online platform is a match with at least one account associated with a second online platform. For example, in the exemplary step <b>306</b> the confidence value may comprise a numerical range from 1-100. In some embodiments, a predetermined value may be established as a minimum threshold of likelihood of a match. For example, in the exemplary embodiment in which the confidence value is based on a numerical range from 1-100, a confidence value of seventy (70) may be a minimum threshold that at least one account associated with the first online platform is a match with at least one account associated with the second online platform. Alternatively, in some embodiments the confidence value in the exemplary embodiment may comprise any numerical number within the numerical range as the minimum threshold that at least one account associated with the first online platform is a match with at least one online account associated with the second online platform.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Following test <b>308</b>, if the confidence value is below the minimum threshold, a determination may be made that at there is no match, or a very low likelihood of a match, between at least one online account associated with the first online platform with at least one online account associated with the second online platform, triggering step <b>310</b>. By way of non-limiting example, in the exemplary embodiment described at test <b>308</b>, if the confidence value is below a score of 70, it may be determined that there is no match between at least one online account associated with the first online platform with at least one online account associated with the second online platform. Following the triggering event, in some embodiments, step <b>310</b> may comprise the creation of a new online account associated with at least one user. In some embodiments, the newly created online account may be associated with the first online platform, the second online platform, or alternatively another online platform separate from first online platform and/or second online platform.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Following test <b>308</b>, if the confidence value is above the minimum threshold, then a determination may be made that there is a possible match between at least one online account associated with the first online platform with at least one online account associated with the second online platform. At step <b>312</b>, a secondary comparison may be conducted of the results of the first comparison of step <b>304</b>, as described above. In some embodiments, step <b>312</b> may be performed using secondary comparison system <b>218</b> as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, or alternatively, may comprise another secondary comparison of data sets.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, step <b>312</b> may comprise a multiple stage review of personally identifiable information, email accounts, usernames, metadata, user patterns, or other information associated with the at least one online account from first online platform and the at least one online account from the second online platform that have been deemed as possible matches following test <b>308</b>. For example, in some embodiments, an initial review may comprise a review of the names associated with the possible matching online accounts from the first online platform and the second online platform. In some embodiments, names of users may be compared for exact or fuzzy matches. In some embodiments, step <b>312</b> may optionally or additionally comprise a review of the birthdates of the potentially matching online accounts from first online platform and the second online platform. In some embodiments, step <b>312</b> may optionally or additionally comprise a review of social security numbers associated with each of the potentially matching online accounts from first online platform and second online platform.

In some embodiments, the comparison performed during step <b>310</b> may comprise the intentional exclusion, or reduced weight given, to known improbable values. In some embodiments, the known improbable values may be excluded or accounted for using the system described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

In some embodiments, migration result of step <b>312</b> may be dependent on the available personally identifiable information, emails, or other information associated with each of the online accounts. As an example scenario illustrating the use of method <b>400</b>, consider the case where two companies with distinct but overlapping user bases are merging and wish to create a common login system such that each user has a single account on the first company's system.

If the determination from test <b>418</b> indicates that there is a match between an email address associated with one of the first online accounts associated with the first online platform and the email address associated with the second online account associated with second online platform, it is determined that the active account corresponds to the user of the second online account, and mitigation outcome <b>420</b> takes place.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, migration outcome <b>420</b> may comprise migrating the account details, such as credentials, personal information, financial information, or other information associated with the second online account associated with second online platform and consolidating it with the active first online account associated with the first online platform. In some embodiments, migration outcome <b>420</b> may further comprise updating the duplicate or dormant account(s) having a different email address with migrated credentials, personal information, financial information, or other information associated with the online account associated with second online platform. In some embodiments, migration outcome <b>420</b> may further comprise marking or identifying the duplicate or dormant account as a duplicate account and suspending it. A prompt identifying the active account may additionally or optionally be presented to the user in the event that the user attempts to access the online account using old credentials.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, if the result of test <b>418</b> determines that there is a match of one online account associated with the second online platform with multiple first online accounts associated with the first online platform based on matching personally identifiable information then migration outcome <b>422</b> may be initiated. For example, this may be the case where a first online account is matched based on personally identifiable information only and another match with a second online account associated with the first online platform based on a matching email address only. Alternatively, it may be the case that multiple first online accounts associated with the first online platform based on matching personally identifiable information, none of which match the email address associated with the second online account. In some embodiments, migration outcome <b>422</b> may comprise migrating the credentials, personal information, financial information, or other information associated with the second online account associated with second online platform and consolidating the migrated information to the active online account associated with the first online platform having corresponding personally identifiable information. In some embodiments, migration outcome <b>422</b> may further comprise creating a new online account shell on the first online platform, which may store the credentials, personal information, financial information, or other information associated with the online account associated with the first online account prior to the data migration to prevent a user from creating a new online account on the first online platform with old, outdated, or otherwise non-applicable credentials. In some embodiments, migration outcome <b>422</b> may further comprise marking or identifying the new online account shell as a duplicate account. A prompt may additionally or optionally be displayed to the user in the event that the user attempts to access the online account using the old credentials. In some embodiments, migration outcome <b>422</b> may further comprise suspending, locking, or otherwise blocking access to the online account associated with first online platform having a matching email address with the online account associated with second online platform, but having different personally identifiable information. In some embodiments, migration outcome <b>422</b> may optionally or additionally comprise sending a status update, email, or other form of communication to the user of the suspended online account, informing the user that their account has been suspended.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although the invention has been described with reference to the embodiments illustrated in the attached drawing figures, it is noted that equivalents may be employed, and substitutions made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as recited in the claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>Having thus described various embodiments of the invention, what is claimed as new and desired to be protected by Letters Patent includes the following:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
