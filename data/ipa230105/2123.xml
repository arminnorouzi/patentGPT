id="p-0001" num="0000">A container and closure combination, for the containment of fluids and extraction therefrom by way of an extraction tube. The container comprises a closed volume with an opening configured to close the opening of the container; the closure is provided with an aperture such that the closure, upon fitment to the container opening, cannot be removed therefrom. The aperture of the closure comprises a unitary elastic unidirectional valve member that can operate in a first, closed condition, to prevent a flow of fluid from the container; and a second, operational condition, with an extraction tube sealingly engaged with respect to the valve, to permit an extraction of fluid from the container through the tube.</p></abstract><drawings

id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to containers that are used to contain fluids that need to be dispensed in controlled quantities. In particular, the present invention relates to a container closure, which can be readily and securely fastened to dispensing containers, bottles and the like.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Discussion of the State of the Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In many fields of endeavor, barrels, plastics containers, cans and other fluid containers are employed to enable the safe storage of a fluid. The fluids contained in the containers may be suitable for a single or several uses and can comprise fluids such as oils, fuels, chemicals, and cleaning fluids. Consider a utilities manager of a manufacturing facility. The floor of the manufacturing area has to be cleaned thoroughly because of greases etc. that are dropped; in order to maintain safety and productivity, the floor has to be cleaned using rotary scrubbing machines, which apply a liquid cleaner, followed by the use of liquid vacuum machines. The scrubbing machines will have a tank that is filled with, for example, water and a degreasant chemical. A particular dose of degreasant chemical is added to the water tank of the scrubber prior to use. The amount dispensed is conveniently provided by way of a hose with a dispensing function and is attached to the container. Upon filing of the cleaning tool, there is no wastage&#x2014;especially if compared with the use of a cup by an operator with a gloved hand and scooping a required amount from an open container. Not only is wastage minimized, proper cleaning is effected, using the required dosage, whereby to satisfy onerous health and safety recommendations, for example. It will be appreciated that in certain industries such as that of medical device manufacture, drug manufacturing and food production, that there will be mandated standards of cleaning mandated. By the use of prescribed amounts of chemical per unit of solvent&#x2014;typically water&#x2014;then national standards/site standards can be maintained.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, chemicals currently used in the commercial cleaning industry or any industry are typically stored in standard blow mortgage containers, for example, 5-liter (1 gallon) containers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a standard type of prior art 5-liter container. The container is blow molded, with an integral handle and a screw-top opening at for screw-threaded connection with a lid. The container caps use standard screw fittings, which can be fully removed for filling and dispensing from the bottle; different specific types of container open can exist for different sizes of container, such as the prior art 20 liter and 200 liter containers shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c</i></figref>. When a chemical container is connected to a dispenser, the cap is fully removed and a flexible tube from the dispenser is inserted into the neck of the bottle. If a user wishes to dispense cleaner directly from the bottle rather than via the dispensing system there is nothing restricting this practice. It is also reported that certain households benefit from the decanting of specialized fluids into proprietary household containers. Indeed, there are many detergents that are used for several tasks, for example, and may be suitable for the general cleaning of all floors, walls and cladding, washable hard surfaces, including all paintwork and types of motor vehicles and even for garments. Such products can be decanted for unauthorized personal use.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another field, greases and oils will need to be dispensed in a workshop; sometimes additives must be accurately dispensed; the product can be expensive. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, there is shown a proprietary prior art system <b>20</b> for transporting and dispensing fluid from a single drum <b>22</b> or small container; an uppermost cap&#x2014;when the barrel is standing in an upright fashion is simply enabled to be at the lowermost point when resting in a horizontal position&#x2014;but not shown in the figure. Systems such as this can be adapted to catch spillage.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Bottles/containers containing automotive lubricants, household chemicals, agricultural products and the like are ill equipped to dispense without additional dispensing device. Exterior dispensing devices on the market (e.g. funnels, valves, tubes) are limited in value. They are typically rigid, i.e. not adaptable or flexible; they are typically restricted in length/range, e.g. regarding motor oil, a funnel flask can dispense into an engine's crankshaft, but cannot reach the transmission intake; they typically require cleaning and storage for reuse, i.e. the value relates to the number of possible uses and accessibility; and they are sold separately from the bottle/container, e.g. when a consumer purchases motor oil, outside of having a funnel readily available, the consumer cannot effectively dispense the oil.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition to the dispensing of fluids, containers must also be housed and stacked in appropriate conditions. Businesses routinely store and move a variety of potentially polluting materials in containers ranging in capacity from a few liters up to drums of 205 liters (45 gallons) and 1000 liters (219 gallons) industrial bulk containers (IBCs). These containers must be stored in accordance with appropriate legislation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Containers of oil, chemicals or other potentially polluting materials can pollute surface water and groundwater. Pollution can be caused by spills from several sources, such as the incorrect storage and handling of containers; accidental leaks; vandalism and theft; overfilling or failure of storage structures; run-off from fires and contaminated firewater; incorrect or damaged drainage systems. These are all potential hazards. Additionally, there are many substances that aren't harmful to humans but that will cause pollution if they're spilt, for example liquid food and drinks, detergents and paper sludges. For example, in England and Wales, oil storage is regulated by the Control of Pollution (Oil Storage) (England) Regulations 2001, (OSR England). Oils covered by these regulations include petrol, diesel, vegetable, synthetic and mineral oils. The regulations apply to most industrial, commercial and institutional sites storing oil outside in containers over 200 liters, including drums and IBCs and to domestic premises storing more than 3500 liters.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the field of containers for food and drink, similar issues can occur in the control of dispensing of fluids, pastes, creams, emulsions and powders. The dispensing of condiments is one issue tomato ketchup, salad dressings, mayonnaise etc. Restaurants and the like will wish to buy in bulk and have dispensing means that allows correct dispensing to be enabled and reduce levels of pilfering. Similarly, sports drinks can be consumed with a straw&#x2014;but for the container that non-sealingly allows a straw or tube to be inserted the drink cannot be consumed without spillage unless special care is taken.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, known container and dispenser systems do not necessarily provide security and none are adapted to the acceptance of &#x201c;universal&#x201d; tube vacuum dispensing devices and/or are complex to utilize. Caps and similar closure systems for containers in production and in use to date, are designed to re-open after being attached with respect to a container.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention seeks to provide a solution to the problems addressed above. The present invention seeks to provide a container closure that readily adapts to dispensing requirements, which can readily and easily be manufactured, at low cost.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with a general aspect of the invention, there is provided a cap for fitment to a container, wherein the cap becomes irreversibly attached to such a container and has an aperture for the insertion of a tube whereby controlled delivery of a fluid from the container can be enabled. The apertured cap preferably comprises one of a screw cap, a push-fit cap, having detent or glue applied thereto, for a male or female opening associated with the container. In such an arrangement, the cap can be manually attached or fitted in a no-wear or low wear mechanized process. It will be appreciated that in the attachment of some types of closure, expensive machinery is required to fasten, for example metal flanges to containers, which machines typically require re-tooling after wear, arising from the creation of welds or rolled flanges to connect the two parts together in a sealing relationship.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with a specific aspect of the invention, there is provided a container and closure combination, for the containment of fluids and extraction therefrom by way of an extraction tube, the container comprising a closed volume with an opening, the closure being configured to close the opening of the container, wherein the closure is provided with an aperture and wherein the closure, upon fitment, cannot be removed from the container opening, the aperture of the closure being defined by a unitary elastic valve member permitting unidirectional flow of fluid through the aperture; wherein the valve can operate, interchangeably, between: a first, closed condition, to prevent a free flow of fluid from the container; and, a second, operational condition, with the extraction tube sealingly engaged within the valve, to permit an extraction of fluid from the container through the tube. By having a unitary, elastic valve member, the valve can conveniently be manufactured with the closure in a simple manufacturing process e.g. in what is known as a two-shot process, whereby the inner valve is manufactured from an elastic plastics material, with the outer surround/container engagement portion being manufactured from a more rigid plastics material.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention can comprise not only the container and closure with aperture but also a tube. For example, the invention may comprise a sports drink with the apertured closure together with a tube. The tube can function as a straw, whereby a drink such as a sports drink can conveniently be consumed, the cap preventing tainting of the drink replacement thereof, which could be useful in competition settings, for example, to ensure uniformity in provision of drinks. The tube can comprise a paste/sauce siphon/vacuum dispensing means or be associated with a paste/sauce siphon/vacuum dispensing means whereby a condiment such as a ketchup, mustard etc., can be dispensed.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Conveniently, the apertured closure or cap is irreversibly fastened to a container by means of co-operating detent mechanism, similar to the frangible devices that indicate that an apertured closure has been removed associated with many consumer products (save that the detent item is not frangible and prevents removal of the apertured closure). Other methods of irreversible attachment could also be employed, such as one-way, push fit aperture closures using barbs from one part physically engaging a relatively softer surface of the other part of the container opening and apertured closure combinations or by having a reverse friction effect, thereby preventing removal. The respective parts of the combination could also be irreversibly or permanently attached by means of adhesive&#x2014;glue or solvent&#x2014;or by heat welding. Simple mechanical ratchet one-way locking systems can also be employed and other more sophisticated mechanical one-way systems. After the closure cap has been securely attached, it is ready for an appropriate format of dispensing tube to be inserted to extract the fluid contents. This apertured closure security feature eliminates the misuse of fluid contents in a simple and cost effective way. The apertured closure of the present invention can simply and effectively prevent an abuse of contents, spillage, pilferage, wastage and cross-contamination.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The apertured closure of the present invention can conveniently be manufactured by well established techniques of injection molding together with over molding, whereby to maintain production costs at acceptable levels, comparable to the manufacture of known cap closures.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a container and closure with aperture combination, the container comprising a closed volume with a generally circularly shaped rim or opening, the apertured closure comprising a closure element having an inside portion for abutment with the rim, to sealingly engage therewith, a wall portion depending from the inside portion having cooperating means to securely locate with rim of the container, the outside wall of the apertured closure surrounding the outside apertured closure; wherein the apertured closure is defined with an indentation leading to a closable seal, the seal being operable to accept a tube of a dispensing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Once securely located with the container, the apertured closure cannot be removed without damage to either the container or closure from the container, thereby preventing any unintentional or accidental dispensing of the fluid in the preparation of cleaning preparations, lubricant mixtures etcetera, where fluids need to be dispensed in measured quantities. In a simple example, a standard container for a cleaning fluid could be controlled by the use of the present invention whereby a dispenser can be used to allow metered amounts of an additive to water for a cleaning process; by having a tube associated with the dispenser then the correct metered dosage may be provided, saving waste; accidental over-pouring is prevented. Preferably, upon first mating of the apertured closure and container, they become irreversibly fastened each to the other. In the prior example, the closure can be simply fastened by hand tightening. Additionally, by having the apertured closure secured in a non-removable fashion, removal of fluid from a container with such an apertured closure by unauthorized persons is prevented, in a simple fashion. Additionally, this can provide significant advantages in the safe disposal of toxic or otherwise undesirable fluids; since any remaining fluid cannot be removed and the container and apertured closure combination cannot be re-used, the container and apertured closure combination must be disposed of, conveniently through safe/authorized channels.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The cooperating means may comprise mutually engaging screw threads or mutually engaging bayonet fastening elements. The cooperating means may comprise detent means, whereby, for example, a clip associated with the apertured closure overlies a detent means, such as a collar about the aperture associated with the container. Such a detent system means that the aperture need not be limited to a circular opening, as required by a rotationally fitted connector.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The apertured closure could also be secured by an adhesive, in the event that the cap was an original fitment. Contoured apertured closures could be fitted whereby the apertured closure and container could only operate with corresponding dispensing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, the seal can comprise a two-flap arrangement (also known as a &#x201c;duckbill seal&#x201d;), or multi-flap variants thereof. The seal member can have a tube feed-in section that is of a general conic shape, having a spiral wire element molded therein to provide a degree of ruggedness. A duckbill seal can be adapted so as to seal with generally rectangular conduit tubes. The seal, when opened with a tube for dispensing can also provide space for air to pass into the container, since dispensing means typically use vacuum forces to enable passage of fluid, a partial vacuum within the container will reduce the amount of a dispensed quantity. In the alternative, a gastight seal may be provided as between a tube and the cap, as might be required for certain classes of fluids, when the central seal is required to be airtight. For example, the aperture may define a ring of an approximate dimension slightly less than the dimension of a tube through which aperture the tube will be connected, whereby the seal, in use is gastight or fluid-tight. Additionally, the close fitting could remove any fluid that may be present upon the exterior wall of the tube as the tube is extracted. The rim of the aperture may be reinforced by the provision of an enhanced amount of polymeric/rubber material about the aperture, preferably further reinforced with a closed loop defined by a spiral spring, whereby a greater degree of strength is provided to the aperture. Additionally, a one-way valve could be provided to enable pressure compensation to occur e.g. by the provision of air, whereby to prevent vacuum problems arising in any dispensing of the fluid.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It will be appreciated that when a fluid tube is inserted into a container, which will generally have an aperture directed upwardly, that the weight of dispensed fluid in the tube will increase the weight of the tube and thus cause forces to act upon the seal, tending to induce the aperture to a degree of ovality (for a nominally circular tube or conduit). Accordingly, in another aspect of the invention, there is provided a centralizing aperture, located at the top of the apertured closure (as seen from the user, when in normal use, with the apertured closure at the top of a fluid container). The centralizing apertures may comprise a further polymeric member with an aperture or a device akin to an iris diaphragm, whereby the strain from the weight of the tube and fluid therein is borne by this first, upper aperture.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention can be utilized in, for example, a stores department of a company, to ensure that fluids are utilized only with respect to their prescribed uses. In such cases, the cap is fitted after the container is initially opened, with any protective seal removed. Additionally, a container may be supplied with an apertured closure in accordance with the present invention, together with a stopper whereby to prevent loss of fluid in transit where a dispensing tube is inserted, in use, whereby to prevent loss of fluid in transit prior and subsequent to extracting fluid from said container.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is provided an apertured closure for use with a container. The apertured closure can be screwed-in, clipped-on or otherwise retained to ensure that the apertured closure cannot be removed whereby to enable good stock control and/or effective dispensing of liquids within a container. Upon disposal, the provision of a bung can assist in closure of the aperture for a dispensing tube, whereby the container can be appropriately disposed of through official channels. The bung can be fitted in an irremovable fashion, though a detent, a one-way screw thread or otherwise. Whilst the invention has been described as a unitary integrally molded closure and valve combination, it is possible that these are arranged as separate items.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention thus provides a simple to fabricate container stopper, which can enable satisfaction of security, health and safety requirements that are imposed on all types of businesses as well as increasing compliance with rules and regulations that are seen by some as a hindrance to normal business practice. Additionally, certain industries involved with medical device manufacture, drug manufacture and food production, etc. have additional mandated standards regarding control of fluids with the use of dispensing equipment. The present invention can assist in compliance of such further standards.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Thus, in summary, the present invention can provide an easy to use cap that once fitted to a container cannot be removed for the placement of tubes associated with vacuum/siphons associated with dispensing means and tubes as in straws for drinking from a bottle. Fluids for all uses from any type of container or receptacle whether it is a bottle, drum, tin, can, bag or box, through a dispensing means such as a tube, syphon, straw, syringe, hose or pipe.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The accompanying drawings illustrate several embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention according to the embodiments.

In the following description, numerous specific details are set out in order to provide a complete understanding to the present invention. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that the present invention may be put into practice with variations of the specific. For the avoidance of doubt, the term closure refers to devices used to close or seal a bottle, jug, jar, tube, can, container, barrel, keg etc. Closures can be a cap, cover, lid, plug, bung, etc.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, there is shown a first embodiment of the invention. Apertured closure <b>30</b> is shown affixed to a standard five-liter container <b>36</b> as referred to in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The apertured closure has an inside seal member which abuts a rim of the opening of the container. Whilst the rim of the container is not shown, examples of such are well known, typically comprising a short length of generally circularly cylindrical wall about an aperture to the inside of the container, the outside wall having a screw-thread, which is inter-engageable with an inside wall of the apertured closure. Conveniently, the apertured closure <b>30</b> has a locking mechanism whereby once attached by way of the screw-thread fittings, removal of the apertured closure is not possible. One-way-detent systems&#x2014;or barbed systems&#x2014;are widely available for child-proof caps and the same detent release system can be adapted to ensure that no release is possible. A shroud may also depend from the wall of the apertured closure so that it is not possible to insert a tool to remove the cap, or at least not to enable removal and subsequent re-fitting, whereby to enable tampering to be determined. It is also possible to have the apertured closure attached by a push-on, non-releasable fashion as are also widely available. The apertured closure has a top outside face <b>31</b> with a central depression <b>32</b>; along the outside wall of the apertured closure <b>33</b>, there are provided knurled formations <b>34</b> which can be utilized to enable the cap to be securely fastened upon first use.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a view of the inside of the apertured closure <b>30</b>.

A perimeter inside seal member <b>42</b> is placed within the apertured closure whereby, in use and upon fastening of the apertured closure with respect to a container, a seal is created which prevents fluid seepage therebetween. The seal of aperture seal member <b>41</b> and inside seal member <b>42</b> are conveniently made from the same plastics material at the same time in an injection molding operation. The seal is conveniently manufactured from a thermoplastics rubber such as nitrile butadiene rubber, but compatibility/suitability of such a seal must be determined with reference to the fluid contained within the container. Nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) typically comprises a family of unsaturated copolymers of 2-propenenitrile and various butadiene monomers (1,2-butadiene and 1,3-butadiene) and the specific physical and chemical properties vary depending on the polymer's composition of nitrile, this form of synthetic rubber being generally resistant to oil, fuel, and other chemicals (the more nitrile within the polymer, the higher the resistance to oils but the lower the flexibility of the material), with a typical usable temperature ranges of &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. to 108&#xb0; C. Neoprene could also be chosen, for example; there are many other types of suitable materials. The inside wall of the apertured closure defines an internal thread <b>43</b>, which corresponds with the outside thread of a container with which the container is to seal with respect to an upper sealing edge of a container opening and to which the apertured closure is associated. Reference numeral <b>44</b> indicates one-way security detent teeth, which are arranged around the inside of the apertured closure and co-operate with corresponding detent teeth associated with the container. In this case, the container is a standard 5-liter container with the detent teeth indicted at reference <b>46</b> per <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>&#x2014;arranged for use with elastic &#x201c;squeeze-release&#x201d; child-proof caps. In contrast with such caps, the present invention provides an apertured closure or cap which does not provide any give arising from any inherent flexibility nor any frangibility&#x2014;some known tamper-evident caps operate in such a fashion, whereby to ensure that once an apertured closure in accordance with the invention has been placed upon the container, it cannot be removed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the apertured closure with a plastics tube <b>50</b> inserted and retained by the seal member <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The present invention, in a first embodiment, therefore enables the insertion of a delivery tube into a container such as an injection molded semi-rigid lid with a threaded outlet. In this first embodiment, when the apertured closure is fitted and a tube inserted, then the fluid can be dispensed. In a cleaning department store, for example, the container will be attached to a bench or wall, to reduce chances of a container being dropped etc. in use. The dispensing tube can be easily inserted and the use of the apertured closure will prevent the contents of the bottle leaking or spilling from the apertured closure, whilst the tube associated with a vacuum dispensing apparatus will allow control of the fluid to be dispensed, rather than the whole container being decanted by hand, with or without a measuring cup or similar. After the fluid in the container has been removed, as the tube is extracted, any remaining fluid adhering to the tube will substantially be removed by the valve of the closure wiping around the tube, assisting in keeping the area of use, and the assembly itself, in as clean a state as possible. The inside wall depending from the apertured closure central area component includes an internal screw thread allowing the lid to attach to a standard blow molded container. The semi-rigid lid includes barbed features on the inside of its internal rim. When the apertured closure is fitted to the bottle and screwed into position, the barbed features locate over existing barbed features positioned on the neck of the blow-molded bottle. Because of the orientation of the barbed features they act to lock the apertured closure in place, preventing the apertured closure from being unscrewed from the blow-molded bottle. It will be appreciated that push-on apertured closures which have a hooked flange which locate about corresponding detents associated with a neck of an outlet of the container are also possible, although by use of a pre-existing screw-threaded outlet for a container, then correct fastening can be simply ensured.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The semi-rigid lid molding acts as a pre-form component allowing a flexible polymer to be over-molded onto the lid. The semi-rigid lid includes a central open aperture into which a diaphragm is molded in the flexible material. The diaphragm is of a specific shape, which will allow a tube to be inserted from the outside of the lid into the bottle, but not from the other direction, since the entrance to the diaphragm seal is tapered. When the tube is removed the diaphragm closes preventing the liquid in the bottle from leaking. The shape of the diaphragm follows the form of a slit valve, such as a duckbill or cross slit valve. A cross slit valve, when viewed from the underside the diaphragm forms a cross shape. The shoulders of the cross-like membrane taper up to the diaphragm body at an angle. When liquid held inside the container applies pressure to the valve, the liquid acts on these angled faces pressing the valve closed and acting to reduce the likelihood of spillage of the contents from the container. The cross-like membrane creates four indented features in the conical shape of the diaphragm. These have a central crease line where the faces of the cross-form meet. When a tube is passed through the diaphragm from the outside, these features fold outwards allowing the diaphragm to open and grip the outside of the tube. When the tube is withdrawn from the bottle, the indented features naturally return to their original molded shape, so that the integrity of the cross slit valve form is maintained. Tri-star slit valves also exist, as do valves with more than four slits (i.e. cross slit). Such slit valves are, in essence, check valves that can be precision-molded, one-piece elastomeric valves that provide reliable backflow prevention at low-pressure differentials&#x2014;that is to say, with reverse flow, a negative differential pressure is created whereby backflow is checked. Slit check valves can straightforwardly be designed to start functioning at specific closing pressure ranges, dependent on specific requirements, and arising from valve size, geometry, and compound characteristics. Slit check valves can be designed to operate in pressures as low as a few millimeters of water.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b></figref>, the container cap is shown in plan, perspective and side views, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> show the central indentation <b>32</b>, which is manufactured from a resilient plastics material. It will be noted that there is a spoke-like pattern <b>62</b> radiating from the depression area, which comprise apertures defined in the semi-rigid cap member <b>61</b>; not only does this provide a pattern&#x2014;which can help identification of particular fluids if supplied in different colors, but also assist in a mechanical bonding of the resilient plastics material to the semi-rigid apertured closure. The outer, semi-rigid lid (i.e. less resilient than the central resilient plastics material can be manufactured from a material such as high density polyethylene (HDPE) or polypropylene, and similar plastics materials. It will be appreciated that other materials, such as brass, aluminum alloys and other metals could also be utilized to fabricate the semi-rigid cap member.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, which show an apertured closure in cross-section, with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> also including the aperture part of the container or bottle. Valve <b>41</b> can be seen in greater detail, which loosely surrounds the tube inserted therethrough, yet only allows air to pass into the container as fluid is dispensed therefrom. Given that dispensing means typically use vacuum forces to enable passage of fluid, a partial vacuum within the container will reduce the amount of a dispensed quantity. A gastight seal may be provided as between a tube and the apertured closure, as might be required for certain classes of fluids, when the central seal is gastight. Accordingly, in addition to the valve as defined above for the tube, closely fitting O-rings may be secured, which O-rings create a fluid-tight seal, between aperture and tube. It will be appreciated that different seals will be required for specific tube diameters. Additionally, a one way valve will need to be provided to enable air to enter the closed volume of the container whereby to prevent vacuum problems arising in any dispensing of fluid.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, there is shown a further variation. Apertured closure <b>30</b> has on interior walls a detent mechanism indicated at <b>1100</b>, <b>1101</b>. The valve remains the same, with seal member <b>41</b>, inside rim seal <b>42</b>. Instead of an exterior screw thread on the outside neck of the container, second detent elements are shown, <b>1102</b>, <b>1103</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows a still further variant, being a close-up of the indented element, but not details of the cap-to-container connection. In this case, a tube <b>50</b> is sealing engaged with respect to the inlet by close fitting body of the apertured closure <b>1202</b>, aided by a wedge-section seal element <b>1203</b>. Additional non-return spikes (not shown) may be placed to prevent removal of the tube, for example if the product was particularly hazardous. Since this embodiment sealingly engages around the tube <b>50</b>, a separate inlet valve must be provided within the apertured closure, or additionally with respect to the container, unless, of course the dispensing tube also carries a separate line, which ensures that an appropriate degree of relative vacuum is maintained within the gaseous space of the container. Reference numeral <b>41</b> indicates the seal per <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> that is displaced when the tube is inserted, which seal enables sealing of the contents of the container, once in place and prior to insertion of the tube.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">A container may be supplied with an apertured closure in accordance with the present invention, in which case the apertured closure may be adhesively fastened to the container. A stopper-like element may be provided within the aperture, whereby to prevent loss of fluid in transit. By the use of a suitable adhesive tape, the apertured closure may be retained. In the alternative a twisted wire-seal fastener, in the style of a champagne cork fastener may be utilized. Other securing mechanisms could be deployed.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the aperture valve conveniently comprises a cross-slit valve; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b><i>a </i></figref>is a plan view of the cross-slit valve <b>126</b>, being an opposite face of the closure as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b><i>b </i>and <b>12</b><i>c </i></figref>shows the aperture valve&#x2014;made from an elastic plastics material, such as a thermoplastic elastomer, in perspective and plan views, respectively, separate from the outer, harder plastics molding&#x2014;conveniently made from a plastics material such as polypropylene of the closure. Other materials are known to the person skilled in the art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b><i>d </i></figref>is a sectional view on line C-C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b><i>c</i></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b><i>f </i></figref>is a sectional view on line D-D of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b><i>e</i></figref>. As is known, thermoplastic elastomer, bonds well to polypropylene, the injection molding being conveniently performed in a manual or automated twin shot injection process, as is known. Other suitable materials that may be used can be silicon rubber, natural rubber, polybutylene, ABS polymers which have suitable elasticity values and may be formed with additives such as lubricants to control the friction of the plastics material so that it is appropriate to the liquid contained and tube employed to enable flow of liquid from the container.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">It is convenient to mold the aperture valve such that the valve is sealed in a closed state upon manufacture. This provides surety against spillage when the aperture closure in accordance with the present invention is fastened to a container with a fluid therein yet has not been used. Conveniently, the valve member is sealed adjacent a peripheral edge of the cross slit <b>120</b> per <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>12</b></figref><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>c</i>, etc., the connecting member being indicated by reference numeral <b>121</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b><i>g</i>-<b>12</b><i>h</i></figref>, there is a valve <b>124</b>, <b>125</b> defining a slit <b>121</b>; as a tube <b>122</b> having a diagonally cut end <b>123</b>, is brought onto the flared upper surfaces of the valve, <b>124</b>, <b>125</b>, the slit is separated. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b><i>i</i></figref>, the tube has caused the polymeric material to separate at the thin bonded region <b>121</b> and the peripheral edges of the valve engage with the external surface of the tube. Alternatively, there may be for example, an inverted v-profile lower edge of the valve, the slit being made either as part of the molding process or as an extra process step in manufacture. This V-notch slit aids the tearing of the membrane of the valve whilst inserting a conduit, although the presence of such a slit is dependent upon size of aperture valve and the materials employed. Upon insertion of a tube for a first time, the mold line of the valve is forced apart, without detriment to the future sealing ability of the valve. That is to say, in this further embodiment, the aperture valve of the closure can be produced so as to be sealed before initial insertion of a tube or conduit for the purpose of transportation and conformity. It has been found that the tube is preferably cut diagonally with respect to the axis of conduit for the tube or a tip element is fastened to the tube, whereby to facilitate insertion of the tube. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b><i>h </i>and <b>12</b><i>i</i></figref>, the tube is shown as having been cut diagonally at the insertion end. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b><i>j</i></figref>, tube <b>122</b> could have an apertured end closure element <b>128</b> fitted on the end of a tube that has been cut normally with respect to the radial axis of the tube. This apertured end also benefits from having a number of openings <b>129</b> for fluid transfer into the tube. By not having a single opening, then the chances of having that single opening closed by debris or by intimate contact with a container wall are removed. Additionally a non-return valve could be optionally associated with this tube termination.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">It will be appreciated that whilst the first embodiment has been shown with reference to a five liter container, the apertured closure, flexible diaphragm with aperture can be made to in a range of sizes, to accommodate a number of standard diameter tubes and can be made with a bayonet style, clip-over style or screw-threaded whether it be left or right handed. It can be made for any size container and for any size of tube. Accordingly, for example, the container could be a twenty liter container or other commonly used container from which fluids need to be dispensed, provided that an outlet has a neck, screw-threaded or otherwise which the apertured closure or cap in accordance with the invention can locate. The connection of the apertured closure with respect to the container could also comprise a push-fit design with either a male or female clip design to suit a push fit design container as shown in diagram. Whilst most apertures tend to be circular in shape, by virtue of their having a circular, screw-threaded aperture, it will be appreciated that if a detent/clip system is employed, the aperture need not be circular and a square, rectangular, other polygonal or irregular shaped opening could be utilized. For example, the irregular shape may be provided so that for particularly hazardous fluids, then appropriate shape determinant closures are to be used with such classes of fluids. In an alternative scenario, a shape could be associated with a particular manufacturer of containers and apertured closures. It is conceivable that an outline of a logo of a manufacturer could define the shape of the opening and thus the corresponding apertured closure.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b</i></figref>, there is shown a variation of the valve, for use (typically, but not exclusively) with substantially rectangular tubes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>a </i></figref>shows one side of a flap of valve <b>1301</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>b </i></figref>shows valve <b>1301</b> as would be seen from an inside of a container, prior to placement of the tube. Valve <b>1301</b> in this case is the simple single slit, two-flap duckbill valve. The lips of the flap are tapered in the same way as the cross slit valve described above and, in operation, utilizes a pressure of liquid acting upon it to cause the valve to close. Other types of unidirectional or non-return valves are known, for examples conical valves <b>1501</b> and <b>1502</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b><i>a</i>-<b>16</b><i>b</i></figref>, a further type of apertured closure are shown with a strain relief member that is operable to urge a tube that is introduced to enter the valve substantially centrally into the seal-aperture, whereby undue forces do not cause the tube to lie in a position other than being substantially axial with respect to a central axis of the aperture. Strain relief element <b>1701</b> comprises an apertured membrane, having an aperture <b>1702</b> larger than a tube intended to pass through the seal-orifice: the strain relief element providing a more rugged aperture against which forces arising from a tube, often several meters long and liquid filled, bearing upon the aperture seal.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b><i>a</i>-<b>17</b><i>c </i></figref>show, respectively, a second type of strain relief member in perspective, cross-sectional and perspective cross-sectional views of an iris diaphragm the iris diaphragm element <b>1704</b> comprising resiliently-biased elements <b>1705</b> which seek to reduce the aperture so-formed <b>1706</b>, as is known, the element being sufficiently rugged to bear weight arising from a tube being directed through the sealed orifice of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b><i>a </i></figref>shows an opening <b>1802</b> in a container <b>1800</b> such as the one depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c</i></figref>.

With reference to the super elliptic portion <b>221</b>, this can be described as an area bounded in part by two oppositely directed Lame curves; for an n-fold duckbill the corresponding tube can have n-elliptical portions. It would be possible to provide a keyed tube&#x2014;a tube having super-ellipse star configuration&#x2014;for specialist fluids, for example, of a length sufficient to extend to ensure that maximum use of a fluid is removed from a container. One could also have a rigid or semi-rigid tube extension, which affixes to an ordinary tube, for specific specialist requirement, for example. Of course, basic polygonal shapes may also be employed. It will be appreciated that the use of the super-ellipse design together with the n-fold duckbill can be applied to the designs discussed above, in general.
