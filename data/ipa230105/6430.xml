Preferably, the width of the cable tray is equal to the width of the second end over the entire length, except at the first end, where the cable tray is less wide. In other words, the cable tray preferably has a constant width over its entire length, except at the first end; there, the cable tray is narrower. Compared to cable trays whose width is constant except at one end where the cable tray is wider, the cable trays according to this embodiment can be placed closer to a wall. Thus, the cable trays according to the present invention require less installation space.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Preferably, the invention provides a cable tray comprising: a bottom and two upright sides; and a first end extending as a continuation of the bottom and the upright sides and a second end extending as a continuation of the bottom and the upright sides, wherein the width of the cable tray is equal to the width of the second end over the entire length, except at the first end where the cable tray is less wide; and each side of the first end comprises a barb, and each side of the second end comprises a barb opening.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the first end is 1.0 to 3.0 mm less wide than the rest of the cable tray, or the first end is 2.0 to 4.0 mm less wide than the rest of the cable tray, or the first end is 5.0 to 7.0 mm less wide than the rest of the cable tray, or the first end is 6.0 to 8.0 mm less wide than the rest of the cable tray.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the first end is 0.5 to 1.5 mm less wide on each side than the rest of the cable tray, or the first end is 1.0 to 2.0 mm less wide on each side than the rest of the cable tray, or the first end is 2.5 to 3.5 mm less wide on each side than the rest of the cable tray, or the first end is 3.0 to 4.0 mm less wide on each side than the rest of the cable tray.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The term &#x201c;cable tray&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to a channel or trough which is configured to accommodate and support lines from utility companies, such as for example electricity cables or data cables. Cable trays are typically used in a building or other installation, so that the lines can be held securely outside the reach of third parties, for example in the vicinity of the ceiling of the building, so that the lines can be passed <b>30</b> safely between starting and end point.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">During use, barbs of the first end snap into the barb openings of the second end of an adjacent cable tray. As the second end is wider, the barbs of the first end are provided on the outside of the sides of the cable tray. The inside of the cable tray is the space between its sides. The outside of a cable tray is the space outside its sides.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the barb openings and/or the barbs are crescent-shaped. Preferably, both the barb openings and the barbs are crescent-shaped. In these embodiments, the barbs are smaller than the corresponding barb openings. In this way, the forces acting on the barb openings during normal use are distributed more evenly across the edge of the barb openings, thus reducing the stresses on the edge of the barb opening.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In addition, the present barbs have the advantage that the forces (on the barb) are absorbed in three directions. In other words, the stresses occurring in the barbs are absorbed (or transmitted) close by the base of the barbs. This prevents the occurrence of peak or structural stresses which could plastically deform the barb when cable tray assemblies are subjected to the full safe working load. Thus, the present barbs as well as the cable trays and assemblies comprising the barbs have the advantage that the forces acting on the barb are transmitted in three directions directly at the base.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Barb openings which are crescent-shaped may, alternatively or additionally, be described as comprising a straight side and an elliptical side. Or, expressed in yet another way, such barb openings have a shape which corresponds to a part of an ellipse between the periphery of the ellipse and a line which runs parallel to the short axis of the ellipse, preferably the smallest part of the ellipse, between the periphery of the ellipse and a line which runs parallel to the short axis of the ellipse.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The crescent-shaped barbs may, alternatively or additionally, also be described as comprising a straight side and an elliptical side. Expressed in other words, such barbs have a shape which corresponds to a part of an ellipse between the periphery of the ellipse and a line which is parallel to the short axis of the ellipse, preferably the smallest part of the ellipse between the periphery of the ellipse and a line which is parallel to the short axis of the ellipse.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Preferably, each side of the first end comprises exactly one barb. In other words, each side of the first end preferably comprises one and only one barb. Expressed in yet another way, the cable tray comprises preferably one and not more than one barb per side at the first end. Preferably, the barbs are placed at the location of the neutral axis of the cable tray.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Preferably, each side of the second end comprises exactly one barb opening.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Preferably, the invention provides a cable tray comprising: a bottom and two upright sides; and a first end extending as a continuation bottom and the upright sides and a second end extending as a continuation of the bottom and the upright sides, wherein the width of the cable tray is equal to the width of the second end over the entire length, except at the first end where the cable tray is less wide; and each side of the first end comprises exactly one barb, and each side of the second end comprises exactly one barb opening.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Compared to cable trays comprising barbs in the bottom, the cable trays according to the present invention are able to absorb both positive and negative moments in the longitudinal direction in an efficient manner. Positive moments typically occur in the center between two bearing points. Negative moments typically occur at the location of bearing points. With cable trays which have barbs in the bottom, the coupling of two adjacent cable trays therefore easily bends when the cable trays are supported at the position where a first end and a second end have been clicked together. In practice, this is then solved in a suboptimum manner, for example by not supporting the cable tray at the position where a first and second end have been clicked together, thus necessitating more supports. Alternatively, in such suboptimum systems, two adjacent cable trays are attached to one another using additional bolts, which renders installation significantly more difficult. By contrast, the present cable trays and assemblies can be supported at any desired location and can be clicked together in a simple manner.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Another drawback of providing barbs in the bottom is the fact that the presence of a barb in the bottom involves a significant risk of damage to cables during installation. In the cable trays according to the present invention, the barbs have been provided in the sides, preferably one barb in each side, and in such a way that there is no risk of damage to cables.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the barb is oriented horizontally. In other words, in these embodiments, the cable trays can be pushed into each other by pushing the first end of a first cable tray over the second end of a second cable tray in the longitudinal direction of these cable trays. Compared to barbs which are oriented vertically, where cable trays are clicked together vertically, cable trays with horizontally oriented barbs require less installation space.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In specific embodiments, the cable tray may be a(n elongate) cable track or a cabletrack accessory, such as for example a horizontal (cable) bend, a T piece, a branch piece, a crossing piece, a rising bend or a descending bend. An end piece with a first end as described herein or an end piece with a second end as described herein is also provided herein.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Preferably, the cable trays are elongate, but other shapes are also possible. Thus, the cable trays may, for example, be star-shaped or be formed as a corner. The cable trays may be curved or straight. Preferably, the cable trays are straight. Preferably, the cable trays are elongate.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The cross section of a cable tray as described herein may be rectangular, round or elliptical, or may have a different shape. Preferably, however, the cross section of the cable tray is rectangular. In other words, the cable tray preferably has a U-shaped cross section. An elongate cable tray may thus be considered to have a longitudinal axis (A-A&#x2032;), an inside (B) and an outside (C).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The cable trays comprise a bottom and two upright sides. Typically, the bottom and the upright sides are made in one piece. Preferably, the entire cable tray is made in one piece.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As an extension of the bottom and the upright sides, the cable tray comprises a first end extending as an extension of the cable tray and a second end extending as an extension of the cable tray.

In other words, preferably the axis of symmetry of the barb is in the longitudinal direction of the cable tray. As a result thereof, the barb makes it possible for two adjacent cable trays to be clicked together to form an assembled assembly in the longitudinal direction and secure them, even when subjected to a high load.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Preferably, the barb is directed towards the outside. Preferably, the barb is situated on the outside of the first end. In some embodiments, the second end slides over the first end. In this case, the barb of the first end may be clicked into the barb opening of the second end.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The term &#x201c;width&#x201d;, as used herein in the context of a cable tray, refers to the distance between the outermost points of two opposite upright sides.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, the width is equal to the width of the second end over the entire length of the cable tray, except at the first end.

In other words, in some embodiments, the inwardly folded upper longitudinal edge comprises a recess.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">This makes it possible to produce assembled assemblies of an approximately constant height. This helps to prevent an abrupt transition between two cable trays in an assembled assembly.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, the inwardly folded upper longitudinal edge is open towards the underside.

This prevents the occurrence of peak or structural stresses which could plastically deform the barb if assemblies of cable trays are subjected to the full safe working load. Thus, the present barbs, as well as cable trays and assemblies which comprise the barbs, have the advantage that the forces acting on the barb are transmitted in three directions directly at the base.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0147">In some embodiments, the barb consists of carbon steel. In some embodiments, the barb then has undergone a surface treatment. Suitable surface treatments comprise strip-galvanized coating, hot-dip galvanization, powder-coating and plastification. Such barbs are very cost-efficient and durable, and make it possible to produce connections having a high load-bearing capacity. In some embodiments, the barb consists of stainless steel.

Also, the cable trays (<b>200</b>,<b>201</b>) are preferably less high at the first end (<b>210</b>): the cable trays (<b>200</b>,<b>201</b>) are of equal height over the entire length, except at the first end (<b>210</b>) where they are less high. In particular, the width of the first end (<b>210</b>) is approximately 2.75 mm (i.e., 2&#xd7;the sheet thickness of 1.25 mm+0.25 mm) smaller than the width of the second end (<b>220</b>), the height of the first end (<b>210</b>) is approximately 2.75 mm (i.e., 2&#xd7;the sheet thickness of 1.25 mm+0.25 mm) smaller than the height of the second end (<b>220</b>). Furthermore, the bottom (<b>240</b>) of the first end (<b>210</b>) is preferably also 1.50 mm (i.e., 1&#xd7;the sheet thickness+0.25 mm) raised with respect to the bottom (<b>240</b>) of the rest of the cable tray (<b>200</b>,<b>201</b>). This facilitates the sliding of the first end (<b>210</b>) and the second end (<b>220</b>) into each other and makes easy assembly possible.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0243">The bottom (<b>240</b>) of the cable trays (<b>200</b>,<b>201</b>) comprises a pre-cut trapezoidal folding flap (<b>260</b>).

The fitting openings (<b>241</b>) in the bottom (<b>240</b>) readily make installation by one person possible. For example, the first end (<b>210</b>) can easily be pushed over the second end (<b>220</b>) by using a flat tool (such as an open-end wrench or open-end spanner). In the first stage of fitting, the fitting openings (<b>241</b>) of the first and second end are positioned in such a way that only a small rectangular opening is created. The barb (<b>100</b>) of the first end (<b>210</b>) now just touches the second end. A simple flat tool can be inserted into the openings (<b>241</b>). By rotating this flat tool, the overlap of the fitting openings will be increased and the two ends will move towards each other, ultimately resulting in the barb (<b>100</b>) engaging with the barb opening (<b>250</b>). By providing several fitting openings, the assembling force can be doubled or increased. Relatively large assembling forces can be produced by another form of overlap, as a result of which even greater thicknesses can still be assembled by one person using a standard tool with a higher torque capacity (for example a ratchet pawl).</p><p id="p-0238" num="0245">The fitting openings (<b>211</b>, <b>221</b>) in the sides make release by one person possible. For example, during fitting, the first end (<b>210</b>) and the second end (<b>220</b>) can be slid over one another and clicked together, the length of the required part of the cable tray (<b>200</b>) can be marked off, the first end (<b>210</b>) and the second end (<b>220</b>) can be detached again in order to cut off the required piece of the cable tray (<b>200</b>) and the piece of the cable tray (<b>200</b>) with the correct dimensions can subsequently be fitted in a simple manner.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0246">Release by one person is ensured by the opening (<b>105</b>) of which the barb forms part. The distance from the barb (<b>100</b>) to the end of the opening (<b>105</b>) of which the barb forms part may be chosen in such a manner that a small open-end wrench can be inserted therein. This is then used as a lever in order to bend the barb opening (<b>250</b>) of the second end so far from the barb for each side that the barb is released and the ends can be disengaged.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0247">Furthermore, the cable trays (<b>200</b>, <b>201</b>) comprise longitudinal perforations (<b>291</b>) and transverse perforations (<b>292</b>).
