More specifically, the present subject matter relates to a vehicle safety system facilitating access to a user to operate the vehicle after he walks around the vehicle and clears any obstruction before starting the vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known that keyless entry systems have long been employed in vehicles to permit vehicle doors to be unlocked without requiring the user to insert a key into a keyhole provided at an entry handle on the vehicle door. Typically, the keyless entry systems are used to remotely lock, unlock and start an engine of the vehicle using radiofrequency (RF) signals.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Several keyless entry systems have been disclosed in the past to control access to the vehicles. One such example is disclosed in a U.S. Pat. No. 10,414,377, entitled, &#x201c;System and method for facilitating user access to vehicles based on biometric information&#x201d; (&#x201c;the '377 patent&#x201d;). The '377 patent discloses systems and methods provided for authorizing a user to access an access-controlled environment. The system includes a system server platform that communicates with mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) and on-board vehicle computing devices accessed by users. The embodiments enable a series of operations whereby a user accessing a vehicle is prompted to biometrically authenticate using the user's smartphone or on-board vehicle computer. In addition, the system can further authorize the user and electronically facilitate access to the vehicle as well as perform other authorized operations relating to the use of the vehicle. In addition, the vehicle access system integrates with various computing devices and computer-based services accessible to the user. The systems and methods also facilitate active monitoring of the vehicle occupants and environmental conditions using optical sensors and the like so as to enhance security, convenience and safety of the occupants during use of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another example is disclosed in a United States Published Application No. 20170018129, entitled &#x201c;Vehicle Entry Keypad with Battery Charge Indicator&#x201d; (&#x201c;the '129 Publication&#x201d;). The '129 Publication discloses a keypad mounted on the exterior of an electric vehicle, for example on the B-pillar, and is used to enter a code to enable unlocking and entry into the vehicle. The keypad is further operative to provide an indication of the state-of-charge of the battery of the vehicle. The keypad is made up of a series of active (for example, touch-sensitive) regions which illuminate when touched to enter the code. Each active region may illuminate selectively and individually to represent a predetermined percentage of battery charge, so that the total number of active regions illuminated corresponds to the state-of-charge of the battery.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another example is disclosed in a U.S. Pat. No. 9,499,129, entitled &#x201c;Methods and systems for using cloud services to assign e-keys to access vehicles&#x201d; (&#x201c;the '129 patent&#x201d;). The '129 patent discloses a method for providing access to a vehicle. The method includes sending, by a server, an access code for the vehicle to a portable device. The access code is configured to be transferred by the portable device to the vehicle. Then, receiving, by the server, data from the portable device that is indicative that the portable device is located outside of the vehicle or proximate thereto. Sending, by the server, validation to the vehicle that the access code received by the vehicle was sent to the portable device, and then the vehicle is configured to send an electronic key to the portable device upon receiving the validation. The electronic key is associated with at least one privilege associated with use of the vehicle, and the at least one privilege is defined based on the access code.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Although the above-discussed disclosures provide different methods of accessing the vehicle, they do not provide any information to the user regarding any obstruction around the vehicle that could cause an unintentional property damage or personal injury.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, there is a need in the art to provide a vehicle safety system that provides access to the user to operate the vehicle after he walks around the vehicle and clears any obstruction before starting the vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an object of the present subject matter to provide an improved vehicle safety system and that avoids the drawback of known techniques.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is another object of the present subject matter to provide a vehicle safety system to ensure there is no obstruction around the vehicle before starting the vehicle to reduce likelihood of an unintentional property damage or personal injury.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to achieve one or more objects, the present subject matter provides a vehicle safety system or a walk around alerting system that ensures a user of a vehicle performs a 360-degree walk around of the vehicle before it is moved from a resting location. The vehicle safety system includes a plurality of input receivers positioned around the vehicle. In one example, the input receivers position at four corners of the vehicle. In another example, the input receivers position at different locations or configure as a continuous line around the vehicle. The input receivers include pads, buttons, proximity sensors, optical sensors, communication ports and the like. Further, the vehicle safety system includes a pressure switch, optical sensor, motion detector, or the like at the driver's seat of the vehicle detecting an operators presence.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with the present invention, the user walks around the vehicle and activates the input receivers within a predetermined time period, say one minute before sitting in the driver's seat. If the user fails to activate the input receivers located about the perimeter of the vehicle within the predetermined time period before sitting in the driver's seat, then the vehicle safety system generates an alert or alarm. This ensures the user completes a 360-degree walk around before sitting in the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">If the user activates the input receivers within the predetermined time period, then the vehicle safety system deactivates the alarm for a period say one minute starting from the time (predetermined time period) any of the input receiver was engaged first, allowing the operator to sit in the vehicle's seat without the alert being triggered. Here, the alarm stays deactivated until the user vacates the seat for more than 15 seconds (or predetermined time period), at which time the vehicle safety system resets, requiring a subsequent walk around. This ensures the user completes a 360-degree walk around before sitting in the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one implementation, the vehicle safety system includes an additional sensor (or sensors) that detects if there are any obstructions around the vehicle, say at the front and/or rear of the vehicle. In this implementation, once the alarm is deactivated by the user after performing the walk around, engaging all input receivers around the vehicle, then sitting in the driver's seat; this generates an additional alert when an obstruction is detected by the motion detector placed on the vehicle at the front and/or rear of the vehicle. This allows the vehicle safety system to operate without the input receivers.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one advantageous feature of the present subject matter, the vehicle safety system ensures the user of the automobile walks around the vehicle and activates the input receivers. By virtue of his activating the input receivers, the user clears obstruction around the vehicle and uses the vehicle. Further, this ensures the user walks around the vehicle and clears any obstruction before starting the vehicle. This reduces the likelihood of unintentional property damage or personal injury by the user driving the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one advantageous feature of the present subject matter, the vehicle safety system can be used as a means to authenticate the user to access the vehicle as the input receivers act as a level of security which the user has to activate/clear to access the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Features and advantages of the subject matter hereof will become more apparent in light of the following detailed description of selected embodiments, as illustrated in the accompanying FIGUREs. As will be realised, the subject matter disclosed is capable of modifications in various respects, all without departing from the scope of the subject matter. Accordingly, the drawings and the description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further features and advantages of the present subject matter will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in combination with the appended drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an environment in which a vehicle safety system implements in a vehicle, in accordance with one embodiment of the present subject matter;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of the vehicle safety system;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> show a circuitry and a method of operating the circuitry, in accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the present subject matter;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a method of ensuring a user of a vehicle performs a 360-degree walk around of the vehicle before it is moved from a resting location;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a method of ensuring a user of a vehicle performs a 360-degree walk around of the vehicle before occupying driver's seat; and</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an environment in which a vehicle safety system implements in a vehicle, in accordance with another embodiment of the subject matter.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It will be noted that throughout the appended drawings, like features are identified by like reference numerals.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Before the present features and working principle of a vehicle safety system is described, it is to be understood that this subject matter is not limited to the particular system as described, since it may vary within the specification indicated.
