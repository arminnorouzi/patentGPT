The design should be understood to not be limited to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the design.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DISCUSSION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth, such as examples of specific data signals, named components, number of wheels in a device, etc., in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present design. It will be apparent, however, to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present design can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well known components or methods have not been described in detail but rather in a block diagram in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present design. Further, specific numeric references such as a first refueling vehicle, can be made. However, the specific numeric reference should not be interpreted as a literal sequential order but rather interpreted that the first refueling vehicle is different than a second refueling vehicle. Thus, the specific details set forth are merely exemplary. Also, the features implemented in one embodiment may be implemented in another embodiment where logically possible. The specific details can be varied from and still be contemplated to be within the spirit and scope of the present design. The term coupled is defined as meaning connected either directly to the component or indirectly to the component through another component.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The refueling vehicle has many features and some example features will be discussed below.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a diagram of an embodiment of a front fuel dispensing module located between the cab and the tank containing the fuel product. The refueling vehicle <b>100</b> can include many components including a cab, a fuel tank, wheels, and a front fuel dispensing module. The fuel tank contains fuel product such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, etc. A front axle is connected to a set of front wheels, which are located under the cab. A rear axle connects to a set of rear wheels, which are located under the fuel tank. The front fuel dispensing module is located between the cab and the tank containing the fuel product. The front fuel dispensing module has at least one or more hoses for dispensing fuel product from the fuel tank to an external tank.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The front fuel dispensing module can be a 24&#x2033; wide cabinet behind the cab with roll up doors on each side. Inside the front fuel dispensing module there is a driver-side hose reel with a first hose on a driver's side of the refueling vehicle <b>100</b> and a curbside hose reel with a second hose on a curbside side of the refueling vehicle <b>100</b> so an operator can deliver fuel product from both sides of the refueling vehicle <b>100</b> through at least one of the hoses without having to reposition the refueling vehicle <b>100</b>. (E.g. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The certified flow meter can be in this cabinet and the register can be mounted in the cab. The module can further include the fueling nozzle with auto shut-off and a water-absorbing micron filter/separator. An optional second flow meter can be used if two different fuel products are being carried, such as gasoline and diesel; and thus, two different fuel products are capable of being dispensed from the same refueling vehicle <b>100</b>. The fuel tank can have an aluminum i) square tank design and/or ii) oval shaped tank, with full skirting to create a smooth uniform tank layout.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The refueling vehicle <b>100</b> may include Mini Tankers, Diesel Refuelers, and Pickup Refuelers, and other trucks. The refueling vehicle <b>100</b> may be implemented in several different designs as shown in the example drawings and images. The refueling vehicle <b>100</b> is built and assembled in compliance with all applicable standards and requirements including NFPA 30A, NFPA 385, CFR 172, IFC Chapter 57 and FMCSA DOT <b>406</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a diagram of an embodiment of the front fuel dispensing module containing both a driver-side hose reel with a first hose on a driver's side of the refueling vehicle and a curbside hose reel with a second hose on a curbside side of the refueling vehicle. Thus, the refueling vehicle <b>100</b> has dual hoses and dual hose reels: one hose reel on the curb side and another hose reel on the driver side compared to a standard refueling truck, which just has one hose reel generally on the back of the truck.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an example, each hose reel may be electrically powered to rewind a fuel hose, such as a- 1 inch&#xd7;50 foot hose. The hose may be a low permeability hose. Note, the hose may have a removable fuel nozzle to allow for faster tank-to-tank fuel product transfers. Alternatively, the hose may have a spliced connection, such as a <b>2</b>&#x2033; drylock, for an API connector for a tank-to-tank fuel product transfer to an external storage tank. The external storage tank can be located in the ground or on another refueling vehicle <b>100</b>. In an embodiment, each hose has its own spliced connection leading to a connector for a tank-to-tank fuel product transfer. The connector for the tank-to-tank fuel product transfer is located between a fuel nozzle on that hose and a pump supplying the fuel product. The hose size and its larger sized connector for a tank-to-tank fuel product transfer allow a 30 GPM flow rate vs 10 GPM limit through a fuel nozzle.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Note, the hose reel may be a spring rewind hose reel with i) a shutoff valve, ii) a &#xbe;&#x2033; (up to 1&#x2033;)&#xd7;50 foot petroleum hose, and iii) a fuel dispensing nozzle. Alternatively, the hose reel can be an electric-powered rewind hose reel. Again, a separate hose and hose reel can be used for dispensing each of the two or more different types of fuel product, such as gasoline and/or diesel.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a diagram of an embodiment of the fuel tank is located behind the fuel dispensing module and over the rear axle and the set of rear wheels. The fuel tank of the refueling vehicle <b>100</b> is located behind the fuel dispensing module and over the rear axle and the set of rear wheels in order to make a weight of the fuel tank and its gallons of fuel product to be better distributed over both the front and rear axles.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> also illustrates a diagram of an embodiment of a start of the fuel tank that begins after the fuel dispensing module and a remainder of the fuel tank stretches over the rear axle and the set of rear wheels near a rear bumper of the refueling vehicle <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The fuel tank can have an aluminum i) square tank design (e.g. see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and/or ii) oval/elliptical shaped tank (e.g. see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), with full skirting to create a smooth uniform tank layout above the rear wheels behind the front fuel dispensing module.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Again, the fuel tank is no longer directly behind the cab of the refueling vehicle <b>100</b> but rather the fuel tank is located after the fuel dispensing module. (E.g. see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). A start of the fuel tank begins after the fuel dispensing module and a remainder of the fuel tank stretches over the rear axle and the set of rear wheels near a rear bumper of the refueling vehicle <b>100</b> in order to better distribute the weight of the fuel tank and its gallons of fuel product to over both the front and rear axles; and thus, put less weight of the fuel tank and its gallons of fuel product on mainly the front axle when braking the refueling vehicle <b>100</b>. Thus, by placing the fuel dispensing module in the front of the refueling vehicle <b>100</b> that then puts the weight of the tank to be more evenly and/or better distributed over both the front and rear axles; and thus, put less weight of the tank and its gallons of fuel product on mainly the front axle when the gallons of fuel product and its tank are moving in a forward direction and the brakes of the vehicle are trying to stop the entire vehicle. Accordingly, this design with better weight distribution across both wheel axles translates to better braking distance for the refueling vehicle <b>100</b>. Also, this design with the better weight distribution of the fuel tank also helps in minimizing structural damage due to weight effects on the front axle.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, the refueling vehicle <b>100</b> now is effectively longer in wheel base by moving the tank and the rear wheels more to the rear of the vehicle even though the overall length of the vehicle from bumper to bumper remains approximately the same. The rear wheels compared to a standard refueling truck have been moved aft or rear so that the wheels are positioned underneath the tank aft or rear of the center of the tank. The rear wheels are closer to the bumper of the vehicle. Again, the rear axle and wheels now assume more of the weight load from that fuel tank and its gallons of fuel product removing some of that weight distribution from the front axle. The overhang portion of the fuel tank from the rear wheels is now far less distance from the rear wheels to the back bumper than in a standard wheel on standard refueling vehicle.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a diagram of an embodiment of the safety light bars forming a working zone. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> also illustrates a diagram of an embodiment of the safety light bars attached to its own mechanical arm that uses an actuator to go from a vertical orientation to a horizontal orientation that extends outward.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The fuel module upfront allows the creation of a rapidly and safely established work zone with the safety light bars. One or more safety light bars can be used to form a safe working zone for the refueling vehicle <b>100</b>.

The safety light bar can either use LEDs that are configured to be i) bright continuous lights, ii) flashing lights, or iii) a combination of bright and flashing lights when in a horizontal orientation that extends outward. The LEDs may be tribal whip LEDs. The LEDs/lights are bright or flash to keep vehicular traffic from getting close to the work zone. All lighting on the light safety bar will be LEDs with vapor proof wiring as well as lighting that meets all federal motor vehicle safety standards.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The LED light assembly attached to the mechanical arm is flexible and is designed to bend when the LED light assembly brushes or hits against an object. The mechanical arm also has a pin connection to allow the arm to be disconnected. The mechanical arm is configured to have a pin connection with a detachable pin to allow the mechanical arm to be disconnected when either the safety light bar or the mechanical arm gets stuck in a horizontal extended outward position.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Extending the safety light bar from the vertical position to the horizontal position with the lights on creates the safe work zone, which allows a large time savings and safe work area for the refueling operation from the front fuel module.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The layout of the fuel module up front in the refueling vehicle <b>100</b>, cabinets, and configuration saves time while improving safety.

The command module can include a wireless/cellular data transfer system. The wireless/cellular data transfer kit will have a radio modem and an antenna. The command module can facilitate refueling by mobile fuel carriers of vehicles of approved users at approved mobile refueling locations. The system may include a server connected to a network and a database accessible by the server that includes approved refueling location information and approved user and user vehicle information, including vehicle identification fuel preference information. The command module communicates with the server via the network, the command module receives refueling request information including user identification and vehicle location information from the server. The server sends these refueling instructions to the command module having its user interface which allows updating of route information with real-time information pertaining to user requests and fuel carrier location data. The command module can include at least one non-transitory processor-readable medium that stores at least one of processor-readable data or processor-executable instructions; and at least one processor communicably coupled to the at least one non-transitory processor-readable medium and to at least one data communications channel. The instructions executed by the at least one processor can perform many functions discussed herein. For example, the instructions executed by the at least one processor can determine a target vehicle to be refueled; to receive location information for the target vehicle over the at least one data communications channel; and to provide refueling vehicle GPS location, and the refueling instructions and location information for the target vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Network</heading><p id="p-0058" num="0057">A number of electronic systems and devices can communicate with each other in a network environment in accordance with the embodiments discussed herein.

Each application has a code scripted to perform the functions that the software component is coded to carry out such as presenting fields to take details of desired information. Algorithms, routines, and engines within, for example, the server computing system can take the information from the presenting fields and put that information into an appropriate storage medium such as a database (e.g., database). A comparison wizard can be scripted to refer to a database and make use of such data.
