The IMDs are configured to wirelessly receive power from an electromagnetic field provided by an external charger. The IMDs include a conductive case and a header that is typically non-conductive, and which houses a three dimensional antenna structure configured to couple with the external magnetic field. Currents induced in the antenna structure are used to provide power to the IMD. The three dimensional antenna structure may be configured as a cage structure comprising a first loop antenna proximate and parallel to the front of the header, a second loop antenna proximate and parallel to the back of the header, and a third loop antenna proximate and parallel to the top of the header.

Typically, such charging coils <b>30</b> are made from multi-stranded copper Litz wire, which increases wire conductivity and improves AC performance, but is complicated and expensive. Such coils <b>30</b> are typically wound and formed on a mandrel prior to being assembled in the IMD <b>10</b>. It can be difficult to connect the coil <b>30</b> to the PCB <b>29</b>, and this connection can break and become unreliable. Further, a coil <b>30</b> can take significant volume in the IMD's case <b>12</b>, which can hamper making IMDs <b>10</b> smaller and more convenient for patients. The inventors desire to provide an IMD that is capable of wirelessly receiving power from an external charger, but which does not include a wire-wound coil <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The inventors notice that the IMD <b>10</b>&#x2032;s case <b>12</b> is typically conductive as already mentioned, and as such it is reactive to the incoming magnetic field <b>55</b>. Specifically, the magnetic portion of the AC magnetic field <b>55</b> will induce AC eddy currents in the case <b>12</b>. As is known, eddy currents comprise loops of electrical current induced within conductive materials, in accordance with Faraday's law of induction. Eddy currents flow in closed loops in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field <b>55</b>, and as such will flow significantly in the outside case portion <b>12</b><i>o </i>of the IMD that faces the external charger. The magnitude of the current in a given loop is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the area of the loop, and the rate of change of flux, and is proportional to the conductivity of the material. Eddy currents flow in conductive materials with a skin depth, and as such are more prevalent at the outside surface of the outer case portion <b>12</b><i>o </i>that face the impinging magnetic field <b>55</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Eddy currents are generally viewed as an unwanted effect when charging an IMD. Some of the power in the field <b>55</b> is lost in the case <b>12</b> when eddy current are induced, thus reducing the power that reaches the charging coil <b>30</b> inside the case. In short, the case <b>12</b> generally attenuates the power that is able to reach the coil <b>30</b> to useful effect to charge the IMD's battery <b>14</b>. Further, eddy currents generated in the case <b>12</b> are generally lost as heat, and thus charging by magnetic induction runs the risk that the case may overheat, which is a unique safety problem when one considers that the IMD <b>10</b> is designed for implantation inside of a patient.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">International Application No. PCT/2020/36668 (&#x201c;the '668 Application), filed Jun. 6, 2020, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, describes examples of improved IMDs configured to harness the power of eddy currents generated at least in part in the IMD's case <b>12</b> during magnetic inductive charging, and to use such harnessed power to charge the IMD's battery <b>14</b> (or more generally to provide power to the IMD). The IMD designs described in the '668 Application do not require a wire-wound secondary charging coil <b>30</b>, which alleviates manufacturing cost and complexity and reduces reliability issues inherent when using wire-wound coils. Further, the lack of a secondary charging coil <b>30</b> allows the IMDs to be made smaller and more convenient for patients.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an example of such an improved IMD <b>100</b> described in the '668 Application. In this example, antenna portions <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>are included within the IMD <b>100</b>&#x2032;s header <b>28</b>. The antenna portions <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>are not wound coils, and are preferably not made of wire, although they could be. Instead, the antenna portions <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>are preferably formed from sheet metal into the shapes shown. The portions <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>are preferably conductive, and may be made from any number of conductive materials or alloys, such as those containing titanium, copper, gold, silver, and the like. The portions <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>may also include combinations of alloys formed in distinctive layers, and in this regard, the portions may be coated, plated, or cladded with conductive materials, as discussed further subsequently.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the antenna portions <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>are generally C-shaped, with outside ends attached to the case <b>12</b> (<b>110</b>), and with inside ends attached to antenna feedthrough wires <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>respectively. More specifically, and as shown in the cross sectional figure to the right, the outside ends of the portions <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>(only portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>is shown) are mechanically and electrically connected to the top surface <b>12</b><i>t </i>of the case, and more specifically to the top surface <b>12</b><i>t </i>of the outside case portion <b>12</b><i>o. </i>Such attachment may be made by welding or brazing the outside ends to the top surface <b>12</b><i>t, </i>as represented by weld <b>110</b>. The left cross sectional figure shows the inside ends of the portions <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>(again, only <b>102</b><i>a </i>shown), and shows attachment of the inside ends to the antenna feedthrough wires <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>(only <b>104</b><i>a </i>shown), which attachments may be made via a solder or weld <b>108</b>. In this example, the antenna feedthrough wires <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>pass through the same feedthrough <b>25</b> as the electrode feedthrough wires <b>23</b> that connect to the electrode contacts in the lead connectors <b>26</b>. This example shows four lead connectors <b>26</b> arranged in a 2&#xd7;2 fashion in the header <b>28</b>, but more or fewer lead connectors could be used.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in the cross sections of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the antenna portions <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>are offset in the header <b>28</b> towards the major surface of outside case portion <b>12</b><i>o </i>(to the left as shown) of the IMD <b>100</b>, with the lead connectors <b>26</b> in the header being offset towards the major surface of the inside case portion <b>12</b><i>i </i>(to the right). This brings the antenna portions <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>closer to the external charger's magnetic field <b>55</b>, and minimizes interference of conductive structures in the lead connectors <b>26</b> with magnetic field reception. Once the lead connectors <b>26</b> are attached to the electrode feedthrough wires <b>23</b>, and the antenna portions <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>are connected to the case <b>12</b> and to the antenna feedthrough wires <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b, </i>the header <b>28</b> can be formed over these structures, such as by encapsulation or overmolding with a suitable header material, e.g., a polymer, epoxy, or thermoset plastic.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">While the IMDs described in the '668 Application provide several improvements over prior art IMDs, the inventors see room for even further improvements. As mentioned above, in the IMDs described in the '668 Application (such as IMD <b>100</b>), the antenna is typically offset towards the outside of the case so as to bring the antenna closer to the external charger's magnetic field. However, that configuration depends on the IMD being implanted in the proper orientation and remaining in the proper orientation. It is known in the art that surgeons sometimes inadvertently flip the orientation of the IMD when they perform the implantation procedure. Likewise, even if the IMD is properly implanted, it may become flipped within the patient's tissue before the IMD becomes fully incapsulated within the patient's tissue. Both of those situations can result in the IMD's antenna not being in an optimum configuration to receive the external charger's magnetic field.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates three possible orientations of an IMD <b>100</b> with respect to an external charger <b>40</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and related discussion for further details about the components of the external charger <b>40</b>). When the IMD <b>100</b> is properly implanted, the antenna <b>102</b> is close to the external charger's magnetic field <b>55</b>, resulting in good coupling of the magnetic field with the antenna, which provides optimal charging. However, if the IMD <b>100</b> is flipped, then the magnetic coupling is poor because of interference by the intervening lead connectors <b>26</b> and any other components that may be housed in the header. Charging efficiency suffers as a result of the poor coupling Moreover, if the IMD <b>100</b> is oriented perpendicular to the surface of the skin, then the magnetic field cannot couple to the IMD's antenna, resulting in very poor charging.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>E</figref> illustrate an embodiment of a three dimensional &#x201c;cage&#x201d; antenna <b>602</b> that allows the IMD to be efficiently charged even if the IMD is flipped or is otherwise in a non-ideal orientation.

For example, as illustrated, the directional antenna <b>612</b><i>a </i>comprises a loop antenna configured parallel with the front side of the IMD case and header (header not shown). For convenience, the directional antenna <b>612</b><i>a </i>is referred to herein as the front antenna. The front antenna <b>612</b><i>a </i>is parallel and proximate to the side of the IMD that is configured to face the outside of the patient when the IMD is correctly implanted. The front antenna <b>612</b><i>a </i>is configured to couple strongly with a magnetic field presented from the positive X direction.

Directional antenna <b>612</b><i>b </i>is configured to couple strongly with a magnetic field presented from the negative X direction. So, if the IMD is flipped, the back antenna <b>612</b><i>b </i>will couple strongly with a magnetic field provided by the external charger placed against the patient's skin. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>, such a magnetic field induces current I in the directional antenna <b>612</b><i>b, </i>generating a potential gap between the affixed terminal <b>604</b><i>b </i>and the floating terminal <b>606</b><i>b. </i>Accordingly, regardless of whether the IMD <b>610</b> is implanted properly or if it is flipped, one of the directional antennas <b>612</b><i>a </i>or <b>612</b><i>b </i>should be oriented to receive magnetic field from the external charger.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The directional antenna <b>612</b><i>c </i>comprises a loop antenna configured perpendicular to the front and back sides of the IMD case and header.

In the illustration, a generic resistance R is used to denote the load associated with charging circuitry in embodiments that use the induced power current as power for charging a rechargeable battery. It should be noted that other embodiments are possible that use the induced power current to power the IMD directly. The power reception circuitry <b>800</b> includes a bypass capacitor C<b>1</b> to keep an essentially constant voltage supplied to the load R. C<b>1</b> is typically a large capacitor, for example, 1 &#x3bc;F.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It will be appreciated that the tank and rectifier circuitry of the power reception circuitry <b>800</b> should be configured to maintain resonance between the three directional antennas, <b>612</b><i>a, </i><b>612</b><i>b, </i>and <b>612</b><i>c. </i>Accordingly, the tank and rectifier circuitry comprises a first parallel resonant tank comprising the front antenna L(<b>612</b><i>a</i>) and a capacitor C<b>2</b>, a second parallel resonant tank comprising the back antenna L(<b>612</b><i>b</i>) and a capacitor C<b>3</b>, and a third parallel resonant tank comprising the top antenna L(<b>612</b><i>c</i>) and a capacitor C<b>4</b>. The illustrated circuit <b>800</b> also comprises two rectification diodes D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>. The rectification diodes may comprise Schottky diodes, for example. It is within the ability of a person of skill in the art to determine the relevant parameters, such as the inductances of the directional antennas L(<b>612</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>), and thus the capacitances of the capacitors C<b>2</b>-<b>4</b> needed to tune the circuit for a desired charging frequency. According to some embodiments, the charging frequency may be tuned for the 6.78 MHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band, which has a range from 6.765 to 6.795 MHz. According to one embodiment L(<b>612</b><i>a</i>) and L(<b>612</b><i>b</i>) where each determined to be 37 nH and L(<b>612</b><i>c</i>) was determined to be 50 nH. In that embodiment, tuning the circuit for a charging frequency of 6.78 MHz entailed C<b>2</b> and C<b>3</b> each being 10 nF and C<b>4</b> being 15 nF. Of course, other charging frequencies could be used, and the values of the relevant inductances and capacitances will vary based on the implementation. Moreover, other tank and rectifier circuit designs will be apparent to a person of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>E</figref>, it should be noted that the directional antennas <b>612</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are coupled to each other. That is, current induced in one of the antennas via the external magnetic field may induce current in others of the antenna, either by magnetic and/or electrical coupling. For example, the antennas <b>612</b><i>a </i>and <b>612</b><i>b </i>are strongly magnetically coupled because the two antennas are parallel and located close together. Likewise, each of <b>612</b><i>a </i>and <b>612</b><i>b </i>are adjacent with (i.e., share a side with) the top antenna <b>612</b><i>c </i>and therefore strongly couple with <b>612</b><i>c. </i>Consider a situation wherein an external magnetic field is provided from the positive X direction. That external magnetic field will couple strongly with the front directional antenna <b>612</b><i>a, </i>as described above. The external magnetic field will also couple moderately with the back directional antenna <b>612</b><i>b </i>(though not as strongly as with <b>612</b><i>a</i>). Moreover, current will be induced in the adjacent top antenna <b>612</b><i>c. </i>So, the cage antenna <b>602</b> provides a slightly higher charging voltage in response to the external magnetic field provided from the positive X direction compared to an IMD having only a single antenna (e.g., having only a front antenna, analogous to <b>612</b><i>a </i>only).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Now consider a situation wherein an external magnetic field is provided from the negative X direction. That external magnetic field will couple strongly with the back directional antenna <b>612</b><i>b, </i>as described above. The external magnetic field will also couple moderately with the front directional antenna <b>612</b><i>a </i>(though not as strongly as with <b>612</b><i>b</i>). Moreover, current will be induced in the adjacent top antenna <b>612</b><i>c. </i>In sum, the charging voltage provided by a magnetic field from the negative X direction will be essentially equal to that provided by a magnetic field from the positive X direction. When an external magnetic field is provided from the negative X direction to an IMD having only a front antenna, the charging efficiency is decreased (moderate coupling) because the antenna is further away, and the lead connectors interfere. The inventor's calculations show that that, according to some embodiments, the charging voltage induced by an external electric field provided from the negative X direction using the cage antenna is about twice the charging voltage induced in an IMD having only a front antenna.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">When an external magnetic field is provided to an IMD having a cage antenna <b>602</b> from the positive Z direction, the magnetic field couples with the top directional antenna <b>612</b><i>c </i>as described above. The magnetic field does not couple with the front or back antennas, <b>612</b><i>a </i>and <b>612</b><i>b, </i>respectively. The inventor's calculations show that that, according to some embodiments, the charging voltage induced by an external electric field provided from the positive Z direction is essentially the same as voltages induced by fields provided from the positive and negative X directions. By contrast, with an IMD having only a front antenna, a magnetic field provided from the positive Z direction exhibits essentially no coupling with the antenna and therefore provides essentially no charging voltage.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As mentioned above, the '668 Application describes IMDs configured with a charging antenna located in the header of the IMD and wherein eddy currents generated in at least a portion of the IMD's case during charging are harnessed to provide power for charging the IMD's battery.

Those attachments may be provided by welding, soldering, or the like, which may provide conductivity adequate to allow induced currents to pass between the antenna <b>602</b> and the case of the IMD. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates the flow of current I(power) induced in a portion of the cage antenna <b>602</b> and the flow of eddy current I(case) induced in the case of the IMD <b>610</b>.

For example, the case may be formed from titanium, whereas the antenna may be formed from higher conductivity materials, such as silver, copper, or gold, or combinations of materials. According to some embodiments, the antenna material may be affixed to one or more tabs of case material, such as titanium, to facilitate the attachment of the antenna to the case.
