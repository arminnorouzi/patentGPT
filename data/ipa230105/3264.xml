A plurality of clamping bodies are used in this case to transmit forces only in one of two rotation directions which are opposite each other between inner and outer components, in particular inner or outer shafts, which can be coupled to each other via the clamping body freewheel unit. In this manner, a transmission of forces can be carried out during rotation in one rotation direction while, via the clamping body freewheel unit, a rotation of the components relative to each other is enabled in the opposite rotation direction. In this case, the clamping bodies are retained at defined spacings relative to each other in a cage of the clamping body freewheel unit in one circumferential direction about a rotation axis which is defined by the clamping body freewheel unit and, in this case, can be tilted about a tilting axis which extends perpendicularly to the circumferential direction so that, depending on the rotation direction, a torque is transmitted or not in a non-positive-locking manner via the clamping bodies.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is known to also provide, for rotatable support precisely with relatively large torques in addition to the plurality of clamping bodies of a clamping body freewheel unit, rolling bodies via which components which are intended to be coupled to each other are rotatably supported relative to each other. For example, the rolling bodies are located between an internal ring of the clamping body freewheel unit and an external ring of the clamping body freewheel unit in front of or directly at the components which are intended to be coupled to each other. For example, an internal ring may be able to be connected to an internal shaft while an external ring can be connected to an external shaft. If the rolling bodies are integrated in the clamping body freewheel unit, typically a separate cage is provided therefor in order to retain the rotatable rolling bodies at a defined spacing relative to each other. Alternatively, a cage is recessed for the rolling bodies, particularly if the rolling bodies are in needle-like form.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">With particular regard to using a clamping body freewheel action in an electric bicycle and the tolerances which have to be provided in this case between two components which are intended to be coupled to each other, such as an internal shaft and an external shaft, and the tight structural spatial conditions, there continues to be a need for improved clamping body freewheel actions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Against this background, a clamping body freewheel unit of claim <b>1</b> is proposed, wherein the at least one portion of a plurality of rolling bodies of the clamping body freewheel unit and the clamping bodies of the clamping body freewheel unit are retained together in one cage.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Consequently, the proposed solution is based on the basic notion of providing a common cage both for clamping bodies and for additional rolling bodies. In the one common cage, consequently, there are formed different types of cage receiving members, on the one hand, for the clamping bodies and, on the other hand, for the rolling bodies. A proposed clamping body freewheel unit consequently comprises in addition to clamping bodies a plurality of rolling bodies which are suitable for rotatably supporting an internal shaft and an external shaft relative to each other if these internal and external shafts are coupled to each other via the clamping body freewheel unit. In this case, the additional rolling bodies are rotatably retained in the cage for the clamping bodies.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Via the proposed integration of rolling bodies and clamping bodies in a common cage, smaller construction types of a clamping body freewheel unit are possible. It is also possible to substantially reduce the costs for the clamping bodies because, in practice, a greater tolerance range is acceptable and additional safeguards in setting tolerances no longer have to be provided. The assembly can also be simplified. It has further been found that, as a result of the proposed clamping body freewheel unit, the robustness with respect to a maximum torque can be increased and a drag torque during freewheeling action can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this case, the proposed clamping body freewheel unit can have, for coupling an internal shaft and an external shaft, an internal ring and/or an external ring, against which the clamping bodies and the rolling bodies adjoin externally or internally, respectively. However, this is not absolutely necessary. In particular, the clamping body freewheel unit can be constructed without an internal ring and/or without an external ring so that a shaft is directly in contact with the clamping bodies and/or rolling bodies.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In particular, one variant of a proposed clamping body freewheel unit may be configured and provided for use in a motorized drive apparatus for an electric bicycle (consequently, for an eBike or Pedelec). Via the clamping body freewheel unit, for example, a force can then be transmitted in the case of a (motor-driven) rotation of a first, external or internal shaft in a first rotation direction to a different second, internal or external shaft in order to drive the other, second shaft. At the same time, the other, second drivable shaft can also be rotated in the first rotation direction via the clamping body freewheel unit so that, in this case, the first driving shaft can be overtaken. Furthermore, the second drivable shaft can also be rotated via the clamping body freewheel unit without rotating the first driving shaft. In this manner, the clamping body freewheel unit may be in particular configured and provided to uncouple in an electric bicycle at least one drive motor of the motorized drive apparatus from an output shaft so that a torque which is applied at the output shaft by a driver of the electric bicycle cannot be transmitted to the drive motor and a force flow is interrupted in the direction of the drive motor by means of the clamping body freewheel unit. In this manner, in an electric bicycle a motorized drive apparatus can be uncoupled from pedal driving, which is actuated by muscle power, of the electric bicycle via the clamping body freewheel unit so that a driver of the electric bicycle can drive the electric bicycle in a manner actuated by muscle power without any counter-acting resistance as a result of the at least one drive motor and/or a gear mechanism of the motorized drive apparatus when the electromotive drive apparatus is inactive (that is to say, without any motor support).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one variant, a plurality of rolling bodies of the clamping body freewheel unit are arranged in a first bearing row which extends in the circumferential direction and which extends parallel with a second bearing row of the clamping body freewheel unit with a plurality of clamping bodies (which are retained in one and the same cage). The first and second bearing rows are consequently arranged in a manner axially offset relative to each other with respect to a rotation axis which is defined by the clamping body freewheel unit.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one variant, a plurality of rolling bodies are arranged together with a plurality of clamping bodies in a bearing row which extends in the circumferential direction of the clamping body freewheel unit. In the circumferential direction, consequently, a plurality of rolling bodies and a plurality of clamping bodies follow each other within this bearing row. Such a variant particularly includes in this case the fact that, in addition to such a (mixed) bearing row with rolling bodies and clamping bodies, an additional bearing row can also be provided in the clamping body freewheel unit, wherein this additional bearing row can contain a mixture of rolling bodies and clamping bodies, only rolling bodies or only clamping bodies.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one variant, at least two clamping bodies directly follow each other in the circumferential direction in the bearing row with a plurality of rolling bodies and a plurality of clamping bodies before at least one rolling body follows one of the at least two clamping bodies in the circumferential direction. In a variant based on this, typically more clamping bodies than rolling bodies are then provided in the bearing row in order to be able to transmit a greater torque for the force transmission via the clamping bodies.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one variant, the clamping body freewheel unit comprises at least two bearing rows which each have a plurality of clamping bodies and which are located beside each other along a rotation axis which is defined by the clamping body freewheel unit. For example, the clamping body freewheel unit may comprise three bearing rows which are located beside each other along the rotation axis. In this instance, two bearing rows can each have a plurality of clamping bodies (exclusively clamping bodies or a mixture with a plurality of rolling bodies) while one bearing row has exclusively a plurality of rolling bodies. In a corresponding variant of a three-row clamping body freewheel unit, consequently, there is provided at least one bearing row which comprises exclusively rolling bodies, the rolling bodies of which are, however, rotatably retained in one and the same cage as the clamping bodies of one of or all of the other bearing rows.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one variant of a three-row clamping body freewheel unit, the cage forms, between one of the bearing rows with a plurality of clamping bodies and the bearing row having exclusively a plurality of rolling bodies, a web which extends radially outwardly with respect to the rotation axis. The different bearing rows are then not only functionally but also structurally separated from each other at the clamping body freewheel unit by means of this web which extends radially outwardly.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In two bearing rows which each have clamping bodies, in principle clamping bodies which are not connected over the bearing rows may be provided.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an alternative variant, the clamping bodies of two adjacent bearing rows are connected to each other, particularly constructed integrally with each other and thereby form a single clamping body row. For example, the clamping bodies of a clamping body row have a common base at a radially internal side and are separated from each other locally by a slot which extends about the rotation axis at a radially external side. As a result of the slot which extends over the circumference, consequently, a clamping body row is formed with two bearing rows, in which there is provided one row of clamping bodies which are located one behind the other in the circumferential direction and which can each transmit forces to the internal shaft via a common base.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Consequently, the proposed solution includes in particular variants of a clamping body freewheel unit in which in a cage, in addition to a row containing only rolling bodies (rolling body row), at least one row of clamping bodies which follow each other in a circumferential direction, for example, slotted or non-slotted clamping bodies (clamping body row), is further provided. Furthermore, variants are included in which, by arranging two rolling bodies which are located one behind the other in an axial direction in gaps between clamping bodies, which follow each other in a circumferential direction, of a clamping body row, two bearing rows which each have rolling bodies and clamping bodies are formed and provided in a cage.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">For the additional functional integration, in one variant at least one seal is provided in the cage. This seal is then, for example, injection-molded on the cage.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For example, the seal is provided at an axial front side of the cage with respect to a rotation axis defined by the clamping body freewheel unit. The seal which is integrated therein at a front side of the cage and which is particularly injection-molded thereon then allows sealing, for example, at a drive apparatus for an electric bicycle, with respect to the environment when the clamping body freewheel unit is fitted.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">For example, the seal which is provided on the cage and which is particularly injection-molded thereon forms at least one sealing lip.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one variant, at least some of the rolling bodies are in the form of cylinder rollers.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The proposed solution further relates to a drive apparatus for an electric bicycle having at least one proposed clamping body freewheel unit. The drive apparatus is consequently configured and provided, for example, for a motorized driving of an electric bicycle and has at least one variant of a proposed clamping body freewheel unit for providing a clamping body freewheel action.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one variant, the drive apparatus comprises at least one drive motor and gear mechanism in order to transmit a drive torque which is produced by the at least one drive motor to an output shaft (via the gear mechanism). The output shaft may be, for example, a bottom bracket shaft for the electric bicycle. The at least one drive motor and the gear mechanism and/or the gear mechanism and the output shaft can then be uncoupled from each other via the clamping body freewheel unit. In this manner, consequently, a force flow in the direction of the drive motor is interrupted via the clamping body freewheel unit so that the motorized drive apparatus and in particular the at least one drive motor thereof do not have to be &#x201c;dragged along&#x201d; during driving actuated by muscle power.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The proposed solution further comprises an electric bicycle having at least one proposed clamping body freewheel unit and/or one proposed drive apparatus.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The appended Figures illustrate variants of the proposed solution which are possible by way of example.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the drawings:</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a first variant of a proposed clamping body freewheel unit having three bearing rows, the clamping bodies and rolling bodies of which are retained in a single common cage of the clamping body freewheel unit;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a perspective view of another variant of the proposed clamping body freewheel unit having two mixed bearing rows which are located axially beside each other and which each have clamping bodies and rolling bodies in a common cage;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> schematically shows a variant of an electric bicycle, in which variants of the proposed solution are used.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS:</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a first variant of a proposed clamping body freewheel unit <b>3</b>.

These clamping bodies <b>5</b> are retained beside each other in a circumferential direction U about the rotation axis D with defined spacing relative to each other and supported so as to be able to tilt about a tilting axis which is parallel with the rotation axis D.
