In addition, the number and size of each element in the figure are only for illustration, and are not used to limit the scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Throughout the specification and the claims, certain words are used to refer to specific elements. Those skilled in the art should understand that electronic device manufacturers may refer to the same components by different names. This article does not intend to distinguish the elements with the same function but different names. In the following specification and claims, words such as &#x201c;including&#x201d;, &#x201c;containing&#x201d;, and &#x201c;having&#x201d; are open-ended words, so they should be interpreted as meaning &#x201c;including but not limited to . . . &#x201d;.
