Pump <b>100</b> is a MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) device, as known to those skilled in the art, that can be used for pumping fluid, valves used for regulating flow, actuators used for moving or controlling the pump and valves and sensor used for sensing pressure. The MEMS device incorporates a piezoelectric transducer as known to those skilled in the art. (However, the MEMS devices may include a capacitive transducer or piezoresistive transducer) that acts as the active element for pumping fluid, but other MEMS structures or technology may be used to achieve desired results as known to those skilled in the art.). Pump <b>100</b> may be used in a drug infusion system for infusing a drug (i.e., medication) or other fluid to a patient (user). Medication may include small molecule pharmaceutical solutions, large molecule or protein drug solutions, saline solutions, blood or other fluids known to those skilled in the art. Insulin is an example fluid. However, pump <b>100</b> may be used in other environments known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Pump <b>100</b> is configured to maximize pump efficiency per mm<sup>2 </sup>(i.e., stroke volume per unit area per Watt). To this end, pump <b>100</b> is a cavity substrate that incorporates a chamber or cavity <b>102</b> that is configured as rectangular or oblong shaped, but it can be alternatively shaped as an elliptical, fillet, circular, square or other shaped pump cell known to those skilled in the art to achieve desired results. The structure and benefits of this chamber are described in detail below. (Note measurements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>39</b></figref> and described herein are example measurements. Those skilled in the art know that other values may be used for such measurements.)</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Structurally, a silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) layer <b>104</b> sits between silicon (Si) layers <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> as shown. Silicon dioxide layer <b>104</b> is used to fusion bond the silicon layers <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> (process details below). However, other techniques may be used to bond the silicon layers <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> as known to those skilled in the art. Silicon dioxide layer <b>105</b> lines the surface of chamber <b>102</b> as well as channels and inlet and outlet ports <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> as shown. Chamber <b>102</b> communicates with inlet and outlet openings <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> via the channels. Silicon layer <b>106</b> covers chamber <b>102</b> act upon the fluid within chamber <b>102</b> (i.e., to pump fluid&#x2014;displace or draw fluid).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Silicon layer <b>106</b> functions as the membrane of the cavity substrate as known to those skilled in the art. Piezoelectric actuator <b>110</b> is layered on top of silicon layer <b>106</b> and it functions to pump or deform/bend silicon layer <b>106</b> to draw into or displace liquid contents from chamber <b>102</b> as known to those skilled in the art. It is the shape of the silicon layers <b>106</b> (and <b>206</b> below), i.e., the walls, along with the silicon dioxide layer <b>104</b> that define the shape of chamber <b>102</b> described hereinabove and the shape of inlet and outlets <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As indicated above, chamber <b>102</b> is configured as pump chamber (also known as a cavity or pump cell) that has a preferable width in the range of 200 &#x3bc;m-1 mm and a length of up to 10 mm, but other widths and lengths may be used as known to those skilled in the art. The maximum chamber <b>102</b> width is limited by manufacturing constraints (allowed sag, bow). By using a shaped cell as described hereinabove, area efficiency, i.e., fill factor&#x2014;pump chamber (or valve chamber&#x2014;below) area/total area, increases (over circular membranes) is optimized to reduce dead volume of the pumping chamber, with very little trade-off in reduction to stroke volume. This results in a larger compression ratio for the micropump and a larger per unit area and per watt of actuation power as known to those skilled in the art. To achieve the same net pumping efficiency with a rectangular or square piezoelectric chamber shape, more dead space (e.g., approximately 60-65% for rectangular as opposed to 80-85% packing efficiency for hexagonal piezoelectric transducer) must be incurred, and thus a lower compression ratio for the overall pump. Pump chambers (i.e., cavities or cells) may be arrayed in parallel or in series to increase total stroke volume.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As for fabrication (in brief), pump chamber <b>102</b> is completely sealed until the very last step in the fabrication process, thereby minimizing the propensity for defect or particle introduction during processing. That is, the pump and channels remain closed until the very end of fabrication processing. This is accomplished by dividing the final pump wafer thinning into two steps: a wafer grind/polish to within 25 &#x3bc;m of the inlet/outlet and a final blanket dry etch step to open up the inlet/outlet. This entire process is described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a cross sectional view of an example valve <b>200</b> (MEMS device).
