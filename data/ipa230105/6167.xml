The display device has, for example, an element density of 400 ppi or higher or 800 ppi or higher.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since an organic EL device has a high responsivity or a high contract or both, the organic EL display device has become a focus of attention. A method of depositing the material of elements on a substrate by vapor deposition is known as a method of forming the elements of an organic EL display device. For example, initially, a substrate on which anodes are formed in a pattern corresponding to elements is prepared. Subsequently, an organic layer is formed on each of the anodes by depositing an organic material on the anode via a corresponding one of the through-holes of a mask. After that, a cathode is formed on each of the organic layers by depositing a conductive material on the organic layer via a corresponding one of the through-holes of the mask.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In organic devices, such as organic EL display devices, when a voltage is applied between an anode and a cathode, a current flows from the anode to an organic layer, and the organic layer emits light that constitutes an image. The current having flowed through the organic layer passes through the cathode and flows to a reference electrode that defines a reference potential. Here, depending on the vapor deposition pattern of cathodes, a current resistance value in the cathode of each element can change, and the amount of current flowing through each element can change. As a result, luminance differences occur among the elements of the organic device, and display uniformity can deteriorate.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a plan view of an example of an organic device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an enlarged plan view of the area surrounded by the alternate long and two-short dashed line and indicated by the reference sign A<b>1</b> in the organic device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an enlarged plan view of the area surrounded by the alternate long and two-short dashed line and indicated by the reference sign B<b>1</b> in the organic device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a plan view of a state where a second electrode is removed from the organic device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a sectional view of the organic device, taken along the line C-C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a sectional view of the organic device, taken along the line D-D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an enlarged plan view of the area surrounded by the alternate long and two-short dashed line and indicated by the reference sign A<b>2</b> in the organic device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram of an example of a vapor deposition apparatus that includes a mask apparatus;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an enlarged plan view of a part corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in a first mask used in the mask apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a plan view of an organic device according to a first example;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a plan view of an organic device according to a second example;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is an enlarged plan view of the area surrounded by the alternate long and two-short dashed line and indicated by the reference sign C<b>2</b> in the organic device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a plan view of an organic device according to a third example;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is an enlarged plan view of the area surrounded by the alternate long and two-short dashed line and indicated by the reference sign C<b>3</b> in the organic device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a plan view of an organic device according to a comparative example;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is an enlarged plan view of the area surrounded by the alternate long and two-short dashed line and indicated by the reference sign C<b>4</b> in the organic device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a plan view of an organic device according to a reference example;

Examples of the iron alloys that include nickel or nickel and cobalt may include Invar that includes nickel higher than or equal to 34 percent by mass and lower than or equal to 38 percent by mass, Super-Invar that includes nickel higher than or equal to 30 percent by mass and lower than or equal to 34 percent by mass and further includes cobalt, and low-thermal expansion Fe&#x2014;Ni plating alloys that include nickel higher than or equal to 38 percent by mass and lower than or equal to 54 percent by mass. When such iron alloys are used, it is possible to reduce the thermal expansion coefficient of the mask <b>50</b>. When, for example, a glass substrate is used as the substrate <b>110</b>, the thermal expansion coefficient of the mask <b>50</b> is able to be set to a low value equivalent to that of the glass substrate. Thus, in the vapor deposition process, it is possible to suppress a decrease in the dimensional accuracy and positional accuracy of vapor deposition layers formed on the substrate <b>110</b> due to a difference in thermal expansion coefficient between the mask <b>50</b> and the substrate <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">Next, a manufacturing method for the above-described organic device <b>100</b> will be described. The manufacturing method for the organic device <b>100</b> may include a substrate preparation process, an organic layer forming process and a second electrode forming process.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">Initially, the substrate preparation process is performed. In the substrate preparation process, the substrate <b>110</b> on which the first electrodes <b>120</b> and the reference electrode <b>150</b> are formed is prepared. The first electrodes <b>120</b> and the reference electrode <b>150</b> may be formed by, for example, forming a conductive layer on the substrate <b>110</b> by sputtering or the like and then patterning the conductive layer by photolithography or the like. The insulating layer <b>160</b> located between adjacent two of the first electrodes <b>120</b> in plan view may be formed on the substrate <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">Subsequently, the organic layer forming process is performed.

The first organic layers <b>130</b>A may be formed by, for example, vapor deposition using a mask having through-holes corresponding to the first organic layers <b>130</b>A. For example, the first organic layers <b>130</b>A are able to be formed by depositing an organic material or the like on the first electrodes <b>120</b> corresponding to the first organic layers <b>130</b>A via the mask. The second organic layers <b>130</b>B may also be formed by, for example, vapor deposition using a mask having through-holes corresponding to the second organic layers <b>130</b>B. The third organic layers <b>130</b>C may also be formed by, for example, vapor deposition using a mask having through-holes corresponding to the third organic layers <b>130</b>C.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">Next, the second electrode forming process is performed. In the second electrode forming process, the second electrode <b>140</b> is formed on the organic layers <b>130</b> by using the above-described mask group. A process of forming the first layers <b>140</b>A of the second electrode <b>140</b> by vapor deposition using the first mask <b>50</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> may be performed. For example, the first layers <b>140</b>A are able to be formed by depositing a conductive material, such as metal, or the like on the organic layers <b>130</b> or the like via the first mask <b>50</b>A. Subsequently, a process of forming the second layers <b>140</b>B of the second electrode <b>140</b> by vapor deposition using the second mask <b>50</b>B may be performed. For example, the second layers <b>140</b>B are able to be formed by depositing a conductive material, such as metal, or the like on the organic layers <b>130</b> or the like via the second mask <b>50</b>B. Subsequently, a process of forming the third layers <b>140</b>C of the second electrodes <b>140</b> by vapor deposition using the third mask <b>50</b>C may be performed. For example, the third layers <b>140</b>C are able to be formed by depositing a conductive material, such as metal, or the like on the organic layers <b>130</b> or the like via the third mask <b>50</b>C.

The plurality of connecting portions <b>105</b> includes the first connecting portion <b>105</b><i>a </i>located on the side of the first side <b>100</b>La in the second direction D<b>2</b>. The first connecting portion <b>105</b><i>a </i>includes the facing connecting portion <b>106</b> located between the transmission areas <b>104</b> in the first direction D<b>1</b>. Since the wiring area <b>100</b>W including the reference electrode <b>150</b> expands along the first side <b>100</b>La, the facing connecting portion <b>106</b> faces the reference electrode <b>150</b>. With this configuration, a route along which a current that has flowed through the second electrode <b>140</b>Y of each of the normal areas <b>103</b> passes through the facing connecting portion <b>106</b> and reaches the reference electrode <b>150</b> is able to be shortened. Therefore, it is possible to suppress an increase in current resistance against a current that has flowed through the second electrodes <b>140</b>Y of the normal area <b>103</b>. More specifically, when a voltage is applied between the first electrode <b>120</b> and the second electrode <b>140</b>, a current flows from the first electrode <b>120</b> to the organic layer <b>130</b>, and the current that has flowed through the organic layer <b>130</b> passes through the second electrode <b>140</b> and flows to the reference electrode <b>150</b>.

Of the current values, the maximum current value was recorded as maximum current value I<sub>max</sub>, the minimum current value was recorded as minimum current value I<sub>min</sub>, and the difference was recorded as current difference value I<sub>diff </sub>The simulation results of the examples, comparative example and reference example are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>.
