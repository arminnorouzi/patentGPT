No. 62/458,805 filed Feb. 14, 2017, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to a tissue staining composition for marking regions of living tissue, for example, regions of the gastrointestinal tract, in order to identify and visualize the regions at a later point in time.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In certain medical procedures there is a need to mark regions of tissue (for example, cancerous or pre-cancerous lesions) so that they can then be later identified, for example, via endoscopic, laparoscopic, or open surgical procedures, weeks, months or years later. Such markings can identify tissue to be surgically excised via a subsequent procedure or permit a physician or other medical provider to assess whether cytological or morphological changes have occurred over time that may justify medical intervention (for example, surgery or drug treatment) to remove or treat the tissue in question.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This type of marking and monitoring is routine in the field of gastroenterology. For example, during an endoscopic examination of the gastrointestinal tract, a physician or other medical practitioner may wish to mark an abnormal area or potential lesion for subsequent monitoring and/or surgical intervention. In a marking procedure, a staining composition is injected through the luminal mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract into the submucosal tissue. However, existing stains (e.g., methylene blue, indigo carmine, indocyanine green-based stains) may be difficult to visualize endoscopically even at the time of injection into tissue of interest because the stain may leak or diffuse out of the tissue at the point of entry and thus visually obscure the area being marked. Furthermore, even after injection, it may become difficult to identify the marked regions months to years later because the marks may fade or even disappear over time. In other words, such stains may not facilitate permanent marking of tissue to accommodate accurate, long term tracking of tissue of interest. As a result, it can be difficult or even impossible for a physician or other medical practitioner to monitor with confidence abnormal tissue, pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions over time. There are similar needs for monitoring other tissues of interest, for example, in the bladder, urinary tract, breast, lymph nodes, central and peripheral nervous system, and lungs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, it has been observed that with certain tissue stains, the staining agents, if particulate, may settle out of solution over time. As a result, the instructions for use typically require that the tissue stain be shaken or vortexed so that the staining agents are resuspended or redistributed prior to use to ensure adequate marking. However, this step may not be performed adequately, if at all, prior to injection, and as a result differing amounts of staining agent may be delivered during different marking procedures or when different areas are marked during the same procedure, resulting in inconsistent marks or marks where insufficient staining agent has been introduced to create a durable mark.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, certain stains (e.g., india ink) often contain impurities such as shellacs, phenols, ammonia, and animal products. These impurities can be associated with complications such as inflammatory reactions or may even be carcinogens.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Despite the advances made in tissue marking agents, for example, endoscopic tissue marking agents, to date, there is still an ongoing need for agents with improved marking reliability, durability, and safety.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It has been discovered that it is possible to produce a biocompatible, carbon particle-based tissue staining composition that is easy and reliable to use, is easily observable during injection into tissue, and provides a durable, reliable mark that can be visualized over time, either by direct observation or by inspection using an endoscope, laparoscope or other similar device. This has been facilitated by the discovery that, when using carbon particles as the staining agent, the carbon particles should have a mean particle diameter less than 0.3 &#x3bc;m in diameter (for example, less than 0.2 &#x3bc;m in diameter) to enhance the darkness of the staining agent. Depending upon the presence of an agent, such as a surfactant, such as a non-ionic surfactant, present in an amount sufficient to reduce particle agglomeration, the particles may remain in suspension for prolonged periods of time with little or no sedimentation (settling). However, the composition may also comprise an anti-settling agent and/or a mucoadhesive agent. Under certain circumstances, a single agent can act as both an anti-settling agent and a mucoadhesive agent. The tissue staining compositions described herein have improved storage characteristics because the carbon particles are less likely to settle out of solution upon storage, provide the same uniform optical density throughout a marking procedure, are darker than other commercially available carbon particle-based tissue stains and thus are easier to visualize at the time of injection into a region of tissue of interest, and provide a durable mark at the region that can be more readily visualized over time. In addition, the tissue staining composition can be thermally sterilized, for example, by autoclaving, because the formulation of the tissue stain is heat stable.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect, the invention provides a liquid, tissue staining composition comprising: carbon particles at a concentration of from about 0.025% to about 2.0% (w/v) having a mean particle diameter of less than 0.3 &#x3bc;m in diameter (e.g., less than 0.2 &#x3bc;m in diameter); an optional anti-settling agent (ASA), for example, an ASA selected from the group consisting of hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, dextran, and guar gum at a concentration of from about 0.025% to less than 5.0% (w/v) (for example, from about 0.05% to less than 5.0% (w/v), from about 0.05% to about 1.0% (w/v), from about 0.1% to about 1.0% (w/v), or from about 0.1% to about 0.5% (w/v)); and an optional mucoadhesive agent.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect, the invention provides a liquid, tissue staining composition comprising: carbon particles at a concentration of from about 0.025% to about 2.0% (w/v) having a mean particle diameter of less than 0.3 &#x3bc;m in diameter (e.g., less than 0.2 &#x3bc;m in diameter); an anti-settling agent (ASA), for example, an ASA selected from the group consisting of hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, dextran, and guar gum at a concentration of from about 0.025% to less than 5.0% (w/v) (for example, from about 0.05% to less than 5.0% (w/v), from about 0.05% to about 1.0% (w/v), from about 0.1% to about 1.0% (w/v), or from about 0.1% to about 0.5% (w/v)); and an optional mucoadhesive agent.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In certain embodiments, and with regard to each of the foregoing aspects, the carbon particles have a mean particle diameter less than 0.2 &#x3bc;m, for example, from about 0.05 &#x3bc;m to less than 0.2 &#x3bc;m. Furthermore, in certain embodiments, the composition can be characterized in that, when centrifuged for 60 minutes at 5,000&#xd7;g, less than 50% of the carbon particles settle out of solution.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The carbon particles can be derived from carbon black, activated carbon, unactivated carbon or a combination thereof. The carbon particles preferably have a level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of no greater than 0.5 ppm based on the total amount of carbon particles. Preferably the carbon particles are depyrogenated or are otherwise pyrogen free. This can be achieved, for example, by heating carbon powder at 220&#xb0; C. for 1 hour to produce pyrogen free dry carbon.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In certain embodiments, the ASA is also a mucoadhesive agent (or has mucoadhesive properties). Exemplary ASAs with mucoadhesive properties include, for example, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, dextran, and guar gum.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, the composition further comprises a viscosity-increasing agent. The viscosity-increasing agent can be present at a concentration of from about 5% to about 25% (w/v). Exemplary viscosity-increasing agents include, for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, isopropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, cellulose and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another embodiment, the composition further comprises an anti-foaming agent. In certain embodiments, the anti-foaming agent can be present at a concentration of from about 0.005% to about 1.0% (w/v). Exemplary anti-foaming agents include, for example, dimethicone and simethicone and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another embodiment, the composition further comprises a surfactant, for example, a non-ionic surfactant. In certain embodiments, the surfactant can be present at a concentration of from about 0.01% to about 2.0% (w/v). Exemplary surfactants include, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable polyoxyethylene sorbitan esterified with a fatty acid, for example, Tween&#xae; such as Tween&#xae; 80.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another embodiment, the composition further comprises a preservative, for example, benzyl alcohol, methyl or ethyl paraben, and benzalkonium chloride. In certain embodiments, the preservative can be present at a concentration of from about 0.01% to about 4.0% (w/v).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In certain embodiments, the composition, for example, for use in gastrointestinal applications, is capable of passing through a 25 gauge needle about 240 cm in length upon application of a force no greater than about 32N (for example, from about 22 to 32N, or about 22N or less, or about 10N or less) to push the composition through the needle. In certain other embodiments, the composition, for example, for use in breast cancer tissue marking, is capable of passing through a 14 gauge needle about 5 cm in length upon application of a force no greater than about 32N (for example, from about 22 to 32N, or about 22N or less, or about 10N or less) to push the composition through the needle.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another embodiment, the composition comprises from about 0.025% to about 2.0% (w/v) carbon particles or from about 0.1% to about 2.0% (w/v) carbon particles; optionally, and when present, from 0.025% to less than 5.0% (w/v) of an ASA selected from the group consisting of hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, dextran, and guar gum; optionally, and when present, from about 5.0% to about 25% (w/v) viscosity-increasing agent; from about 0.005% to about 1.0% (w/v) anti-foaming agent; and from about 0.1% to about 2.0% (w/v) surfactant. In another embodiment, the composition comprises from about 0.025% to about 1.0% (w/v) carbon particles or from about 0.1% to about 1.0% (w/v) carbon particles; optionally, and when present, from about 0.025% to about 1.0% (w/v) of an ASA selected from the group consisting of hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, dextran, and guar gum; optionally, and when present, from about 12% to about 18% (w/v) of a viscosity-increasing agent; from about 0.05% to about 0.25% (w/v) anti-foaming agent; and from about 0.7% to about 1.5% (w/v) surfactant. Each of the foregoing compositions may further comprise a preservative, for example, benzyl alcohol.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is contemplated that the staining composition can be produced by combining sterile agents to one another so that the resulting staining composition is sterile. However, in another approach, once the tissue staining composition has been prepared, it can be sterilized, for example, by filter sterilization, by exposure to one or more sterilizing agents, separately or in combination, such as exposure to high temperature and/or high pressure (for example, during autoclaving), or by exposure to ionizing radiation. Alternatively, the tissue staining composition after inclusion in a delivery device (e.g., a vial, syringe, etc.) can be sterilized using one or more procedures known and used in the art of sterilization, for example, by exposure to one or more sterilizing agents, separately or in combination, such as exposure to high temperature and/or high pressure (for example, during autoclaving), or by exposure to ionizing radiation. The sterilization process preferably achieves a sterility assurance level (SAL) of 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>or better; i.e. the probability of any given unit of product being non sterile after the process is no more than 1 in 10<sup>3</sup>. More preferably, the sterilization process achieves an SAL of 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>or better, 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>or better, 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>or better, or 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>or better.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another aspect, the invention provides a method of preparing the foregoing tissue staining composition, the method comprising: (a) producing a composition comprising carbon particles, preferably depyrogenated carbon particles, having a mean particle diameter of less than 0.3 &#x3bc;m or less than 0.2 &#x3bc;m in diameter; and (b) combining the composition comprising the carbon particles with an optional ASA, and an optional mucoadhesive agent and/or one or more other excipients to produce the tissue staining composition. During step (a), the carbon particles preferably are combined with a surfactant and an anti-foaming agent prior to a deagglomeration procedure that produces carbon particles to give a mean particle diameter of less than 0.3 &#x3bc;m or less than 0.2 &#x3bc;m. For example, the carbon particles produced in step (a) can be produced by sonicating or homogenizing carbon particles (which include carbon primary particles, aggregates, and agglomerates) having a mean particle diameter of, for example, greater than 5.0 &#x3bc;m in diameter to produce carbon particles having a mean particle diameter of less than 0.3 &#x3bc;m or less than 0.2 &#x3bc;m in diameter.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The resulting composition can be sterilized, for example, by filter sterilization, autoclaving or exposure to ionizing radiation. Furthermore, when the composition is introduced into a delivery device, the resulting device can be terminally sterilized by using one or more of the sterilization approaches described herein.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In another aspect, the invention provides a method of staining a region of tissue in a subject, the method comprising injecting the foregoing tissue staining composition into the region of interest in the subject in an amount effective to stain the region so as to be visible by visual inspection, for example, by the unaided eye, an endoscope, laparoscope or other device.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the tissue is present in the gastrointestinal tract, bladder, breast, lymph nodes, lung, or central or peripheral nervous system of the subject. In certain embodiments, the tissue is present in the gastrointestinal tract of the subject.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another embodiment, the stain is visible, for example, visible endoscopically, for at least 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months, or 120 months after the staining of tissue.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">These and other aspects and features of the invention are described in the following detailed description and claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description of preferred embodiments, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

This has been facilitated by the discovery that, when using carbon particles as the staining agent, it is important to use carbon particles that have a mean particle diameter less than 0.3 &#x3bc;m (for example, less than 0.2 &#x3bc;m in diameter) to enhance the darkness of the staining agent.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Depending upon the presence of an agent that reduces or eliminates carbon particle agglomeration (for example a surfactant, such as a non-ionic surfactant), the carbon particle may remain in suspension for prolonged periods of time with little or no sedimentation (settling). However, depending upon the circumstances, the composition may also comprise an anti-settling agent and/or a mucoadhesive agent. A single agent can have both anti-settling and mucoadhesive properties. The resulting tissue stain is much darker than comparable carbon particle-based tissue stains that contain a larger amount of carbon particles where the carbon particles have a larger mean particle diameter. As a result, the tissue stains of the invention are easier to visualize at the time of injection into a region of tissue of interest, and provide a durable mark at the region that can be visualized over time. Furthermore, the resulting tissue stain has improved handling and storage characteristics because the carbon particles are less likely to settle out of solution upon storage and can be easily in injected into tissues of interest using commercially available needles and injection systems.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The terms &#x201c;tissue stain,&#x201d; &#x201c;tissue staining composition,&#x201d; and &#x201c;tissue marking composition&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The properties and advantages of the carbon partible-based tissue staining compositions of the invention are shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In particular, the tissue staining compositions of the invention (i) are much darker (achieved by reducing the size of the carbon particles) and thus are easier to visualize upon introduction into the tissue of interest and then produce a durable mark that can be visualized over time, (ii) exhibit reduced settling of the carbon particles (achieved by reducing the particle size and optionally by adding an anti-settling agent) and thus are easier to manipulate by the user, and (iii) are mucoadhesive (achieved by adding a mucoadhesive agent and/or by using an anti-settling agent with mucoadhesive properties) and thus are contemplated to be easier to visualize upon introduction into a tissue of interest with less &#x201c;bleeding&#x201d; of the stain out of the site of introduction and produce a durable mark that can be visualized over time.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The tissue stains of the invention can be easily visualized as the stain is being injected into a region of tissue of interest, and when introduced, given the darkness and the optional mucoadhesive properties of the tissue stain, the stain can be visualized, for example, by direct observation or by a medical instrument, for example, endoscope or laparoscope, over a prolonged period of time, for example, for weeks, months or years. The tissue stains are particularly useful when a physician or other medical practitioner wishes to mark a tissue for subsequent surgery or to monitor a region of a tissue over time, for example, to assess whether potentially abnormal tissue has become pre-cancerous or cancerous.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, if a cancerous or precancerous lesion is found in the gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder, bronchi of the lungs, breast tissue, or lymph nodes or in other locations, a marking at the site can be used to guide a surgeon to that site in a subsequent procedure. By way of example, polyps in the colon typically are removed promptly because of their potential for malignancy. Polyps are discrete mass lesions that protrude into the intestinal lumen. Mucosal neoplastic (adenomatous) polyps give rise to adenocarcinoma of the colon and therefore, polyps detected at sigmoidoscopy or barium enema are removed as soon as possible by colonoscopic polypectomy or other techniques such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,122,147 and 5,542,948. Sometimes polyps or tumors cannot be safely or completely removed by colonoscopy, and surgical resection must follow. Once the polyps have been removed, surveillance colonoscopy is periodically repeated to look for missed polyps, new adenomas, and residual or recurrent cancer.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is understood that the tissue staining compositions can be used to mark a variety of tissues in a subject, for example, tissues in the gastrointestinal tract, the breast, the lymph nodes, the bladder and urinary tract, etc. However, as discussed in more detail below, a particular tissue staining formulation can be optimized for delivery to and/or staining a tissue of interest.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">I. Carbon Particles</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The tissue marking composition of the invention includes carbon particles as a source of pigment. Although the intensity of the color (darkness) can be increased by increasing the concentration of carbon particles in suspension, it has also been discovered that reducing the particle size can have an even more profound effect on the darkness of the suspension. As a result, by reducing particle size, for example, by deagglomeration, it is possible to produce staining compositions that are much darker than comparable staining compositions with much higher concentrations of particles that are larger in size.

The reduction in the particle size may also reduce the rate of settling of the particles in solution.

Although filtering of particles can reduce the size of the particles included in the formulation, it does not actually change the size of the agglomerates and the minimum size of the particles is limited by the size of the filter.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As used herein, the term &#x201c;carbon particles&#x201d; is understood to mean individual carbon particles (primary carbon particles) as well as aggregates of individual carbon particles where the aggregates of smaller particles are bound together strongly enough to behave as a single particle, both of which have a particle size that cannot be reduced by exposure to mechanical forces and/or energy, for example, by sonication or homogenization, for example, by using the procedures described herein.

Carbon black is finely divided carbon such as vaporized heavy oil fractions produced by burning hydrocarbons using partial oxidation. The pigment can contain over 97% carbon. The oil furnace process represents the most widely used method for producing carbon black. Generally, a liquid hydrocarbonaceous feedstock is sprayed into turbulent products of combustion produced by reacting fluid fuel and oxygen and the hydrocarbon feedstock is converted into carbon black which is separated from combustion gases. Carbon black can also be produced by burning natural gas and letting the flame impinge on a cool surface. The preferred carbon black useful herein is low in incompletely burned hydrocarbons which may be absorbed during manufacture; particularly, the carbon black is low in aromatics and other compounds which may be carcinogens. More particularly, the preferred carbon black is low in residual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. By &#x201c;low&#x201d; is meant substantially non-carcinogenic levels. In a preferred embodiment, the carbon black has a level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of not greater than 0.5 ppm based on the amount of carbon black.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Charcoal can be prepared by the ignition of wood, sugar, and other carbon-containing compounds in the absence of air. It has a graphitic structure but is not well developed in crystallinity. It will therefore be categorized as amorphous herein. Activated carbon is similar obtained by the carbonization or destructive distillation of vegetable matter, e.g., wood, nut shells, bones, or other carbonaceous material. The carbon is activated by heating to high temperatures in the presence of water or carbon dioxide which results in a carbon having a porous internal structure. Carbon which has not been subjected to this treatment will be called unactivated herein. Coke is prepared by heating coal in the absence of air.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Exemplary carbon particles, preferably 4750 Monarch, can be obtained from Cabot Corp., Billerica, Mass. or Asbury Carbon 5388 or 5377 obtained from Asbury Carbons, Asbury, N.J.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The density of the carbon particles typically used in the tissue staining composition of the invention is from about 1.7 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to about 1.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, which is greater than the density of water either alone or with glycerol. As a representative formulation vehicle, the density of water containing 25% (w/v) glycerol is not appreciably greater than 1.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Due to the higher density of the carbon particles than the liquid phase, the carbon particles typically settle out to some degree, resulting in a liquid portion and a settled solid portion, such that the liquid portion has a lower number of carbon particles compared with the original composition as a whole. A reduced amount of carbon particles can lead to poorer marking performance of the liquid portion of the composition. Such solutions should be shaken, vortexed or otherwise mixed prior to use. Given that some users may not redistribute the staining agent (for example, by shaking) prior to use, it is desirable to reduce the amount of settling of the carbon particles over time. Methods for reducing settling include reducing the particle size, either alone or in combination with increasing the liquid viscosity of the composition and/or including an anti-settling agent. It has been discovered that the rate of settling of the carbon particles can be slowed significantly by reducing the mean particle diameter (including aggregates) to less than 0.3 &#x3bc;m in diameter (for example, less than 0.2 &#x3bc;m in diameter) and optionally including an anti-settling agent (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Typically carbon is available as primary carbon particles, aggregates, agglomerates, and combinations thereof. The primary carbon particles and the aggregates cannot be reduced in size, for example, by the application of mechanical forces and/or energy, for example, via sonication or homogenization. Given that the carbon often comprises agglomerates (for example, agglomerates having a mean particle diameter greater than 5 &#x3bc;m) the agglomerates can be broken down by a deagglomeration process to liberate individual carbon particles and/or aggregates. When the attractive forces that hold the agglomerates together are disrupted, for example, mechanically and/or through application of energy, the resulting carbon particles can have a mean particle diameter less than 0.3 &#x3bc;m, for example, less than 0.2 &#x3bc;m, or have a mean particle diameter in a range of from about 0.1 to about 0.2 &#x3bc;m, or have a mean diameter in a range of from about 0.05 &#x3bc;m to less than 0.2 &#x3bc;m. The smaller particles appear much darker than a comparable weight of larger particles. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the visibility of a given weight of carbon particles diminishes as the particles became larger, because the eye observes fewer large particles as being less black than the same weight of more numerous smaller carbon particles, due to the larger &#x201c;spaces&#x201d; between the larger particles. Thus, deagglomeration can increase the visibility of the mark, as well as reduce the amount and speed of settling. The size of the particles can be determined by using a number of approaches including, for example, laser light scattering particle analysis (LLSPA) (also known as laser diffraction or laser diffractometry), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). LLSPA may be more accurate when analyzing larger particles (for example, particles having a mean diameter of about 5 &#x3bc;m or greater) whereas DLS may be more accurate when analyzing smaller particles (for example, particles having a mean diameter of 0.5 &#x3bc;m or less). In addition, particle sizes can be measured using a LUMiSizer 650 that employs Space- and Time-resolved Extinction Profiles (STEP) technology, which measures particles in the range of, for example, 20 nm to 100 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The darkness of the tissue staining compositions containing the carbon particles can be measured as a function of absorbance or reflectance by means of a densitometer or uv/visible spectrophotometer, such as an X Rite 504 Portable Color Reflection Spectrodensitometer and a Thermo Scientific Biomate S3 UV-Vis spectrophotometer and the darkness may be expressed in terms of % Absorbance, % Reflectance, or optical density.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The deagglomeration process can be achieved by sonication, homogenization, high shear mixing, or ball milling, or other approaches to reduce particle size. Preferably, deagglomeration is achieved by sonication or homogenization. In certain embodiments, the carbon is deagglomerated by sonication in a 350W Biologics Model 3000 Ultrasonic Homogenizer with Solid Titanium Tip &#xbd;&#x2033; Diameter unit from BioLogics, Inc., Manassas, Va. sonicator on 60% power, for about 3 minutes or until approximate particle size is achieved. In other embodiments, the carbon is deagglomerated by homogenization, for example, by homogenizing at approximately 8,500 rpm for about 1 hour (for example, using a Silverson Model L5M-A mixer-homogenizer) or until the approximate particle size is achieved. One exemplary approach for deaggregating carbon particles by homogenization is described in Example 2.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In certain embodiments, the carbon particles are deagglomerated before they are mixed with other excipients, for example, the ASA and the optional mucoadhesive agent, because the process of deagglomeration may result in viscosity changes to ASA and the mucoadhesive agent, especially if the ASA or mucoadhesive agent are fabricated from or otherwise contain polymers which can be altered by high shear conditions. The carbon particles may be maintained as aggregates having a mean particle diameter less than 0.3 &#x3bc;m (for example, less than 0.2 &#x3bc;m) by the inclusion of additional additives, for example, one or more surfactants described below, which prevent or slow down the rate of reagglomeration due to van der Waals attraction.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Preferably the carbon particles are depyrogenated or are otherwise pyrogen free.

Settling is a process that takes place over time, and may proceed over a period of minutes, hours, days, months, or years. It is possible to quantify the rate of settling using a variety of approaches, for example, via centrifugation to accelerate the settling process. Similarly, the rate of settling, as well as particle size analysis, can be determined using a LUMiSizer 650 available from LUM GmbH, Berlin, Germany.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As a comparative method of analyzing the settling properties of a composition, a composition of interest may be subjected to centrifugal forces many times the force of gravity which allows the simulation of months of settling to occur in minutes to hours. Centrifugation of a tube containing a sample of interest may result in settling of the carbon particles at the bottom of the tube leaving a liquid depleted of carbon particles at the upper most regions of the liquid. A portion of the liquid in the upper most regions of the liquid (for example, the upper third portion) can then be analyzed to determine the amount of carbon particles that have settled. In certain embodiments, the staining composition can be characterized in that, when subjected to centrifugation for 60 minutes at 5,000&#xd7;g, the staining composition, which includes the ASA, exhibits less than 70%, less than 60%, less than 50%, less than 40%, less than 30%, or less than 20% of the settling when compared against similar composition where the particles have a mean particle diameter greater than 5 &#x3bc;m and/or the composition lacks an ASA.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">III. Mucoadhesives</heading><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Depending upon the choice of the ASA (for example, an ASA that does not also have mucoadhesive properties), it may be preferable to include an additional mucoadhesive agent. The mucoadhesive agent can aid the adherence of the staining agent in the marking of the composition to the target tissue. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is contemplated that greater mucoadhesion promotes cohesion of the mark and, therefore, increases the likelihood that the mark will remain in one place and be more readily visible near the area of interest, potentially by reducing spreading of the pigment over time. Furthermore, it is also believed that increased cohesion may reduce the leakage associated with marking solutions post injection, such leakage being undesirable as it can cloud the field of view of an endoscope and require an operating physician to rinse the area being viewed.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Preferred mucoadhesive agents optionally are thermally stable, compatible with other components in the formulation and increase the mucoadhesion of carbon particles with a mean particle diameter of less than 0.3 &#x3bc;m in diameter.

The surfactant allows the carbon agglomerates to be more readily dispersed in aqueou solutions and prohibits reagglomeration after sonication/homogenization. In certain embodiments the surfactant is a non-ionic surfactant. In certain embodiments, the surfactant is selected from the group consisting of polyethoxylated sorbitan ester and/or sorbitan ester. Exemplary polyethoxylated sorbitan esters include, for example, PEG-20 sorbitan monolaurate (Tween&#xae; 20), PEG-4 sorbitan monolaurate (Tween&#xae; 21), PEG-20 sorbitan monopalmitate (Tween&#xae; 40), PEG-20 sorbitan monostearate (Tween&#xae; 60), PEG-20 sorbitan tristearate (Tween&#xae; 65), and PEG-20 sorbitan monooleate (Tween&#xae; 80), which are available commercially from Croda Europe Ltd, England.

Simethicone (USP) comprises a mixture of poly(dimethylsiloxane) and silicon dioxide. The poly (dimethylsiloxane) is &#x3b1;-(trimethylsilyl)-&#x3c9;-methyl-poly[oxy (dimethylsilylene)]. The anti-foaming agent can be present at a final concentration from about 0.01% to about 0.5% (w/v), from about 0.05% to about 0.25% (w/v), or frog about 0.1% to about 0.2% (w/v).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The composition can also include a suitable preservative such as benzyl alcohol, methyl or ethyl paraben, or benzalkonium chloride, which can function as an anti-microbial.

Methods of Manufacture and Use</heading><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The tissue staining compositions can be prepared using a variety of approaches.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In a first approach, the marking compositions are produced by making a solution comprising carbon particles having a mean particle diameter less than 0.3 &#x3bc;m, preferably less than 0.2 &#x3bc;m. This can be achieved by, for example, sonicating or homogenizing a carbon particle containing solution, as discussed above. Thereafter, the particles are combined with other excipients, for example, an ASA, a mucoadhesive agent, a surfactant, and other agents etc.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In an exemplary protocol for making a tissue stain containing an ASA, a first pre-mix solution (the carbon pre-mix) is prepared by dissolving a surfactant (e.g., Tween&#xae; 80) and an anti-foaming agent (e.g., simethicone) in an aqueous solution (e.g., water), then adding depyrogenated carbon particles and mixing the surfactant, anti-foaming agent and carbon particles to produce a surfactant/carbon particle mixture. The surfactant/carbon particle mixture is then exposed to a deagglomeration procedure (for example, by sonication and/or homogenization) to produce the first pre-mix solution. In this method, the surfactant coats the carbon particles to slow down or prevent agglomeration or reagglomeration of the carbon particles. A second pre-mix solution (the polymer pre-mix) is prepared by combining the ASA (e.g., HEC) with the optional viscosity-increasing agent (e.g., glycerol) by mixing. The glycerol can also wet the ASA (e.g., HEC). The resulting mixture (or the ASA alone) is combined with an aqueous solution (e.g., water). Preferably the ASA (e.g., HEC) is not exposed to the deagglomeration procedure as this may shear the polymer thereby reducing or otherwise eliminating the beneficial properties of the polymer. In other words, the carbon particles are deagglomerated before being mixed with the ASA. A preservative can be added to the first pre-mix solution, the second pre-mix solution or both the first and second pre-mix solutions. The first and second pre-mix solutions then are combined, mixed, and introduced into a suitable container or delivery device, for example, a syringe.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">If the final tissue stain lacks the optional ASA and/or viscosity-increasing agent, then the second pre-mix solution can lack the ASA and/or viscosity-increasing agent. An example of a protocol for making a tissue stain without an ASA is described in Example 2. Briefly, a first pre-mix is prepared by combining a surfactant (e.g., Tween&#xae; 80), an anti-foaming agent (e.g., simethicone) and a viscosity increasing agent (e.g., glycerol) in water, and then adding the resulting mixture to carbon particles with mixing to produce the first pre-mix. A preservative can be added to the first pre-mix. A second pre-mix is prepared by adding a surfactant (e.g., Tween&#xae; 80) to water with stirring. Then a viscosity increasing agent (e.g., glycerol) is added to the mixture to produce the second pre-mix. A preservative can be added to the second pre-mix. Thereafter, the first pre-mix and the second pre-mix are combined with mixing (homogenization) at the appropriate rate and for the appropriate time, for example, for over 20 hours, until a tissue stain containing carbon particles with the desired particle sizes are obtained.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In a second approach, the deagglomerated carbon particles are mixed with the excipients, for example, the optional ASA, mucoadhesive agent, surfactant, etc. and then the carbon particles are filtered with a 0.2 &#x3bc;m filter (or a filter with smaller pore sizes) and size sorted to have a mean particle diameter less than 0.3 &#x3bc;m or less than 0.2 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The resulting tissue staining compositions created by the foregoing approaches and protocols, when introduced in a suitable container, can then be sterilized to maximize shelf life using sterilization techniques known in the art, including, as appropriate, autoclaving, exposure to ionizing radiation or by sterile filtration. Similarly, once the tissue staining composition has been included in a delivery device, the delivery device may be terminally sterilized using one or more procedures known in the art of terminal sterilization, for example, by autoclaving or by exposure to ionizing radiation.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The sterilization process preferably achieves a sterility assurance level (SAL) of 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>or better; i.e. the probability of any given unit of product being non sterile after the process is no more than 1 in 10<sup>3</sup>. More preferably, the sterilization process achieves an SAL of 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>or better, 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>or better, 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>or better, or 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>or better.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The staining composition can be used in the form of a liquid surgical marker for endoscopic and/or laparoscopic marking using known endoscopic and/or laparoscopic techniques. For example, the liquid tissue marking solution can be drawn into a syringe and injected through a needle, for example, a 25 gauge needle into the tissue of interest. In certain embodiments, the composition is capable of passing through a 25 gauge needle 240 cm in length by application of a force no greater than about 32N, for example, from about 22N to about 32N, or about 22N or less, or about 10N or less, or about 7N or less, or about 5N or less, to push the composition through the needle. The choice of the appropriate needle and/or injection system for introducing the tissue stain into the tissue of interest would be apparent to the user.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In certain embodiments, the tissue staining solutions do not include emulsifiers and/or do not contain carbon particles encapsulated in an emulsifier and/or do not contain carbon particles encapsulated in emulsifier containing micelles, as described in U.S. Pat.

This resulted in the settling of a portion of the carbon particles to give a pellet of settled solids at the bottom of each centrifuge tube and a liquid supernatant above the pellet. An aliquot from the one third of the supernatant was then removed and analyzed by UV/visible spectrometry to determine carbon concentration, which was then compared to the carbon concentration in the sample prior to centrifugation.
