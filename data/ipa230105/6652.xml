Since a single chip is required to support a variety of application scenes such as the 2th generation mobile communication system (2G), 3G, 4G and 5G, it is required to deploy down-sampling filters on the links in parallel to deal with the variety of application scenes, therefore a large number of filters are required. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, multiple single-mode filters are deployed in parallel, and input data are allocated to a corresponding single-mode filter through a multiplexer (MUX) to achieve filtering on the input data. In this way, in order to support multiple scenes, multiple single-mode filters are needed to be deployed, resulting in more resource consumption and more code amount for logic implementation.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart of an FIR filter-based filtering method according to an embodiment.

The FIR filter further includes an input control module <b>32</b>, an output control module <b>33</b>, a data merging module <b>34</b> and a control and parameter configuration module <b>35</b>. The filter multiplexing units <b>31</b> each can perform functions such as data beating, timing sequence control, and multi-add operation on input data and coefficients. Each of the filter multiplexing units <b>31</b> has its own data input control logic to control a phase of data input and timing sequence of data input. The FIR filter can configure a decimation mode of the FIR filter through the control and parameter configuration module <b>35</b>, so as to configure whether each of the three filter multiplexing units <b>31</b> is used, and to configure a filtering order used by each of the filter multiplexing units <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The preset filtering order and the preset down-sampling multiple are filtering parameters needed when the FIR filter is required to perform a filtering operation on input data according to a practical scenario. When the FIR filter filters the input data, the FIR filter allocates the input data to at least part of the filter multiplexing units to perform multi-add operation on the input data and filter coefficients of the at least part of the filter multiplexing units. Therefore, it is necessary to select, according to the preset down-sampling multiple, a corresponding number of filter multiplexing units as used filter multiplexing units, and the input data will be evenly allocated to these used filter multiplexing units according to a timing sequence of the data input. When the preset filtering order is acquired, and the number of the used filter multiplexing is determined, each of the used filter multiplexing unit is required to evenly share the preset filtering order to perform filtering operation. When the FIR filter performs filtering, the input data will be evenly allocated to the used filter multiplexing units according to the timing sequence, and after the used filter multiplexing units each performed multi-add operation on the input data and a respective filter coefficient, the unit filtered data is obtained. The unit filtered data outputted by all the used filter multiplexing units is merged to obtain the filtered data finally outputted by the FIR filter. The input data is evenly allocated to the used filter multiplexing units for filtering operation according to the timing sequence of the data input, and after the used filter multiplexing units output their respective unit filtered data, the unit filtered data is also required to be arranged according to the timing sequence of the data input before the filtering operation, to realize the operation of merging the unit filtered data, and the merged unit filtered data is used as the output filtered data of the FIR filter.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an implementation, operation in S<b>12</b> includes: selecting a number of filter multiplexing units same as the preset down-sampling multiple as the used filter multiplexing units in a case where the preset down-sampling multiple is an integer.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Operation in S<b>14</b> includes: performing multi-add operation on the input data and respective preset filtering coefficients by the each used filter multiplexing unit configured with the filtering order to obtain the unit filtered data, wherein the multi-add operation is performed in a number of clock cycles same as the preset down-sampling multiple.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an example, if the preset down-sampling multiple is 3, three filter multiplexing units may be selected as used filter multiplexing units. Within 3 clock cycles, the three filter multiplexing units are used to perform multi-add operation on the input data to obtain unit filtered data. By merging the unit filtered data outputted by the three used filter multiplexing units, 3&#xd7;decimation filtering may be achieved. The filter coefficients of the three used filter multiplexing units are (0, 3, 6, 9, . . . ), (1, 4, 7, 10, . . . ) and (2, 5, 8, 11 . . . ) respectively, and by selecting orders of the used filter multiplexing units according to the preset filtering order, filtering with the preset filtering order may be achieved. If the preset down-sampling multiple is 2, two filter multiplexing units may be selected as used filter multiplexing units. Within 2 clock cycles, these two filter multiplexing units are used to perform multi-add operation on the input data to obtain unit filtered data. By merging the unit filtered data outputted by the two used filter multiplexing units, the 2&#xd7;decimation filtering may be achieved. In this case, for the 2&#xd7;decimation filtering, there is a unused filter multiplexing unit, and when to perform 2&#xd7;decimation filtering, the unused filter multiplexing unit may be shielded by hardware, to allow make the output of the unused filter multiplexing unit to be all 0, then the output results of the two used filter multiplexing units are merged to be the result of the 2&#xd7;down-sampling filtering.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an implementation, operation in S<b>12</b> includes: in a case where the preset down-sampling multiple is a fraction, selecting a number of filter multiplexing units same as a numerator of the preset down-sampling multiple as the used filter multiplexing units.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Operation in S<b>14</b> includes: performing multi-add operation on the input data and respective preset filtering coefficients by the each used filter multiplexing unit configured with the filtering order to obtain the unit filtered data, wherein the multi-add operation is performed by using a number of clock cycles same as the numerator of the preset down-sampling multiple and within a number of clock cycles same as a denominator of the preset down-sampling multiple.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an example, if the preset down-sampling multiple is &#xbe;, three filter multiplexing units may be selected as used filter multiplexing units. Within 4 clock cycles, the three filter multiplexing units are used to perform multi-add operation on the input data in the first 3 clock cycles, and in the fourth clock cycle, only shifting is performed and filtering is not performed, to obtain unit filtered data. By merging the unit filtered data outputted by the three used filter multiplexing units, &#xbe;&#xd7;decimation filtering may be achieved.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an implementation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, before operation in S<b>11</b>, the method further includes: operation in S<b>41</b> and operation in S<b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Operation in S<b>41</b> includes configuring a number of the plurality of filter multiplexing units in the FIR filter according to at least two preset down-sampling multiples supported by the FIR filter, where a preset down-sampling multiples is an integer or a fraction.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Operation in S<b>42</b> includes configuring a unit maximum order supported by each of the plurality of filter multiplexing units according to a maximum order supported by the FIR filter and the number of the plurality of filter multiplexing units, where the filter multiplexing units are each configured to have functions for performing data beating, timing sequence control, and multi-add operation on data and coefficients.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an implementation, operation in S<b>41</b> includes: in a case where the at least two preset down-sampling multiples supported by the FIR filter are all integers, configuring the number of the filter multiplexing units according to a largest preset down-sampling multiple among the at least two preset down-sampling multiples; and in a case where the at least two preset down-sampling multiples supported by the FIR filter comprise a fraction, configuring the number of the filter multiplexing units according to a denominator of the preset down-sampling multiple being of a fraction and the preset down-sampling multiple being of an integer in the at least two preset down-sampling multiples.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an exemplary embodiment, if the FIR filter supports 2&#xd7;decimation filtering and 3&#xd7;decimation filtering, the FIR filter is required to be configured with three filter multiplexing units.

According to the requirement of supporting a maximum order of 90 and a maximum down-sampling multiple of 3, the FIR filter is designed to have total three filter multiplexing units, each of the filter multiplexing units can realize the multi-add operation with a maximum order of 30, and the total three filter multiplexing units can achieve the performance requirements for decimation filtering with a maximum order of 90. Registers are used to control data input to different filter multiplexing units, and configure each of the filter multiplexing units with different filter coefficients, and finally different filtering multiplexing units are combined to achieve the support for different filtering functions. Under the maximum order (each filtering multiplexing unit with a maximum order of 30), a total filtering order of the multi-mode filter may be flexibly defined by software. For the filtering order that does not need to be used, the filter multiplexing unit may be directly configured with filter coefficients of 0. In theory, any filter design with a filtering order unexceeding the maximum order can be supported.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">One FIR filter is configured to have multiple filter multiplexing units, and various filtering modes are achieved by different combinations of the filter multiplexing units. The filter down-sampling modes and the filter order can be switched by configuring corresponding registers, which, compared with the way of adopting multiple single-mode filters, reduces the data selection module, the filter parameter configuration register, the number of single-mode filters and corresponding logic circuits. Especially, when dealing with complex scenarios, one multi-mode FIR filter is used to replace existing multiple single-mode filters that are needed to be designed to deal with each complex scenario, and the multi-mode FIR filter can supports more scenarios and reduces resource consumption and the amount of code for logic implementation.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of an FIR filter-based filtering apparatus according to an embodiment, and the filtering apparatus can be deployed at a digital receiving front-end, the filtering apparatus includes: a filtering parameter acquisition module <b>51</b>, a unit selection module <b>52</b>, a unit order configuration module <b>53</b>, a unit data output module <b>54</b>, and a data merging module <b>55</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The filtering parameter acquisition module <b>51</b> is configured to acquire a preset filtering order and a preset down-sampling multiple; the unit selection module <b>52</b> is configured to select, according to the preset down-sampling multiple, a corresponding number of filter multiplexing units as used filter multiplexing units, where the FIR filter includes multiple filter multiplexing units; the unit order configuration module <b>53</b> is configured to configure, according to the preset filtering order, filtering orders for the used filter multiplexing units; the unit data output module <b>54</b> is configured to filter, according to the preset down-sampling multiple, input data allocated to each used filter multiplexing unit through the each used filter multiplexing unit configured with the filtering order, and output unit filtered data; and the data merging module <b>55</b> is configured to merge the unit filtered data respectively outputted by the corresponding number of used filter multiplexing units and output merged unit filtered data.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, the unit selection module <b>52</b> includes: a first selection sub-module.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The first selection sub-module is configured to select a number of filter multiplexing units same as the preset down-sampling multiple as the used filter multiplexing units in a case where the preset down-sampling multiple is an integer.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Correspondingly, the unit data output module <b>54</b> includes: a first unit data calculation sub-module.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The first unit data calculation sub-module is configured to perform multi-add operation on the input data and respective preset filtering coefficients by the each used filter multiplexing unit configured with the filtering order to obtain the unit filtered data, where the multi-add operation is performed in a number of clock cycles same as the preset down-sampling multiple.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, the unit selection module <b>52</b> includes: a second selection sub-module.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The second selection sub-module is configured to, in a case where the preset down-sampling multiple is a fraction, selecta number of filter multiplexing units same as a numerator of the preset down-sampling multiple as the used filter multiplexing units.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Correspondingly, the unit filtered data output module <b>54</b> includes: a second unit data calculation sub-module.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The second unit data calculation sub-module is configured to perform multi-add operation on the input data and respective preset filtering coefficients by the each used filter multiplexing unit configured with the filtering order to obtain the unit filtered data, wherein the multi-add operation is performed by using a number of clock cycles same as the numerator of the preset down-sampling multiple and within a number of clock cycles same as a denominator of the preset down-sampling multiple.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In one embodiment, the filtering apparatus based on an FIR filter further includes: a unit quantity configuration module and a unit order configuration module.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The unit quantity configuration module is configured to, before the preset filtering order and the preset down-sampling multiple are acquired, a number of the plurality of filter multiplexing units in the FIR filter according to at least two preset down-sampling multiples supported by the FIR filter, where each of the at least two preset down-sampling multiples is an integer or a fraction.
