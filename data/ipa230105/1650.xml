id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0002">The present invention relates to a prepreg in which a thermosetting resin and a thermoplastic resin are impregnated into a reinforcing fiber, and to a laminate or an integrated product containing the thermosetting resin, the thermoplastic resin, and the reinforcing fiber.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0003">A fiber-reinforced composite material that combines a thermosetting resin or a thermoplastic resin as a matrix with a reinforcing fiber such as a carbon fiber and a glass fiber is a lightweight material yet having excellent mechanical properties such as strength and rigidity, as well as excellent heat resistance and corrosion resistance. Therefore, this has been used in numerous fields, including aerospace, automobiles, railway vehicles, marine vessels, civil engineering and construction, and sporting goods. However, these fiber-reinforced composite materials are not suitable for manufacturing of a part and a structural body having a complex shape in a single molding process. For the applications described above, it is necessary to prepare a member made of a fiber-reinforced composite material and then to integrate this with a similar or different type of a member. A mechanical bonding method using a bolt, a rivet, a screw, or the like, and a bonding method using an adhesive are used to integrate a fiber-reinforced composite material composed of a reinforcing fiber and a thermosetting resin with a similar or a different member. The mechanical bonding method requires a pre-processing process of a bonding portion, such as drilling of a hole, which leads to not only the increase in the time in the manufacturing process and in the manufacturing cost, but also the decrease in the material strength due to drilling of the hole. The bonding method using an adhesive requires bonding and curing processes, which include preparation and application of the adhesive; thus, this leads to the increase in the time in the manufacturing process and to the insufficient reliability in terms of the adhesion strength.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0004">The fiber-reinforced composite material using a thermoplastic resin as the matrix bonds between members by welding in addition to the mechanical bonding method and the bonding method using an adhesive as described above; thus, it is possible to reduce the time necessary for bonding between members. On the other hand, when mechanical properties at a high temperature and an excellent resistance to chemicals are required as in the case of an aircraft structural member, there has been a problem in that the heat resistance and the chemical resistance thereof were not so good as those of the fiber-reinforced composite material composed of a thermosetting resin and a reinforcing fiber.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0005">Here, Patent Literature 1 describes a method for bonding a fiber-reinforced composite material composed of a thermosetting resin and a reinforcing fiber via an adhesive.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0006">Patent Literature 2 describes a method for integrating a member formed of a thermoplastic resin with a member formed of a fiber-reinforced composite material that is obtained from a thermosetting resin. Specifically, a thermoplastic resin film is laminated to the surface of a prepreg sheet composed of a reinforcing fiber and the thermosetting resin, and then, this is heated and pressurized to obtain a fiber-reinforced composite material. The resulting fiber-reinforced composite material is then placed in a mold, and then, the thermoplastic resin is injection molded to bond the thermoplastic resin member formed by injection molding with the fiber-reinforced composite material.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0007">In addition, Patent Literature 3 describes a method for manufacturing a laminate in which a thermoplastic resin adhesive layer is formed on the surface of a composite material composed of a thermosetting resin and a reinforcing fiber. It is described that this shows the adhesive effect with other members via a thermoplastic resin.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0008">Patent Literature 4 describes a prepreg and its fiber-reinforced composite material, in which a particle, or a fiber, or a film formed of a thermoplastic resin is placed on the surface layer of a prepreg composed of a reinforcing fiber and a thermosetting resin.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">PATENT LITERATURE</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0009">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2018-161801</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0010">Patent Literature 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H10-138354</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0011">Patent Literature 3: Japanese Patent No. 3906319</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0012">Patent Literature 4: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H08-259713</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0013">However, the method described in Patent Literature 1 is a method for bonding fiber-reinforced composite materials composed of a reinforcing fiber and a thermosetting resin to each other by using an adhesive; but, because the thermosetting resin is a matrix resin, welding cannot be used as the method for bonding the fiber-reinforced composite material as it is. Because it takes a time for the adhesive to be cured, there is a problem in that the bonding process is time-consuming. On top of this, the bonding strength thereof was not sufficient.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">In the method described in Patent Literature 2, the bonding strength at the bonding portion between the thermosetting resin in the fiber-reinforced composite material and the thermoplastic resin film was not sufficient.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">The fiber-reinforced composite material of Patent Literature 3 could be integrated by welding via the thermoplastic resin and exhibited an excellent bonding strength at room temperature, but the bonding strength at high temperature was not sufficient.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">In the method described in Patent Literature 4, it is indicated that the particle, the fiber, or the film made of the thermoplastic resin improves an interlaminar fracture toughness value, but the bonding strength in the boundary portion between the thermosetting resin in the fiber-reinforced composite material and the thermoplastic resin was not sufficient.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide: a prepreg that has an excellent quality as a prepreg, that can weld with the same type or a different type of member, that expresses an excellent bonding strength, that has an excellent interlaminar fracture toughness value, and that gives a laminate suitable as a structural material; and a laminate and an integrated product thereof.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">To solve the problem described above, a prepreg according to the present invention includes the following compositions. That is, a prepreg includes composition elements [A], [B], and [C] described below,</p><p id="p-0021" num="0000">[A] a reinforcing fiber,<br/>[B] a thermosetting resin, and<br/>[C] a thermoplastic resin.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0019">[B] contains a thermoplastic resin having an aromatic ring with an amount of 10% or more by mass, a resin region containing [B] is present on one surface of the prepreg, a resin region containing [C] is present on another surface of the prepreg, and [A] that crosses over a boundary surface between the resin region containing [B] and the resin region containing [C] and that is in contact with both resin regions is present.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0020">Furthermore, the laminate, which is another aspect of the present invention, has any of the following compositions. That is, the laminate includes the composition in which the cured product of the above-described prepreg constitutes at least some of the layers, or includes the following composition. That is, A laminate comprising layers containing composition elements [A], [C], and [D] described below,</p><p id="p-0024" num="0000">[A] a reinforcing fiber,<br/>[C] a thermoplastic resin, and<br/>[D] a thermosetting resin cured product.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0021">[D] contains 10% or more by mass of a thermoplastic resin having an aromatic ring, and [A] that crosses over a boundary surface between a resin region containing [C] and a resin region containing [D] and that is in contact with both resin regions is present.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0022">Here, whenever the term &#x201c;laminate&#x201d; is used in this specification, this shall refer to any of these laminates in accordance with the context unless otherwise specifically mentioned. Also, without any particular restriction, as it can be seen from this specification, the laminate according to the present invention is a fiber-reinforced resin that can be typically prepared by using a preform containing the prepreg of the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0023">The prepreg and the laminate according to the present invention use a thermosetting resin and a thermoplastic resin, in which not only these two are firmly bonded, but also they can well weld with the same type or a different type of member. Accordingly, the time required in the bonding process can be shortened as compared with a conventional fiber-reinforced composite material using a thermosetting resin and a reinforcing fiber; thus, it is possible to speed up the molding process of a structural member. Furthermore, when the thermosetting resin is made to contain a specified amount of the thermoplastic resin having an aromatic ring, the resin properties suitable for the prepreg manufacturing process is obtained; thus, a high quality prepreg can be obtained. In addition, the laminate that exhibits an excellent bonding strength and is excellent as the structural material can be obtained. Accordingly, when this is applied to an aircraft structural member, a wind turbine blade, an automotive structural member, and computer applications such as an IC tray and a housing of a laptop computer, not only an excellent performance as the structural material is expressed, but also the molding time and cost of the products relating to the above-mentioned applications can be significantly reduced.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the prepreg or the laminate according to the present invention, and illustrates a cross section that is perpendicular to the prepreg plane or the laminate plane relating to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a cross section that is perpendicular to the prepreg plane or the laminate plane in the present invention, and is for the sake of explanation about the method to measure the roughness average length RSm and the roughness average height Rc.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0026">&#x3c;Composition Element [A]&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0027">The reinforcing fiber of the composition element [A] used in the present invention includes a glass fiber, a carbon fiber, a metal fiber, an aromatic polyamide fiber, a polyaramide fiber, an alumina fiber, a silicon carbide fiber, a boron fiber, a basalt fiber, and the like. These may be used singly or in a combination of two or more of them as appropriate. These reinforcing fibers may be surface treated. The surface treatment includes a metal deposition treatment, a treatment with a coupling agent, a treatment with a sizing agent, and an adhesion treatment with an additive, and the like. In this specification, in the case that such a surface treatment is conducted to the reinforcing fiber, the reinforcing fiber shall include those in the state after having been subjected to the treatments as described above. These reinforcing fibers include the reinforcing fiber having an electric conductivity. The carbon fiber is preferably used as the reinforcing fiber because of its low specific gravity, high strength, and high elastic modulus.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0028">Illustrative examples of the commercially available product of the carbon fiber include TORAYCA&#xae; T800G-24K, TORAYCA&#xae; T800S-24K, TORAYCA&#xae; T700G-24K, TORAYCA&#xae; T700S-24K, TORAYCA&#xae; T300-3K, and TORAYCA&#xae; T1100G-24K (all are manufactured by Toray Industries, Inc.).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0029">The form and arrangement of the reinforcing fiber can be selected as appropriate from the reinforcing fibers arranged in one direction, a laminate of the reinforcing fibers arranged in one direction, a woven fabric, and the like. However, in order to obtain a lightweight laminate having a higher level of durability, it is preferable in each prepreg that the reinforcing fibers be long fibers arranged in one direction (fiber bundle) or in the form of continuous fibers such as a woven fabric.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0030">The reinforcing fiber bundle may be composed of a plurality of fibers in the same form or a plurality of fibers in different forms. The number of the reinforcing fibers that constitute one reinforcing fiber bundle is usually in the range of 300 to 60,000; but considering the manufacturing of the base material, the number is preferably in the range of 300 to 48,000, while more preferably from 1,000 to 24,000. The range may be a combination of any of the upper limits and any of the lower limits described above.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0031">The reinforcing fiber has a surface free energy of preferably in the range of 10 to 50 mJ/m<sup>2 </sup>as measured by the Wilhelmy method. By controlling the surface free energy within this range, the reinforcing fiber expresses a high affinity with the thermosetting resin of [B] or with the thermosetting resin cured product of [D] and the thermoplastic resin of [C], and a high bonding strength at the boundary surface in which the reinforcing fiber crosses over between a resin region containing [B] or [D] and a resin region containing [C]. In addition, agglomeration of the reinforcing fibers among themselves is suppressed thereby resulting in good dispersion of the reinforcing fibers in the molded article and in less variation (coefficient of variation) in the bonding strength. The surface free energy of the reinforcing fiber is preferably in the range of 15 to 40 mJ/m<sup>2</sup>, while more preferably in the range of 18 to 35 mJ/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0032">The method to control the surface free energy of the reinforcing fiber includes the method in which an amount of an oxygen-containing functional group such as a carboxyl group and a hydroxyl group is controlled by oxidizing the surface thereof, or the method in which a single compound or a plurality of compounds is attached to the surface thereof. When a plurality of compounds is attached to the surface, a mixture of compounds having a high surface free energy and a low surface free energy may be attached. Hereinafter, the method to calculate the surface free energy of the reinforcing fiber will be explained. The surface free energy can be calculated by measuring the contact angle between the reinforcing fiber and each of three solvents (purified water, ethyleneglycol, and tricresyl phosphate) followed by the Owens' approximation method. The procedure is described below, but the measurement equipment and the detailed method thereof are not necessarily limited to the following.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0033">By using DCAT11 manufactured by DataPhysics, firstly, after taking one monofilament out from the reinforcing fiber bundle, this is cut into eight fibers having the length of 12&#xb1;2 mm, and then these are attached in parallel to a specialized holder FH12 (a flat plate whose surface is coated with an adhesive substance) with the distance of 2 to 3 mm between the monofilaments. The tips of the monofilaments are then trimmed and set in DCAT11 of the holder. For the measurement, a cell containing each solvent is brought close to the lower tips of the eight monofilaments at the speed of 0.2 mm/s and immersed to 5 mm from the tip of the monofilaments. Then, the monofilaments are pulled up at the speed of 0.2 mm/s. This operation is repeated four or more times. The force F received by the monofilament while being immersed in the liquid is measured using an electronic balance. This value is used to calculate the contact angle &#x3b8; by the following equation.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Cas</i>&#x3b8;=(force<i>F</i>(<i>mN</i>)received by8monofilaments)/(8(number of monofilaments)&#xd7;circumference of monofilament(<i>m</i>)&#xd7;surface tension of solvent(<i>mJ/m</i><sup>2</sup>))<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0039" num="0034">The measurement was carried out with regard to the monofilaments extracted from three different locations of the reinforcing fiber bundle.

(&#x201c;Thermosetting resin&#x201d; as the composition element [B] in this specification shall mean a resin composition that contains 50% or more by mass of a thermosetting resin and exhibits behaviors of the thermosetting resin as a whole.) When the content of the thermoplastic resin having an aromatic ring is less than 10% by mass, at the resin film producing process during prepreg manufacturing, or at the resin impregnating process to carbon fibers, the resin is taken off in a release paper or in a cover film, resulting in the increase in an unevenness of a basis weight of the thermosetting resin; thus, a high quality prepreg cannot be obtained. When the unevenness of the resin basis weight increases, the amount of the thermosetting resin in the laminate becomes uneven, resulting in an unevenness in the reinforcing fiber ratio and disorder in the arrangement of the fibers; these in turn result in the increase in the variation (coefficient of variation) of the bonding strength as an integrated product. The content of the thermoplastic resin having an aromatic ring is more preferably 13% or more by mass.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0041">The thermoplastic resin component having an aromatic ring described above is a thermoplastic resin component other than the composition element [C], and is preferably soluble in the thermosetting resin of [B]. The term &#x201c;soluble in the thermosetting resin&#x201d; means that there is a temperature range in which the thermoplastic resin component being mixed with the thermosetting resin forms a homogeneous phase upon heating or heating with stirring. Here, the term &#x201c;forming a homogeneous phase&#x201d; means that there is no separation by a visual observation. The term &#x201c;state of being dissolved&#x201d; refers to the state in which the thermosetting resin including the thermoplastic resin component is in a homogeneous phase in a certain temperature range. Once a homogeneous phase is formed in a certain temperature range, it does not matter whether or not separation would occur outside this temperature range, for example, at room temperature. Inclusion of such a thermoplastic resin having an aromatic ring increases the affinity with the thermoplastic resin of [C] thereby leading to enhancement of the interface strength between the resin region containing [B] or [D] and the resin region containing [C]; as a result, an excellent bonding strength as the integrated product can be expressed.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0042">In general, the thermoplastic resin having an aromatic ring is preferably the thermoplastic resin having in the main chain thereof a bond selected from the group consisting of a carbon-carbon bond, an amide bond, an imide bond, an ester bond, an ether bond, a carbonate bond, a urethane bond, a thioether bond, a sulfone bond, and a carbonyl bond. Also, the thermoplastic resin component may partially have a cross-linked structure; and also, this may be crystalline or amorphous. In particular, preferable is at least one resin selected from the group consisting of polycarbonate, polyphenylene oxide, polyphenylene sulfide, polyarylate, polyester, polyamide imide, polyimide, polyether imide polysulfone, polyether sulfone, polyether ketone, polyether ether ketone, phenoxy resin, and polybenzimidazole.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0043">In particular, the thermoplastic resin having an aromatic ring is preferably a polyether sulfone or a polyether imide. The polyether imide and the polyether sulfone have a strong interaction with the composition element [C] due to the hydrogen bonding property thereof, thereby leading to enhancement of the interface strength between the resin region containing [B] or [D] and the resin region containing [C]; as a result, an excellent bonding strength as the integrated product can be expressed. In addition, the polyether imide and the polyether sulfone also have an excellent heat resistance thereby expressing an excellent bonding strength even in a high environmental temperature; thus, these are good examples for this.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0044">The weight-average molecular weight of the thermoplastic resin having an aromatic ring is preferably in the range of 10,000 to 40,000 g/mol both inclusive. When the weight-average molecular weight is 10,000 g/mol or higher, the thermoplastic resin has excellent heat resistance and mechanical properties; thus, this expresses an excellent bonding strength under an environment of a room temperature as well as a high environmental temperature. When the weight-average molecular weight is 40,000 g/mol or less, the compatibility with the composition element [C] increases thereby increasing the interface strength between the resin region containing [B] or [D] and the resin region containing [C]; as a result, an excellent bonding strength is expressed.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0045">In the composition element [B], the storage modulus at 90&#xb0; C. at the temperature raising process of 1.5&#xb0; C./min using a rheometer is preferably in the range of 1.0 to 100 Pa. When the storage modulus at 90&#xb0; C. in [B] is 1.0 Pa or higher, at the thermosetting resin film producing process during prepreg manufacturing, or at the resin impregnating process to carbon fibers, the resin is less taken off in a release paper or in a cover film, thereby resulting in the decrease in an unevenness of a basis weight of the resin; thus, a high quality prepreg can be obtained. In the composition element [B], when the storage modulus at 90&#xb0; C. is 100 Pa or less, the resin is not scratched at the film producing process of the thermosetting resin during prepreg manufacturing. As a result, the resin film having a uniform thickness can be obtained, so that a high quality prepreg having less unevenness in the resin basis weight can be obtained. The smaller unevenness in the resin basis weight can lower the unevenness in the amount of the thermosetting resin in the laminate and can suppress formation of the defect such as a void. Accordingly, it becomes possible to lower the variation (coefficient of variation) in the bonding strength of the integrated product. The storage modulus at 90&#xb0; C. is more preferably in the range of 1.0 to 50 Pa, while still more preferably in the range of 1.0 to 30 Pa.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0046">Furthermore, in the composition element [B], the temperature to reach a minimum viscosity thereof at the temperature raising process of 1.5&#xb0; C./min is preferably in the range of 120&#xb0; C. or higher. This suppresses thickening of the resin in the prepreg manufacturing process so that the resin film having a uniform thickness can be obtained. As a result, a high quality prepreg having less unevenness in the resin basis weight can be obtained. The viscosity of the composition element [B] at the temperature raising process of 1.5&#xb0; C./min using a rheometer gradually decreases; then, as the temperature is raised further, the fluidity thereof decreases due to progress of the curing reaction, and above a certain temperature, the viscosity starts to increase. This temperature was defined as the temperature to reach the minimum viscosity, and the viscosity immediately before the viscosity starts to increase was defined as the minimum viscosity. From the viewpoint of the production efficiency, the temperature to reach the minimum viscosity is preferably 180&#xb0; C. or lower. Furthermore, when the minimum viscosity is 0.5 Pas or higher, it is difficult to cause disorder in the arrangement of the carbon fibers during lamination molding, so that the integrated product expresses a high boding strength with lowering the variation in the bonding strength. The minimum viscosity when the temperature is raised at 1.5&#xb0; C./min using a rheometer is more preferably 1.0 Pas or more, while still more preferably 2.0 Pas or more. From the viewpoint of the quality of the laminate obtained after molding, the minimum viscosity is 100 Pas or less, while more preferably 10 Pas or less.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0047">Illustrative examples of the thermosetting resin to be used in the composition element [B] include an unsaturated polyester resin, a vinyl ester resin, an epoxy resin, a phenol resin, a urea resin, a melamine resin, a polyimide resin, a cyanate ester resin, a bismaleimide resin, a benzoxazine resin, a copolymer or a modified body of these resins, or a blend of at least two of these resins.

When the content of the reinforcing fiber is 90% or less by mass, the chance of poor impregnation of the resin is likely to be reduced thereby leading to the decrease in formation of the void in the resulting laminate.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0068">&#x3c;Laminate&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0081" num="0069">Another aspect of the present invention is the laminate that is produced by the method in which the preform having at least some of the layers thereof composed of the prepreg according to the present invention is cured by pressurizing and heating, namely, the laminate having at least some of the layers thereof composed of the cured product of the prepreg according to the present invention; the preform being produced by laminating a plurality of the prepregs according to the present invention, or by laminating the prepreg according to the present invention with a prepreg other than the prepreg according to the present invention.
