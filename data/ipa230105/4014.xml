However, the near-eye display might cause symptoms such as visual fatigue, eyestrain, and so on, which are collectively referred to as vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC). In this case, the two eyes of the user might not verge and accommodate at the same time for estimating the relative distance of objects.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, to give the user an improved FOV, a distance between the near-eye display and each of the eyes is normally kept at a limited range, for example, about 15 mm to 50 mm. However, the eyes of a user wearing eyeglasses might not be kept in the aforesaid distance range, which might adversely affect the FOV.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, it is cumbersome if the eyeglasses are necessary to be provided between the user and the near-eye display for viewing images.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, an object of the disclosure is to provide an optical system including a pancake lens assembly which may eliminate or alleviate at least one of the above-mentioned drawbacks.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the disclosure, an optical system includes a pancake lens assembly which has a lens unit and a liquid crystal device. The lens unit includes a partially reflective mirror, a reflective polarizer, and a quarter waveplate disposed between the partially reflective mirror and the reflective polarizer. The lens unit is configured such that when a light is introduced into the pancake lens assembly in a Z direction to form a continuous light path including three path segments between the quarter waveplate and the reflective polarizer, an X-polarized light polarized in an X direction orthogonal to the Z direction travels on two of the three path segments, and a Y-polarized light polarized in a Y direction orthogonal to both the X and Z directions travels on a remaining one of the three path segments. The liquid crystal device has liquid crystal molecules. Long axes of the liquid crystal molecules are orientated parallel to an X-Z plane defined by the X and Z directions, and the liquid crystal device is disposed between the quarter waveplate and the reflective polarizer such that when the continuous light path is formed, the X-polarized light passes through the liquid crystal device two times and the Y-polarized light passes through the liquid crystal device one time.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">With the provision of the optical system of the disclosure, a folded light path (i.e., the continuous light path) can be formed in the optical system, which is conducive for reducing total volume of the optical system. In addition, by arranging the long axes of the liquid crystal molecules in parallel to the X-Z plane, the light passing through the pancake lens assembly can be adjusted by the liquid crystal device two times, which is beneficial for solving the problem of limited adjustable optical phase in a liquid crystal device. In addition, the optical system may be also used for mitigating the vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC) caused by the near-eye display, and/or for vision correction.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other features and advantages of the disclosure will become apparent in the following detailed description of the embodiment(s) with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view illustrating a light path in an optical system in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic view illustrating details of a liquid crystal device of the optical system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic view illustrating another optical system in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Before the disclosure is described in greater detail, it should be noted that where considered appropriate, reference numerals have been repeated among the figures to indicate corresponding or analogous elements, which may optionally have similar characteristics.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">To aid in describing the disclosure, directional terms may be used in the specification and claims to describe portions of the present disclosure (e.g., front, rear, left, right, top, bottom, etc.).

In some embodiments, the light-providing device <b>4</b>A is configured to provide a circularly polarized light. In some embodiments, the light-providing device <b>4</b>A may be a display or other suitable devices. The light-providing device <b>4</b>A may be an OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display for providing a circularly polarized light. If the light-providing device <b>4</b>A is an LED (light-emitting diode) display for providing a linearly polarized light, an additional quarter waveplate (not shown) may be used for transforming the linearly polarized light into a circularly polarized light.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The polarization transformation of the light in the optical system is described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. An R-circularly polarized light represented by the arrow <b>101</b> from the light-providing device <b>4</b>A passes through the partially reflective mirror <b>21</b>, and then encounters the quarter waveplate <b>22</b>. The quarter waveplate <b>22</b> transforms the R-circularly polarized light into an X-polarized light represented by the arrow <b>102</b>. The X-polarized light traveling on the path segment (S<b>1</b>) passes through the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> for the first time, and is reflected by the reflective polarizer <b>23</b>. Thereafter, the reflected X-polarized light represented by the arrow <b>103</b> traveling on the path segment (S<b>2</b>) passes through the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> for the second time. Afterward, the quarter waveplate <b>22</b> transforms the X-polarized light into an R-circularly polarized light represented by the arrow <b>104</b>. The partially reflective mirror <b>21</b> reflects and transforms the R-circularly polarized light into an L-circularly polarized light represented by the arrow <b>105</b>. Next, the quarter waveplate <b>22</b> transforms the L-circularly polarized light into a Y-polarized light represented by the arrow <b>106</b>. The Y-polarized light traveling on the path segment (S<b>3</b>) passes through the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> for the third time, and then passes through the reflective polarizer <b>23</b> toward an eye of a user (not shown).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It should be noted that when a light passes through the liquid crystal device <b>3</b>, the optical phase modulated by the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> is limited, which may be related to the thickness and refractive index of the materials used in liquid crystal device <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this case, the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> is a polarization-dependent lens merely for adjusting the focus of the X-polarized light. In other words, the focus of the light can be adjusted by the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> two times. In alternative embodiment, the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> may be a polarization-independent lens for adjusting the focuses of the X-polarized light and the Y-polarized light.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">By directing the light to pass through the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> several times, the optical phase modulated by the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> may be enhanced. Therefore, compared to a typical liquid crystal lens which has an increased thickness of a liquid crystal layer to achieve the same optical modulation range (i.e., the variation range of the optical power) as that of the pancake lens assembly <b>100</b>, the response time of pancake lens assembly <b>100</b> is relatively fast compared to the typical liquid crystal lens with the increased thickness of the liquid crystal layer. Although two liquid crystal devices provided at two opposite sides of the lens unit <b>2</b> may also achieve the same effect, the number of such liquid crystal device is doubled. Besides, one liquid crystal device disposed outside of the lens unit <b>2</b> may not achieve the effect shown by the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> disposed in the lens unit <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, a distance between the reflective polarizer <b>23</b> and the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> may affect the overall optical phase modulation, i.e., affect the equivalent diopter of the pancake lens assembly <b>100</b>. For example, when the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> is a liquid crystal lens, a predetermined distance between the reflective polarizer <b>23</b> and the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> may be equal to a thickness of two of the liquid crystal lenses. When the distance between the reflective polarizer <b>23</b> and the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> is less than the predetermined distance, the equivalent diopter of the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> in the pancake lens assembly <b>100</b> can be doubled. On the contrary, when the distance between the reflective polarizer <b>23</b> and the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> is larger than the predetermined distance, the equivalent diopter of the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> in the pancake lens assembly <b>100</b> may be less than double. The actual equivalent diopter may be calculated based on the concept of a composite lens, and details thereof are omitted for the sake of brevity. When the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> is a liquid crystal prism, an effect observed with two liquid crystal prisms may be obtained. Therefore, by providing the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> in the lens unit <b>2</b>, a relatively thin liquid crystal device <b>3</b> can be used to achieve a good performance, which is conductive for reducing total volume and weight of the pancake lens assembly <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, although the elements <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>23</b> are spaced apart from each other in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, those elements may be bonded to each other along the optical axis of the pancake lens assembly <b>100</b> in the Z direction without gaps therebetween. For example, the quarter waveplate <b>22</b> and the partially reflective mirror <b>21</b> are sequentially adhered on one side of the liquid crystal device <b>3</b>, and the reflective polarizer <b>23</b> may be adhered on the other side of the liquid crystal device <b>3</b>. Since the elements <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> may have thicknesses in micro-scale, and they may formed on the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> through sputtering or other suitable techniques used for reducing total thickness and weight of the pancake lens assembly <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> may have a planar surface. In alternative embodiments, the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> may have a spherical, aspherical, or free-form optical surface. The surface of the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> may be varied based on application of the optical system.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, when an imaging position is to be changed using the conventional near-eye display, the distance between the lens unit and the display would be changed. When the liquid crystal device <b>3</b> in the pancake lens assembly <b>100</b> is an electrically tunable focusing liquid crystal lens, the focal length can be electrically controlled, and there is no need to move the lens unit <b>2</b> and the display (such as the light-providing device <b>4</b>A). Therefore, when the pancake lens assembly <b>100</b> is applied to, for example, a near-eye display, the vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC) can be resolved, or vision correction of a user can be achieved. Therefore, a user with poor vision may use the near-eye display without wearing eyeglasses or the like for vision correction.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Furthermore, the optical system of the disclosure may also serve as at least a portion of a corrective lens for daily vision correction.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an optical system in accordance with some embodiments.

In addition, by arranging the long axes (L) of the liquid crystal molecules <b>34</b> in parallel to the X-Z plane, the light passing through the pancake lens assembly <b>100</b> can be adjusted at least two times by the liquid crystal device <b>3</b>, which solves the problem of limited adjustable optical phase in a liquid crystal device. In addition, the optical system of the disclosure may be also used for mitigating the VAC caused by the near-eye display, and/or for vision correction.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the description above, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details have been set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiment(s).
