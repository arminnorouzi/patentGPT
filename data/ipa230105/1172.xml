Medical devices such as a medical tube and a syringe used in the liquid delivery line can be connected to each other by using a connector set including a male connector and a female connector to which the male connector can be connected (see, for example, JP 2013-252165 A).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The male connector includes a hollow rod-shaped flow path connection portion that defines a first flow path inside, and a lock protrusion. The female connector includes a cap, a housing, and a valve body. The cap has a top wall having an opening into which the flow path connection portion provided in the male connector can be inserted, and an outer peripheral wall hanging from an outer peripheral edge of the top wall. The housing has a cylindrical wall having an inner peripheral surface defining a second flow path, and an engagement protrusion protruding from an outer peripheral surface of the cylindrical wall so as to form a lower surface to be engaged with the lock protrusion to lock the male connector in a state of being connected to the female connector.

Then, in cases such as one where a locked state where the lock protrusion is engaged with the lower surface of the engagement protrusion is released by an unintended external force, an inner peripheral edge of the lock protrusion may be engaged with the above gap, and although the connector set is not in a normal connected state, the connector set may be continued to be used as it is because it is difficult to determine from the appearance.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, an object of the present disclosure is to provide a female connector and a connector set capable of inhibiting an inner peripheral edge of a lock protrusion of a male connector from being engaged with a boundary between an engagement protrusion and an outer peripheral wall of the female connector.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect of the disclosure, a connector set includes: a male connector; and a female connector configured to connect the male connector.
