More specifically, the present application relates to an elevator safety system, an elevator system, and an elevator safety control method.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a tool for improving the walking of passengers between floors or shortening a walking distance of passengers, passenger transportation devices are very common in daily life. As an example, the most common passenger transportation devices are escalators and elevators that are usually used between floors of commercial buildings, and moving walkways that are usually used in large airports.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An elevator system typically includes one or more elevator cars that can move along an elevator hoistway. The elevator hoistway is provided with openings for connecting elevator-waiting halls of individual floors respectively, and elevator hall doors are arranged at these openings accordingly. When the elevator car runs to a corresponding floor, a car door and the hall door move in association so that the two are opened or closed simultaneously, thereby ensuring the safety of passengers during normal use of the elevator and in other situations.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to ensure the safety of the elevator system in the hall door, a switch device (such as a contact switch) is usually used to monitor its opening and closing state. For example, before and during the operation of the elevator car of the elevator system, it is necessary to ensure that the hall doors of all the floors remain closed and mechanically locked through the switch device, etc.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">At present, there exists an elevator safety chain with a switch device, which ensures that the elevator is triggered to stop running when the hall door is not normally closed, so as to prevent passengers from being accidentally pinched. However, this safety triggering process is short and sudden. When the elevator system detects that the safety chain is cut off, it may control the elevator car to stop emergently, so that the passengers are trapped in the car for a long time while waiting for rescue. Each of the aforementioned situations will affect the passenger's experience in taking the elevator.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present application aims to provide an elevator safety system, an elevator system, and an elevator safety control method to solve or at least alleviate at least some of the aforementioned technical problems.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to achieve at least one object of the present application, according to an aspect of the present application, an elevator safety system is provided, which includes a plurality of elevator safety chain sections connected in series and assigned to individual floors of an elevator, the elevator safety chain section including: a hall door switch, which is configured to detect an opening and closing state of a hall door of a current floor, and which is conducted when the hall door of the current floor is closed, and is opened when the hall door is opened;

However, those skilled in the art will readily recognize that the same principles can be equally applied to all types of elevator safety systems, elevator systems, and elevator safety control methods, in which the same or similar principles can be implemented. Any such changes do not depart from the true spirit and scope of the present application.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The current floor in this document refers to a certain floor of the elevator, which is the studied object, and each floor of the elevator can be studied as the current floor. That is, when a certain floor is the studied object, this floor will be temporarily referred to as the current floor.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The present application provides an elevator safety system and an elevator system respectively. An embodiment of an elevator system with an elevator safety system <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The elevator safety system <b>10</b> includes a plurality of elevator safety chain sections connected in series and assigned to individual floors of the elevator, and all the elevator safety chain sections together form a complete elevator safety chain of the elevator safety system. The &#x201c;plurality&#x201d; of elevator safety chain sections mentioned herein usually refer to the number of elevator safety chain sections corresponding to the number of elevator floors; of course, without emphasizing the number of elevator floors, the &#x201c;plurality&#x201d; of elevator safety chain sections mentioned herein are two or more elevator safety chain sections. Specifically, on each floor of the elevator, each elevator safety chain section includes a hall door switch, an inter-floor limit switch, a processing circuit, and a normally open switch serving as the hall door bypass switch and a first normally closed switch and a second normally closed switch serving as the limit bypass switches, and the hall door bypass switch is arranged in series with the limit bypass switches. The elevator safety system <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> further includes a top limit switch <b>102</b> placed above a top floor of the elevator and a bottom limit switch (not shown) placed under a bottom floor of the elevator. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also shows a method for introducing a power source <b>101</b> for the elevator safety chain. For example, the power source <b>101</b> may be a 110V AV or a 30V DC, etc.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The top limit switch <b>102</b> may be opened in a controlled manner when the car moves to be higher than the top floor by a first preset distance, and remains closed when the car is in other positions so as to conduct a relevant branch. In this way, if the elevator continues to move upward by more than the first preset distance after arriving at the top floor, a closing mechanism of the top limit switch <b>102</b> will be cut off under force directly (contacting) or indirectly (non-contacting), thereby cutting off the elevator safety chain section so as to cut off the entire elevator safety chain. When the elevator safety chain cannot be conducted, an elevator controller <b>140</b> in the corresponding elevator system can control the elevator car to stop running, so as to prevent the elevator car from running out of the border or continuing to run when the hall door of the top floor is not completely closed, which would otherwise cause an accident.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Similarly, the bottom limit switch (not shown) can be opened in a controlled manner when the car moves to be lower than the bottom floor by a second preset distance, and remains closed when the car is in other positions so as to conduct a relevant branch. In this way, if the elevator continues to move downward by more than the second preset distance after arriving at the bottom floor, a closing mechanism of the bottom limit switch will be cut off under force directly (contacting) or indirectly (non-contacting), thereby cutting off the elevator safety chain section so as to cut off the entire elevator safety chain. When the elevator safety chain cannot be conducted, the elevator controller <b>140</b> in the corresponding elevator system can control the elevator car to stop running, so as to prevent the elevator car from running out of the border or continuing to run when the hall door of the bottom floor is not completely closed, which would otherwise cause an accident.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The top limit switch <b>102</b> and the bottom limit switch may have the same shape or configuration as inter-floor limit switches described below, and they are described separately herein only due to the uniqueness of their arrangement positions and functions.

This layout is commonly seen in hospitals, shopping malls and other places with a large flow of people. In some examples, when there is only one hall door on each floor, there may be only one hall door switch. In other examples, if necessary, the hall door switch may also include a plurality of (two or more) switches connected in series, and the plurality of switches correspond to the plurality of (two or more) hall doors on the current floor respectively. The purpose of the serial arrangement of the hall door switches is that if any one of the hall door switches fails to be closed, the elevator safety chain cannot be conducted on this branch.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the following, the working principle of the elevator safety system according to some examples of the present disclosure will be explained by using the floor <b>120</b> as a representative example (as the current floor).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The hall door switches <b>1101</b> and <b>1102</b> of the floor <b>120</b>, which serve as opening and closing detection sensors for the two hall doors of the floor <b>120</b>, are configured to detect an opening and closing state of the two hall doors of the current floor; they are conducted when the hall doors of the current floor are closed, and they are opened when the hall doors are opened. In a case where contact switches are chosen for the hall door switches <b>1101</b> and <b>1102</b>, when the hall door is closed (a distance between the two halves of the hall door is less than a certain value at this time, e.g., 1 cm), the contact of the hall door switch will touch another pole so that the hall door switch is in a closed state.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The inter-floor limit switch <b>1103</b> on an upper side of the floor <b>120</b> is opened in a controlled manner when the car is in a preset interval between the current floor and an upper adjacent floor, the inter-floor limit switch <b>1203</b> on a lower side of the floor <b>120</b> is opened in a controlled manner when the car is in a preset interval between the current floor and a lower adjacent floor, and the inter-floor limit switch <b>1103</b> and the inter-floor limit switch <b>1203</b> are conducted when the car is in other positions. Taking the preset interval between the current floor and the lower adjacent floor as an example, it may be formed between a position a preset distance below the floor <b>120</b> and a position a preset distance above the lower adjacent floor. For example, the preset distances for forming the aforementioned preset interval may be a certain distance value between 100 mm and 300 mm. The inter-floor limit switches <b>1103</b> and <b>1203</b> may force the two poles of their switch contacts to be out of contact when the inter-floor limit switches <b>1103</b> and <b>1203</b> are pressed by a mechanical actuating structure of a certain actuating component coupled to a car body, that is, the inter-floor limit switches <b>1103</b>, <b>1203</b> are opened. Taking the inter-floor limit switch <b>1203</b> as an example, an action range of the actuating component ranges from a position a preset distance below the current floor (e.g., 100 mm) to a position a preset distance above the lower adjacent floor. It should be understood that the preset distances described in this document with the current floor or adjacent floor as the reference object are each measured by taking an alignment position of the car with the hall door of the current floor or the adjacent floor (for example, the middle position of the car coincides with the middle position of the hall door) as the reference. Other similar descriptions of positional relationships may be inferred based on this, and will not be described repeatedly; accordingly, positions of the preset intervals formed based on these preset distances can also be known. Such arrangements of the limit switches enable the corresponding inter-floor limit switch to be triggered after the car moves downward or upward by more than a preset distance from the current floor, so that the branch where the inter-floor limit switch in the elevator safety chain is located is opened. Similarly, when the car moves upward by more than the first preset distance from the top floor, the corresponding top limit switch will be triggered, so that the branch where the top limit switch in the elevator safety chain is located is opened. Similarly, when the car moves downward by more than the second preset distance from the bottom floor, the corresponding bottom limit switch will be triggered, so that the branch where the bottom limit switch in the elevator safety chain is located is opened.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The processing circuit <b>1200</b> of the floor <b>120</b> may be in the form of a micro-processing unit, a general-purpose processor, a dedicated processor, and the like.

For the convenience of description, the figure also shows extension of the path to the upper adjacent floor (the floor <b>21</b>). This configuration can ensure that when the hall door switch <b>221</b> is shielded, an adapted way to establish a path in the current floor for the elevator safety chain can also be provided. In a case where the inter-floor limit switches <b>212</b> and <b>222</b> remain closed, this adapted path can exist for a period of time.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">It should be understood that &#x201c;can be conducted&#x201d; in this document means that this configuration creates the possibility for forming a corresponding conduction path, but if there are other interference factors (for example, switch failure, etc.), it is possible that this path is not actually formed.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this document, &#x201c;can at least be conducted&#x201d; means that in addition to the above-mentioned possible paths, there may also be other paths that enable the elevator safety chain to be conducted in the current floor. For example, if the inter-floor limit switch <b>222</b> is not opened, the elevator safety chain section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> can also be conducted in the current floor via the first normally closed switch <b>223</b>, the hall door switch <b>221</b>, and the inter-floor limit switch <b>222</b> in sequence.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As can be known from the above description of the principle of the limit switch, the inter-floor limit switch <b>212</b> is opened under force when the car is in a preset interval (a first interval) from a position a preset distance below the floor <b>21</b> (e.g., when the car is in a descending state) to a position a preset distance above the floor <b>22</b> (e.g., when the car is in an ascending state). The inter-floor limit switch <b>222</b> is opened under force when the car is in a preset interval (a second interval) from a position a preset distance below the floor <b>22</b> (e.g., when the car is in a descending state) to a position a preset distance above the lower adjacent floor not shown (e.g., when the car is in an ascending state). The opening of any one of the inter-floor limit switches <b>212</b> and <b>222</b> will cause the adapted path to disappear, so that the elevator safety chain will be cut off and the elevator system will stop running.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In other words, when the car is not in the first interval or the second interval, the corresponding elevator safety chain section can exist for a period of time. Therefore, even if some of the hall door switches are shielded, the elevator system also can run for a period of time, such as at a reduced speed, and will not stop running suddenly. When the car is in the above first interval or the second interval, it means that the car is already extremely close to the hall door that is in the open state, and if the shielding of the hall door switch is caused by the failure of the hall door to close normally, then the continued running of the car in the first interval and the second interval may lead to pinching and injury to passengers who accidentally enter the hall door that fails to close normally. Therefore, according to the above configuration, if the car is in the above first interval or the second interval, the corresponding elevator safety chain section will be cut off, so that the entire elevator safety chain will be cut off and the elevator system will stop running.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition, the floor <b>22</b> includes two normally closed switches. When the hall door switch is in the abnormally opened state, theoretically, both the first normally closed switch <b>223</b> and the second normally closed switch <b>225</b> will be opened, but in actual situations, not both of them will be opened due to various unexpected factors. The purpose of setting two normally closed switches is that even if only one of the normally closed switches can be normally opened, the path passing through the two at the same time will be removed. This configuration can avoid the failure to cut off the elevator safety chain due to unexpected factors.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the processing circuits <b>1100</b>, <b>1200</b> and <b>1300</b> may be connected to a CAN interface <b>1404</b> of the elevator controller <b>140</b> of the elevator system through CAN interfaces <b>1104</b>, <b>1204</b> and <b>1304</b> respectively, so as to realize communication with the elevator controller <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the following, an interaction and control process between the processing circuits of the elevator safety system and the elevator controller of the elevator system according to some examples of the present disclosure will be explained by using the floor <b>120</b> as a representative example (as the current floor).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments of the present application, indicators used to express the abnormally opened state of the hall door switch include: the hall door switch has not received an opening instruction, and the hall door is in the open state. For example, when the hall door switches <b>1201</b> and <b>1202</b> are in the open state and this is not caused by normal opening of the hall door, the elevator controller <b>140</b> or the processing circuit <b>1200</b> can judge that the hall doors corresponding to the hall door switches <b>1201</b> and <b>1202</b> cannot be closed normally, that is, the hall door switches <b>1201</b> and <b>1202</b> are in the abnormally opened state.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the process of judging the abnormally opened state of the hall door switch, the processing circuit can either be used as a parameter collection device, or as a parameter processing device, or as both a parameter collection device and a parameter processing device.

At this time, the processing circuit serves as the parameter processing device, and the elevator controller <b>140</b> only needs to be configured to transmit to the processing circuit whether there is an on-off instruction for the hall door switches <b>1201</b> and <b>1202</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As another example, the processing circuit <b>1200</b> is further configured to receive and transmit the opening and closing states of the hall door switches <b>1201</b> and <b>1202</b>, and receive the shielding instruction for the hall door switches when the hall door switches <b>1201</b> and <b>1202</b> are in the abnormally opened state.

Secondly, the inter-floor limit switch <b>1203</b> is also arranged in parallel with the second normally closed switch <b>1207</b> of the current floor and the first normally closed switch <b>1305</b> of the lower adjacent floor in the elevator safety chain. Furthermore, the inter-floor limit switch <b>1103</b> is also arranged in parallel with the first normally closed switch <b>1205</b> of the current floor and the second normally closed switch <b>1107</b> of the upper adjacent floor in the elevator safety chain.

The introduction of the optocoupler circuit can avoid the crosstalk of the circuits on both sides of the optocoupler circuit. The other optocoupler circuits shown in the figure also have similar arrangements and effects.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some still other embodiments of the present application, the elevator safety system <b>10</b> further includes forcibly guided relays <b>1108</b>, <b>1208</b> and <b>1308</b>, etc., which are assigned to individual floors of the elevator, and which are controlled by corresponding processing circuits to achieve on-off control of the corresponding normally open switch, the first normally closed switch and the second normally closed switch. That is, one relay will control three switches at the same time, which reduces the hardware cost and also reduces the complexity of the design.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some yet other embodiments of the present application, the inter-floor limit switches are all arranged in the hoistway at the middle positions that are equidistant from the current floor and adjacent floors, whereas the top limit switch is arranged in the hoistway at a third preset distance from the top floor, and the bottom limit switch is arranged in the hoistway at a fourth preset distance from the bottom floor. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an elevator system including three floors is schematically shown. Floors <b>410</b>, <b>420</b>, and <b>430</b> respectively have corresponding floor doors. A top limit switch <b>401</b> is arranged at a position at a distance T away from the top floor (the floor <b>410</b>). An inter-floor limit switch <b>411</b> of the lower adjacent floor of the floor <b>410</b> is at a distance T from both the floor <b>410</b> and the floor <b>420</b>. Similarly, an inter-floor limit switch <b>421</b> of the lower adjacent floor of the floor <b>420</b> is also at a distance T from both the floor <b>420</b> and the floor <b>430</b>. In addition, the distance from a bottom limit switch <b>431</b> of the bottom floor (the floor <b>430</b>) to the bottom floor <b>430</b> is also T. The above even arrangement will make calibration of the car position more reasonable. For example, the first interval and the second interval described above will be symmetrical with respect to the current floor.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in some embodiments of the present application, the inter-floor limit switch <b>411</b> is squeezed and opened by an actuating push rod <b>45</b> coupled to a car <b>44</b>. It should be noted that the coupling form in the figure is schematic, and the form of the actuating push rod <b>45</b> is also schematic. According to the principle of the present disclosure, other coupling forms and other structural forms of actuating components can be designed. For example, although not shown in the figure, the actuating component can also be configured as an actuating magnetic element. When the car is in a preset interval between the current floor and the adjacent floor, the actuating magnetic element can open the inter-floor limit switch through a magnetic force. Each of these actuating components has different advantages and can be selected according to the actual application situation. For example, mechanical actuating components have better stability; and magnetic actuating components will have lower friction due to their non-contact characteristics, and thus are more suitable for high-speed elevator application scenes.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The specific structure and working process will be described in the following by taking the actuating push rod as an example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is simplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in some embodiments of the present application, the actuating push rod is symmetrical in the vertical direction with respect to the car. Specifically, in an elevator system <b>50</b>, the actuating push rod coupled to a car <b>51</b> in the illustrated manner includes three parts: an upper section <b>521</b>, a middle section <b>522</b>, and a lower section <b>523</b>. These three parts form an entirety, in which the middle section <b>522</b> is axisymmetric, and the upper section <b>521</b> and the lower section <b>523</b> are designed as mirror images.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in some other examples, the actuating push rod has an upper push rod and a lower push rod respectively coupled to the car, and the upper push rod and the lower push rod are symmetrical in the vertical direction with respect to the car. Specifically, in an elevator system <b>60</b>, the actuating push rod coupled to a car <b>61</b> in the illustrated manner includes two parts: an upper section <b>621</b> and a lower section <b>622</b>, in which the upper section <b>621</b> and the lower section <b>622</b> are designed as mirror images. The design shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> can save material compared to the corresponding example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Similarly, the actuating magnetic elements not shown are also symmetrical in the vertical direction with respect to the car. Further, they can also adopt an integrated or separate structural arrangement, and thus have corresponding technical effects, which will not be repeated herein.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to another aspect of the present application, an elevator system is also provided, which includes any of the elevator safety systems as described above and an elevator controller communicatively coupled with its processing circuit. The elevator system can prevent emergency stop of the elevator to a certain extent when the elevator hall door is not normally closed, thereby reducing the sense of panic of passengers. In addition, it can also ensure the safety of the elevator system when the elevator hall door is not normally closed, and prevent the car from pinching passengers.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the following, functions and effects that the elevator controller in the elevator system can achieve in the elevator safety control process will be explained.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">For example, in some embodiments of the present application, the elevator controller <b>140</b> is further configured to control the car to run at a speed lower than a preset speed (for example, 0.3 m/s) to the nearest floor to the car, when the hall door switch is in the abnormally opened state. For example, when it is found that the hall door switch of a certain floor is in the abnormally opened state, it may indicate that the corresponding hall door cannot be closed normally. At this time, the running of the car in the hoistway is at risk. In this case, the car can move to the nearest floor to the car at a speed lower than a normal running speed (for example, 0.5 m/s). When there are two floors close to the car at the same time, the floor in the original running direction of the car can be considered preferentially. In some examples, when the car runs to the nearest floor, the elevator controller <b>140</b> may also issue an instruction to open the hall door of the nearest floor, so as to facilitate the evacuation of the trapped person from the car.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments of the present application, the elevator controller is further configured to determine whether to issue an instruction to open the hall door of the current floor when the hall door switch is in the abnormally opened state. For example, if the car is still in the low-speed running state described above, the hall door that cannot be normally closed on the current floor should not be opened. If the car is located on the current floor and the hall door of the current floor cannot be normally closed, then the hall door of the current floor can be opened to allow the trapped persons to evacuate from the car. Specifically, for example, in some embodiments of the present application, the elevator controller <b>140</b> is further configured to send an instruction to open the hall door of the current floor when the hall door switch is in the abnormally opened state, the car is on the current floor, and the safety chain is conducted. In this case, the car has not yet left the current floor, and the trapped persons can be evacuated from the car by opening the hall door.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Another aspect of the present application provides an elevator safety control method (hereinafter referred to as control method), which can be used in the elevator system in any of the foregoing embodiments or combinations thereof, and which therefore also has corresponding technical effects. Specifically, the elevator safety control method includes the following steps: controlling the hall door bypass switch to be closed and the limit bypass switch to be opened when the hall door switch is in the abnormally opened state, so that the elevator safety chain section can be conducted in the current floor via the hall door bypass switch and the inter-floor limit switch. For example, thick lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> show a path that enables the elevator safety chain to be conducted in the current floor as described above. For the convenience of description, the figure also shows extension of the path to the upper adjacent floor (the floor <b>21</b>). This configuration can ensure that when the hall door switch <b>221</b> is shielded, an adapted way to establish a path in the current floor for the elevator safety chain can also be provided. In a case where the limit switches <b>212</b> and <b>222</b> remain closed, this adapted path can exist for a period of time.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The control method may further include the following steps: controlling the hall door bypass switch to be opened and the limit bypass switch to be closed when the hall door switch is not in the abnormally opened state, so that the elevator safety chain section can be conducted in the current floor at least via the hall door switch and the limit bypass switch in sequence. For example, thick lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> show a path that enables the elevator safety chain to be conducted in the current floor as described above. This configuration can ensure that a reliable path is established in the current floor for the elevator safety chain when the hall door switch <b>221</b> is not shielded.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some examples, the elevator safety chain is also provided with a top limit switch and a bottom limit switch. At this time, the following control steps may be further added: opening the top limit switch when the car moves to be higher than the top floor by a first preset distance, and closing the top limit switch when the car is in other positions. By configuring the top limit switch in this way, if the elevator continues to move upward by more than the first preset distance after arriving at the top floor, the closing mechanism of the top limit switch will be cut off under force, thereby cutting off the elevator safety chain. When the elevator safety chain cannot be conducted, the elevator controller in the elevator safety system can control the car to stop running, so as to prevent the car from running out of the border or continuing to run when the hall door of the top floor is not completely closed, which would otherwise cause an accident. Similarly, the bottom limit switch can also be opened when the car moves to be lower than the bottom floor by a second preset distance, and the bottom limit switch can be closed when the car is in other positions. By configuring the bottom limit switch in this way, if the elevator continues to move downward by more than the second preset distance after arriving at the bottom floor, the closing mechanism of the bottom limit switch will be cut off under force, thereby cutting off the elevator safety chain. When the elevator safety chain cannot be conducted, the elevator controller in the elevator safety system can control the car to stop running, so as to prevent the car from running out of the border or continuing to run when the hall door of the top floor is not completely closed, which would otherwise cause an accident.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some other examples, the method further includes: when the hall door switch is in the abnormally opened state, controlling the car to run to the nearest floor to the car at a speed lower than a preset speed, and controlling the hall door of the nearest floor to be opened, which reduces the discomfort of the trapped person in emergency stop and help them evacuate from the car as soon as possible.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some still other examples, the method further includes: when the hall door switch is in the abnormally opened state, the car is located on the current floor and the elevator safety chain section is conducted, determining that the car has not yet left the current floor; therefore, the hall door of the current floor can be controlled to be opened, which helps the trapped person evacuate from the car as soon as possible.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The above elevator safety control method can prevent emergency stop of the elevator to a certain extent when the elevator hall door is not normally closed, thereby reducing the sense of panic of passengers. In addition, it can also ensure the safety of the elevator system when the elevator hall door is not normally closed, and prevent the car from pinching passengers.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Described above are only specific embodiments of the present application, but the scope of protection of the present application is not limited thereto.
