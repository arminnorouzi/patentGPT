As a regulating valve, a throttle valve is employed which regulates the entrance pressure and steam quantity to the specified steam pressures and steam quantities before the blading of the steam turbine. The most commonly used regulating valves are non-pressure-relieved single-seat valves which are operated with high-pressure oil systems of 100-160 bars because of their high valve forces. For very large steam volumes, very massive and voluminous valves are employed, which are likewise operated with high-pressure oil systems or with medium-pressure oil systems of 30-50 bars.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For increasing the efficiency, it is usual to feed the steam to the turbine via several exposure sectors, usually between 2 and 6 up to a maximum of 10 sectors. The steam inflow to each sector is adjusted by its own regulating valve. As the load increases, one regulating valve after the other is opened in a steady manner, so that in any arbitrary load condition, some regulating valves are fully opened and only one is partially opened. Throttling losses therefore only occur at this one partially opened regulating valve, resulting in a favourable overall efficiency.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is known to combine the quick-closing valve and the regulating valve as a combination valve in one common valve housing. In practice, each of the two valves has its own active drive. Such combination valves have the problem of a valve structure extending over several meters, as the drives for the respective valve stem have to be arranged on different sides of the housing. In addition, pressure losses, high valve forces and in particular vibrations at the valve stem as well as leaking valve seals are often a problem during operation. Thus, vibrations at valve stems lead to damage at the stems, valve seats and valve guides. This results in steam leakage, which makes additional suctions necessary. Furthermore, pressure losses may occur due to multiple deflection of the steam in the housing.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is the object of the present invention to provide a combination valve for a steam circuit, in particular for a steam circuit of a steam turbine, which enables a compact and space-saving arrangement and a favourable fluid-mechanical design.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This object is achieved by a combination valve having the features stated in claim <b>1</b>. In claims dependent thereon, advantageous embodiments and developments of the combination valve are stated.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, the combination valve comprises a quick-closing valve and a regulating valve which are arranged in a common housing, only the regulating valve being displaceable by an active drive. The quick-closing valve, however, is passively displaceable by steam from the steam circuit, in particular main steam.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It has been found that this offers advantages regarding the size of the combination valve. By such a way of driving the two valve components, only one active drive is required for the regulating valve. An active drive for the quick-closing valve is unnecessary. The combination valve can therefore be embodied with a small footprint.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The steam-controlled quick-closing valve can be displaced in a simple manner by the steam being present at suitable control areas of the quick-closing valve body via corresponding pressure differences. For this purpose, the quick-closing valve preferably has control areas on its front side, which enables the quick-closing valve to be opened, as well as control areas on its back side, which contribute to the closing of the quick-closing valve.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this regard, the steam-controlled quick-closing valve is preferably configured such that, when the quick-closing valve is open, the steam pressure is present only at the front-side control areas, while the back-side control areas are pressure less. For closing the quick-closing valve, steam pressure is applied to both sides of the control areas. Since the front-side and back-side control areas offer approximately equally sized working areas for the steam pressure, an additional, preferably mechanical, closing component, for example a spring, is installed for the closing operation of the quick-closing valve, which closing component additionally acts on the back-side control areas when the quick-closing valve closes, in order to enable the closing operation of the quick-closing valve. Moreover, in the absence of steam pressure, the mechanical closing component can keep the quick-closing valve closed.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The mechanical closing component is preferably selected such that it does not hinder an opening of the quick-closing valve when a sufficiently high steam pressure is present at the front-side control areas and the back-side control areas are pressure less. The closing force of the closing component is coordinated such that it is smaller than the force at the closed quick-closing valve's front control areas which are exposed to steam pressure. The closing force of the mechanical closing component is less than 75%, in particular less than 50%, in particular less than 25%, in particular less than 10%, in particular less than 5%, in particular less than 1%, of the force of the steam pressure being present.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The combination valve has in particular a control component which enables the steam to be selectively directed to the at least one rear control area of the quick-closing valve. Such control components, for example valves, are significantly smaller than an active drive and can be arranged on the side or above the valve housing. The active drive of the regulating valve is preferably attached to exactly one side of the housing.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">This compactness of the combination valve allows a simple and space-saving arrangement of the combination valve in the steam circuit. Furthermore, space can be saved because the combination valve itself is built small.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The sealing of the valve stems against the atmosphere is advantageously solved in this combination valve by the quick-closing valve not having a stem but only the regulating valve having a stem directed outwards and the back-side control areas of the quick-closing valve are pressureless in the open position of the quick-closing valve. Thus, the stem seal of the regulating valve, which seals the stem against the atmosphere on one side, can also be kept pressureless on the other side during operation. Only when the steam pressure to the turbine is switched on, the stem seal of the regulating valve is briefly under static pressure, but only until the opening operation of the quick-closing valve is initiated.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, the quick-closing valve is configured with a sleeve-shaped quick-closing valve body. On the one hand, a sleeve-shaped valve body enables the valve to be shut off safely. On the other hand, such an embodiment has a uniform front-side working area for the steam. The back side of the sleeve-shaped quick-closing valve body is preferably designed as a circular area. In addition, the sleeve-shaped embodiment of the quick-closing valve body allows the possible arrangement of further components in the internal space of the quick-closing valve body.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thus, advantageously, the regulating valve can be configured with a tubular valve body and the tubular valve body of the regulating valve can be guided on the inside of the sleeve-shaped quick-closing valve body. This allows the regulating valve to be arranged, at least partly, in the internal space of the quick-closing valve. This means that the two valve bodies together require only slightly more space than one single valve body. Furthermore, the fact that the two movable valve bodies move in the same direction away from the respective valve seat allows the steam to flow in and out freely with low flow losses.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the regulating valve is embodied as a &#x201c;pressure-relieved tubular regulating valve&#x201d;. This enables a pressure-relieved actuation of the regulating valve. The tubular valve body is a tube section, it has two annular sealing areas and preferably has an inner wall to which the stem shaft, which is in connection with the drive of the regulating valve, is fastened. In addition, the inner wall preferably has bores for the pressure relief of the regulating valve. Due to the bores, only minimal pressure needs to be counteracted upon the travel of the regulating valve.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Alternatively, the regulating valve is embodied as a &#x201c;pre-stroke regulating valve&#x201d; in which the pre-stroke on the regulating valve is opened first and then the valve body.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Just as the tubular valve body of the regulating valve can advantageously be guided on the inside of the sleeve-shaped quick-closing valve body, the sleeve-shaped valve body of the quick-closing valve can in turn advantageously be guided on the outside in a guide sleeve. The guide sleeve can be a separate element in the housing, or the housing itself can be configured on the inside as a guide sleeve for the sleeve-shaped valve body of the quick-closing valve.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the combination valve allows independent switching and also closing of the two components regulating valve and quick-closing valve in the sense of two independent redundant closing elements. For example, the regulating valve can initially remain closed and the quick-closing valve can be opened. Then, the regulating valve can be opened as required to enable a passage of the steam. This also enables good regulatability of minimal steam flows.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The preferred embodiment of the combination valve with two independent redundant closing elements also makes it possible to stop the steam supply quickly and safely. For example, the steam supply through the combination valve to a steam turbine must be completely shut off within approx. 0.3 seconds in order to ensure protection of the turbine. Since both valves achieve these closing times, it is sufficient that one of the two valves closes the steam flow leakage-free. Preferably, both valves close leakage-free. In particular, the quick-closing valve closes leakage-free. The regulating valve may have a leakage flow, but the leakage flow of the regulating valve is preferably negligible low. In particular, in the event that the steam is supplied to the turbine via several exposure sectors and accordingly several combination valves are provided, the leakage flow of the regulating valve is unproblematic, since this always only directly affects the first/next opening valve in the combination valve row, in particular the regulating valve. The other valves, in particular the quick-closing valve, are first closed anyway and thus leakage-free. Compared to the prior art, the combination valve has the advantage that multiple leakage flows do not add up. This is reliably prevented with the present combination valve.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further preferably, a switchable control valve is provided for switching the quick-closing valve. For this purpose, in particular a 3/2 way valve is used. The switchable control valve serves for directing the steam to the back side of the quick-closing valve body via a line system. Such a valve has the necessary switching times to close the quick-closing valve in approx. 0.3 seconds. A switchable control valve can, moreover, be configured with relatively small and inexpensive drives.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, the control valve has a hydraulically or pneumatically embodied control drive. This enables a targeted switching of the combination valve by the control drive used. The preferred drive mechanisms of the control drive here are selected such that they do not require complex drives but can be embodied relatively small compared to the combination valve. This allows the valve including the control drive to be arranged on the side of or above the combination valve. The hydraulics or pneumatics are usually already present in the application area of such a combination valve and can be directly utilized.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The regulating valve can advantageously have a regulating valve drive embodied as a low-pressure hydraulic drive or as an electric drive. This allows targeted control of the regulating valve. In addition, the preferred drive mechanisms are simple to execute. The preferred design of the regulating valve as a pressure-relieved tubular regulating valve allows the use of low-pressure hydraulics in the range of 2 to 18 bar, in particular 4 to 16 bar, in particular 6 to 14 bar, in particular 8 to 12 bar instead of the usual high-pressure hydraulics of 60 to 200 bar for non-relieved valves, or an electric drive. The electric drive can be embodied relatively small for a pressure-relieved regulating valve, as only a small torque is required.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Advantageously, the housing of the combination valve is constructed from a housing base body and a housing cover, the housing base body being connectable to the housing cover in a force-fitting and/or form-fitting manner. This enables an uncomplicated mounting of the components and also enables a relatively uncomplicated replacement of the installed components. The housing cover here is preferably connected to the housing base body by screws. The housing cover preferably comprises exactly one side wall of the housing.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The drives of the quick-closing valve and of the regulating valve as well as the quick-closing valve itself and the regulating valve itself are preferably fastened to or guided on the housing cover. This allows easy removal of the valves and their drives by taking off the cover, making it easy to replace the components in a more suitable location, such as a workshop.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, the drives can also be removed individually when the cover is mounted. This enables an easy and quick replacement of defective drives.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">If a component is defective, the complete cover including the valve mechanisms can be replaced without requiring disassembly of the tube connection. Replacing the components by replacing the entire housing cover enables the realization of short downtimes of the combination valve. The defective housing cover can then be repaired or replaced, while the steam circuit can be further operated with the replaced cover.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The housing preferably has a steam strainer at a steam entry port, which comprises a steam deflector. This allows a partial deflection of the entering steam flow. With this type of valve, the steam flow must be directed through a 90&#xb0; angle, which can lead to flow losses. Due to the steam strainer used, the entering steam is already deflected at the steam entry port by an angle of 10&#xb0; to 80&#xb0;, in particular 25&#xb0; to 65&#xb0;, in particular 30&#xb0; to 55&#xb0;, in particular 40&#xb0; to 50&#xb0;, in particular 45&#xb0;. This partial deflection reduces the flow losses occurring in the valve by gradually deflecting the steam.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The steam strainer also enables foreign matter entrained in the steam flow to be filtered out. The foreign matter comprises, for example, welding beads or detachments from the boiler and tubing. By filtering out the entrained foreign matter, damage to the valve bodies, valve areas and turbine blades due to impact of the foreign matter is prevented. Damage to the valve bodies and the valve areas can lead to unwanted leakage flows. Damage to turbine blades can lead to a reduction in the efficiency of the turbine, although this does not necessarily result in the turbine being shut down. In extreme cases, this can lead to blade breakage, additional damage to internal parts of the turbine and even damage to the turbine housing, which can cause the turbine to come to a standstill and usually make subsequent repairs unavoidable.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The steam strainer is connected to the housing cover of the housing preferably in a detachable manner. This allows easy cleaning and replacement of the steam strainer. The steam strainer can be removed by taking off the cover together with it. The connection between steam strainer and cover, preferably embodied as a pin connection, can be detached and the steam strainer can be checked, cleaned and/or replaced. This allows easy and quick replacement of the steam strainer in case of damage or heavy soiling. Damage to the steam strainer can be caused by foreign matter entrained in the steam flow or by vibrations caused by the steam flow.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Furthermore, the steam strainer can preferably rest in a fitting guide of the housing base body in the mounted state for stabilization in order to minimize the mechanical load on the steam strainer, for example due to vibrations caused by the steam. The guides in the housing base body are preferably designed in such a way that the steam strainer is not damaged by a slight vibration in the guides. For this purpose, the guides preferably have an insert made of a soft and thus damping material.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The housing also advantageously has a diffuser at a steam exhaust port. This enables a further reduction of flow losses in the combination valve. The diffuser here advantageously serves as a sealing area for both the quick-closing valve and the regulating valve. The sealing area for the quick-closing valve is radially on the outside relative to the sealing area for the regulating valve.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferably, the diffuser has a swirl-breaking device that acts as a deflecting device for the steam flow and resolves turbulences in the steam flow. The swirl-breaking device here is made of two to twelve, in particular four to eight, in particular five to seven, in particular six swirl-breaking teeth. The swirl-breaking teeth are located at the entrance side of the diffuser and extend into the internal space of the flow channel. In this way, they can prevent or dissolve turbulences in the steam flow.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Particularly preferably, the swirl-breaking teeth of the swirl-breaking device are located between the sealing seat of the quick-closing valve and the sealing seat of the regulating valve. Thus, the swirl-breaking device can form a guide for the regulating valve. This means that in the end area of the stroke of the regulating valve, shortly before the regulating valve reaches the sealing seat at the diffuser, the guide of the swirl-breaking device engages. Preferably, the guide of the swirl breaker engages approximately up to the first third of the stroke when the regulating valve leaves the sealing seat on the diffuser, and similarly when closing, before the regulating valve reaches the sealing seat in the last third. This allows the vibrations at the regulating valve in this area to be reduced to a minimum. These vibrations are strongest when the regulating valve is opened.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The diffuser is arranged in the housing base body advantageously in a detachable manner. This allows an easy change of the diffuser in case of maintenance of the valve or damage to the diffuser, for example on the sealing areas. The diffuser here can, for example, be screwed into the housing base body or inserted and fastened by means of a pin or screw connection.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As already mentioned, the diffuser serves as a sealing area for the regulating valve and for the quick-closing valve. As these areas can be damaged by the fast-closing processes, easy replacement of the diffuser is useful and can thus minimize maintenance effort.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Here, for an easier and better check for wear and/or damage, the diffuser can be checked outside the housing. On the one hand, a check in the disassembled state allows an improved visual check of all areas of the diffuser. On the other hand, a check in the disassembled state allows the diffuser to be checked with different checking means, such as for example various types of radiographic check or surface check.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It often happens that a steam circuit runs for months or years without the need to close the quick-closing valve. It is therefore of particular importance for a steam circuit to prove that the quick-closing valve actually moves when it is suddenly needed and is not stuck. Corresponding tests are carried out during ongoing operation and must not interfere with the operation. This is not difficult in systems that have two redundant quick-closing valves arranged in parallel, because then each quick-closing valve can be closed individually for test purposes while the other is open and guarantees steam flow. However, if only one quick-closing valve is provided, for example because the redundancy is ensured by the regulating valve as in the present combination valve, so-called partial stroke tests are carried out on the quick-closing valve, which are characterized by the fact that the quick-closing valve is only moved over part of its stroke without this influencing the ongoing, adapted and reduced operation of the steam circuit. The American API 612 standard standardizes this test. In the present combination valve, the stroke range of the quick-closing valve in the partial stroke test is preferably 15%-20% of the full stroke.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For this purpose, the quick-closing valve is exposable to main steam via a separate shut-off line in such a way that it moves in its closing direction during ongoing operation of the steam circuit&#x2014;supported, for example, by the spring force of the mechanical closing component. Due to the displacement of the quick-closing valve in the closing direction, a throttle point opens, via which the main steam can escape, so that the quick-closing valve is prevented from moving further in the closing direction and instead remains in a partial stroke position. The successful partial stroke test is checked via two pressure transmitters arranged upstream and downstream of the throttle point. The two pressure transmitters confirm when the respectively indicated pressures have levelled off to a common mean pressure somewhere between the pressure in the steam entry port and the ambient pressure.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Of course, a full stroke test is much more informative because it also provides information about the valve's capability to shut off. As the steam is usually supplied to the turbine via several exposure sectors and thus several combination valves are provided, the partial stroke test of the quick-closing valve can advantageously be replaced by a common full stroke test of the quick-closing valve and the regulating valve of the respective combination valve. For this, the turbine output in the steam circuit is first reduced by adapting it to the remaining open valves, so that the combination valves can then perform the full stroke test one after the other and thus prove their suitability for an even safer stop and shut-off of the turbine.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The combination valve disclosed herein has the particular advantage that it can be used in safety circuits certified as &#x201c;SIL 3&#x201d; in accordance with IEC/EN 61511/61508. &#x201c;SIL&#x201d; stands for &#x201c;safety integrity level&#x201d; and specifies the requirements as to the reliability of safety functions of electrical and/or electronic and/or programmable electronic systems in four safety levels. SIL means reducing hazards to people, the environment and property to an acceptable level. For example, a safety circuit where only one quick-closing valve is provided in a steam circuit cannot exceed SIL 2. For SIL 3, at least the redundancy of the quick-closing valve would be required, i.e. a second upstream or downstream quick-closing valve would have to be provided, for example, so that in the event of failure of one valve, at least the other valve can still close. Two shut-off valves of the same type are referred to as homogeneous redundancy. When the two shut-off valves are of different types, i.e. when a systemic fault cannot lead to the simultaneous failure of both valves, this is called diversitary redundancy. For example, a quick-closing valve which, like the present one, is steam-controlled and a regulating valve which, on the one hand, is suitable for completely shutting off the passage and, on the other hand, is actuated e.g. electrically, can together make a safety system SIL 3-capable. The present combination valve combines such a quick-closing valve and such a regulating valve in one common housing, and the fact that both valves can open and close independently of each other qualifies the combination valve as SIL 3-capable with diversitary redundancy. As a result, this combination valve, in the case of SIL 3 requirements in safety circuits, can replace the classic quick-closing valves. It offers the particular advantage that it is small in size because both valves are combined in one housing, and that it enables the partial stroke test, which is also a mandatory requirement due to the API 612 standard. Both properties in combination in one valve, plus SIL 3 capability, represent a special technical advance.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Both the features stated in the patent claims and the features indicated in the following embodiment examples of the combination valve are each suitable, alone or in combination with each other, for developing the object further. The respective feature combinations do not represent a restriction with regard to the further development of the combination valve but are substantially merely exemplary in character.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further embodiment examples will hereinafter be explained more closely with reference to the drawings.

The spring sleeve <b>21</b><i>a, </i>supported by the spring force of the cylindrical compression spring <b>21</b>, first continues to seal the bores <b>33</b>, and via the axial groove <b>63</b> the tensioner <b>22</b> is now also completely exposed to pressure.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">After a defined and adjustable stroke, the tensioner <b>22</b> strikes against the spring sleeve <b>21</b><i>a </i>and shifts it coaxially to the longitudinal axis <b>3</b><i>a. </i>This means that the bores <b>33</b> are no longer covered by the spring sleeve <b>21</b><i>a, </i>so that the steam can escape through the bores <b>33</b>, the chamber <b>28</b>, the control line <b>27</b>, the 3/2 way valve <b>36</b> and the channel <b>38</b> into the leakage steam line <b>40</b>. This creates a balance of forces and a static pressure in the spring chamber <b>32</b>, which displaces the quick-closing valve into the partial stroke test position of about 15% to 20% of the full stroke and holds it there.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The successful partial stroke test is checked and confirmed via the two pressure transmitters PT<b>61</b> and PT<b>62</b> arranged upstream and downstream of the throttle point, respectively, by the pressure displayed in each case levelling off at a common mean pressure somewhere between the steam pressure in the steam entry port <b>55</b> and the ambient pressure. Then, the shut-off valve <b>30</b> is closed again. The pressure from the spring chamber <b>32</b> then decreases via the bores <b>33</b>, the chamber <b>28</b>, the control line <b>27</b>, the 3/2 way valve <b>36</b> and the channel <b>38</b> into the leakage steam line <b>40</b>. At the same time, the steam pressure on the complete front side of the quick-closing valve body <b>19</b> shifts the quick-closing valve <b>2</b> backwards into the spring chamber <b>32</b> until the spring sleeve <b>21</b><i>a </i>covers the bores <b>33</b> and interrupts the steam flow to the leakage steam line <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Just as in the opening process of the quick-closing valve <b>2</b>, now, here too, the damping zone is reached, and the pressure trapped in the spring chamber <b>32</b> then only slowly decreases via the gap until the tensioner <b>22</b> rests with its contact diameter D<sub>k </sub>on the sleeve <b>60</b> and seals the spring chamber <b>32</b>. The quick-closing valve <b>2</b> has now again reached the end position &#x201c;open&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a front view of the diffuser <b>49</b>.

The steam flow here is divided by the swirl-breaking teeth <b>54</b> at the border of the diffuser <b>49</b>. These divided streams thus cannot form large steam eddies and rejoin after the swirl-breaking teeth <b>54</b> to form a directed steam flow.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a second embodiment of the combination valve <b>1</b>. The second embodiment differs with respect to the first embodiment in the design and mode of operation of the regulating valve <b>3</b>. All other reference signs remain the same in their function and position as in the first embodiment example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, except for the sealing rings <b>13</b> which have been omitted here.

The sealing rings <b>13</b> are omitted, and as a result the labyrinth seal <b>12</b> now allows a small steam flow which reaches the step body <b>72</b> and ensures the function thereof. The push body <b>66</b> rests inside the tubular valve body <b>64</b> against the step <b>65</b>. The push body <b>67</b> rests against the pull body <b>66</b>. The tensioner <b>68</b> rests against the pull body <b>67</b> and secures the position of the push body <b>66</b> and of the pull body <b>67</b>.

In the closed position, the tubular valve body <b>64</b> rests against the second sealing area <b>52</b> of the diffuser <b>49</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Since such pre-stroke regulating valves have already existed since the 1960s and are described for example in Traupel, W.: &#x201c;Thermische Turbomaschinen&#x201d;, Springer-Verlag, 1982, and are known to the person skilled in the art, a detailed explanation will be dispensed with at this point. It should be clear, however, that this also applies to such pre-stroke regulating valves which have a different structure than the regulating valve shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a side view of the spring sleeve <b>21</b><i>a </i>and the tensioner <b>22</b>. The tensioner <b>22</b> is embodied with an external hexagon on one end face. The external hexagon has a flank distance which corresponds to a standardized wrench size. The surface of the external hexagon of the tensioner <b>22</b> is bulged. The bulge has a preferably line-shaped maximum in the contact diameter D<sub>k</sub>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The spring sleeve <b>21</b><i>a </i>has four axial grooves <b>63</b>. The axial grooves <b>63</b> are arranged uniformly at the circumference of the inner bore of the spring sleeve <b>21</b><i>a. </i>The tensioner <b>22</b> is arranged in the inner bore of the spring sleeve <b>21</b><i>a. </i>The tensioner <b>22</b> rests flat against the spring sleeve.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The axial grooves <b>63</b> function as flow channels and allow an equalization of pressure when the quick-closing valve is opened and closed. The design of the wrench head of the tensioner <b>22</b> as a hexagon and the number of axial grooves ensure here at least one at least partially bare flow channel, due to the geometry of the hexagon and the arrangement of the axial grooves <b>63</b> offset by 90&#xb0; to each other. Pressure differences that cannot be equalized by a flow channel could lead to errors when opening and/or closing the quick-closing valve and thus negatively influence the function of the combination valve.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-22" num="01-22"><claim-text><b>1</b>.-<b>22</b>.
