specifically, storage devices integrated with an automated product storage and recovery system.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A storage unit conventionally comprises several substantially parallelepiped-shaped racks. Such a rack comprises four vertical uprights connected together by horizontal cross-members which support shelves. The shelves define the lower portion of storage compartments. Generally, a storage compartment is a parallelepiped volume corresponding to that of a standard pallet and a forklift can access the storage compartment via a main face to deposit the palett when it is necessary to remove one of the products which is stored thereon for the preparation of an order.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The racks are generally arranged such that the main faces of the storage compartments face one another. The racks thus arranged delimit a main circulation span of the forklift which extends between two circulation avenues which distribute other spans.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The handling carriages and the space which is necessary for them to manoeuvre, obligate the circulation spans and avenues to be widely sized, which reduces the floor surface area on which storage racks can be mounted. Finally, the storage height is limited to the maximum handling height of the forklift which, when it increases, increases the wheelbase of the forklift and obligates the circulation spans and avenues to also be extended.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The object of the invention is to improve the storage and/or packing capacity of a storage unit occupying a defined floor surface area.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To this end, a method is provided for securing a first and a second upright parallel to one another, and respectively provided with a first climbing element and a second climbing element. The method comprises the following steps; the first upright being in a first mounting position:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">a) attaching a first lower connector to a first lower portion of the first upright;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">b) attaching a first upper connector to a first upper portion of the first upright;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">c) attaching a first lower end of the first climbing element to the first lower connector and a first upper end of the first climbing element to the first upper connector;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">d) adjusting a first distance separating the first lower end and the first upper end of the first climbing element to bring the first distance to a first predetermined value;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">e) immobilising the position of the first lower end and the position of the first upper end of the first climbing element relative to the first upright;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">the second upright being in a second mounting position:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">g) attaching a second connector to a second lower portion of the second upright;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">h) attaching a second upper connector to a second upper portion of the second upright;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">i) attaching a second lower end of the second climbing element to the second lower connector and a second upper end of the second climbing element to the second upper connector;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">j) adjusting a second distance separating the second lower end and the second upper end of the second climbing element to bring the second distance to the first predetermined value;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">k) immobilising the position of the second lower end and the position of the second upper end of the second climbing element relative to the second upright;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">l) positioning the first upright and the second upright such that the first climbing element and the second climbing element extend parallel to a climbing direction;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">m) adjusting the position of the first upright and the position of the second upright such that the first lower end of the first climbing element and the second lower end of the second climbing element lie in a plane substantially orthogonal to a climbing direction.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">An easy securing of the climbing elements of two uprights are thus obtained, without having to intervene on the upper part of these. Such securing is easily reproducible and allows to secure all of the uprights of one same storage unit comprising several rack elements.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The method has a particularly profitable application when the first climbing element comprises a first chain and the second climbing element comprises a second chain.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The mounting operations are

second upper portion of the second upright comprises a step h&#x2032;) of positioning the second upper connector to a second predetermined distance and step j) of adjusting a second distance separating the second lower end and the second upper end of the second climbing element to bring the second distance to the first predetermined value comprises a step j&#x2032;) of adjusting a fifth distance separating the second upper connector of the second upper end of the second climbing element to bring the fifth distance to the third predetermined value.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The installation precision of the first climbing element is improved when step c) of attaching a first lower end of the first climbing element to the first lower connector and a first upper end of the first climbing element to the first upper connector comprises a step c&#x2032;) of attaching a first profile for supporting the first climbing element to the first upright.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The operational silence of the storage unit and the vibrating urging of the uprights is improved when step c) of attaching a first lower end of the first climbing element to the first lower connector and a first upper end of the first climbing element to the first upper connector also comprises a step c&#x2033;) which follows step c&#x2032;) of attaching a first profile for supporting the first climbing element to the first upright, step c&#x2033;) comprising the placing of a first damper element between the first support profile and the first climbing element.</p><p id="p-0028"
