The wood surface is often varnished to protect it, on the one hand, and to further improve the visual appearance, on the other hand, for example, by creating a &#x201c;high-gloss finish&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To assess the quality of varnished wood surfaces, the varnished surface may be subjected to an individual visual inspection. However, it is problematic here that the visual impression that an observer receives from a glossy varnished surface is always dependent on the incident light from the surroundings, which is reflected at the surface, due to which the observer sees an image of the surroundings projected on the surface. Moreover, the visual impression is strongly dependent on the viewing direction of the observer and also on the knowledge of the observer about the design and reflectivity of the inspected object. Individual visual inspections therefore result in subjective and thus poorly comparable results.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method that assess the quality of varnished wood surfaces.

The surface can be assigned for this purpose, for example, an x direction and a y direction, which is preferably oriented orthogonally thereto, wherein the surface is represented by a plurality of value pairs (x, y) and wherein a brightness value H(x, y) is assigned to each value pair. The points of the surface represented by the value pairs (x, y) preferably lie in a plane in which the observed surface is projected. The brightness values can be ascertained, for example, with the aid of a camera having a light-sensitive sensor. In particular, the observed surface section can be illuminated by a light source, wherein a brightness value H(x, y) is measured with the aid of the camera for each value pair (x, y) and used to create the brightness map. A corresponding pixel of the camera can be assigned to each value pair (x, y) of the surface.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">The term curvature map refers to an assignment of curvature values K(x, y) to a plurality of points (x, y) of the surface to be examined. The curvature values are preferably the mean curvature of the surface at the respective point. The mean curvature is preferably given by the arithmetic mean of the two main curvatures in the respective point. The curvature map can be generated in a fundamentally known manner, for example, by means of strip deflectometry. The term &#x201c;strip deflectometry&#x201d; refers to a method in which a strip pattern is generated and oriented on a varnished surface to be examined. The reflection of the strip pattern on the varnished surface is acquired by a camera. Local irregularities present on the surface to be examined have the result that the strip pattern acquired by the camera is deformed in relation to the originally generated strip pattern. The curvature of the surface or the local alignment of the normal vectors, which are perpendicular to the surface at an observed point, can be calculated from the deformations (see, for example, &#x201c;Li, Wansong; Bothe, Thorsten; von Kopylow, Christoph; J&#xfc;ptner, Werner: High Resolution 3D Shape Measurement on specular surfaces by fringe reflection. In: Proceedings of SPIE Volume 5457, 2004, pages 411-422&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">The same camera is preferably used for the creation of the brightness map and for the creation of the curvature map.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">The term cross-correlation is to be understood according to its typical mathematical meaning. The cross-correlation can in particular describe the correlation of the two functions H(x, y) and K(x, y) in dependence on a location shift (h, k) of the functions relative to one another in the x or y direction. The cross-correlation KK (h, k) of brightness map and curvature map can be ascertained, for example, for the case in which brightness map and curvature map are given by the two discrete location functions H(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>j</sub>) and K(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>j</sub>), according to:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>KK</mi>   <mo>&#x2061;</mo>   <mo>(</mo>   <mrow>    <mi>h</mi>    <mo>,</mo>    <mi>k</mi>   </mrow>   <mo>)</mo>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mi>&#x3b1;</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mrow>    <munder>     <mo>&#x2211;</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>i</mi>      <mo>,</mo>      <mi>j</mi>     </mrow>    </munder>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <mi>H</mi>      <mo>&#x2061;</mo>      <mo>(</mo>      <mrow>       <msub>        <mi>x</mi>        <mi>i</mi>       </msub>       <mo>,</mo>       <msub>        <mi>y</mi>        <mi>j</mi>       </msub>      </mrow>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>     <mo>&#xb7;</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>K</mi>      <mo>&#x2061;</mo>      <mo>(</mo>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <msub>         <mi>x</mi>         <mi>i</mi>        </msub>        <mo>+</mo>        <mi>h</mi>       </mrow>       <mo>,</mo>       <mrow>        <msub>         <mi>y</mi>         <mi>j</mi>        </msub>        <mo>+</mo>        <mi>k</mi>       </mrow>      </mrow>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">The indices i, j denote the respective discrete x or y values here. The sums are formed, for the case in which brightness and curvature maps each have, for example, a number of n discrete x values and m discrete y values, by a double sum, in which the index i assumes the values 1 to n and the index j assumes the values 1 to m. The value &#x3b1; is a factor which enables scaling.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">The curvature map permits a statement to be made about the curvatures present on the varnished surface and thus about existing irregularities. For this purpose, for example, the measured curvature values can be averaged over the entire observed surface and a standard deviation can be calculated. A large standard deviation results if large deviations from the mean curvature are present at many points of the surface. A large standard deviation is therefore fundamentally accompanied by a poor varnish quality.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">However, it was recognized in the scope of the present disclosure that the curvature map and in particular the standard deviation do not permit a satisfactory quality assessment in many cases. In particular, it was recognized that the natural grain of wood surfaces often results in irregularities in the surface, which follow the course of the grain. This is because the grain of the wood is formed by pores which can contract or enlarge in the course of time. Trench formation or also bulging of the varnish can thus occur in the region of the pores. Such varnish flaws are referred to hereinafter as &#x201c;varnish collapse&#x201d;. It was furthermore recognized in the scope of the present disclosure that the visual impression is less strongly impaired by such a varnish collapse extending along the grain in comparison to other varnish flaws. Rather, a varnish collapse which extends along the grain is less noticeable and is perceived by an observer in many cases as less disturbing. A varnish collapse extending along a grain is therefore not included among the &#x201c;varnish flaws&#x201d; in the scope of the present disclosure. Varnish flaws in the scope of the present disclosure thus refer to irregularities and other faults in the varnished wood surface which do not represent a varnish collapse in the above-mentioned meaning.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">Since the grain of the wood is recognizable on the brightness map as a brightness curve (the pores forming the grain are typically lighter or darker than the respective surroundings), it can be established in a simple manner in the scope of the present disclosure by the ascertainment of the cross-correlation of brightness map and curvature map whether the irregularities of the surface are to be attributed to the grain of the wood or not. The proportion of the irregularities of the surface which is to be attributed to varnish flaws can be ascertained in this manner. If, for example, a large cross-correlation is found, this means that a greater proportion of the irregularities is to be attributed to the grain.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025">The method according to the present disclosure thus enables, due to the consideration of the cross-correlation, a judgment as to whether measured irregularities are caused by the grain&#x2014; and thus can have more of a tendency to be tolerated&#x2014;or whether they are actually disturbing varnish flaws. Furthermore, the method according to the present disclosure can be carried out in an automated manner and is moreover independent of the subjective assessment of an observer. It can thus be ensured in a simple and cost-effective manner that repair measures are only performed when an objectively established varnish flaw actually exists.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026">In one preferred embodiment, the measured brightness distribution is scaled to create the brightness map. This has the advantage of better comparability between various surfaces. Moreover, it is possible to prevent differences in the illumination intensity from resulting in different results in the assessment of the varnish quality.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027">The scaling preferably comprises the following steps:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0028">a) dividing the measured brightness distribution by a low-pass-filtered version of itself,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0029">b) subtracting the mean value of the brightness from the result of step a.,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0030">c) dividing the result of step b. by the standard deviation of the brightness.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0026" num="0031">Step a. is used here for the purpose of scaling locally differing brightnesses and contrasts, so that in particular those brightness maps which originate from surfaces of different types of wood are equalized with one another with respect to brightness and contrast. Moreover, the mean brightness is almost precisely at one due to the division according to step a. Due to the subtraction of the mean value and the division by the standard deviation, a brightness map is generated, the mean value of which is approximately zero and the standard deviation of which is approximately one, so that surfaces of various types of wood are optimally comparable to one another. Moreover, the following ascertainment of the cross-correlation is thus facilitated.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0032">In one preferred embodiment, the ascertainment of a cross-correlation of brightness map and curvature map comprises the following steps:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0033">a) carrying out a Fourier transform of the brightness map in the frequency space,</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0034">b) carrying out a Fourier transform of the curvature map in the frequency space,</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0035">c) multiplying the two Fourier transforms,</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0036">d) inverse Fourier transform of the result of the multiplication in step c. in the location space.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0028" num="0037">The inverse Fourier transform represents the cross-correlation in this case. It has been shown that the Fourier transforms of the brightness and curvature maps can be handled easily and the ascertainment of the cross-correlation is thus simplified. In particular, a so-called &#x201c;fast&#x201d; Fourier transform can be carried out.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0038">In one preferred embodiment, it is provided that the evaluation of the result of the cross-correlation to ascertain the proportion of the irregularities of the surface to be attributed to varnish flaws is carried out by ascertaining the absolute value of the cross-correlation in its extreme point. The extreme point can be a maximum or a minimum, since the grain on the brightness map can appear either light or dark. Moreover, the varnish collapse in the region of a grain can be formed as explained above by a bulge or by a trench.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0039">Since the brightness map, as explained above, is preferably already scaled, no further scaling of the cross-correlation is required for the mentioned evaluation. In particular, no scaling of the curvature distribution or the Fourier transform of the curvature distribution preferably takes place. This has the advantage that the absolute values of the cross-correlation in the extreme point enable an absolute statement about the extent of the varnish collapse caused by the grain, and thus a direct comparison can be performed for various observed varnished surfaces. However, it can be provided that the absolute value of the cross-correlation is divided by the geometric mean of the width and height of the curvature map of the observed surface region, to thus achieve scaling with respect to the image size (thus the size of the curvature map). If this adaptation to the image size is not carried out, the absolute value of the cross-correlation is dependent on this image size, which is undesirable for reasons of comparability.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0040">In one advantageous embodiment, it can be provided that a standard deviation of the curvature map is ascertained, wherein the standard deviation is used as a further indicator for the assessment of the varnish quality. It is preferably provided here that the curvature map is first filtered of the mean value. The mean value filtering is required in particular if the surface to be assessed has a globally curved shape, thus in particular is not formed by a planar surface. In this case, the curvature map naturally follows the global curvature profile of the surface. The mean value-filtered curvature map can be obtained, for example, in that a low-pass-filtered version of the curvature map is ascertained and subtracted from the curvature map. Low-frequency curvature changes caused by the global shape of the examined surface are removed from the curvature map in this way (thus are no longer present in the mean value-filtered curvature map) and only the higher-frequency curvature changes to be attributed to varnish irregularities remain. A large standard deviation of the mean value-filtered curvature map is typically an indicator of a poor varnish quality.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0041">Furthermore, in one preferred embodiment, a curvature threshold value can be defined and the number and/or the proportion of the points of the curvature map can be ascertained which exceed the curvature threshold value, wherein the number and/or the proportion of the points of the curvature map exceeding the curvature threshold value is used as a further indicator for the assessment of the varnish quality. If the measured curvature at a point of the curvature map exceeds the threshold value, a varnish flaw can be presumed. The number of the points exceeding the threshold value is thus also an informative indicator for the varnish quality. The ascertainment of the number and/or the proportion of the points exceeding the threshold value is preferably carried out on a mean value-filtered curvature map. It is also possible here to prevent the global curvature profile of a surface to be examined from exerting an influence on the evaluation.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows multiple brightness maps used in the scope of the method according to an aspect of the present disclosure of a section to be examined of a varnished wood surface.

The brightness maps have a plurality of pixels, wherein one grayscale value is assigned to each pixel, which represents the respective brightness.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0043">To generate the brightness map shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, the surface section represented by the brightness map was illuminated by a light source and acquired by a camera.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> shows a low-pass-filtered version of the brightness map shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>. Brightness changes at high frequency are filtered out by the low-pass filter, so that the brightness changes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> significantly slower in comparison to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> if one &#x201c;tracks&#x201d; the respective map along an imaginary line.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> shows a brightness map in which the respective brightness results by way of a division of the brightness distribution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> by the brightness distribution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>. This means that for each pixel given by a value pair (x, y), a quotient is formed from the respective brightness values. Due to this scaling, the brightness maps of various types of wood are equalized to one another with respect to their contrast and their brightness, so that better comparability exists.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a curvature map of the observed section of the varnished wood surface obtained by means of strip deflectometry. The curvature map is also a grayscale diagram, in which the respective grayscale value represents the curvature at the respective pixel. To generate the curvature map, a strip pattern was projected on the observed section and the reflection of the strip pattern was acquired by the camera. In a fundamentally known manner, a mean curvature was calculated on the basis of the deformed strip image acquired by the camera for each pixel (x, y), which is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> by a grayscale value. The number of the pixels of the curvature map corresponds to the number of the pixels (x, y) of the brightness map, moreover, the same section of the varnished wood surface is observed to create brightness map and curvature map.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0047">In contrast to the brightness map, the curvature map is not scaled. In the later evaluation of the cross-correlation, this enables a statement about the absolute extent of the varnish collapse extending along a grain and thus a direct comparison between various varnished wood surfaces.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> shows the Fourier transform of the scaled brightness map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>.

Below the grayscale diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref>, a graph <b>15</b> is shown, which shows the cross-correlation as a function of the shift in the x direction, wherein the shift in the y direction is set to zero. To the right of the grayscale diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref>, a graph <b>16</b> is shown, which shows the cross-correlation as a function of the shift in the y direction, wherein the shift in the x direction is set to zero. The location of the two graphs in the grayscale diagram is indicated by a horizontal line or by a vertical line, respectively.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0051">On the basis of the graphs <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>, a maximum of the cross-correlation at a shift of (0, 0) can be seen clearly. On the basis of the absolute value of the cross-correlation in the maximum (0, 0), a statement can be made about which proportion of the irregularities ascertained by the curvature map is to be attributed to disturbing varnish flaws (scratches, varnished faults), and which proportion is to be attributed to the existing grain. In this way, the evaluation can be carried out in an automated and objective manner.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0052">In addition to the cross-correlation ascertained as described above, further measured values can be used to assess the varnish quality. In particular, the standard deviation of the curvature can be used as a measured value on the basis of the curvature map. Moreover, a further measured value can be defined, which results from the number of those pixels, the curvature of which exceeds a defined curvature threshold value. For the ascertainment of the above-mentioned measured values, the curvature map is preferably, as explained above, filtered of the mean value, to avoid an undesired influence of the global curvature of the surface to be examined on the measured values.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0053">The measured values can be assigned a weighting, wherein a global measured value can be calculated on the basis of the measured values in consideration of the respective weighting.
