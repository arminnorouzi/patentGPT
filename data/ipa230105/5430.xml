As a minimum driving current (e.g., a current of about 10 picoamperes (pA) or less) is transmitted to the light-emitting diode ED, with the first transistor T<b>1</b> turned off, an image of black luminance is expressed. When the minimum driving current displaying a black image flows, the influence of a bypass transfer of the bypass current Ibp may be great. When a large driving current displaying an image such as a normal image or a white image flows, there may be almost no influence of the bypass current Ibp. Accordingly, when a driving current displaying a black image flows, a light-emitting current Ted of the light-emitting diode ED, which corresponds to a result of subtracting the bypass current Ibp drained through the seventh transistor T<b>7</b> from the driving current Id, may have a minimum current amount to such an extent as to accurately express a black image.
