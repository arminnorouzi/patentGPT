In a cooling mode, the temperature of the refrigerant before throttling can also be reduced, thereby improving the cooling efficiency of the evaporator. Most compressors can only compress a gaseous refrigerant. If a liquid refrigerant enters the compressor, it will cause liquid shock and damage the compressor. In order to reduce the liquid shock of the compressor, a gas-liquid separator is installed before the compressor.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a related art, a gas-liquid separator integrating heat exchange and gas-liquid separation functions is adopted. The gas-liquid separator includes an inner cylinder body, an outer cylinder body and an interlayer cavity between the inner cylinder body and the outer cylinder body. A device with gas-liquid separation function is located inside the inner cylinder body. A device with heat exchange function is located outside the inner cylinder body. The liquid refrigerant after gas-liquid separation is stored in the inner cylinder body. The refrigerant entering the interlayer cavity exchanges heat with the device with heat exchange function. In a cooling mode, the temperature of the refrigerant entering a throttling device is reduced, the cooling effect is improved, and the liquid shock phenomenon of the compressor can be further reduced. Under the condition that diameters of the inner cylinder body and the outer cylinder body remain unchanged, the structural arrangement of the heat exchange member of the heat exchange assembly will affect the distribution of the refrigerant in the interlayer cavity, thereby affecting the heat exchange effect of the device with heat exchange function. In the related art, the heat exchange members on two sides of the heat exchange tube have the same structure, so that the heat exchange capacities on the two sides of the heat exchange tube are the same. However, the requirements for the heat exchange capacity on the two sides of the heat exchange tube are different, and setting the structure of the heat exchange members on the two sides of the heat exchange tube to be the same will result in a waste of the interlayer cavity space.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the above problems existing in the related art, the present application provides a gas-liquid separator and a heat management system with different structures of heat exchange members on two sides of a heat exchange tube.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to achieve the above object, the present application adopts the following first technical solution:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">a gas-liquid separator, including: a first cylinder body, a second cylinder body, a first flow guide portion, a second flow guide portion, a gas-liquid distribution assembly and a heat exchange assembly;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">the first cylinder body being located inside the second cylinder body, the gas-liquid separator having a first cavity and a second cavity, the first cavity at least including a space inside the second cylinder body and outside the first cylinder body, the second cavity at least including a space inside the first cylinder body, the heat exchange assembly being at least partially located in the first cavity;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">the gas-liquid distribution assembly including a flow guide pipe, the first flow guide portion being fixed with the second cylinder body, the first flow guide portion having a third cavity, the flow guide pipe being fixed with the first flow guide portion, one end of the flow guide pipe communicating with the third cavity, another end of the flow guide pipe communicating with the second cavity, the third cavity communicating with the first cavity;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0010">the second flow guide portion being fixed with the second cylinder body, the first flow guide portion and the second flow guide portion being located on opposite sides of the second cylinder body;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0011">the heat exchange assembly including a heat exchange tube, a first heat exchange member and a second heat exchange member, the heat exchange tube at least partially surrounding the first cylinder body, one side of the first heat exchange member being disposed adjacent to or attached to the second cylinder body, another side of the first heat exchange member being fixed with the heat exchange tube, one side of the second heat exchange member being disposed adjacent to or attached to the first cylinder body, an other side of the second heat exchange member being fixed with the heat exchange tube, a structure of the first heat exchange member being different from a structure of the second heat exchange member.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0012">In order to achieve the above object, the present application adopts the following second technical solution:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0013">a gas-liquid separator, including: a first cylinder body, a second cylinder body, a first flow guide portion, a second flow guide portion, a gas-liquid distribution assembly and a heat exchange assembly;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0014">the second cylinder body being sleeved on an outside of the first cylinder body, the gas-liquid separator having a first cavity and a second cavity, the first cavity at least including a portion located between the second cylinder body and the first cylinder body, the second cavity at least including a portion located in the first cylinder body;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0015">the first flow guide portion and the second flow guide portion being located at opposite ends of the second cylinder body, respectively;

Different structures may be used for the first heat exchange member <b>64</b> and the second heat exchange member <b>65</b> when designing the heat exchange assembly <b>6</b>.
