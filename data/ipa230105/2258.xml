This application is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application generally refers to the treatment of contaminated water, and more particularly to the dosage by dissolution of hydrolyzable tablets for the treatment of contaminated water using ammoniacal nitrogen, arsenic, phosphorus and chlorides.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The contamination of a tributary may be due to the presence of ammoniacal nitrogen, arsenic, chlorides and/or phosphorus. Contaminants contained in the water to be treated may be reduced in various ways.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the tributary to be treated, ammoniacal nitrogen is found in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (aqueous) and NH<sub>3 </sub>(gaseous) forms; these forms are in thermodynamic equilibrium and the predominance of one relative to the other depends closely on the pH. Several technologies exist to eliminate ammoniacal nitrogen, inter alia &#x201c;stripping,&#x201d; which consists in favoring the gaseous form of ammoniacal nitrogen and releasing it; biological treatment, which requires a temperature between 25 and 30&#xb0; C.; oxidation of the ammoniacal nitrogen into nitrates (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>), a nitrogen species that can lead to the eutrophication of water areas; and chemical treatment, which is faster, but which also leads to nitrates (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Ionized ammoniacal nitrogen can also be reduced chemically. Thus, ionized ammoniacal nitrogen can be precipitated in the form of magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) complex to eliminate both the phosphate in its ortho-phosphate form and the nitrogen in its ionized ammoniacal form in the water to be treated. This solution nevertheless requires certain conditions, inter alia respect for the stoichiometry, a molar ratio Mg/P close to 0.9 and a precipitation pH close to 9.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Several methods for simultaneous precipitation of ammoniacal nitrogen and ortho-phosphate already exist, such as the solid-liquid fluidized bed methods or stirred tank methods. For example, international publication no. WO 01/19735 relates to a device and method for treating manure; international publication no. WO 95/05347 relates to an electrolytic system with a series of electrodes for treating manure; international publication no. WO 2007/009749 relates to a reactor and a method for producing MAP from manure or from exhaust containing ammonium and using magnesium; and international publication no. WO 2009/102142 relates to a treatment device combined into two steps, or treatment in an anaerobic reactor followed by a second step for MAP formation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The simultaneous precipitation of ionized ammoniacal nitrogen and ortho-phosphate can be done with magnesium addition to produce the magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) complex.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The precipitation of the ionized nitrogen in the absence of ortho-phosphate may be done with the addition of ortho-phosphate and magnesium to produce the magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) complex and/or any other precipitate capable of forming, such as ammonium carbonate with formula (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, ammonium acetate with formula CH<sub>3</sub>COONH<sub>4</sub>, ammonium oxalate with formula (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, ammonium sulfate with formula (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>and/or forms salmiac, an ammonium chloride.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Arsenic reduction has been subject to many studies, and the treatment methods used can be classified into several categories including selective adsorption methods, precipitation and co-precipitation methods, membrane methods and biological methods. The lower elimination efficiency of the As(III) relative to the As(V) requires a prior oxidation step. The precipitation of the arsenic can be done by adding ferric salts, aluminum salts, calcium salts and/or magnesium salts into the water followed by flocculation (polymer) and solid/liquid separation. The obtained precipitate is either ferric, aluminum, calcium and/or magnesium arsenate.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Several methods for reducing the phosphorus in the water exist, such as advanced decanting, aerated biological filters, filters, activated sludges, sequencing batch reactors (SBR), membrane reactors (MBR) and electrocoagulation. The precipitation of the phosphorus can be done by adding ferric salts, aluminum salts, calcium salts and/or magnesium salts into the water followed by flocculation (polymer) and solid/liquid separation. The obtained precipitate is either ferric, aluminum, calcium and/or magnesium phosphate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Chloride reduction can be done either by adsorption on activated carbon, on natural zeolites, or on ferric oxide, by reverse osmosis, by electrocoagulation, by ion exchange or by chemical treatment. Inter alia, by transformation into hypochlorite ions by oxidation and the latter are treated using ascorbic acid and/or meta-bisulfite. Chloride reduction can also be done by precipitation in the form of an apatite variant with chemical formula Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Moreover, several works have studied the influence of physicochemical parameters of the environment (pH, temperature, stirring, etc.) on the nucleation and growth of crystals of the magnesium ammonium phosphate complex, but very few have examined the role of the organic matter present in the environment. However, recent studies, conducted in the medical field to understand the formation of kidney stones, have shown the importance of the composition of the organic fraction on the formation of the crystals of the magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) complex.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Many of the cited methods have been faced with major technical and economic constraints making their in situ application difficult and restrictive, and above all, ineffective, as a sole process.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is therefore desirable to obtain simple and inexpensive methods and processes for separating contaminants in wastewater, such as mining water, while obtaining effective contaminant reduction.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one aspect, the invention relates to the use of a tablet for treating water laden with a contaminant, said tablet comprising a precipitating agent and being solid and hydrolyzable, and wherein said contaminant is ammoniacal nitrogen.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect, the invention relates to a method for using a tablet for treating water laden with a contaminant, said tablet comprising a precipitating agent and being solid and hydrolyzable, and wherein said contaminant is ammoniacal nitrogen.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another aspect, the disclosure relates to a tablet comprising at least one precipitating agent alone or in combination with an agglomerating agent, said tablet being in solid and hydrolyzable form.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another aspect, the disclosure relates to the use of the tablet described herein to treat water laden with a contaminant.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another aspect, the invention relates to a method for using a tablet described herein, to treat the water laden with a contaminant, wherein the contaminant is chosen from ammoniacal nitrogen, arsenic, phosphorus, chloride and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another aspect, the disclosure relates to a method for manufacturing a tablet for treating water laden with a contaminant, said method comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0021">mixing an active ingredient, chosen from a precipitating agent alone or in combination with an agglomerating agent, and optionally a nonactive ingredient, according to predetermined weights;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0022">homogenizing the mixture;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0023">compressing the mixture to obtain said tablet;

The control of the dosage is related to the hardness of the tablet, the nature of the contaminated water, the active and nonactive ingredients and the hydraulic turbulence (turbulent flow).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0073">It is also understood that the dosage of the active ingredients contained in the tablet is determined by the dissolution time of the tablet, the quantity of tablets placed in contact with the contaminated water, the turbulence and the conditions of the environment (for example temperature, pH, matter in suspension).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0074">The term &#x201c;tablet&#x201d; refers to a hydrolyzable solid with a base of a chemical formulation that comprises at least one active ingredient, either a combination of ingredient <b>1</b> (precipitating agent) and ingredient <b>2</b> (precipitating agent and/or agglomerating agent), or ingredient <b>1</b> alone, or ingredient <b>2</b> alone. The tablet is produced for example by mixing the active ingredients in solid form and the nonactive ingredients, respecting the weights of the formulation.
