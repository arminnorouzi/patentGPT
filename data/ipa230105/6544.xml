DC-DC converters may be used in a wide variety of applications, including portable electronic devices (such as cellular telephones, laptop computers, etc.) or automotive applications, for example, where a DC input voltage (from a battery, for example) is converted to a DC output voltage to power circuits. In some applications, multiple DC output voltages are needed for different circuits of a single device. Additionally, some applications have multiple DC input voltages, so the DC-DC converter may need to support operation with different DC input voltages.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Traditional DC-DC converters use analog control circuitry due to the control circuitry's simple implementation and efficiency. However, advancements in digital technology have led to digitally controlled DC-DC converters that offer high-speed operation with low power consumption.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a high-level view of a prior art digitally controlled DC-DC converter <b>100</b>. DC-DC converter <b>100</b> includes a digital pulse width modulator (DPWM) <b>105</b> that generates a stream of variable width pulses that drives a power stage of DC-DC converter <b>100</b> in order to obtain the desired DC output voltage. DPWM <b>105</b> changes the pulse widths of the pulses in the stream of variable width pulses to achieve the desired DC output voltage. The stream of variable width pulses is amplified by a power switching circuit no, while a filter <b>115</b> averages the amplified stream of variable width pulses to produce the DC output voltage V<sub>OUT</sub>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">An analog to digital converter (ADC) <b>120</b> converts a difference (an error) between the DC output voltage V<sub>OUT </sub>and the desired DC output voltage, and a compensator <b>125</b> generates adjustments (e.g., adjustments to the pulse widths) to the stream of variable width pulses to reduce the difference between the DC output voltage V<sub>OUT </sub>and the desired DC output voltage. Adjustments to the stream of variable width pulses may include changing pulse widths, the duration of the on and off periods of each pulse in the stream of variable width pulses, and so on. As an example, increasing the pulse width of a pulse will increase the DC output voltage V<sub>OUT</sub>, while decreasing the on period of a pulse will decrease the DC output voltage V<sub>OUT</sub>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a detailed view of a prior art DPWM <b>105</b>. DPWM <b>105</b> utilizes a hybrid technique for generating the stream of variable width pulses. DPWM <b>105</b> generates a stream of pulses with pulse widths that can adjusted. The discussion presented herein focuses on a single pulse to help prevent confusion. This single pulse will be referred to as a first pulse having a first pulse width. DPWM <b>105</b> generates a first pulse width that is generally close to the desired pulse width and then fine tunes the pulse width to more accurately match the desired pulse width. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, DPWM <b>105</b> includes a logic control circuit <b>205</b>, a coarse pulse width adjust circuit <b>210</b>, and a fine pulse width adjust circuit <b>212</b>. Logic control circuit <b>205</b> is configured to output a binary value based on the DC input voltage V<sub>IN</sub>, the binary value is also based on an error sign and an error magnitude (both produced by compensator <b>125</b>, for example). The binary value produced by logic control circuit <b>205</b> corresponds to a pulse width of individual pulses of the stream of variable width pulses, which may be based on the DC input voltage V<sub>IN</sub>, as well as error values generated by compensator <b>125</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Coarse pulse width adjust circuit <b>210</b> generates the first pulse width of the pulse, and includes a counter <b>214</b> and a digital comparator <b>216</b>. Counter <b>214</b> is configured to increment (or decrement) based on a clock signal of DC-DC converter <b>100</b>, and comparator <b>216</b> compares an output of counter <b>214</b> with a specified bit (or bits) of the binary value produced by logic control circuit <b>205</b>, with the specified bit corresponding to a falling edge of an individual pulse of the stream of variable width pulses. In general, the time between when counter <b>214</b> commences counting and the falling edge corresponds to the first pulse width of the pulse. As an example, the specified bit is a most significant bit (MSB) of the binary value produced by logic control circuit <b>205</b>. Coarse pulse width adjust circuit <b>210</b> may operates as follows:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0029">Rising edge of an individual pulse occurs when counter <b>214</b> commences, e.g., when counter <b>214</b> is reset (to zero, for example).

Fine pulse width adjust circuit <b>212</b> performs fine tuning on the first pulse width, and includes a digital delay line (DDL) <b>218</b>, a multiplexer <b>220</b>, and a register <b>222</b>. DDL <b>218</b> introduces delays to the rising and falling edges of the individual pulses produced by coarse pulse width adjust circuit <b>210</b>, allowing fine adjustments to the pulse width of the individual pulses. Fine pulse width adjust circuit <b>212</b> can introduce the same delay or different delays to the rising and falling edges of a single pulse. DDL <b>218</b> is implemented as a linear sequence of buffers, with each buffer introducing a delay proportional to the propagation delay of the buffer. Multiplexer <b>220</b> has multiple inputs with each input coupled to a buffer output of DDL <b>218</b>. Multiplexer <b>220</b> selects a particular delayed rising or falling edge of the individual pulse based on the binary value produced by logic control circuit <b>205</b>. The selection of multiplexer <b>220</b> is based on a least significant bit (LSB) of the binary value generated by logic control circuit <b>205</b>. Register <b>222</b>, which is implemented using S-R latches, for example, is set (outputting a high value) when counter <b>214</b> is reset and is reset (outputting a low value) when multiplexer <b>220</b> outputs a high value (which corresponds to a time that is a sum of the time of the falling edge produced by coarse pulse width adjust circuit <b>210</b> and the time delay introduced by DDL <b>218</b>) resetting register <b>222</b>. Hence, the pulse width of the individual pulse is a sum of the pulse width of the pulse generated by coarse pulse width adjust circuit <b>210</b> (COARSE T<sub>ON</sub>) and delay imparted upon the individual pulse by fine pulse width adjust circuit <b>212</b> (FINE T<sub>ON</sub>).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates a detailed view of a pulse <b>230</b> output by coarse pulse width adjust circuit <b>210</b>. Pulse <b>230</b> is an individual pulse of the stream of variable pulse pulses. Pulse <b>230</b> has a rising edge <b>235</b> that corresponds to when counter <b>214</b> is reset (trace <b>237</b> represents the value of counter <b>214</b>), which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> as occurring at time <b>239</b>. Pulse <b>230</b> also has a falling edge <b>241</b> located at time <b>243</b>, when the specified bit of counter <b>214</b> is equal to the specified bit of the binary value produced by logic control circuit <b>205</b>. Pulse <b>230</b> has a pulse width equal to COARSE T<sub>ON</sub>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates a detailed view of pulse <b>230</b> delayed by DDL <b>218</b> of fine pulse width adjust circuit <b>212</b>. Pulse <b>230</b> (output of comparator <b>218</b> of coarse pulse width adjust circuit <b>210</b>) is provided to DDL <b>218</b>. As discussed previously, DDL <b>218</b> comprises a linear sequence of delay elements (e.g., buffers), with each delay element introducing a delay proportional to the propagation delay of the delay element. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, a time <b>250</b> corresponds to a delay introduced by a first delay element of DDL <b>218</b>, a time <b>252</b> corresponds to a delay introduced by a second delay element of DDL <b>218</b>, a time <b>254</b> corresponds to a delay introduced by a third delay element of DDL <b>218</b>, a time <b>256</b> corresponds to a delay introduced by a fourth delay element of DDL <b>218</b>, and so on. Pulse <b>258</b> illustrates pulse <b>230</b> delayed by the first four delay elements of DDL <b>218</b>. The delay introduced by the delay elements is equal to N*T<sub>CLK</sub>=FINE T<sub>ON</sub>, where N is the number of delay elements and T<sub>CLK </sub>is the switching period of the clock of DC-DC converter <b>100</b>. Hence, it is possible to increase the pulse width of pulse <b>230</b> by utilizing the rising edge of pulse <b>230</b> and a falling edge of a delayed pulse (e.g., pulse <b>258</b>) to produce a pulse with pulse width approximately equal to COARSE T<sub>ON</sub>+N*T<sub>CLK</sub>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035">An issue that exists with the prior art DC-DC converter <b>100</b> is the power consumption associated with the circuitry providing the fine pulse width control, e.g., fine pulse width adjust circuit <b>212</b>. Individually, each delay element in the linear sequence of delay elements has relatively small power consumption. However, in situations where there may be several hundred delay elements (or more) in the linear sequence of delay elements, the total power consumption may be high. Furthermore, the linear sequence of delay elements is continually consuming power, even in situations where there is no need to adjust the pulse width.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0036">For discussion purposes, consider a situation where the prior art DC-DC converter wo is a buck converter with the following parameters, which are determined from the requirements for the DC-DC converter:</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037">f<sub>SW</sub>=switching frequency;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038">V<sub>IN</sub>=input voltage;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0039">V<sub>OUT</sub>=output voltage; and</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040">&#x394;V<sub>OUT</sub>=maximum change in the output voltage.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0000">While f<sub>CLK </sub>(the system clock frequency) directly depends on</p><p id="p-0040" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>n=V</i><sub>IN</sub><i>/&#x394;V</i><sub>OUT</sub>.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0041" num="0041">With consideration being given to the fact that V<sub>IN </sub>may cover a wide range of values, there is a tradeoff between the precision of DC-DC converter wo and the power consumption of DC-DC converter <b>100</b>, where the precision of DC-DC converter <b>100</b> is a measure of how well the output voltage of DC-DC converter wo matches up to the expected output voltage of DC-DC converter <b>100</b>.

In such a situation, it may be necessary for the DC-DC converter to repeat operations <b>800</b> to potentially adapt the precision of the DC-DC converter should the duty cycle, the setpoint, or both the duty cycle and the setpoint change.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0087">For illustrative purposes, consider an example DC-DC converter operating with a 50 MHz system clock and a DDL with 128 delay elements. Using a commonly available 180 nm process technology, each delay element may consume about 6.03 uA each. Therefore, the entire DDL will consume 6.03 uA*128&#x2dc;772 uA. Hence, if the full precision of the DC-DC converter is not required, operating without the DDL would save approximately 772 uA. Additional power reduction may be achieved if the charge pump (e.g., charge pump <b>407</b>) is also switched off.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0088">Example embodiments of the invention are summarized here.
