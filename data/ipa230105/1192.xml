TTFields are FDA approved for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), and may be delivered, for example, via the Optune&#x2122; system. Optune&#x2122; includes a field generator and two pairs of transducer arrays (i.e., electrode arrays) that are placed on a patient's shaved head. One pair of electrodes is positioned to the left and right of the tumor, and the other pair of electrodes is positioned anterior and posterior to the tumor. In the preclinical setting, TTFields can be applied in vitro using, for example, the Inovitro&#x2122; TTFields lab bench system.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">TTFields therapy is an approved mono-treatment for recurrent glioblastoma, and an approved combination therapy with chemotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma and unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma patients.

Thus, for example, the sub-group of A-E, B-F, and C-E are specifically contemplated and should be considered disclosed from disclosure of A, B, and C; D, E, and F; and the example combination A-D. This concept applies to all aspects of this application including, but not limited to, steps in methods of making and using the disclosed compositions. Thus, if there are a variety of additional steps that can be performed it is understood that each of these additional steps can be performed with any specific embodiment or combination of embodiments of the disclosed methods, and that each such combination is specifically contemplated and should be considered disclosed.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">A. DEFINITIONS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is understood that the disclosed method and compositions are not limited to the particular methodology, protocols, and reagents described as these may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention which will be limited only by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to &#x201c;a JNK inhibitor&#x201d; or &#x201c;an ERK inhibitor&#x201d; includes a plurality of such JNK or ERK inhibitors, reference to &#x201c;the cancer cell&#x201d; is a reference to one or more cancer cells and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used herein, an &#x201c;alternating electric field&#x201d; or &#x201c;alternating electric fields&#x201d; refers to a very-low-intensity, directional, intermediate-frequency alternating electrical fields delivered to a subject, a sample obtained from a subject or to a specific location within a subject or patient (e.g. a target site). In some aspects, the alternating electrical field can be in a single direction or multiple directional. In some aspects, alternating electric fields can be delivered through two pairs of transducer arrays that generate perpendicular fields within the treated heart. For example, for the Optune&#x2122; system (an alternating electric fields delivery system) one pair of electrodes is located to the left and right (LR) of the heart, and the other pair of electrodes is located anterior and posterior (AP) to the heart. Cycling the field between these two directions (i.e., LR and AP) ensures that a maximal range of cell orientations is targeted. In some aspects, an alternating electric field can be referred to as Tumor Treating Field (TTF).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In-vivo and in-vitro studies show that the efficacy of alternating electric fields therapy increases as the intensity of the electrical field increases. Therefore, optimizing array placement on the area of a patient's tumor to increase the intensity in the desired region of the tumor can be performed with the Optune system. Array placement optimization may be performed by &#x201c;rule of thumb&#x201d; (e.g., placing the arrays on the tumor as close to the desired region of the target site (e.g. cancer cells) as possible), measurements describing the geometry of the patient's tumor, tumor dimensions. Measurements used as input may be derived from imaging data. Imaging data is intended to include any type of visual data, such as for example, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) image data, x-ray computed tomography (x-ray CT) data, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, positron emission tomography (PET) data, data that can be captured by an optical instrument (e.g., a photographic camera, a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, an infrared camera, etc.), and the like. In certain implementations, image data may include 3D data obtained from or generated by a 3D scanner (e.g., point cloud data). Optimization can rely on an understanding of how the electrical field distributes within the head as a function of the positions of the array and, in some aspects, take account for variations in the electrical property distributions within the heads of different patients.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; refers to the target of administration, e.g. an animal. Thus, the subject of the disclosed methods can be a vertebrate, such as a mammal. For example, the subject can be a human. The term does not denote a particular age or sex. Subject can be used interchangeably with &#x201c;individual&#x201d; or &#x201c;patient.&#x201d; For example, the subject of administration can mean the recipient of the alternating electrical field.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">By &#x201c;treat&#x201d; is meant to administer or apply a therapeutic, such as alternating electric fields, to a subject, such as a human or other mammal (for example, an animal model), that has cancer or has an increased susceptibility for developing cancer, in order to prevent or delay a worsening of the effects of the cancer, or to partially or fully reverse the effects of the cancer (glioblastoma, ovarian, or lung metastatic carcinoma).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">By &#x201c;prevent&#x201d; is meant to minimize the chance that a subject who has an increased susceptibility for developing cancer will develop cancer.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;administering&#x201d; and &#x201c;administration&#x201d; refer to any method of providing a therapeutic, such as an IGFR1 inhibitor, JNK inhibitor, RPS6 inhibitor or ERK inhibitor to a subject. Such methods are well known to those skilled in the art and include, but are not limited to: oral administration, transdermal administration, administration by inhalation, nasal administration, topical administration, intravaginal administration, ophthalmic administration, intraaural administration, intracerebral administration, rectal administration, sublingual administration, buccal administration, and parenteral administration, including injectable such as intravenous administration, intra-arterial administration, intramuscular administration, and subcutaneous administration. Administration can be continuous or intermittent. In various aspects, a preparation can be administered therapeutically; that is, administered to treat an existing disease or condition. In further various aspects, a preparation can be administered prophylactically; that is, administered for prevention of a disease or condition. In an aspect, the skilled person can determine an efficacious dose, an efficacious schedule, or an efficacious route of administration so as to treat a subject. In some aspects, administering comprises exposing. Thus, in some aspects, exposing a cancer cell to alternating electrical fields means administering alternating electrical fields to the cancer cell.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">&#x201c;Optional&#x201d; or &#x201c;optionally&#x201d; means that the subsequently described event, circumstance, or material may or may not occur or be present, and that the description includes instances where the event, circumstance, or material occurs or is present and instances where it does not occur or is not present.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Ranges may be expressed herein as from &#x201c;about&#x201d; one particular value, and/or to &#x201c;about&#x201d; another particular value.

METHODS OF INCREASING SENSITIVITY</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some aspects, alternating electric fields can increase expression of certain genes. For example, application of an alternating electric fields to a cell or subject can increase expression of genes such as IGF1R, JNK, RPS6, and ERK in the cell or subject.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor is a protein found on the surface of human cells. It is a transmembrane receptor that is activated by a hormone called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and by a related hormone called IGF-2. It belongs to the large class of tyrosine kinase receptors. This receptor mediates the effects of IGF-1, which is a polypeptide protein hormone similar in molecular structure to insulin. IGF-1 plays an important role in growth and continues to have anabolic effects in adults&#x2014;meaning that it can induce hypertrophy of skeletal muscle and other target tissues. Mice lacking the IGF-1 receptor die late in development, and show a dramatic reduction in body mass. The IGF-1R is implicated in several cancers, including breast, prostate, and lung cancers. In some instances, its anti-apoptotic properties allow cancerous cells to resist the cytotoxic properties of chemotherapeutic drugs or radiotherapy. In breast cancer, where EGFR inhibitors such as erlotinib are being used to inhibit the EGFR signaling pathway, IGF-1R confers resistance by forming one half of a heterodimer (see the description of EGFR signal transduction in the erlotinib page), allowing EGFR signaling to resume in the presence of a suitable inhibitor. This process is referred to as crosstalk between EGFR and IGF-1R. It is further implicated in breast cancer by increasing the metastatic potential of the original tumor by conferring the ability to promote vascularization.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Increased levels of the IGF-IR are expressed in the majority of primary and metastatic prostate cancer patient tumors. Evidence suggests that IGF-IR signaling is required for survival and growth when prostate cancer cells progress to androgen independence. In addition, when immortalized prostate cancer cells mimicking advanced disease are treated with the IGF-1R ligand, IGF-1, the cells become more motile. Members of the IGF receptor family and their ligands also seem to be involved in the carcinogenesis of mammary tumors of dogs. IGF1R is amplified in several cancer types based on analysis of TCGA data, and gene amplification could be one mechanism for overexpression of IGF in cancer.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), were originally identified as kinases that bind and phosphorylate c-Jun on Ser-63 and Ser-73 within its transcriptional activation domain. They belong to the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, and are responsive to stress stimuli, such as cytokines, ultraviolet irradiation, heat shock, and osmotic shock. They also play a role in T cell differentiation and the cellular apoptosis pathway. Activation occurs through a dual phosphorylation of threonine (Thr) and tyrosine (Tyr) residues within a Thr-Pro-Tyr motif located in kinase subdomain VIII. Activation is carried out by two MAP kinase kinases, MKK4 and MKK7, and JNK can be inactivated by Ser/Thr and Tyr protein phosphatases. It has been suggested that this signaling pathway contributes to inflammatory responses in mammals and insects.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">JNK, by phosphorylation, modifies the activity of numerous proteins that reside at the mitochondria or act in the nucleus. Downstream molecules that are activated by JNK include c-Jun, ATF2, ELK1, SMAD4, p53 and HSF1. The downstream molecules that are inhibited by JNK activation include NFAT4, NFATC1 and STAT3. By activating and inhibiting other small molecules in this way, JNK activity regulates several important cellular functions including cell growth, differentiation, survival and apoptosis. JNK activation is involved in tumorigenesis of several cancer types.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6 or eS6) is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit and is therefore involved in translation. Mouse model studies have shown that phosphorylation of eS6 is involved in the regulation of cell size, cell proliferation, and glucose homeostasis.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) or classical MAP kinases are widely expressed protein kinase intracellular signaling molecules that are involved in functions including the regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells. Many different stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, virus infection, ligands for heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors, transforming agents, and carcinogens, activate the ERK pathway. Disruption of the ERK pathway is common in cancers, especially Ras, c-Raf, and receptors such as HER2. ERK can also activate pro-survival pathways in tumors.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Activation of the ERK1/2 pathway by aberrant RAS/RAF signaling, DNA damage, and oxidative stress leads to cellular senescence. Low doses of DNA damage resulting from cancer therapy cause ERK1/2 to induce senescence, whereas higher doses of DNA damage fail to activate ERK1/2, and thus induce cell death by apoptosis.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As provided herein, decreasing or inhibiting expression of one or more of IGF1R, JNK, RPS6, and ERK can allow for prolonged use or application of alternating electric fields to a cell or subject or can allow for increased frequency or field strength applied to a cell or subject.
