in an IP network are assigned for every network. Thus, a communication terminal to which a global IP address has been assigned cannot move to another network while holding the same IP address. In the case where a communication terminal moves to another network, a global IP address that is managed by the network that the communication terminal is moving to needs to be assigned to the communication terminal.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">On the other hand, there are cases where it is desired to always assign the same IP addresses to communication terminals in upper layer applications and services, and to permanently perform communication to the same IP addresses for communication continuity and the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional technologies that have been developed for this purpose include IP Mobility Support for IPv4 (Mobile IP) and the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) (NPL 1).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Non Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">[NPL 1] The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) [Online], available at: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6830 (accessed: Dec. 11, 2019).</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order for communication terminals to move networks while holding the same IP address, it is necessary to use a technology such as the abovementioned LISP, or to assign a global IP address fixedly to every communication terminal and allow connectivity over the network by utilizing a routing protocol such as BGP to advertise the global IP address held by a communication terminal to the network to which the communication terminal is connected to be propagated throughout the entire network.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, with both the LISP and path advertisement methods, the information of all the mobile communication terminals must be held by each of devices such as routers and the like. The number of mobile communication terminals is huge, and thus there is a problem in that the amount of data that must be held by each device is huge and it is impossible to hold all the data.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the case of path advertisement in particular, the routing table normally reduces the data amount by advertising IP addresses in an aggregated manner for every organization, and thus when IP addresses are advertised on a network for every mobile communication terminal, the routing table becomes huge due to being unable to aggregate the IP addresses.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has been made in view of the above points, and an object of the invention is to provide a technology that enables IP communication from a communication terminal to a mobile communication terminal to be performed, without holding a huge amount of data in each device on the network.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the disclosed technology, a communication device for use in a system including a database storing a unique identifier and position information for every mobile communication terminal includes an acquisition unit configured to acquire, based on a unique identifier of a mobile communication terminal serving as a communication destination, position information of the mobile communication terminal serving as the communication destination from the database, and to acquire an IP address of a router accommodating the mobile communication terminal serving as the communication destination, based on the acquired position information, and a communication unit configured to transmit a packet having the IP address in a header.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Effects of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the disclosed technology, a technology is provided that enables IP communication from a communication terminal to a mobile communication terminal to be performed, without holding a huge amount of data in each device on the network.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a system configuration diagram in a first embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram for describing an outline of operations of the system.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a configuration diagram of a mobile communication terminal.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a configuration diagram of a communication terminal.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram showing the structure of a table stored in a mobile terminal position information DB.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a configuration diagram of an accommodating router specification device.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram showing the structure of a table stored in a router accommodation range DB.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram for describing operations in the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a configuration diagram of a router in a second embodiment.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a diagram for describing operations in the second embodiment.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a diagram for describing operations in a third embodiment.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a diagram for describing operations in a fourth embodiment.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a diagram showing an example hardware configuration.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.

The communication terminal performs encapsulation by further attaching an IP header whose destination is the IP address of the accommodating router to the original IP packet, and transmits the IP packet to which IP header is attached. The accommodating router removes the attached IP header and forwards the packet addressed to the destination IP address of the original IP packet.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The processing for encapsulating IP packets may be performed by the router. IP packet encapsulation by the communication terminal is thereby unnecessary. IPv6 Segment Routing (SRv6) may be used as the means of forwarding IP packets. The processing for removing the attached IP header in the accommodating router is thereby unnecessary.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Also, the processing for attaching an SR header to IP packets may be performed by the router.
