The air that has moved to the second space R<b>2</b> is blown out to the target space S<b>1</b> from the blowout port <b>54</b> of the panel <b>51</b> by the first fan <b>43</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Therefore, in the present embodiment, an inner space of the introduction connection pipe <b>52</b>, the first space R<b>1</b>, the pre-heater space <b>41</b><i>f</i><b>1</b>, the post-heater space <b>41</b><i>f</i><b>2</b>, and the second space R<b>2</b> constitute the first air path P<b>1</b> through which air flows from the intake port <b>55</b> to the blow-out port <b>54</b>. The third area A<b>3</b> and the second area A<b>2</b> of the adsorption member <b>41</b><i>a</i>, the heater <b>42</b>, and the first fan <b>43</b> are disposed in a midway of the first air path P<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the first air path P<b>1</b>, the air before being heated by the heater <b>42</b> passes through the third area A<b>3</b> of the adsorption member <b>41</b><i>a </i>to preliminarily cool the adsorption member <b>41</b><i>a</i>. The adsorption member <b>41</b><i>a </i>releases moisture to the air by passage of the air heated by the heater <b>42</b> through the second area A<b>2</b> of the adsorption member <b>41</b><i>a</i>. As a result, the air passing through the second area A<b>2</b> of the adsorption member <b>41</b><i>a </i>is humidified.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">During the humidifying operation, both the air flowing through the first air path P<b>1</b> and the air flowing through the second air path P<b>2</b> pass through the same space, namely, the first space R<b>1</b>. However, a partitioning wall for distributing the air flowing through the first air path P<b>1</b> and the second air path P<b>2</b> is not provided in the first space R<b>1</b>. This owes to the fact that difference in sucking force of air is generated between the second fan <b>44</b> and the first fan <b>43</b> because the second fan <b>44</b> is driven with a larger air volume than the first fan <b>43</b>, and the air is distributed into the first air path P<b>1</b> and the second air path P<b>2</b> by the difference in sucking force. Since both the air flowing through the first air path P<b>1</b> and the air flowing through the second air path P<b>2</b> pass through the same space, namely the first space R<b>1</b>, it is possible to simplify the structure in the housing body <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">When the first fan <b>43</b> and the second fan <b>44</b> arc actuated during the ventilation operation, outdoor air flows through the first air path P<b>1</b> and the second air path P<b>2</b> similarly to the humidifying operation. However, since the moisture adsorption rotor <b>41</b> and the heater <b>42</b> are not driven, the air flowing through the first air path Pi is released from the blow-out port <b>54</b> of the panel <b>51</b> into the target space S<b>1</b> without being humidified by the adsorption member <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the moisture adsorption rotor <b>41</b>. Not only the first fan <b>43</b> but also the second fan <b>44</b> is driven during the ventilation operation because it can be difficult to drawing outdoor air in via the introduction duct <b>48</b> by driving only the first fan <b>43</b> because the first fan <b>43</b> generates less air volume of air flow than the second fan <b>44</b>. Air volume control of first fan <b>43</b> and second fan <b>44</b></p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The first fan <b>43</b> and the second fan <b>44</b> each are controlled by the controller <b>46</b> to have such an operation frequency (number of rotations) that generates an air flow of a predetermined air volume. The air volume by the first fan <b>43</b> and the air volume by the second fan <b>44</b> are set, for example, at a ratio of 1:5.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, when the introduction duct <b>48</b> connected with the introduction connection pipe <b>52</b> is long, it is necessary to increase the operation frequencies of the first fan <b>43</b> and the second fan <b>44</b> so as to draw outdoor air into the housing <b>47</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Therefore, the first fan <b>43</b> and the second fan <b>44</b> each are operated at an appropriate operation frequency by the controller <b>46</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">As the operation frequency of the second first <b>44</b> is increased, the air volume of the air flowing through the seventh space R<b>7</b>, and the air volume of the air flowing through the fourth space R<b>4</b> also increase. The air flowing through the seventh space R<b>7</b> is used merely for detecting temperature and humidity of the target space Si, and the air flowing through the fourth space R<b>4</b> is used merely for cooling the heat generating component, and both of these airs are not used for humidifying air, and hence a loss for humidification increases as the air volume increases. Therefore, in the present embodiment, by adjusting an opening degree of the opening (junction port) <b>68</b><i>a </i>connecting the seventh space R<b>7</b> and the sixth space R<b>6</b>, and an opening degree of the opening (junction port) <b>66</b><i>a </i>connecting the fourth space R<b>4</b> and the sixth space R<b>6</b> respectively with the adjustment plates <b>68</b><i>b </i>and <b>66</b><i>b</i>, it is possible to suppress the increase in air volume of the air flowing through the seventh space R<b>7</b> and the fourth space R<b>4</b> even when the operation frequency of the second fan <b>44</b> is increased.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Other Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The fourth air path P<b>4</b> for cooling the heat sink <b>84</b> may be joined with the first air path P<b>1</b> rather than with the second air path P<b>2</b>, and may be blown out to the target space Si from the blow-out port <b>54</b>.

When the heat generating component is cooled by using the air introduced into the housing from the outside, the heat generating component can be cooled efficiently. However, if heated air after cooling the heat generating component passes through the humidity control member, humidification performance may be adversely affected. In the humidity control device of Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No, 2006-170492, cooling of the heat generating component as described above is not taken into account at all.
