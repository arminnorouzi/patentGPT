i.e., primary, secondary, and tertiary recovery (or EOR (enhanced recovery)), wherein different recovery methods are used in each of the stages.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The primary recovery method includes flush production, which uses the original pressure and gravity within the oil reservoir, and also artificial lift, which uses an artificial oil extraction technique such as a pumping. The crude oil recovery rate in the primary recovery stage, through combination of these methods is said to be maximum of only about 20%. The secondary recovery method includes water flooding or reservoir pressure maintenance, wherein water or natural gas is injected to maintain reservoir pressure and to increase oil production after production decline in the primary recovery stage. Even with a combination of these primary and secondary recoveries, the crude oil recovery rate is estimated to be about 40%, and the majority of crude oil remains in the subsurface oil reservoir. Thus, the tertiary recovery method; i.e., the enhanced oil recovery method (EOR flooding), has been developed for higher recovery of crude oil, and for recovery of more crude oil from oil reservoirs wherein crude oil has already been recovered from easily recoverable pore spaces.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The EOR technology includes thermal flooding, gas flooding, microbial flooding, and chemical flooding. Among these, gas flooding (also referred to as &#x201c;miscible gas flooding&#x201d;) forms a miscible state (mixing state under supercritical pressure) between the injection gas (fluid) and oil, to thereby improve the recovery rate of crude oil remaining in micropores of the reservoir rock. In gas flooding, for example, hydrocarbon gas, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen gas, or combustion exhaust gas generated during oil production is utilized for injection, and thus the gas extracted from the oil reservoir can be reused as is, and CO<sub>2 </sub>in the exhaust gas emitted from, for example, refineries or power plants can be recovered and used. Thus, gas flooding contributes to effective use of available resources while increasing the crude oil recovery rate. In addition, gas flooding has received attention as a technique that can contribute to a reduction in amount of greenhouse gases emitted, i.e., a measure against global warming.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In gas flooding, injection gas tends to diffuse along larger pore spaces in the oil reservoir and is less likely to enter smaller pore spaces, due to high mobility of the injection gas. Thus, the water alternating gas (WAG) injection process, wherein gas and water are injected alternatingly, has also been applied to reduce the high mobility of the injection gas.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">CO<sub>2 </sub>foam flooding, which is intended to improve the recovery efficiency through control of the mobility, has been proposed as a next-generation technology of the aforementioned CO<sub>2 </sub>gas flooding method. In this flooding method, the viscosity of injection fluid is increased by formation of CO<sub>2 </sub>foam, and the comparative viscosity of crude oil (i.e., the fluid to be replaced) is made relatively lower, to thereby improve the mobility ratio and to improve the recovery efficiency of crude oil remaining in micropores of the reservoir rock.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, regarding CO<sub>2 </sub>foam flooding, Non-Patent Document 1 discloses a technique using commercially available silane-modified silica nanoparticles, and Non-Patent Document 2 discloses a technique using silica nanoparticles whose surfaces are grafted with ligands. Patent Document 1 discloses foam for enhancing oil recovery, the foam containing a foaming composition containing surface-modified silica nanoparticles and a foaming agent (e.g., nitrogen gas). Patent Document 2 discloses a method for recovering crude oil using emulsion stabilized with amphiphilic nanoparticles containing silica nanoparticles and metal nanoparticles.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">Patent Document 1: JP 2005-526887 A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0009">Patent Document 2: WO 2015/116332</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Non-Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">Non-Patent Document 1: A.

INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0066" num="0067">The present invention is directed to an aqueous sol for increasing the stability of froth or emulsion in a fluid in CO<sub>2 </sub>foam flooding of enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The aqueous sol of the present invention can contribute to formation and stabilization of froth or emulsion through contact of the aqueous sol with water (including salt water, seawater, etc.) and carbon dioxide, and through contact of these with crude oil.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0068">The term &#x201c;froth&#x201d; as used herein refers to &#x201c;foam&#x201d; composed of numerous bubbles, wherein each bubble has a diameter of about several &#x3bc;m to several hundreds of &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0069">In the case of emulsion, each droplet generally has a diameter of about 0.1 &#x3bc;m to several hundreds of &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0070">&#x3c;Aqueous Sol&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0070" num="0071">In general, an aqueous sol is a colloidal dispersion system containing an aqueous solvent serving as a dispersing medium and colloidal particles serving as a dispersoid. The present invention is particularly directed to an aqueous sol wherein the dispersing medium is an aqueous medium (water) having an acidic pH, and the dispersoid is silica particles subjected to surface treatment with a specific functional group. Specifically, the present invention is directed to an aqueous sol wherein the dispersoid is silica particles having surfaces at least partially coated with a silane compound having a hydrolyzable group (hereinafter may be simply referred to as &#x201c;silane compound&#x201d;) (hereinafter the silica particles may be referred to as &#x201c;silica particles subjected to surface treatment with a silane compound&#x201d; or &#x201c;surface-treated silica particles&#x201d;), and the dispersion medium is an aqueous solvent having a pH of 1.0 or more to 6.0 or less.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0072">The phrase &#x201c;silica particles having surfaces at least partially coated with a silane compound having a hydrolyzable group&#x201d; as used herein refers to a state where the silane compound having a hydrolyzable group is bonded to at least a portion of the surfaces of silica particles&#x201d;; specifically includes a state where the silane compound covers the entire surfaces of silica particles, a state where the silane compound covers a portion of the surfaces of silica particles, and a state where the silane compound is bonded to the surfaces of silica particles.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0073">The silica particles (surface-treated silica particles) contained in the aqueous sol of the present invention can be evaluated for their average particle diameter (DLS average particle diameter) and dispersion state by dynamic light scattering.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0074">The DLS average particle diameter corresponds to the average of the diameters of secondary particles (diameters of dispersed particles). It is said that the DLS average particle diameter of completely dispersed particles is about twice the average primary particle diameter (i.e., specific surface area diameter as measured by the nitrogen gas adsorption method (BET method) or the Sears method, corresponding to the average of primary particle diameters). Thus, the measurement of the DLS average particle diameter can determine whether the colloidal particles (surface-treated silica particles in the present invention) contained in the aqueous sol are in a dispersed state or in an aggregated state. Specifically, it can be determined that a larger DLS average particle diameter indicates an aggregated state of the colloidal particles contained in the aqueous sol.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0075">In the present invention, the surface-treated silica particles contained in the aqueous sol may have an average particle diameter (DLS particle diameter) of 1 to 100 nm, or 1 to 50 nm, or 3 to 30 nm, or 5 to 15 nm. The particles having a DLS average particle diameter of more than 1 nm do not aggregate in the aqueous sol and remain stable therein, whereas the particles having a DLS average particle diameter of less than 100 nm enable the sol to readily penetrate into pores of sandstone or carbonate rocks present in the subsurface oil field reservoir, resulting in improved crude oil recovery rate.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0076">In the surface-treated silica particles contained in the aqueous sol, the mass ratio of the silane compound to the silica particles is, for example, 0.01 to 2.00:1.00, or 0.30 to 2.00:1.00, or 0.33 to 2.00:1.00, or 0.33 to 1.00:1.00.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0077">When the amount of the silane compound is 0.01 parts by mass or more (preferably 0.30 parts by mass or more) relative to 1.00 parts by mass of the silica particles contained in the aqueous sol, the aqueous sol can be expected to have favorable salt resistance. However, when the amount of the silane compound is adjusted to 2.00 parts by mass or more, an effect commensurate with an increase in the amount cannot be obtained.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0078">In the aforementioned aqueous sol, the concentration of the surface-treated silica particles (solid content concentration) may be, for example, 1 to 40% by mass.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0079">Preferably, the aqueous sol of the present invention has no isoelectric point at a pH of 6 or less, for example, a pH range of 1 or more to 6 or less. In such a case, the aqueous sol can be expected not to aggregate but to remain stable.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0080">In general, the salt concentration of seawater is about 30,000 ppm to 40,000 ppm, the salt concentration of oil and gas fields in Japan is about 10,000 ppm to 50,000 ppm, and the salt concentration of formation water overseas (for example, in the Abu Dhabi carbonate rock oil field) is about 160,000 ppm, etc. In view of injection of the aqueous sol of the present invention into an oil reservoir in an onshore or offshore oil field, the aqueous sol desirably exhibits high salt resistance in an environment having a salt concentration of about 10,000 ppm (corresponding to 1.0% by mass) to over 200,000 ppm; specifically, it is desirable that the silica particles contained in the aqueous sol do not aggregate or gelate and remain in a dispersed state in the aforementioned environment.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0081">In the present invention, the salt resistance (salt water stability) of the aqueous sol can be evaluated by a salt resistance test wherein the aqueous sol is stored at a pH of 5.0 or more to 8.0 or less and 80&#xb0; C. for 30 days in an environment containing sodium chloride, calcium chloride, and magnesium chloride as main components and having a total salt concentration of 10,000 to 230,000 ppm such that the silica concentration is 1.0% by mass. When a change in the average particle diameter of the aqueous sol as measured by dynamic light scattering is small before and after this test, the silica particles contained in the aqueous sol can be evaluated to maintain their dispersed state. However, when the aqueous sol exhibits poor salt resistance, the DLS average particle diameter becomes very large after the salt resistance test, which reflects the aggregated state of the silica particles contained in the sol.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0082">In the present invention, the aqueous sol can be determined to have good salt resistance when the average particle diameter measured by dynamic light scattering after the aforementioned salt resistance test differs by 200 nm or less from the average particle diameter before the test. In particular, when the difference in DLS average particle diameter between before and after the test is 200 nm or less (e.g., 160 nm or less), the aqueous sol can be determined to have very good salt resistance without alteration (aggregation or gelation) of the silica sol.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0083">The silica particles contained in the aqueous sol of the present invention can maintain stable froth or emulsion form in the presence of water, oil, and carbon dioxide at a temperature of 30 to 120&#xb0; C. and a pressure of 70 to 400 atm. The term &#x201c;stable&#x201d; as used herein refers to the case where the froth or the emulsion does not disintegrate or separate. The present inventors confirmed that when froth or emulsion is formed for several hours under static conditions, the foam or the emulsion stably maintains its form for several days.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0084">Carbon dioxide becomes supercritical under conditions of 31.1&#xb0; C. and 72.8 atm or higher. In the present invention, the oil in rock pores is displaced by water (containing the silica particles), oil, and carbon dioxide in the form of froth or emulsion. In this case, the carbon dioxide may be in a homogeneous supercritical state or in a gas or liquid phase state.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0085">The aforementioned aqueous sol is prepared by mixing a silane compound having a hydrolyzable group with an (unmodified) aqueous silica sol, and then subjecting the mixture to thermal treatment as described below.

Specifically, the particle diameter corresponds to the equivalent diameter (specific surface area diameter) calculated from the specific surface area of colloidal silica determined from the amount of 0.1N-NaOH required for titration, from pH 4 or more to pH 9 or less, of colloidal silica equivalent to 1.5 g of SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0091">In the present invention, the average particle diameter of the aqueous silica sol (colloidal silica particles) as measured by the nitrogen gas adsorption method (BET method) or the Sears method may be, for example, 1 to 100 nm, or 1 to 50 nm, or 3 to 30 nm, or 5 to 15 nm.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0092">The aforementioned aqueous silica sol may be a commercially available product.

In the present invention, an important factor in salt resistance is a combination of the pH of an aqueous silica sol as a raw material and the aforementioned hydrolyzable group.

In this case, the silane compound having a hydrolyzable group may be added to the aqueous silica sol so that the mass ratio of the silane compound to the silica particles (silica solid content) in the aqueous silica sol is as follows: for example, the mass ratio of the silane compound to the silica particles of 0.01 to 2.00:1.00, or 0.30 to 2.00:1.00, or 0.33 to 2.00:1.00, or 0.33 to 1.00:1.00.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0117">When the thermal treatment temperature is lower than 50&#xb0; C., the rate of partial hydrolysis of the hydrolyzable group is reduced, and thus the surface treatment efficiency is lowered, whereas when the thermal treatment temperature is higher than 100&#xb0; C., dry silica gel is generated, which is not desirable.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0118">When the thermal treatment time is less than one hour, the hydrolysis reaction of the silane compound having a hydrolyzable group proceeds insufficiently. Meanwhile, even when the thermal treatment time is longer than 20 hours, the hydrolysis reaction of the silane compound becomes almost saturated, and thus the heating time need not be longer. The phrase &#x201c;silica particles coated with a silane compound&#x201d; encompasses the case where hydrolyzable groups are completely hydrolyzed, and the silica particles are coated with siloxane bonds, and the case where some hydrolyzable groups remain unreacted and the other hydrolyzable groups are hydrolyzed, and the silica particles are with siloxane bonds.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0119">The amount of surface treatment (coating) with the silane compound having a hydrolyzable group; i.e., the number of silane compound molecules bonded to the silica particle surface is preferably, for example, 0.01 to 5 or 1 to 5 per nm<sup>2 </sup>of the silica particle surface.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0120">The resultant aqueous sol containing, as a dispersoid, silica particles subjected to surface treatment with the silane compound corresponds to an aqueous sol dispersed in an aqueous solvent having a pH of 1.0 or more to 6.0 or less; i.e., an aqueous sol stored at a pH of 1.0 or more to 6.0 or less.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0121">Surface-treated silica particles may be prepared by using an alkaline aqueous silica sol (pH 8 or higher), and adding a silane compound having a hydrolyzable group to the aqueous silica sol in the same manner as described above. However, an aqueous sol containing surface-treated silica particles dispersed in an aqueous medium prepared by using an alkaline aqueous silica sol as a raw material requires attention, since the average particle diameter as measured by dynamic light scattering increases significantly after the salt resistance test described above; i.e., the silica particles are likely to aggregate and to be less stable. When surface-treated silica particles are prepared under alkaline conditions, the aqueous sol wherein the particles are dispersed is confirmed to exhibit poor foamability in a mixture system of water, carbon dioxide, and a crude oil substitute (hydrocarbon (decane)). Thus, the aqueous sol is less likely to be effective in crude oil recovery by carbon dioxide foam.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0122">When an aqueous silica sol (aqueous sol) containing surface-treated silica particles prepared under alkaline conditions is made acidic with, for example, hydrochloric acid (e.g., pH 1.0 or more to 6.0 or less) to thereby yield an acidic aqueous silica sol (aqueous sol), the average particle diameter as measured by dynamic light scattering increases after the aforementioned salt resistance test, and the silica particles aggregate and exhibit lowered stability. This acidic aqueous silica sol also exhibits poor foamability in a mixture system of water, carbon dioxide, and a crude oil substitute (decane). Rock pores that contribute to fluid flow are considered to have a diameter of several &#x3bc;m or more. Thus, conceivably, the aggregated and gelated aqueous silica sol is difficult to pass through rock pores of several &#x3bc;m sufficiently in the core flood test. Therefore, the aforementioned alkaline aqueous silica sol (aqueous sol) subjected to surface treatment with a silane compound under alkaline conditions, or the acidic aqueous silica sol (aqueous sol) prepared from the alkaline aqueous silica sol is not suitable for crude oil recovery in the present invention.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0123">&#x3c;Crude Oil Recovery Method&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0123" num="0124">The aqueous sol of the present invention can be used to recover crude oil from a subsurface hydrocarbon-containing reservoir through, for example, a procedure including step (a): a step of injecting the aqueous sol of the present invention, water, and carbon dioxide alternatingly or simultaneously into the subsurface oil reservoir, and step (b): a step by which oil is recovered to the surface from oil production well drilled into subsurface oil reservoir.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0125">The water to be injected in the step (a) may be salt water containing chlorine ions and sodium ions, calcium ions, magnesium ions, etc., or may be seawater (for example, when the aqueous sol is assumed to be used in oil reservoirs in offshore oil fields).

The back pressure valve was set to 200 atm (i.e., test conditions) with the back pressure pump.
