The body is provided with multiple steaming meshes for placing food, and the heating structure contains a heat tank. The bottom of the heat tank is formed into a flat plate on the bottom of the body to accommodate waters, and a gas stove or electric heating tube is used to directly heat the bottom of the heating tank. The waters are boiled to produce water vapors, and the waters are fed into the heating tank via a water inlet pipe. However, a steaming structure is arranged on the bottom of the body through the heating structure, and the electric heating tube is covered by the waters to generate water vapors to heat the foods on the meshes. However, the electric heating tube and the body are covered with waters. Therefore, the water vapors can only reach 100&#xb0; C., which is the boiling point of the liquid to cause poor heating effect.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention has arisen to mitigate and/or obviate the afore-described disadvantages.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The primary aspect of the present invention is to provide a steam stove which is capable of enhancing a temperature to heat and sterilize effectively.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a steam stove which contains the steaming module and the two heating modules so that the steaming module heats the waters from the water tank to produce the water vapors, and the two heating modules heat the water vapors of the steam room successively to enhance heating and sterilizing effect greatly.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To obtain the above mentioned aspects, a steam stove provided by the present invention contains: a body, a steaming module, two flowing conduits, and two heating modules.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The body includes a steam room defined therein and being opened or closed, a water tank formed on a bottom of the steam room and accommodating the steaming module, two vertical partitions vertically arranged on two sides of the steam room of the body so as to produce the two flowing conduits, and a bottom and a top of each of the two flowing conduits are in communication with the water tank and the steam room.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Each of the two heating modules is fixed in each of the two flowing conduits and is not shielded by the water tank, and a horizontal partition is defined among two bottoms of the two vertical partitions and the body so as to shield the water tank.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view showing the exploded components of a steam stove according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention,</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view showing the assembly of the steam stove according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross sectional view showing the operation of the steam stove according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention will be clearer from the following description when viewed together with the accompanying drawings, which show, for purpose of illustrations only, a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention,</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, a steam stove according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is capable of enhancing a temperature to heat and sterilize foods effectively.
