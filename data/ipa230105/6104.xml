At the current stage, the light-emitting diode still faces many technical challenges, and one of them is the efficiency droop effect of the light-emitting diode. Specifically, when the light-emitting diode is driven within an operating range of current density, it corresponds to a peak value of the external quantum efficiency (EQE). As the current density of the light-emitting diode continues to increase, the external quantum efficiency will decrease, and this phenomenon is the efficiency droop effect of the light-emitting diode.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, when manufacturing the micro light-emitting diode (micro LED), an etching process is adopted for procedures such as mesa and isolation. However, during the etching process, sidewalls of the micro light-emitting diode may be damaged. When the size of the micro light-emitting diode is less than 50 micrometers (&#x3bc;m), the proportion of carriers flowing through the sidewall increases as the surface area of the sidewall accounts for an increasing proportion of the overall surface area of the epitaxial structure, which thereby affects the micro light-emitting diode, and results in a substantial decrease in the external quantum efficiency.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosure provides a micro light-emitting device that improves the quantum efficiency.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosure also provides a micro light-emitting device display apparatus, including the above-mentioned micro light-emitting device and has better display quality.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The micro light-emitting device of the disclosure includes an epitaxial structure, a first electrode, a second electrode and a conductive layer. The epitaxial structure includes a first-type semiconductor layer, a light-emitting layer, and a second-type semiconductor layer. The light-emitting layer is located between the first-type semiconductor layer and the second-type semiconductor layer. The first-type semiconductor layer includes a first portion and a second portion connected to each other. A bottom area of the first portion is smaller than a top area of the second portion. A thickness of the second portion is greater than 10% of a thickness of the first-type semiconductor layer. The first electrode is disposed on the epitaxial structure and located on the first portion of the first-type semiconductor layer. The second electrode is disposed on the epitaxial structure. The conductive layer is disposed between the first electrode and the first portion, wherein an orthographic projection area of the conductive layer on the first portion is greater than or equal to 90% of an area of the first portion.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The micro light-emitting device display apparatus of the disclosure includes a driving substrate and a plurality of micro light-emitting devices. Each of the micro light-emitting devices includes an epitaxial structure, a first electrode, a second electrode and a conductive layer. The epitaxial structure includes a first-type semiconductor layer, a light-emitting layer, and a second-type semiconductor layer. The light-emitting layer is located between the first-type semiconductor layer and the second-type semiconductor layer. The first-type semiconductor layer includes a first portion and a second portion connected to each other. A bottom area of the first portion is smaller than a top area of the second portion.

The first-type semiconductor layer <b>112</b><i>a </i>is, for example, a P-type semiconductor layer, and the second-type semiconductor layer <b>116</b> is, for example, an N-type semiconductor layer, but they are not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">To be specific, in the first-type semiconductor layer <b>112</b><i>a </i>of this embodiment, a resistance value of the first portion <b>113</b> is greater than a resistance value of the second portion <b>115</b>. A resistance value of an overlapping region between the second portion <b>115</b> and the first portion <b>113</b> is smaller than a resistance value of a non-overlapping region between the second portion <b>115</b> and the first portion <b>113</b>. That is to say, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the resistance value of the two sides of the second portion <b>115</b> (i.e., the area not covered by the first portion <b>113</b>) is greater than the resistance value of the middle (i.e., the area covered by the first portion <b>113</b>) of the second portion <b>115</b>. Therefore, most first-type semiconductor carriers of the first-type semiconductor layer <b>112</b><i>a </i>move toward the middle of the second portion <b>115</b>, thereby reducing the ratio of the first-type semiconductor carriers toward a sidewall of the epitaxial structure <b>110</b><i>a</i>. In this way, the quantum efficiency of the micro light-emitting device <b>100</b><i>a </i>of this embodiment may be improved.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> again, in the first-type semiconductor layer <b>112</b><i>a </i>of this embodiment, the first portion <b>113</b> is of a first thickness T<b>1</b>, the second portion <b>115</b> is of a second thickness T<b>2</b>, and a ratio of the second thickness T<b>2</b> to the first thickness T<b>1</b> is, for example, between 0.1 and 0.5. Herein, the second thickness T<b>2</b> of the second portion <b>115</b> is, for example, between 0.1 &#x3bc;m and 0.5 &#x3bc;m. If the second thickness T<b>2</b> of the second portion <b>115</b> is too small (i.e., the above-mentioned ratio being less than 0.1), then the yield of the process will be reduced; in contrast, if the second thickness T<b>2</b> of the second portion <b>115</b> is too large (i.e., the above-mentioned ratio being greater than 0.5), reduction of the first-type semiconductor carriers moving toward the sidewall cannot be achieved.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In terms of area ratio, a ratio of the bottom area E<b>1</b> of the first portion <b>113</b> of the first-type semiconductor layer <b>112</b><i>a </i>to a bottom area E<b>3</b> (i.e., a bottom area of the second portion <b>115</b>) of the first-type semiconductor layer <b>112</b><i>a </i>is, for example, between 0.8 and 0.98. Furthermore, a ratio of a surface area of a side surface S of the epitaxial structure <b>110</b><i>a </i>to a surface area of the epitaxial structure <b>110</b><i>a </i>is, for example, greater than or equal to 0.01. Herein, a length of the epitaxial structure <b>110</b><i>a </i>is, for example, less than or equal to 50 &#x3bc;m. Moreover, in this embodiment, the distance G<b>1</b> between the edge of the first portion <b>113</b> and the edge of the second portion <b>115</b> is, for example, between 0.5 &#x3bc;m and 5 &#x3bc;m. If the distance G<b>1</b> is too large (i.e., greater than 5 &#x3bc;m), this will affect a light-emitting area of the light-emitting layer <b>114</b>. Besides, a ratio of the first thickness T<b>1</b> of the first portion <b>113</b> of the first-type semiconductor layer <b>112</b><i>a </i>to a thickness T of the epitaxial structure <b>110</b><i>a </i>is, for example, between 0.05 and 0.4. Through the above-mentioned ratio range, the thickness of the first portion <b>113</b> is controlled in an appropriate range, which reduces the likelihood of carriers escaping from the sidewall of the first portion <b>113</b> since the sidewall is too long, or reduces the difficulty or failure rate, among others, of the process increased due to the thickness being too small. In one embodiment, the thickness T of the epitaxial structure <b>110</b><i>a </i>is, for example, 3 &#x3bc;m to 8 &#x3bc;m, and the thickness (i.e., the first thickness T<b>1</b> plus the second thickness T<b>2</b>) of the first-type semiconductor layer <b>112</b><i>a </i>is, for example, 0.5 &#x3bc;m to 1 &#x3bc;m. A ratio of a side surface area of the first portion <b>113</b> of the first-type semiconductor layer <b>112</b><i>a </i>to a side surface area of the epitaxial structure <b>110</b><i>a </i>is, for example, between 0.2 and 0.8. As the ratio of the side surface area of the first portion <b>113</b> is within the above-mentioned ratio range, the light-emitting area of the first-type semiconductor layer <b>112</b><i>a </i>and the thin film resistance effect may both be attended to. That is, this ensures a relatively large area in which the carriers pass through the light-emitting layer <b>114</b>, and maintains the distance G<b>1</b> between the first portion <b>113</b> and the second portion <b>115</b>, so that the resistance difference between the layers is not reduced due to the distance G<b>1</b> being too short.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> again, a cross-sectional shape of the first portion <b>113</b> of the first-type semiconductor layer <b>112</b><i>a </i>in this embodiment is a trapezoid.
