Field of the Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a cascode-connection amplification circuit.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A cascode-connection amplification circuit is often used as a high-frequency signal amplification circuit.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-5160 discloses a cascode-connection amplification circuit that includes a first transistor and a second transistor. More specifically, the first transistor has a common emitter (or common source) and the second transistor has a common base (gate). In addition, whether or not a collector (drain) terminal of the first transistor is grounded can be switched using a switch.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the cascode-connection amplification circuit disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-5160, a parasitic inductance caused by a ground wiring line is added to the second transistor, which has a common base (gate), and as a result the grounding characteristic of the second transistor becomes unstable and the stability factor (K factor) of the cascode-connection amplification circuit is reduced. In this state, there is a risk that the amplification circuit will undergo oscillation when feedback occurs via a parasitic capacitance or the like in the vicinity of the transistor.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, the present disclosure was made in order to solve the above-described problem and it is an object thereof to provide a stable cascode-connection amplification circuit in which oscillation is prevented.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to achieve this object, an amplification circuit according to a preferred embodiment of the present disclosure includes: a first input terminal to which a high-frequency signal is input; an output terminal that outputs the high-frequency signal, which has been amplified; a power supply terminal that is connected to a power supply that generates a direct-current power supply voltage; a first transistor that has a first terminal, a second terminal, and a first control terminal to which a high-frequency signal is input via the first input terminal; a second transistor that has a third terminal that is connected to the second terminal, a fourth terminal that outputs an amplified high-frequency signal, and a second control terminal that is grounded, the second transistor being cascode connected to the first transistor; a first capacitance element that is serially disposed on a second path that connects the second control terminal and the power supply terminal to each other; and a first resistive element that is serially arranged on a first path that connects the fourth terminal and the power supply terminal to each other or is serially arranged on the second path, and that is a first resistance element or a first switch element; the fourth terminal and the second control terminal being connected to each other via the first resistive element and the first capacitance element.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although the second control terminal of the second transistor is grounded, a parasitic inductance component is generated at the second control terminal due to for example a wiring line that is for grounding the second control terminal. Therefore, in the amplification circuit of the related art, the stability of the second transistor is reduced due to the potential of the second control terminal not being grounded in a fixed manner, feedback occurs, and an oscillation undesirably occurs when a loop formed by this feedback has a loop gain greater than or equal to 1.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">With respect to this, in the above-described configuration, since the fourth terminal, which is an output terminal for a high-frequency signal, and the second control terminal are connected to each other via the first resistive element, a loop can be formed that does not have a loop gain greater than or equal to 1 due to the loop gain being reduced by the first resistive element. In addition, the potential of the second control terminal is isolated from the power supply potential by the first capacitance element disposed on the second path. Thus, even when a parasitic inductance component is generated at the second control terminal, the high-frequency feedback signal is attenuated, and therefore a stable amplification circuit in which oscillation is prevented can be provided.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, the amplification circuit may further include: a first inductance element that is serially disposed on the first path that connects the fourth terminal and the power supply terminal; and a second capacitance element that is serially disposed between the fourth terminal and the output terminal; and the first resistive element may be serially disposed on the first path or the second path between the first inductance element and the second control terminal.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Due to this configuration, the first resistive element is disposed in a region outside the first transistor, the second transistor, and a matching network formed by the first inductance element and the second capacitance element, and therefore degradation of the gain of the amplifier formed by the first transistor and the second transistor can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, the first resistive element may be the first resistance element and the first resistance element may be serially disposed on just the second path out of the first path and the second path.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Due to this configuration, a current of the second transistor that flows along the first path is not attenuated by the first resistive element, and therefore degradation of the amplification characteristics can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, the first resistive element may be the first switch element, and the first switch element may be serially disposed on the first path that connects the fourth terminal and the power supply terminal to each other.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Due to this configuration, a so-called off leakage current that flows from the power supply terminal to the ground terminal via the fourth terminal, the third terminal, the second terminal, and the first terminal can be suppressed by putting the first switch element into a non- conductive state when the first transistor and the second transistor are not operating.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, when the amplification circuit is performing an amplification operation, the first switch element may be in a conductive state, and when the amplification circuit is not performing an amplification operation, the first switch element may be in a non-conductive state.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Due to this configuration, when the amplification circuit is performing an amplification operation, oscillation of the amplification circuit can be suppressed, and when the amplification circuit is not performing an amplification operation, the off leakage current of the amplification circuit can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The amplification circuit may further include: a second resistive element that is serially disposed on the first path or the second path, and is a second resistance element or a second switch element.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Due to this configuration, even in the case where the necessary resistance value is not secured using just the on resistance of the first switch element when the first switch element is in a conductive state, sufficient loop attenuation can be realized using the second resistive element.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, the amplification circuit may further include a third resistance element that is connected in parallel with the first inductance element.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Due to this configuration, even in the case where the necessary resistance value is not secured using just the on resistance of the first switch element, sufficient loop attenuation can be realized using the third resistance element.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The amplification circuit may further include a third capacitance element and a first series circuit in which a fourth capacitance element and a third switch element are connected in series with each other. The third capacitance element and the first series circuit may be each connected in parallel with the first inductance element.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Thus, the parallel resonant frequency of a parallel resonance circuit consisting of the first inductance element and the third capacitance element can be varied by switching the third switch element between a conductive state and a non-conductive state. Therefore, the frequency can be adjusted over a wide range of frequencies to achieve a high gain.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The amplification circuit may further include a second series circuit in which a fifth capacitance element and a fourth switch element are connected in series with each other. The second series circuit may be connected in parallel with the second capacitance element.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thus, by switching the fourth switch element to either a conductive state or a non-conductive state, it is possible to adjust the frequency and impedance at which impedance matching with an externally connected circuit connected to the output terminal is to be realized over a wide range of frequencies.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The amplification circuit may further include: a plurality of filters that are connected between the first input terminal and the first control terminal and have different frequency bands as pass bands thereof; a first switch circuit that is connected between the first input terminal and the plurality of filters and is configured so as to be capable of switching a connection between the first input terminal and any of the plurality of filters; and a second switch circuit that is connected between the plurality of filters and the first control terminal and is configured so as to be capable of switching a connection between the first control terminal and any of the plurality of filters.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">With this configuration, a plurality of filters are disposed, and as a result, the frequencies at which the amplification circuit has gain can be restricted and unwanted waves can be suppressed. The conditions under which a signal source impedance can be obtained at particular frequencies as seen from the second transistor are broadened by switching the plurality of filters, resulting in an increased risk of the amplification circuit oscillating at a particular frequency, but a high-frequency feedback signal can be attenuated by the first resistive element and the first capacitance element even if a parasitic inductance component is generated at the second control terminal, and a stable amplification circuit in which oscillation is prevented can be provided.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The amplification circuit may further include a ground terminal to which the second control terminal is connected and an IC substrate on or in which the ground terminal, the first transistor, the second transistor, the first capacitance element, and the first resistive element are disposed. The ground terminal may be a bump electrode bonded to a main surface of the IC substrate.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">With this configuration, a high-frequency feedback signal is attenuated by the first resistive element and the first capacitance element even when a parasitic inductance component is generated at the second control terminal, and a stable amplification circuit in which oscillation is prevented can be provided.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The amplification circuit may further include an external connection terminal to which the second control terminal is connected, an IC substrate on or in which the first transistor, the second transistor, the first capacitance element, and the first resistive element are disposed, and a module substrate having a first main surface and a second main surface, which face each other, the IC substrate being disposed on the first main surface. The external connection terminal may be disposed on the second main surface of the module substrate.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">With this configuration, a high-frequency feedback signal is attenuated by the first resistive element and the first capacitance element even when a parasitic inductance component is generated at the second control terminal, and a stable amplification circuit in which oscillation is prevented can be provided.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The amplification circuit may further include a first inductance element that is serially disposed on the first path that connects the fourth terminal and the power supply terminal to each other, and a second capacitance element that is serially disposed between the fourth terminal and the output terminal. The first inductance element may be serially arranged on the first path or the second path between the first resistive element and the second control terminal.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The amplification circuit may further include a second input terminal, a third transistor that has a fifth terminal, a sixth terminal, and a third control terminal to which a high-frequency signal is input via the second input terminal, and a fourth transistor that has a seventh terminal that is connected to the fifth terminal, an eighth terminal that outputs an amplified high-frequency signal, and a fourth control terminal that is grounded, the fourth transistor being cascode connected to the third transistor. The first resistive element may be the first switch element serially disposed between the first inductance element and the fourth terminal. The first path may connect the fourth terminal and the power supply terminal to each other and connect the eighth terminal and the power supply terminal to each other. The second path may connect the second control terminal and the power supply terminal to each other and connect the fourth control terminal and the power supply terminal to each other. The amplification circuit further may further include a third switch element serially disposed between the first inductance element and the eighth terminal.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">With this configuration, since the fourth terminal, which is an output terminal for a high-frequency signal, and the second control terminal are connected to each other via the first resistive element, a loop can be formed that does not have a loop gain greater than or equal to 1 due to the loop gain being reduced by the first resistive element. In addition, the potential of the second control terminal is isolated from the power supply potential by the first capacitance element disposed on the second path.

In addition, the ground terminals <b>54</b> and <b>55</b> are grounded. A high-frequency signal (RFin) is input to the input terminal <b>51</b> (example of first input terminal) and a high-frequency signal (RFout) amplified by the transistors <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> is output from the output terminal <b>52</b>. As illustrated in the figure, the power supply <b>31</b> is not an essential constituent element of the amplification circuit <b>1</b> and does not need to be included inside the amplification circuit <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The transistor <b>20</b> is a first transistor that has a source terminal S<b>1</b> (first terminal), a drain terminal D<b>1</b> (second terminal), and a gate terminal G<b>1</b> (first control terminal), and is for example an n-type field effect transistor.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The transistor <b>10</b> is a second transistor that has a source terminal S<b>2</b> (third terminal), a drain terminal D<b>2</b> (fourth terminal), and a gate terminal G<b>2</b> (second control terminal), and is for example an n-type field effect transistor.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The transistors <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> may instead be p-type field effect transistors, or for example may be bipolar transistors. In the case where the transistors <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are bipolar transistors, for example, the source terminals will be emitter terminals, the drain terminals will be collector terminals, and the gate terminals will be base terminals.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the amplification circuit <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, the drain terminal D<b>1</b> is connected to the source terminal S<b>2</b>, the source terminal S<b>1</b> is connected to the ground terminal <b>55</b> via the inductor <b>21</b>, and the gate terminal G<b>1</b> is connected to the input terminal <b>51</b> via a capacitor <b>22</b>. In addition, the drain terminal D<b>2</b> is connected to the output terminal <b>52</b> via the capacitor <b>15</b>, and the gate terminal G<b>2</b> is connected to the ground terminal <b>54</b> via the capacitor <b>12</b>. In other words, the transistor <b>10</b> is cascode connected to the transistor <b>20</b>, and the amplification circuit <b>1</b> forms a cascode-connection amplification circuit.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The inductor <b>11</b> is a first inductance element that is serially disposed on a first path that connects the drain terminal D<b>2</b> and the power supply terminal <b>53</b>, and is a matching element for realizing impedance matching between the transistors <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> and an externally connected circuit. The inductor <b>21</b> is a second inductance element that is serially disposed on a path that connects the source terminal S<b>1</b> and the ground terminal <b>55</b>, and is a source degeneration inductor. The inductors <b>11</b> and <b>21</b> are not essential constituent elements of the amplification circuit <b>1</b> according to this embodiment.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The capacitor <b>15</b> is a second capacitance element that is serially disposed between the drain terminal D<b>2</b> and the output terminal <b>52</b>. The capacitor <b>15</b> is a DC cutting element for removing a direct-current bias component of a high-frequency signal amplified by the transistors <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, and is also a matching element for realizing impedance matching between the transistors <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> and an externally connected circuit.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The capacitor <b>13</b> is a first capacitance element that is serially disposed on a second path that connects the gate terminal G<b>2</b> and the power supply terminal <b>53</b> to each other. The capacitor <b>13</b> functions as a pass capacitor for selectively allowing a high-frequency signal to pass along the second path, and also has a DC cutting function for preventing an unwanted current from flowing along the second path when a direct-current power supply voltage of the power supply <b>31</b> is applied to the ground terminal <b>54</b> via the power supply terminal <b>53</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The switch <b>14</b> is a switch element that is serially disposed on the first path that connects the drain terminal D<b>2</b> and the power supply terminal <b>53</b> to each other and is a so-called first resistive element that functions as a resistance element having an on resistance when in a conductive state.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In other words, according to the above connection configuration, the drain terminal D<b>2</b> and the gate terminal G<b>2</b> are connected to each other via the inductor <b>11</b>, the switch <b>14</b>, and the capacitor <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">According to the above-described configuration of the amplification circuit <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, the gate terminal G<b>2</b> of the transistor <b>10</b> is grounded (in a high-frequency manner via the capacitor <b>12</b>). At this time, a parasitic inductance component, which is for example caused by a wiring line used to (high-frequency) ground the gate terminal G<b>2</b>, is generated at the gate terminal G<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Therefore, in the amplification circuit of the related art, a problem occurs in that the stability of the transistor is reduced due to the potential of the gate terminal not being (high-frequency) grounded in a fixed manner due to this parasitic inductance component, feedback occurs due to for example a parasitic capacitance generated between the drain terminal D<b>2</b> and the gate terminal G<b>2</b> and between the gate terminal G<b>2</b> and the drain terminal D<b>1</b>, and an oscillation undesirably occurs when a loop formed by the feedback has loop gain that is greater than or equal to 1.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">With respect to this, in the above-described configuration of the amplification circuit <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, the drain terminal D<b>2</b> connected to the output terminal <b>52</b> and the grounded gate terminal G<b>2</b> are (high-frequency) connected to each other via the switch <b>14</b>. Therefore, when the switch <b>14</b> is in a conductive state, the drain terminal D<b>2</b>, the inductor <b>11</b>, the switch <b>14</b>, the capacitor <b>13</b>, and the gate terminal G<b>2</b> form a high-frequency signal feedback circuit between the drain terminal D<b>2</b> and the gate terminal G<b>2</b>. Here, the switch <b>14</b> has an on resistance when in a conductive state, and therefore the feedback circuit forms a loop that does not have a loop gain that is greater than or equal to 1 (feedback signal is attenuated) due to the on resistance. In other words, a high-frequency signal output from the drain terminal D<b>2</b> is returned via the loop in an attenuated state without passing through a parasitic capacitance or the like generated in the vicinity of the transistor <b>10</b>. In addition, the potential of the ground terminal <b>54</b> is isolated from the power supply potential by the capacitor <b>13</b> disposed on the second path. Thus, even when a parasitic inductance component is generated at the gate terminal G<b>2</b>, feedback signals in both directions between the drain terminal D<b>2</b> and the gate terminal G<b>2</b> are attenuated by this loop, and therefore a stable amplification circuit <b>1</b> in which oscillation is prevented can be provided.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the case where the amplification circuit <b>1</b> is not performing an amplification operation, the switch <b>14</b> is in a non-conductive state, and therefore a so-called off leakage current of the transistors <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> that flows from the power supply terminal <b>53</b> to the ground terminal <b>55</b> via the drain terminal D<b>2</b>, the source terminal S<b>2</b>, the drain terminal D<b>1</b>, and the source terminal S<b>1</b> can be suppressed. From this point of view, it is preferable that the switch <b>14</b> be disposed on the first path out of the first path and the second path. However, from the viewpoint of the feedback circuit being able to form a loop that does not have a loop gain greater than or equal to 1 (feedback signal is attenuated) due to the on resistance of the switch <b>14</b>, the switch <b>14</b> may be disposed on the second path that connects the gate terminal G<b>2</b>, the capacitor <b>13</b>, and the power supply terminal <b>53</b> to each other.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In addition, the switch <b>14</b> may be a first resistance element (resistive element) rather than a switch element that switches between a conductive state and a non-conductive state. However, in this case, the effect of being able to suppress the off leakage current using the first resistance element is low, and therefore the first resistance element may be disposed on the first path or the second path.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The amplification circuit <b>1</b> according to this embodiment further includes a bias terminal <b>57</b> that is connected to the gate terminal G<b>1</b>, a bias terminal <b>56</b> that is connected to the gate terminal G<b>2</b>, the capacitor <b>22</b> that is serially disposed between the gate terminal G<b>1</b> and the input terminal <b>51</b>, and the capacitor <b>12</b> that is serially disposed between the gate terminal G<b>2</b> and the ground terminal <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">A bias circuit is connected to the bias terminal <b>57</b>. The bias circuit generates a direct-current bias voltage or direct-current bias current for setting the operation point of the transistor <b>20</b>. A bias circuit is connected to the bias terminal <b>56</b>. The bias circuit generates a direct-current bias voltage or direct-current bias current for setting the operation point of the transistor <b>10</b>. In this way, the transistors <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> can be set to optimum operation points. The DC cut capacitor <b>22</b> is disposed such that a direct-current bias component is not allowed to leak to the input terminal <b>51</b> in the case where a direct-current bias component is applied to the gate terminal G<b>1</b>. The DC cut capacitor <b>12</b> is disposed such that a direct-current bias component is not allowed to leak to the ground terminal <b>54</b> in the case where a direct-current bias component is applied to the gate terminal G<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The inductor <b>11</b> is a matching element that is for realizing impedance matching between the transistors <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> and an externally connected circuit, and therefore the inductor <b>11</b> is disposed outside the region in which the transistors <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are formed. Thus, the resistive element is disposed in a region outside the transistors <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> and a matching network formed by the inductor <b>11</b> and the capacitor <b>15</b>, and therefore does not affect the gain of an amplifier formed by the transistors <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The first resistive element may be a first resistance element and the first resistance element may be serially disposed on just the second path out of the first path and the second path.

Thus, even when the parasitic inductance L<sub>G1 </sub>is generated at the gate terminal G<b>2</b>, a high-frequency feedback signal between the drain terminal D<b>2</b> and the gate terminal G<b>2</b> is attenuated by this loop, and therefore a stable amplification circuit <b>1</b> in which oscillation is prevented can be provided.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">On the other hand, when an amplification operation is not being performed, the switch <b>14</b> is in a non-conductive state and a so-called off leakage current that flows from the power supply terminal <b>53</b> to the ground terminal <b>55</b> via the drain terminal D<b>2</b>, the source terminal S<b>2</b>, the drain terminal D<b>1</b>, and the source terminal S<b>1</b> can be suppressed</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In other words, in the amplification circuit <b>1</b> in which the switch <b>14</b> is serially disposed on the first path, oscillation can be suppressed in the amplification circuit <b>1</b> when the amplification circuit <b>1</b> is performing an amplification operation and the off leakage current of the amplification circuit <b>1</b> can be suppressed when the amplification circuit <b>1</b> is not performing an amplification operation.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In particular, as the frequency becomes higher, the impedance (j&#x3c9;L<sub>G1</sub>) of the parasitic inductance L<sub>G1 </sub>increases and the grounding characteristic of the gate terminal G<b>2</b> of the transistor <b>10</b> deteriorates. Thus, feedback via the gate terminal G<b>2</b> is more likely to occur. In general, in the case where a high-performance transistor having a gain of up to several tens of GHz is used, there is a possibility that the loop gain of the loop formed by this feedback will be greater than or equal to 1. In addition, the off leakage current tends to increase, the higher the performance of the transistor that is used.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">With respect to this, the amplification circuit <b>1</b> according to this embodiment is characterized in that, even when the high-frequency amplification performances of the transistors <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are high, a feedback circuit can be formed in which a feedback signal is attenuated and in that the off leakage current can be suppressed.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">1.2 Stability Factor of Amplification Circuit</heading><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a graph illustrating the stability factor of the amplification circuit <b>1</b> according to Embodiment 1.

Since the stability factor (K factor) of the amplification circuit <b>1</b>, which includes a feedback circuit in which there is no possibility of the loop gain being greater than or equal to 1, can be greater than or equal to 1, a stable amplification operation in which oscillation is prevented can be provided.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">An amplification circuit <b>500</b> of the related art according to a comparative example will be described below for comparison with the amplification circuit <b>1</b> according to the embodiment described above.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a circuit configuration diagram of the amplification circuit <b>500</b> according to the comparative embodiment and circuits peripheral thereto.
