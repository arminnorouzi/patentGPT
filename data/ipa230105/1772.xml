The present invention also relates to a metal reinforcement for swingdoor tailgates, hybrid design, mixture of tubes and stamped sheet.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">One of the current trends in the automobile industry is to lower vehicle weight to help achieve better fuel economy, thus helping to meet fuel economy standards and to offset the higher fuel prices. Another trend is that there is a broader range of vehicle models; which in turn reduces the volume of vehicles produced on a per model basis. Liftgates are traditionally made from stamped steel panels that are heavy and have a high tooling cost and are susceptible to corrosion. Sheet Molding Compound (SMC) is an alternative to steel for the inner and outer panels of the liftgate. Using SMC has several manufacturing concerns related to the material and process. Steel and SMC liftgates have a mass penalty over thermoplastics. There are also styling restrictions with traditional sheet metal and SMC components.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In another aspect of the invention, it is desirable to provide steel wire reinforcements between and connected with the inner and outer panels in order to further strengthen the liftgate. Traditionally steel wires or cables have been used to hold the liftgate together during a collision. However, the traditional steel cables do not provide any type of strengthening features. It is therefore desirable to develop and provide new strengthening features either formed within the inner and outer panels are connected between the inner and outer panels that can be used to strengthen the overall liftgate structure as well as strengthen and support connection accessories such as light modules, door latches etc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In yet another aspect of the invention, Rear doors of SUVs, vans and other vehicles are complex to engineer. They tend to be large areas which require hinge attachment points for opening and closing of the doors. The doors must seal to keep the elements out and require stiffness and strength for operating and sealing of the doors but also requiring as light of weight as possible since they have to be supported by hinges. Therefore, robust hinge attachment points capable of holding the weight of doors, dampening struts, latches, and handles are required.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A vehicle door including an internal tubular frame for providing attachment of hinges and latches to the door and at least one inner or outer panel for attaching to the frame. In a preferred embodiment the door is a swingdoor which opens from the center to the outside.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The door construction of the present invention provides a vehicle door with very good mechanical performance with respect to torsional and bending stiffness. It provides good crash performance and metal reinforcement at latch, strut, ball joint, and hinge points. The door uses tubes and stamped sheet metal parts and is easier and cheaper to manufacture. Additionally, the complete assembly can be easily adjusted for needed dimensions/tolerance requirements in welding process.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another embodiment of the invention relates to a composite liftgate structure having an inner panel formed of composite material and an outside surface with a perimeter surface area that is adjacent a perimeter edge of the structural composite inner panel. There is a metal hybrid reinforcement connected to the perimeter surface area, wherein the metal hybrid reinforcement forms a closed ring around a perimeter of the inner panel thereby providing enhanced strength to the composite liftgate structure. There is also at least one outer panel connected to the inner panel, wherein the metal hybrid reinforcement is positioned between the inner panel and the at least one outer panel.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exploded side perspective view of a composite liftgate according to a first embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a side elevational view of the metal hybrid reinforcement.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a first cross-sectional plan view of the metal hybrid reinforcement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> is a second cross-sectional plan view of the metal hybrid reinforcement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> is a third cross-sectional plan view of the metal hybrid reinforcement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref> is a fourth cross-sectional plan view of the metal hybrid reinforcement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exploded side perspective view of the metal hybrid reinforcement of the composite liftgate.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of a swing door according to a second embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an exploded view of a swing door according to a third embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an end perspective view of the tubular frames of the swing door.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an end perspective view of the tubular frames connected to the inner panels.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The following description of the preferred embodiment is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> an exploded side perspective view of a composite liftgate <b>10</b> having a composite liftgate structure <b>12</b>.
