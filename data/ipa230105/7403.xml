using a piezoelectric device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Piezoelectric-type vibration apparatuses may be easily damaged by an external impact due to a fragile characteristic of a piezoelectric device, and as a result, there may be a problem where the reliability of sound reproduction is low.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, comparing with the coil type, because a piezoelectric constant of piezoelectric devices are low, the piezoelectric-type vibration apparatuses may be low in sound characteristic and/or sound pressure level characteristic in a low-pitched sound band.</p><p

The inventors have invented a new vibration apparatus where the reliability of sound reproduction is enhanced through various experiments, and moreover, have invented a new vibration apparatus where the sound characteristic and/or the sound pressure level characteristic in the low-pitched sound band is enhanced.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One or more aspects of the present disclosure are directed to providing a vibration apparatus having the enhanced reliability of sound reproduction, an apparatus including the same, and a vehicular apparatus including the vibration apparatus.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One or more aspects of the present disclosure are directed to providing a vibration apparatus where a sound characteristic and/or a sound pressure level characteristic in a low-pitched sound band may be enhanced, an apparatus including the same, and a vehicular apparatus including the vibration apparatus.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional features and aspects of the disclosure are set forth in part in the description that follows and in part will become apparent from the description or may be learned by practice of the inventive concepts provided herein. Other features and aspects of the inventive concepts may be realized and attained by the structures pointed out in the present disclosure, or derivable therefrom, and the claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">To achieve these and other aspects of the present disclosure, as embodied and broadly described herein, a vibration apparatus may comprise a vibration device, and an adhesive member at a surface of the vibration device. A modulus of the vibration device may be equal to a modulus of the adhesive member or may be greater than the modulus of the adhesive member.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one or more aspects of the present disclosure, an apparatus may comprise a vibration member, and one or more vibration generating apparatuses connected to the vibration member. The one or more vibration generating apparatuses may comprise a vibration apparatus. The vibration apparatus may comprise a vibration device, and an adhesive member at a surface of the vibration device.
