It is common to use these means to destroy neoplasms. Treatments known in the art involve surgical intervention to physically remove the aberrant cell mass, radiation to kill the cells of the aberrant cell mass, exposure of aberrant cells to toxic chemicals (i.e., chemotherapy), or a combination of such techniques. While each treatment modality has shown significant effectiveness in treatment of various cell proliferative diseases, no one technique has been shown to be highly effective at treating all types of cell proliferative diseases and disorders.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While surgical intervention is effective at removal of solid tumors on tissues and organs that are physically accessible and capable of sustaining physical damage or capable of regeneration, surgical intervention can be difficult to perform on tumors that are not readily accessible or on organs that do not regenerate. In these cases, surgical intervention can often involve substantial physical damage to the patient, requiring extensive recuperation times and follow-on treatments. At other times, the extensive growth of the neoplasm prevents removal, since attempts at removal would likely kill the patient. Likewise, treatment with radiation can result in collateral damage to tissue surrounding the tumor, and can cause long-lasting side-effects, which can lower the quality of life of the patient. Chemotherapeutic treatments can cause systemic damage to the patient, and can result in significant side effects that might require a long recuperation period or cause permanent damage to tissues and organs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recent work by the inventors has focused on the ablation of unwanted soft tissue (malignant tumors) by application of excessive electrical energy, using a technique termed Irreversible Electroporation (IRE). Successful control and/or ablation of soft tissue sarcoma and malignant glioma have been achieved. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) involves placing electrodes within or near the targeted region to deliver a series of low energy, microsecond electric pulses. These pulses permanently destabilize the cell membranes of the targeted tissue (e.g., tumor), thereby killing the cells.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The foregoing and other objects and aspects of the present invention are explained in greater detail in the drawings herein and the specification set forth below.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0156" num="0155">Irreversible electroporation is a tumor ablation technique which utilizes high voltage pulsed electric fields to destroy tumors. While these procedures are generally considered non-thermal, the non-thermal designation only refers to the mechanism of cell death, being the cell membrane phospholipid bilayer reorientation in response to the electric field and the formation of cytotoxic aqueous pores which traverse the cell membrane. In practice, some of the electrical energy which is applied to the cells or tissue is lost in the form of heat described by Joule heating.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">Joule heating adds confounding variables to any irreversible electroporation treatment as heat is known to change the biophysical response of cells. For example, when hyperthermia is maintained for extended periods of time proteins begin to denature. Electrically, there are temperature dependent spatio-temporal changes in cell media and tissue conductivity leading to a dynamic reduction in resistance which may need to be accounted for in pulsed electric field treatment planning. For in vitro experiments, elevated temperatures will cause collagen to denature at temperatures above approximately 42&#xb0; C. This limitation can make investigating the combinatorial effects of pulsed fields and hyperthermic temperatures challenging in 3D tumor models where the melt point of the matrix is less than the applied Joule heating.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">While the heating effects in irreversible electroporation could be minimalized by reducing the pulse repetition rate or decreasing the width of the pulses, this has not been the standard practice. Previous irreversible electroporation protocols have been prescribed in terms of pulse number, amplitude, and repetition rate in order to achieve a targeted treatment energy dose. Temperature is allowed to increase unregulated throughout the duration of the treatment. Although, side effects are rare for irreversible electroporation treatments, uncontrolled elevated temperatures may be a contributing factor to adverse side effects such as coagulative necrosis, thrombosis, and fistulas.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">Uncontrolled tissue ablation protocols could be characterized as open loop, being devoid of a feedback mechanism dependent on a process output. The closed loop, dynamically controlled, pulsed electric field ablation technique presented here, algorithmically controlled electrotherapy (ACE), uses real time feedback in order to dynamically adjust the energy delivery profile to control multiple physiological, biological, and systemic responses to the treatment. ACE uses a set of process inputs (e.g. voltage, temperature, imaging, and pulse delivery rate) to find an improved pulse delivery rate which establishes a steady state value for a physical response, biological response, or systemic response based on a measurement acquired from a remote sensor or imaging. In the case of temperature measurements, the location of temperature sensing could be anywhere throughout the intended ablation volume or at a remote location of interest. In vivo, temperature data could be acquired either at the electrode, distal to the electrode, or from imaging data in order to protect critical structures such as nerves, blood vessels, bile ducts, or other critical structures from thermal injury. Selection of appropriate pulse widths, voltages, doses and energy delivery rates provide the ability to selectively control the predominant form of cell death occurring following ACE therapy enables the delivery of treatments which are more likely to induce a favorable immune response. In conjunction with adjunctive therapeutics this treatment enables local gene-therapy to further enhance anti-tumor effects.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Experiments were conducted to validate both the operation of the temperature control software and investigate the cytotoxic effects of pulsed electric fields delivered with respect to a temperature control algorithm. The basis of this temperature control paradigm was a proportionate control algorithm which adjusts the rate of pulse delivery depending on the difference between a measured temperature and a target temperature value. Pulses are delivered algorithmically until a target total pulse on time or integrated energized time (IET) is achieved. When combined with a pulsed power supply, an ACE system was demonstrated for 500V, 750V and 1000V treatments. Without thermal control, temperature increases of 5.3&#xb1;0.3&#xb0; C., 11.4&#xb1;0.7&#xb0; C., and 22.0&#xb1;4.7&#xb0; C. were observed from a baseline of 20&#xb0; C. respectively. With temperature control enabled and a target temperature of 25&#xb0; C., 24.5&#xb1;0.5&#xb0; C. was achieved for 1000V treatments with similar results observed for lower voltage treatments. Biological experiments have indicated that ACE is capable of achieving treatment zones similar to those created with non-temperature controlled irreversible electroporation. The results highlight the thermal dependence of cell death for pulses with durations on the order of 2 &#x3bc;s which has not been observed in non-thermal irreversible electroporation clinical protocols utilizing longer pulse lengths (50-100 &#x3bc;s). The findings from this study set the foundation for in vivo experiments utilizing a temperature-controlled pulse delivery rate, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Methods</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Experimental Temperature Control Algorithm</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">The ACE algorithm has been designed to dynamically adjust the rate of pulse delivery to achieve and maintain a target temperature. The aim is for the temperature to rapidly increase according to a user defined maximum delivery rate (R<sub>max</sub>) and then decrement to a steady state delivery rate where the targeted temperature is maintained. The rate specifies the amount of pulse on time compared to the total treatment time of an individual pulse sequence. For a biphasic pulse sequence, the R<sub>max </sub>pulse delivery rate is given by:</p><p id="p-0164" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <msub>      <mi>R</mi>      <mi>max</mi>     </msub>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <mfrac>       <mrow>        <msub>         <mi>&#x3c4;</mi>         <mi>p</mi>        </msub>        <mo>+</mo>        <msub>         <mi>&#x3c4;</mi>         <mi>n</mi>        </msub>       </mrow>       <mi>&#x3b4;</mi>      </mfrac>      <mo>[</mo>      <mfrac>       <mrow>        <mi>&#x3bc;</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mi>s</mi>       </mrow>       <mi>s</mi>      </mfrac>      <mo>]</mo>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mn>1</mn>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0165" num="0000">where &#x3c4;<sub>p </sub>is the pulse width of the positive phase of the delivered pulse, &#x3c4;<sub>n </sub>is pulse width of the negative phase of the delivered pulse, and 6 is the temporal delay between pulse sequences.

This enables ACE to be both truly non-thermal and controllably thermal. For non-thermal treatments, ACE allows for the shortest treatment times while mitigating thermal damage to the patient. In a controllably thermal configuration, ACE could allow for clinicians to determine the extent of thermal damage that a tumor receives. Alternatively, a temperature control point can be placed near to tissue that ought to be preserved after treatment. This allows for safer operation near critical structures with potential for reduced side effects.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0252">In this study we demonstrate ACE as a control schema to maximize pulse delivery rates, minimize treatment times, and provide a mechanism for clinicians to control thermally and electrically induced ablative outcomes. An ex vivo perfused liver model was used to demonstrate the use of dynamic temperature control algorithms to produce 4 cm ablation zones in under 27 minutes with a three-applicator array. In separate experiments, these algorithms were able to rapidly achieve and maintain temperatures of 45, 60, or 80&#xb0; C. at the tissue-electrode interface. A single applicator approach was used to correlate the measured ablation zones to electric field isocontours in order to determine lethal electric field thresholds for ACE treatments of 708 V/cm and 867 V/cm for 45&#xb0; C. and 60&#xb0; C. ACE treatments, respectively. These results establish ACE as a viable method for hepatic tumor treatment with ablation profiles equivalent to other energy-based ablation techniques.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0253">Methods</p><p id="p-0293" num="0254">Tissue Preparation and Processing</p><p id="p-0294" num="0255">All experiments were conducted on ex vivo porcine livers following a previously established technique for organ preservation and evaluation. Livers obtained from a local slaughterhouse were flushed with 200 mL of 1&#xd7; Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)(IS25049, Aldon Corp. Avon N.Y.) to remove large blood clots then transported on ice to the laboratory. A peristaltic pump (EW-77921-65, Cole-Palmer, Vernon Hills, Ill.) was attached to the liver hepatofugally via the vena cava and perfusion with PBS was initiated using a flow rate between 18-25 mL/hour. To simulate venous pressure and increase the volume of fluid within the organ the flow of perfusate exiting the portal vein was restricted via a plastic luer lock (4551100, Cole-Palmer, Vernon Hills, Ill.) coupled to 1 mm inner diameter tubing. To facilitate the removal of any potential blood clots the liver was gently massaged and continuously perfused until tissue blanching occurred indicating that the organ had been flushed and all lobes were receiving PBS. Finally, the existing perfusate was discarded and replaced with fresh PBS which was occasionally refreshed during the experiments.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0256">Post-treatment the organs were moved to a standard laboratory refrigerator at 4&#xb0; C. and perfused for 10-15 hours to allow for delayed cell death processes associated with the treatment to occur. For the three-applicator array (3AA) protocol, treatment sites were identified and sectioned by hand perpendicular to applicator insertion in 0.5 to 1.0 cm thick slices. This yielded between six and ten measurable ablation zones per treatment site. For single applicator and grounding pad (A+GP) protocols a single section was made parallel to and along the applicator insertion path yielding two measurable ablation zones per treatment site. The tissue sections were placed in a bath containing 10 g/L triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC, A1087009, Alfa Aesar, Tewksbury, Mass.) in PBS overnight in a dark environment to enhance visibility of the ablation zones (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>). TTC enzymatically reduces into red 1,3,5-triphenylformazan in living cells and excluded from dead cells which appear light pink. Further contrast enhancement was achieved by preserving tissue samples in Neutral Buffered Formalin (22-046-361, Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass.), however, the results of this process were variable. Ablation zones, indicated by a change in tissue color and texture, were measured using digital calipers. For the three-applicator array, three measurements for each ablation zone were obtained by identifying a straight line connecting the punctures of adjacent applicator pairs then measuring the ablation margin along that line. For the single applicator and grounding pad protocol, the maximal length along the applicator insertion path and maximal width perpendicular to the applicator insertion path were recorded for each ablation zone. The length and width values for ablations within treatment groups were averaged to determine the mean ablation size and data is presented as mean&#xb1;standard deviation.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0257">Energy Delivery</p><p id="p-0297" num="0258">ACE waveforms (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b><i>a</i></figref>) were delivered to the liver tissue via 1 mm diameter applicators (Monopolar Probe, AngioDynamics Inc., Latham, N.Y.) which contain an adjustable insulator used to set the length of the exposed electrode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b><i>b</i></figref>).

The solution to this step was used as the initial value of a second sequential stationary solver with higher voltages applied to the energized electrode tines. An Algebraic Multigrid preconditioner was used with 2 iterations over 500 levels where the coarsest level had 500 degrees of freedom. The Conjugated Gradients iterative solver was used with Error Estimation Checking disabled.

ACE utilizes a controls systems approach, using temperature as process feedback to manage the intra-tumor environment. For the first time this study demonstrates the use of active cooling via an internally perfused electrode combined with ACE algorithmic for control of in situ temperature profiles for tissue ablation. This was evaluated in an ex vivo tissue model with a single internally cooled applicator and grounding pad (CA+GP). The electrode configuration was used to deliver 3000V and 5000V treatments to tissue with pulse delivery rates up to 500 &#x3bc;s/s. The treatments were evaluated for temperature profiles, pulse delivery rates, time to completion, and extent of thermal injury. The actively cooled ACE was then compared to non-cooled treatments.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0296">The results of this analysis indicate that active cooling of the applicator reduced thermal injury volumes by 56-84% versus non-cooled treatments. While actively cooling the electrodes, the largest thermal injury volumes (2.6&#xb1;0.4 cm3) were observed for treatments with a 60&#xb0; C. temperature set point. Reduction of this set point to 50&#xb0; C. and 40&#xb0; C. resulted in significantly smaller thermal injury volumes of 1.5&#xb1;0.3 and 0.1&#xb1;0.2 cm3, respectively, without significantly increasing treatment times. A combination of active cooling and temperature control (2.0 mL/min, 40&#xb0; C.) was found to reduce treatment times by 84% (from 5.4 minutes to 0.9 minutes) without significantly increasing the extent of thermal injury found for matched non-cooled ACE treatments. These results confirm the use of active electrode cooling combined with ACE is a viable strategy for reducing thermal injury in pulsed electric field therapies and sets the foundation for in vivo studies.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0297">Methods</p><p id="p-0352" num="0298">Electrode</p><p id="p-0353" num="0299"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b>A</figref> is an image of a tissue treatment embodiment, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b>B</figref> is a graph illustrating delivery waveforms, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>A and <b>28</b>B</figref> illustrate an overview of an ETT treatment protocol according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.

The combinatorial effect of ETT temperature control and active cooling was then evaluated with perfusion at rates of 2 and 4 mL/min.

This IET (0.02 s) is approximately the dose prescribed for clinical NK-IRE treatments (e.g. 90&#xd7;-220&#xd7;, 70 &#x3bc;s-100 &#x3bc;s pulses, 0.006-0.022 s IET) and is typical for high frequency IRE treatments.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0311">Fluid flow rates of 0.0 (no cooling), 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 mL/min were investigated. To prevent extreme temperatures which can result in tissue desiccation, arcing, and damage to the pulse generator, these experiments were conducted with a temperature set point of 80&#xb0; C. To mitigate the impact of treatment current as a confounding factor, the grounding pad was moved to obtain consistent mean currents, measured throughout the treatment (range: 18.3-21.1A) for these protocols. To achieve this, a single test waveform was delivered, and the grounding pad was moved accordingly to adjust the initial current to approximately 18A.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0312">Effect of Temperature Set Point on Thermal Injury</p><p id="p-0372" num="0313">To investigate the effect of ETT temperature set point on thermal injury 0.02 s IET 5000V treatments were administered with an R<sub>max </sub>of 500 &#x3bc;s/s and a perfusion flow rate of 2.0 mL/min with temperature set points of 40, 50, and 60&#xb0; C. In some actively cooled temperature-controlled treatments the measured temperature failed to reach the 40, 50, or 60&#xb0; C. target set points. This may have been due to deflection of the temperature sensor away from the electrode-tissue interface or elevated tissue impedance. These treatments were excluded from analysis and additional data points were acquired.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0314">Treatments comparing the ETT waveforms to those used by the clinical NK-IRE protocols were attempted, however, intense electrical arcing was observed for 100 &#x3bc;s monopolar waveforms in preliminary experiments at 4000V and these treatments were aborted to avoid damaging the pulse generator. Intense electrical arc was observed during the first 4 kV 100 &#x3bc;s electrical pulse delivered in these treatments. Stochastic filamentous corona was observed at the tip of the electrode observed in some 5 kV ETT treatments. All other protocols were repeated a minimum of three times (N=3), with the exception of the non-cooled 40&#xb0; C.

However, the rate of heat transfer from the tissue to the coolant was likely independent of this experimental input. Therefore, treatments with greater average power delivery (e.g. approximately 65 W) resulted in substantially larger regions of thermal injury surrounding the electrode than more conservative treatments (approximately 46 W). When initial treatment currents were constrained perfusion at rates of 2, 4, and 8 mL/min were sufficient to mitigate the induction of thermal damage which became increasingly localized to the tip of the electrode. Taken in summation, these results indicate that active cooling of electrodes may not be sufficient for generically preventing the induction of thermal injury as treatment currents in vivo are dynamic and depend on tissue characteristics, applicator arrangement, applicator placement, and local temperatures.</p><p id="p-0396" num="0333">The use of active temperature feedback by ACE from one, or multiple, locations is a potential solution to this challenge. In this study, it was demonstrated that dynamically adjusting the rate at which pulses are delivered is an effective method for achieving and maintaining a target temperature at the electrode-tissue interface. Without active cooling, the ACE algorithm was capable of maintaining temperatures of 30&#xb0; C. (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>A</figref>), 40&#xb0; C., 50&#xb0; C., 60&#xb0; C.

The mean current values measured were not statistically different (p=0.3989) in these treatments, however, the delivery rate (413 vs 87 &#x3bc;s/s) and thus average power delivered was much greater for the actively cooled treatments. It is likely that in this scenario, active perfusion was unable to remove enough energy to prevent thermal injury. It is possible that the temperature sensors were measuring an average temperature of both the cooled electrode surface and the warmer adjacent tissue resulting in a mischaracterization of the tissue temperature leading the algorithm to deliver energy at a higher rate than intended. To address this challenge, it may be necessary for future algorithms to implement a maximum power limit or use average power as a means for controlling the delivery rate. Alternatively, it may be necessary to record temperatures in locations where the thermal gradient is lower or at multiple locations. However, decreasing the temperature set point to 40&#xb0; C. in conjunction with active cooling resulted in negligible thermal injury with substantially reduced treatment times compared to the 50&#xb0; C. non-cooled treatments (54 versus 343 s) indicating that selection of appropriate temperature set points may be sufficient for preventing thermal damage.</p><p id="p-0398" num="0335">The R<sub>max </sub>used in this study (500 &#x3bc;s/s) represented an extreme case which is approximately 5&#xd7; the rate typically used clinically. This R<sub>max </sub>value was selected to examine the extent to which treatment times could be reduced to overcome the highly efficient removal of heat at the electrode-tissue interface and to test the limitations of the temperature control algorithm. While it may be feasible to use rates greater than 100 &#x3bc;s in vivo, caution should be exercised due to the potential to induce unintended thermal injury if temperature sensing is limited to the electrode-tissue interface. The results presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b>A to <b>31</b>C</figref> clearly demonstrate that thermal injury adjacent to the electrode is possible even if temperatures measured at the electrode are below 60&#xb0; C. In these scenarios there is likely an imbalance in the rate of Joule heating in the tissue surrounding the electrode and the rate of cooling due to electrode perfusion. As tissue is a relatively poor thermal conductor there is a natural limitation to the rate at which energy can be transferred through the tissue to the cooled electrode. This limitation is likely responsible for the observation (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>32</b>A to <b>32</b>D</figref>) that 5000V non-cooled treatments at 50&#xb0; C. resulted in similar thermal injury volumes to more rapid treatments with active cooling and a 40&#xb0; C. set point. Future work may be used to determine the ideal rate of pulse delivery and control schemes which utilize true energy or power delivery calculations rather than energized-timing calculations may be necessary.</p><p id="p-0399" num="0336">The localization of thermal injury towards the electrode tip may have been due to the internal geometry of the applicator which likely has a greater distance between the coolant and distal tip than the sidewalls of the electrode. Turbulent flow within the electrode at this location may have also impeded efficient thermal transfer. Alternatively, electrical corona may have formed at the sharp tip of the electrode resulting in an additional source of localized heating not present along the main body of the electrode. Corona were not observable through the opaque liver tissue, however, they appeared stochastically in preliminary experiments conducted with the applicator placed 1-2 mm from a visible surface in muscle tissue.</p><p id="p-0400" num="0337">Techniques for killing target cells and simultaneously reducing or eliminating thermal injury, tissue burning, tissue charring, nerve and/or blood vessel damage by adjusting the energy delivery profile in response to a measurement or a user-controlled input.</p><p id="p-0401" num="0338">The field strength required to induce a lethal electric field mediated response is relatively high, in the range of 300-2000 V/cm. To produce relatively large ablation zones (1-6 cm) with a single applicator requires the use of high voltage (500-20,000V) electrical pulses which induce a temperature increase through Joule (resistive) heating. In some scenarios, exposure to hypothermic temperatures is acceptable, or even favorable, however even in these scenario temperatures above 90-100&#xb0; C. can induce charring and arcing at the tissue-electrode interface which can impact treatment outcomes. In other scenarios, for example tumors which involve major blood vessels or critical nerves, thermal injury to critical structures is unwanted. One strategy for overcoming this is to select an energy delivery rate which is assumed to avoid excessive Joule heating. However, this generally requires some a priori knowledge of the tissue electrical properties and does not account for dynamic changes in electrical or physical properties of the tissue under treatment. Alternatively, sensing of the temperature or a proxy via a measurement technique (temperature sensor, tissue stiffness, ultrasound, MRI, imaging) can be used to dynamically adjust the rate at which energy is delivered in real time to reduce or eliminate thermal injury at the treatment site.</p><p id="p-0402" num="0339">Measuring the temperature of pulsed electric field treatments in situ is particularly challenging due to the high electric field emitted by the applicator electrode during treatment.

For example, wide bandgap semiconductors at the end of a fiber optic cable can be used to make temperature measurements in a high electric field environment.

In addition, the control algorithm can be adjusted to induce varying degrees of thermal damage in conjunction with an electrically induced ablation by modulating the target temperature of the coolant flowing through the application. These simulations indicate that it is possible to dynamically control ACE algorithms by acquiring measurements of a physical property of the tissue from a remote location. It is feasible that ultrasound, CT, MM, impedance, or mechanical measurements of the tissue could be used instead of temperature measurements of the coolant outlet temperature or the temperature at a specific location within or adjacent to the treatment zone. For example, MRI thermometry could be used to obtain a temperature measurement from the tissue adjacent to the applicator or a volumetric temperature measurement of the treatment zone. This data could be used by the algorithm to dynamically adjust the energy delivery rate such that thermal injury to the tissue is controlled, mitigated, minimized, or prevented.

The delay between these pulses may also be dynamically adjusted by the algorithm to reduce, mitigate, or eliminate muscle contractions based on a measurement or user input, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b>B</figref>. Also, the delay between successive waveforms (one or more positive pulse and one or more negative pulse) may be dynamically adjusted by the algorithm or by a user input, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b>C</figref>. It has been observed that for a given waveform (e.g. 2-5-2) decreasing the delay between successive waveforms (e.g. increasing the energy delivery rate) reduces the number of and intensity of muscle contractions. At moderate repetition rates (e.g. greater than 10 Hz) no muscle contractions or a single sustained muscle contraction is observed due to the induction of a tetanized state in the local muscles. Inversely, increasing the delay between successive waveforms (e.g. decreasing the energy delivery rate) occasionally results in the induction of individual visible muscle contractions.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0357">Algorithmically, a number of strategies could be employed to reduce or eliminate muscle contractions. One such example is as follows:</p><p id="p-0421" num="0358">Prior to treatment, an initial combination of pulse width, repetition rate, voltage, and target dose are selected. The target dose refers the integrated energized time associated with the energy delivered by the electrical pulses. The target dose is selected based on the target treatment volume, the voltage, and the pulse width. The treatment is initiated and upon measurement (or observation) of muscle contractions, the duration of each individual pulse is reduced by a proportional percentage (e.g. 10%). As treatment outcomes may be affected by the pulse width, a new target dose may be selected. To maintain an alternative physical outcome, biological outcome or systemic outcome (e.g., a tetanized state or a specified tissue temperature), the delay between successive waveforms may be adjusted to achieve a new specified energy delivery rate. These new treatment parameters are administered and measurements of (or observations of) muscle contractions are made and the treatment parameters are again adjusted. This process would be repeated until the target dose is administered.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0359">In some embodiments, a pre-treatment ramp-up algorithm may be employed. In this case, prior to treatment an initial combination of pulse widths (waveforms), repetition rates, voltage, and target dose are selected. Starting from a small voltage (e.g. 25V) the specified waveform is delivered once (or a small number of times) and the physiological response is observed. If muscle contractions are not measured (or observed), the voltage is algorithmically increased until a target treatment voltage is achieved. If muscle contractions are measured (or observed), voltage escalation is delayed and the pulse widths or delay between alternating polarity pulses is decreased until the intensity of muscle contractions is reduced to an acceptable level. Then, voltage escalation is resumed, modifying the pulse parameters as necessary, until the target treatment voltage is reached. A new target dose and repetition rate are calculated based on the treatment voltage and waveform parameters and the treatment is administered. This ramp up algorithm may be accompanied by an additional treatment algorithm for dynamically adjusting the treatment parameters based on additional measurements or observations. In order to demonstrate the control of localized tissue heating and muscle contraction mitigation, ACE has been demonstrated in two animal models, mice (murine) and horse (equine). The murine model has additionally been used to demonstrate a therapeutic tumor size reduction when ACE treatments are combined with antigen capturing nanoparticles.</p><p id="p-0423" num="0360">Methods</p><p id="p-0424" num="0361">Equine Methods</p><p id="p-0425" num="0362"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>39</b>A to <b>39</b>D</figref> are photos of an applicator used to validate ACE treatment in in vivo equine melanoma tumors, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.

Approximately 7-9 days later, tumors were measured around 4-8 mm in size and treated with ACE. For these tumors, a two needle electrode configuration was used (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B</figref>) and the voltage to distance ratio [V/cm] of the applied electrical pulses was maintained at 2500 V/cm based on the electrode separation. In most treatments, the center to center distance of the electrical needles was adjusted to either 4 mm or 6 mm, depending on tumor size. The needle exposure was typically 6 mm, was adjusted for smaller or larger tumors. A fiber optic temperature probe was inserted between the two electrode needles such that a remote temperature measurement was acquired on the surface of the skin. This measurement was used as a proxy for inter-tumoral temperature and used as a feedback measurement for the ACE algorithm. The maximum rate of energy delivery was set to be either 100 &#x3bc;s/s or 200 &#x3bc;s/s depending on the target temperature. Prior to treatment, a baseline temperature measurement (typically 29-30&#xb0; C.) was acquired. The algorithm was then programmed to achieve a target temperature which was 5&#xb0; C., 10&#xb0; C., or 20&#xb0; C. above the baseline temperature.

Slight twitching or muscle contractions were observed during the ramp-up procedure in which only a single waveform was delivered. This typically subsided during the full treatment as a tetanic state was induced. Individual muscle twitches were occasionally observed as the treatment temperature approached the target set point (60&#xb0; C.) and the energy delivery rate was algorithmically reduced to maintain the target temperature. In some treatments, muscle contractions were mitigated by increasing the target temperature thereby increasing the steady state energy delivery rate (pulse repetition rate) or by decreasing the pulse width which had the effect of increasing the pulse repetition rate to maintain the algorithmically determined energy delivery rate.</p><p id="p-0437" num="0374">Immediately following treatment, slight dermal abrasion corresponding to the location of the ring electrode and black discharge from the insertion sites were occasionally observed. Photographic follow up indicates that in the days following treatment the tumor volume decreased followed by the formation of a dermal scab and generation of depigmented skin at the treatment site. At treatment follow up (typically 3-6 weeks) gentle scrubbing of scab at the treatment site was sufficient to remove the scab and expose a vascularized region of healing dermal tissue. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>41</b>A to <b>41</b>D</figref> are graphs of representative data recorded from the ACE treatment of a single tumor, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>41</b>A to <b>41</b>D</figref> illustrate measurements of current (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b>A</figref>), resistance (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b>B</figref>), and temperature (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b>C</figref>) during treatment indicate a temperature and dose dependent change (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b>D</figref>) in the impedance-to-temperature ratio which may be beneficial in determining a treatment end point.

The magnitude of this transient is dependent on a number of parameters including the electrical properties of the cell and its environment, the magnitude of the local electric field, and the time domain characteristics of the pulses. Similarly, the biological responses following PEF exposure are dependent on a complex combination of stochastic energy dependent phenomena. These range in severity and include the absence of a measurable response, disruption of mitotic spindle formation, temporary permeabilization of the cell membrane, induction of apoptosis, and outright membrane disruption leading to a necrotic form of cell death.</p><p id="p-0449" num="0386">Clinical PEF treatments leading to the destruction of unwanted tissue (ablation) are generally referred to as irreversible electroporation (IRE) due to the presumed induction of permanent defects in the cell membrane caused by the electrical pulses. These IRE treatments are rapidly gaining traction as a clinical treatment for inoperable tumors, especially in cases where surgical, radiological, and thermal procedures are contraindicated. The success of the only FDA approved intervention, the NanoKnife (NK-IRE), has led to interest in improving the technique. Of note the NK-IRE may be limited in the size of tumors which can feasibly be treated due to the induction of intense muscle contractions by the 50-100 &#x3bc;s electrical pulses delivered, electrical arcing between probe pairs, and by the potential to induce unintended thermal injury due to a lack of active feedback during energy delivery.</p><p id="p-0450" num="0387">These limitations have led to investigations of microsecond duration alternating polarity pulses as an alternative strategy. These high frequency irreversible electroporation (H-FIRE) protocols mitigate muscle contractions, reduce the potential for electrical arcing, and enable the use of significantly higher treatment voltages[9]. However, these treatments generally require greater electric field strength, possibly due to a proposed cancelation effect, to induce lethal effects and result in smaller treatment zones than NK-IRE when treatment voltages and doses are held constant.</p><p id="p-0451" num="0388">This leads to some question as to whether or not microsecond or nanosecond pulses can achieve the same degree of clinical utility as the 50-100 &#x3bc;s pulses used in NK-IRE. Here, a potential alternative strategy is investigated, integrated time nanosecond pulse irreversible electroporation, substantially similar to the ACE treatments described herein, in which the stochastic nature of PEF responses is exploited by delivering significantly larger electrical doses (integrated times) than common with NK-IRE. The results show that while NK-IRE ablation sizes appear to reach a steady state, ACE ablations increase sequentially with integrated times of 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 s. Computational models were used to investigate the charging/discharging behavior of cell membranes during exposure to ACE treatments and to determine the treatment voltages and overall treatment durations that would be necessary for ACE to achieve equivalent ablation sizes as NK-IRE clinically. For experiments conducted at physiological temperatures, 0.01 s IET ACE treatments with 350 ns, 500 ns, and 750 ns pulses require electric field intensities of 1109V/cm, 954 V/cm, and 698V/cm, respectively, to induce cell death. To achieve similar ablation volumes as NK-IRE these protocols would require the use of 6.7 kV, 5.8 kV, and 4.2 kV pulses, respectively. To inhibit significant thermal injury adjacent to the electrode, 44&#xb0; C. temperature-controlled treatments were simulated and required 1190 s, 870 s, and 450 s, respectively, to achieve identical ablation volumes to standard 100 s 3 kV NK-IRE protocols.</p><p id="p-0452" num="0389">Methods</p><p id="p-0453" num="0390">Cell Culture and 3D Tumor Model</p><p id="p-0454" num="0391">Due to interest in utilizing PEFs for the treatment of brain tumors where thermal transients can be especially deleterious, U118 human glioblastoma cells were utilized in this study.

In some embodiments, the positive and negative pulses may be on the order of microseconds. This alternating polarity waveform is designed to mitigate muscle contractions in vivo.

The minimum pulse width corresponded to the minimum pulse with achievable with the custom H-Bridge pulse generator utilized in this study. The delay between successive waveforms was algorithmically controlled such that transient temperature increases of 5&#xb0; C. were achieved and maintained. The delay between successive waveforms was controlled algorithmically based on temperature readings.
