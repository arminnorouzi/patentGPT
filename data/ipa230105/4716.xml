As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the method includes the following implementation steps:</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">step <b>101</b>: adding, in a process of training a pre-trained model using training sentences, a learning objective corresponding to syntactic information for a self-attention module (self-attention mechanism) in the pre-trained model; and</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">step <b>102</b>: training the pre-trained model according to the learning objective.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is observed that, in the solution of the above-mentioned method embodiment, the syntactic information may be used for guiding the training operation of the pre-trained model, such that the pre-trained model learns the syntactic information, thus improving a performance of the pre-trained model, and reducing consumption of computing resources, or the like.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Usually, the pre-trained model is a pre-trained model based on a transformer architecture, and the self-attention module is a quite important module in the pre-trained model.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the method according to the present disclosure, an additional subtask learning operation is introduced to regularize a learning operation of the self-attention module, and reference is made to the syntactic information in the regularized design, such that the pre-trained model may learn the syntactic information.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">That is, in the process of training the pre-trained model using the training sentences, the learning objective corresponding to the syntactic information may be defined for the self-attention module in the pre-trained model.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The learning objective may include one or both of a first learning objective and a second learning objective. That is, only the first learning objective may be defined, or only the second learning objective may be defined, or the first learning objective and the second learning objective may be defined simultaneously, which is determined according to actual needs, thus achieving a quite flexible and convenient effect.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The first learning objective and the second learning objective are specifically described below respectively.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">1) First Learning Objective</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For any term x in the training sentence, a first weight corresponding to the term x is required to be greater than a second weight. The first weight is an attention weight between the term x and any term y which is associated with the term x through a direct path in a dependency tree corresponding to the training sentence, and the second weight is an attention weight between the term x and any term z which is associated with the term x through a weak path or is not associated therewith through a path in the dependency tree.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The association through the direct path may mean that the term is located on a same path as and downstream of the term x, and directly connected therewith by one edge, or the term is located on the same path as the term x and directly connected therewith by one edge.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The association through the weak path may mean that the term is located on the same path as and downstream of the term x, and indirectly connected therewith by at least two edges, or the term is located on the same path as the term x and indirectly connected therewith by at least two edges.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The no-path association means that the term is not located on the same path as the term x.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">For ease of expression/distinction, the above-mentioned different terms are referred to as the term x, the term y, and the term z respectively.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The syntactic information gives information of a syntactic structure among terms, and the terms with a shorter syntactic path have a higher dependency degree; that is, parents are more likely to be represented by immediate children. Based on this, it may be assumed that, for any given term x, the attention weight between the term x and any term y which is associated with the term x through the direct path in the dependency tree is greater than the attention weight between the term x and any term z which is associated with the term x through the weak path or is not associated therewith through a path in the dependency tree.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Any training sentence may include a plurality of terms; for example, the training sentence &#x201c;Bai* (representing a company name) acquires a high-tech company&#x201d; may include terms &#x201c;Bai*&#x201d;, &#x201c;acquire&#x201d;, &#x201c;one&#x201d;, &#x201c;high-tech&#x201d;, and &#x201c;company&#x201d;. In addition, a dependency tree corresponding to the training sentence may be constructed using an existing method, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the dependency tree according to the present disclosure. The dependency tree may reflect dependencies between the terms in the training sentence.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, the term x is &#x201c;company&#x201d; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the term y may be &#x201c;one&#x201d; or &#x201c;high-tech&#x201d;, and it is observed that &#x201c;one&#x201d; or &#x201c;high-tech&#x201d; is located on the same path as and downstream of &#x201c;company&#x201d; (i.e., a child node of &#x201c;company&#x201d;), and directly connected with &#x201c;company&#x201d; by one edge; the term z may be &#x201c;Bai*&#x201d;, and it is observed that &#x201c;Bai*&#x201d; is not located on the same path as &#x201c;company&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A direction of the edge is considered in the above processing method, and if the direction of the edge is not considered, for example, the term xis still &#x201c;company&#x201d; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and the term y may be &#x201c;one&#x201d;, &#x201c;high-tech&#x201d;, or &#x201c;acquire&#x201d;, that is, is located on the same path as &#x201c;company&#x201d; and directly connected therewith by one edge.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Assuming that a child node is further included under &#x201c;one&#x201d; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the term corresponding to the node may also be taken as the term z which is a term associated with &#x201c;company&#x201d; through a weak path.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As described above, for the term x, the first weight and the second weight may be obtained, the first weight may be the attention weight between the term y and the term x, and the second weight may be the attention weight between the term z and the term x.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In practical applications, the self-attention mechanism may include plural layers, and may be a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and for each term in the same training sentence, under each head of each layer, each term has an attention weight for each of other terms (which may include itself), and a method of obtaining the attention weight is a prior art.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Assuming that a current layer is layer j, 1&#x2264;j&#x2264;L, L represents a number of the layers, and a number of heads is 8, taking the term x and the term y as examples, 8 attention weights exist between the term y and the term x, and correspond to 8 heads respectively, and correspondingly, an average of the 8 attention weights may be calculated, and the obtained average is taken as the required first weight. In a same manner, the required second weight may be obtained.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Using the above-mentioned attention weights, an attention weight matrix may be further obtained, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the attention weight matrix according to the present disclosure, in which a number of squares is equal to the number of the terms included in the training sentence, each square represents the attention weight between two terms, and colors of the squares represent sizes of different attention weights.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For the term x, the first weight is required to be greater (generally, much greater (&#x3e;&#x3e;)) than the second weight, and a specific value may be determined according to actual needs.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">2) Second Learning Objective</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">For any subtree in the dependency tree corresponding to the training sentence, a first similarity corresponding to any core term in the subtree is required to be greater than a second similarity, and a third similarity corresponding to the subtree is required to be greater than a fourth similarity.
