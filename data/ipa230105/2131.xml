More particularly, the disclosure relates to water soluble nonwoven web for packaging harsh chemical compositions.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Water soluble packaging materials are commonly used to simplify dispersing, pouring, dissolving and dosing of a material to be delivered. Traditional packaging materials include water soluble films and pouches made therefrom are commonly used to package compositions such as laundry, dish detergents or harsh chemicals. A consumer can directly add the pouched composition to water. Advantageously, this provides for accurate dosing while eliminating the need for the consumer to measure the composition. Traditional water soluble films can interact with the pouch components (e.g., harsh chemicals) or environmental moisture, which can affect the properties of the film, for example, the solubility of the film can decrease over time when stored in contact with such chemicals, resulting in undesirable residue remaining after a dosing and/or the mechanical properties of the film may deteriorate over time. In another type of problem, water soluble films may discolor when stored in contact with harsh chemicals. In another type of problem, water soluble films prepared from water soluble polymers may stick to processing equipment and/or other water soluble films. Such problems may particularly arise when the film is formed into pouches and the pouches are stored together in secondary packaging. In addition, some currently marketed pouches made of water soluble polymeric films have an unpleasant rubbery or plastic-like feel when handled by the consumer. In another type of problem, when water soluble pouches are provided to, e.g., bulk water, the water soluble pouches may release the contents in such a way that a localized concentration of contents is provided, rather than providing a more homogeneous distribution of the contents throughout the bulk solution.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, there exists a need in the art for water soluble packaging that is pleasant to handle, quickly releases the pouch contents to provide a more homogeneous distribution, and which can remain water soluble after storing in contact with the pouch contents while having a reduced tendency to stick to other water soluble packaging.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One aspect of the disclosure provides unit dose articles comprising a packet comprising an outer wall, the outer wall having an exterior surface and an interior surface defining an interior pouch volume, the outer wall comprising a nonwoven web comprising a plurality of fibers comprising a sulfonate modified PVOH fiber forming material comprising a sulfonated anionic monomer unit wherein the sulfonate modified PVOH fiber forming material has a degree of hydrolysis of at least 95% and the sulfonated anionic monomer is present in an amount in a range of about 1 mol % to about 5 mol %; and a composition contained in the interior pouch volume.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another aspect of the disclosure provides unit dose articles comprising a packet comprising an outer wall, the outer wall having an exterior surface and an interior surface defining an interior pouch volume, the outer wall comprising a nonwoven web comprising a plurality of fibers comprising a blend of fiber forming materials comprising (i) polyvinylpyrrolidone, and (ii) a sulfonate modified polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), a carboxyl modified PVOH, or both; and a composition contained in the interior pouch volume.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another aspect of the disclosure provides unit dose articles of the disclosure, wherein a pool and/or water-treatment composition is contained in the interior pouch volume, the pool and/or water-treatment composition comprises an oxidant, and the concentration of the oxidant in the pool and/or water treatment composition is in a range of 50% to 100% by weight; and wherein the oxidant comprises calcium hypochlorite, and the packet optionally comprises a first coating comprising an acid scavenger provided on at least a portion of the interior surface of the outer wall.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another aspect of the disclosure provides unit dose articles of the disclosure, wherein a pool and/or water-treatment composition is contained in the interior pouch volume, the pool and/or water-treatment composition comprises an oxidant, and the concentration of the oxidant in the pool and/or water treatment composition is in a range of 50% to 100% by weight; and wherein the oxidant comprises trichloroisocyanuric acid, and the packet optionally comprises a first coating comprising an acid scavenger provided on at least a portion of the interior surface of the outer wall.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect of the disclosure provides processes for dosing a composition to bulk water comprising the steps of contacting with the bulk water a unit dose article according to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For the compositions described herein, optional features, including but not limited to components and compositional ranges thereof, fiber forming materials, multiple layer constructions, fiber geometries, and/or mechanical properties are contemplated to be selected from the various aspects and embodiments provided herein.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further aspects and advantages will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the following detailed description.

In embodiments, the fiber forming materials are water soluble. In embodiments, the fibers are water soluble.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In general, the fibers of the disclosure include at least one polyvinyl alcohol fiber forming material. Polyvinyl alcohol is a synthetic polymer generally prepared by the alcoholysis, usually termed hydrolysis or saponification, of polyvinyl acetate. Fully hydrolyzed PVOH, where virtually all the acetate groups have been converted to alcohol groups, is a strongly hydrogen-bonded, highly crystalline polymer which dissolves only in hot water&#x2014;greater than about 140&#xb0; F. (about 60&#xb0; C.). If a sufficient number of acetate groups are allowed to remain after the hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate, that is the PVOH polymer is partially hydrolyzed, then the polymer is more weakly hydrogen-bonded, less crystalline, and is generally soluble in cold water&#x2014;less than about 50&#xb0; F. (about 10&#xb0; C.). As such, the partially hydrolyzed polymer is a vinyl alcohol-vinyl acetate copolymer that is a PVOH copolymer, but is commonly referred to as PVOH.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The polyvinyl alcohol can be a modified polyvinyl alcohol, for example, a copolymer. The modified polyvinyl alcohol can include a co-polymer or higher polymer (e.g., ter-polymer) including one or more monomers in addition to the vinyl acetate/vinyl alcohol groups. Optionally, the modification is neutral, e.g., provided by an ethylene, propylene, N-vinylpyrrolidone or other non-charged monomer species. Optionally, the modification is a cationic modification, e.g., provided by a positively charged monomer species. Optionally, the modification is an anionic modification. Thus, in some embodiments, the polyvinyl alcohol includes an anionic modified polyvinyl alcohol. An anionic modified polyvinyl alcohol can include a partially or fully hydrolyzed PVOH copolymer that includes an anionic monomer unit, a vinyl alcohol monomer unit, and optionally a vinyl acetate monomer unit (i.e., when not completely hydrolyzed). In some embodiments, the PVOH copolymer can include two or more types of anionic monomer units. General classes of anionic monomer units which can be used for the PVOH copolymer include the vinyl polymerization units corresponding to sulfonic acid vinyl monomers and their esters, monocarboxylic acid vinyl monomers, their esters and anhydrides, dicarboxylic monomers having a polymerizable double bond, their esters and anhydrides, and alkali metal salts of any of the foregoing. Examples of suitable anionic monomer units include the vinyl polymerization units corresponding to vinyl anionic monomers including vinyl acetic acid, maleic acid, monoalkyl maleate, dialkyl maleate, maleic anhydride, fumaric acid, monoalkyl fumarate, dialkyl fumarate, itaconic acid, monoalkyl itaconate, dialkyl itaconate, citraconic acid, monoalkyl citraconate, dialkyl citraconate, citraconic anhydride, mesaconic acid, monoalkyl mesaconate, dialkyl mesaconate, glutaconic acid, monoalkyl glutaconate, dialkyl glutaconate, glutaconic anhydride, alkyl acrylates, alkyl alkacrylates, vinyl sulfonic acid, allyl sulfonic acid, ethylene sulfonic acid, 2-acrylamido-1-methyl propane sulfonic acid, 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid (AMPS), 2-methylacrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid, 2-sulfoethyl acrylate, alkali metal salts of the foregoing (e.g., sodium, potassium, or other alkali metal salts), esters of the foregoing (e.g., methyl, ethyl, or other C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4 </sub>or C<sub>6 </sub>alkyl esters), and combinations of the foregoing (e.g., multiple types of anionic monomers or equivalent forms of the same anionic monomer). In some embodiments, the PVOH copolymer can include two or more types of monomer units selected from neutral, anionic, and cationic monomer units.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The level of incorporation (degree of modification) of the one or more anionic monomer units in the PVOH copolymers is not particularly limited. In embodiments, the one or more anionic monomer units are present in the PVOH copolymer in an amount in a range of about 1 mol. % or 2 mol. % to about 6 mol. % or 10 mol. % (e.g., at least 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, or 4.0 mol. % and/or up to about 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, or 10 mol. % in various embodiments). In embodiments, the one or more anionic monomer units are present in the PVOH copolymer in an amount in a range of about 1 mol. % to 10 mol %, or about 1 mol % to 8 mol %, or about 1 mol % to 5 mol %, about 2 mol. % to about 6 mol. %, about 3 mol. % to about 5 mol. %, or about 1 mol. % to about 3 mol. %.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The degree of hydrolysis (DH) of the PVOH homopolymers and PVOH copolymers included in the water soluble fibers and nonwoven webs of the present disclosure can be in a range of about 75% to about 99.9% (e.g., about 79% to about 92%, about 80% to about 90%, about 88% to 92%, about 86.5% to about 89%, or about 88%, 90% or 92% such as for cold-water soluble compositions; about 90% to about 99%, about 92% to about 99%, about 95% to about 99%, about 98% to about 99%, about 98% to about 99.9%, about 96%, about 98%, about 99%, or greater than 99%). The DH, while specifically is a measure of the amount of acetates removed from the polyvinyl acetate polymer (e.g. via hydrolysis, saponification), it is most commonly used to understand the amount of acetate remaining on the PVOH polymer or copolymer. The acetate groups form the amorphous or non-crystalline regions of the PVOH copolymer. Therefore, it can be stated as an approximation, the higher the DH, the relatively higher is the crystallinity of the PVOH copolymer or blends of the PVOH copolymer. When a PVOH resin is described as having (or not having) a particular DH, unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the specified DH is the average DH for the PVOH resin.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In general, as the degree of hydrolysis is reduced, a fiber or nonwoven web made from the polymer will have reduced mechanical strength but faster solubility at temperatures below about 20&#xb0; C. As the degree of hydrolysis increases, a fiber or nonwoven web made from the polymer will tend to be mechanically stronger and the thermoformability will tend to decrease. The degree of hydrolysis of the PVOH can be chosen such that the water-solubility of the polymer is temperature dependent, and thus the solubility of a fiber and/or nonwoven web made from the polymer and additional ingredients is also influenced. In one option the nonwoven web is cold water soluble. For a co-poly(vinyl acetate vinyl alcohol) polymer that does not include any other monomers (e.g., a homopolymer not copolymerized with an anionic monomer) a cold water soluble fiber or nonwoven web, soluble in water at a temperature of less than 10&#xb0; C., can include PVOH with a degree of hydrolysis in a range of about 75% to about 90%, or in a range of about 80% to about 90%, or in a range of about 85% to about 90%. In another option the fiber or nonwoven web is hot water soluble. For a co-poly(vinyl acetate vinyl alcohol) polymer that does not include any other monomers (e.g., a homopolymer not copolymerized with an anionic monomer) a hot water soluble fiber or nonwoven web, soluble in water at a temperature of at least about 60&#xb0; C., can include PVOH with a degree of hydrolysis of at least about 98%.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The degree of hydrolysis of a polymer blend can also be characterized by the arithmetic weighted, average degree of hydrolysis (<o ostyle="single">H&#xb0;</o>). For example, <o ostyle="single">H&#xb0;</o> for a PVOH polymer that includes two or more PVOH polymers is calculated by the formula <o ostyle="single">H&#xb0;</o>=&#x3a3;(Wi&#xb7;H<sub>i</sub>) where W<sub>i </sub>is the weight percentage of the respective PVOH polymer and H<sub>i </sub>is the respective degrees of hydrolysis. When a polymer is referred to as having a specific degree of hydrolysis, the polymer can be a single polyvinyl alcohol polymer having the specified degree of hydrolysis or a blend of polyvinyl alcohol polymers having an average degree of hydrolysis as specified.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The viscosity of a PVOH polymer (&#x3bc;) is determined by measuring a freshly made solution using a Brookfield LV type viscometer with UL adapter as described in British Standard EN ISO 15023-2:2006 Annex E Brookfield Test method. It is international practice to state the viscosity of 4% aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solutions at 20&#xb0; C. All viscosities specified herein in Centipoise (cP) should be understood to refer to the viscosity of 4% aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution at 20&#xb0; C., unless specified otherwise. Similarly, when a polymer is described as having (or not having) a particular viscosity, unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the specified viscosity is the average viscosity for the polymer, which inherently has a corresponding molecular weight distribution, i.e. the weighted natural log average viscosity as described below. It is well known in the art that the viscosity of PVOH polymers is correlated with the weight average molecular weight (<o ostyle="single">M</o>w) of the PVOH polymer, and often the viscosity is used as a proxy for the <o ostyle="single">M</o>w.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In embodiments, the PVOH resin may have a viscosity of about 1.0 to about 50.0 cPs, about 1.0 to about 40.0 cPs, or about 1.0 to about 30.0 cPs, for example about 4 cPs, 8 cPs, 15 cPs, 18 cPs, 23 cPs, or 26 cPs. In embodiments, the PVOH copolymers may have a viscosity of about 1.0 to about 30.0 cPs for example, about 1 cPs, 1.5 cPs, 2 cPs, 2.5 cPs, 3 cPs, 3.5 cPs, 4 cPs, 4.5 cPs, 5 cPs, 5.5 cPs, 6 cPs, 6.5 cPs, 7 cPs, 7.5 cPs, 8 cPs, 8.5 cPs, 9 cPs, 9.5 cPs, 10 cPs, 11 cPs, 12 cPs, 13 cPs, 14 cPs, 15 cPs, 17.5 cPs, 18 cPs, 19 cPs, 20 cPs, 21 cPs, 22 cPs, 23 cPs, 24 cPs, 25 cPs, 26 cPs, 27 cPs, 28 cPs, 29 cPs, 30 cPs, 31 cPs, 32 cPs, 33 cPs, 34 cPs, or 35 cPs. In embodiments, the PVOH copolymers may have a viscosity of about 21 cPs to 26 cPs. In embodiments, the PVOH copolymers can have a viscosity of about 5 cPs to about 14 cPs.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Polyvinyl alcohols can be subject to changes in solubility characteristics. The acetate group in the co-poly(vinyl acetate vinyl alcohol) polymer (PVOH homopolymer) is known by those skilled in the art to be hydrolysable by either acid or alkaline hydrolysis. As the degree of hydrolysis increases, a polymer composition made from the PVOH homopolymer will have increased mechanical strength but reduced solubility at lower temperatures (e.g., requiring hot water temperatures for complete dissolution). Accordingly, exposure of a PVOH homopolymer to an alkaline environment can transform the polymer from one which dissolves rapidly and entirely in a given aqueous environment (e.g., a cold water medium) to one which dissolves slowly and/or incompletely in the aqueous environment, potentially resulting in undissolved polymeric residue.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">PVOH copolymers with pendant carboxyl groups, such as, for example, maleate modified PVOH, can form lactone rings between neighboring pendant carboxyl and alcohol groups, thus reducing the water solubility of the PVOH copolymer. In the presence of a strong base, the lactone rings can open over the course of several weeks at relatively warm (ambient) and high humidity conditions (e.g., via lactone ring-opening reactions to form the corresponding pendant carboxyl and alcohol groups with increased water solubility). Thus, contrary to the effect observed with PVOH homopolymers, it is believed that such a PVOH copolymer can become more soluble due to chemical interactions between the polymer and an alkaline composition inside the pouch during storage.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Specific sulfonates and derivatives thereof having polymerizable vinyl bonds can be copolymerized with vinyl acetate to provide cold-water soluble PVOH polymers which are stable in the presence of strong bases. The base-catalyzed alcoholysis products of these copolymers, which can be used in the formulation of water soluble fibers, are vinyl alcohol-sulfonate salt copolymers which are rapidly soluble. The sulfonate group in the PVOH copolymer can revert to a sulfonic acid group in the presence of hydrogen ions, but the sulfonic acid group still provides excellent cold-water solubility of the polymer. In embodiments, vinyl alcohol-sulfonate salt copolymers contain no residual acetate groups (i.e., are fully hydrolyzed) and therefore are not further hydrolysable by either acid or alkaline hydrolysis. Generally, as the amount of modification increases, the water solubility increases, thus sufficient modification via sulfonate or sulfonic acid groups inhibit hydrogen bonding and crystallinity, enabling solubility in cold water. In the presence of acidic or basic species, the copolymer is generally unaffected, with the exception of the sulfonate or sulfonic acid groups, which maintain excellent cold water solubility even in the presence of acidic or basic species. Examples of suitable sulfonic acid comonomers (and/or their alkali metal salt derivatives) include vinyl sulfonic acid, allyl sulfonic acid, ethylene sulfonic acid, 2-acrylamido-1-methylpropanesulfonic acid, 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesufonic acid, 2-methacrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid and 2-sulfoethyl acrylate, with the sodium salt of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid (AMPS) being a preferred comonomer.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The water soluble polymers, whether polyvinyl alcohol polymers or otherwise, can be blended. When the polymer blend includes a blend of polyvinyl alcohol polymers, the PVOH polymer blend can include a first PVOH polymer (&#x201c;first PVOH polymer&#x201d;) which can include a PVOH homopolymer or a PVOH copolymer including one or more types of anionic monomer units (e.g., a PVOH ter- (or higher co-) polymer) and a second PVOH polymer (&#x201c;second PVOH polymer&#x201d;) which can include a PVOH homopolymer or a PVOH copolymer including one or more types of anionic monomer units (e.g., a PVOH ter- (or higher co-) polymer). In some aspects, the PVOH polymer blend includes only the first PVOH polymer and the second PVOH polymer (e.g., a binary blend of the two polymers). Alternatively or additionally, the PVOH polymer blend or a fiber or nonwoven web made therefrom can be characterized as being free or substantially free from other polymers (e.g., other water soluble polymers generally, other PVOH-based polymers specifically, or both). As used herein, &#x201c;substantially free&#x201d; means that the first and second PVOH polymers make up at least 95 wt. %, at least 97 wt. %, or at least 99 wt. % of the total amount of water soluble polymers in the water soluble fiber or nonwoven web. In other aspects, the water soluble fiber or nonwoven web can include one or more additional water soluble polymers. For example, the PVOH polymer blend can include a third PVOH polymer, a fourth PVOH polymer, a fifth PVOH polymer, etc. (e.g., one or more additional PVOH homopolymers or PVOH copolymers, with or without anionic monomer units). For example, the water soluble nonwoven web can include at least a third (or fourth, fifth, etc.) water soluble polymer which is other than a PVOH polymer (e.g., other than PVOH homopolymers or PVOH copolymers, with or without anionic monomer units).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Water soluble polymers other than a PVOH polymer can include, but are not limited to, polyacrylate, water soluble acrylate copolymer, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethyleneimine, pullulan, water soluble natural polymer including, but not limited to, guar gum, gum Acacia, xanthan gum, carrageenan, and starch, water soluble polymer derivatives including, but not limited to, modified starches, ethoxylated starch, and hydroxypropylated starch, copolymers of the forgoing and combinations of any of the foregoing.

In embodiments, the carboxyl modified PVOH comprises a maleate monomer unit selected from the group consisting of monomethyl maleate, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, alkali salts thereof, and a combination thereof. Thus, in embodiments, the carboxyl modified PVOH comprises a maleate modified PVOH. As used herein, and unless specified otherwise, a &#x201c;maleate modified PVOH&#x201d; refers to a polyvinyl alcohol including monomer units resulting from polymerization with monomers selected from the group consisting of maleic acid, monoalkyl maleate, dialkyl maleate, and/or maleic anhydride.

Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the AMPS modifications can inhibit acid induced crosslinking of the PVOH, which can cause reduced solubility of the nonwoven in water and the AMPS modification and/or the maleate modification can inhibit acid/base induced polyene formation (condensation reactions) that can cause the nonwoven to yellow undesirably.

There have been many studies that have been devoted to the determination of the molecular weight of PVP polymer. The low molecular weight polymers have narrower distribution curves of molecular entities than the high molecular weight compounds. Some of the techniques for measuring the molecular weight of various PVP polymer products are based on measuring sedimentation, light scattering, osmometry, NMR spectroscopy, ebullimometry, and size exclusion chromatography for determining absolute molecular weight distribution. By the use of these methods, any one of three molecular weight parameters can be measured, namely the number average (Mn), viscosity average (Mv), and weight average (Mw). Each of these characteristics can yield a different answer for the same polymer. Therefore, in any review of the literature, one must know which molecular average is cited.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In embodiments, the polyvinylpyrrolidone can have a weight average molecular weight (<o ostyle="single">M</o>w) of at least about 3,000 g/mol.

The weight average molecular weight can be determined by those skilled in the art, for example, by methods such as size exclusion chromatography (gel permeation chromatography). When a PVP resin is described as having (or not having) a particular molecular weight, unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the specified molecular weight is the average molecular weight for the resin, which inherently has a corresponding molecular weight distribution.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that high Mw PVP polymers as disclosed herein are advantageous as they are resistant to migration out of the nonwoven when the nonwoven is in contact with dry and/or hygroscopic components. It is believed that the higher the Mw, the more entangled the individual polymer chains can become such that the PVP chains are less likely to separate from other components of the nonwoven and migrate out of the film.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The PVP polymer can provide a number of advantages when added as a fiber forming material to a fiber of the nonwoven web described herein. For example, without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the pyrrolidone functional groups of the PVP polymer can act as an acid trap and/or a pH buffer, reacting with H<sup>+</sup> ions from the harsh chemicals (shown below in Scheme 1), thereby hindering acid induced cross-linking and discoloration of the polyvinyl alcohol. Further, PVOH homopolymer or copolymer nonwoven webs in contact with harsh chemicals typically become brittle over time, as the harsh chemicals draw out water and/or plasticizers from the nonwoven web. The harsh chemicals can be hygroscopic, which can result in the absorption other polar solvents and materials, such as commonly used as plasticizers. However, advantageously, the combination of the PVOH copolymer and the PVP in the fiber forming materials described herein can help prevent the nonwoven web from becoming brittle in the presence of harsh chemicals. The PVP in the nonwovens described herein can act similar to a plasticizer but is resistant to being drawn out of the nonwoven web by harsh chemicals. The PVP can also allow the nonwoven webs herein to maintain flexibility, even when the films include relatively low amounts of traditional plasticizer content and water content.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="46.31mm" wi="75.35mm" file="US20230002132A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">As described herein, the combination of sulfonate modified PVOH and carboxyl modified PVOH can advantageously provide resistance to degradation in the presence of harsh chemicals, such as acids, oxidants or bases.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">As described herein, the sulfonate modified PVOH can advantageously provide resistance to degradation of the nonwoven in the presence of harsh chemicals, such as base-mediated oxidants. As used herein, the term &#x201c;base-mediated oxidant&#x201d; refers to an oxidant that oxidizes another chemical species using a basic mechanistic pathway to oxidation. A basic mechanistic pathway to oxidation refers a pathway wherein a base, such as <sup>&#x2212;</sup>OH, initiates or catalyzes the oxidation reaction of the reagent. For example, sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, and monovalent and divalent salts having similar structures to sodium hypochlorite and calcium hypochlorite are considered base-mediated oxidants.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">As described herein, the combination of PVOH and PVP can advantageously provide resistance to degradation in the presence of harsh chemicals, such as acids, oxidants or bases. For example, when PVOH is used as the sole resin, the harsh chemical can react with the PVOH to degrade the nonwoven web quickly. In contrast, it has been advantageously found that the combination of PVOH and PVP can stop or at least slow the degradation of the nonwoven web. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the pyrrolidone functional groups of the PVP can act as an acid trap, interacting with H<sup>+</sup> ions from the harsh chemicals, preventing the H<sup>+</sup> ions from promoting acid catalyzed elimination of the hydroxyl units of the vinyl alcohol, thereby hindering degradation of the polyvinyl alcohol. Conventional water soluble PVOH films have a tendency to degrade in the presence of harsh chemicals, such as chlorinated sanitizing agents and other oxidative chemicals, acids, and certain bases. Excessive oxidation causes the films to become insoluble in water, thus making them ineffective for unit-dose packaging agents. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the hypochlorite ions produced by certain harsh chemicals oxidize the pendant &#x2014;OH moieties in the PVOH copolymer film, creating carbonyl groups on the polymer backbone. The carbonyl group is an intermediate step toward polyene formation (and yellowing) as it creates an acidic alpha hydrogen. The carbonyl group is also an intermediate to chain scission. Additionally, hydrochloric acid produced by certain harsh chemicals may react with the hydroxyl group to create unsaturated bonds in the polymer backbone which can cause decreased solubility in water as well as discoloration in the film. In either event, the removal of the pendant &#x2014;OH groups makes the films increasingly insoluble in water.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">Nonwoven webs including typical PVOH homopolymers or copolymers as the sole fiber forming materials in contact with harsh chemicals advantageously do not become brittle, as residual water migrates out of the nonwoven web in the presence of the harsh chemicals; however, such loss of water can result in shrinking of the fibers and, ultimately, the nonwoven web. Further advantageously, the sulfonate modified PVOH and/or the PVP can act similar to a rheology modifier for the carboxyl modified PVOH, allowing control over the flow of the fiber forming material during fiber production, as well as imparting chemical compatibility to the carboxyl modified PVOH in the presence of harsh chemicals by inhibiting the decomposition of the carboxyl modified PVOH by the harsh chemical.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">The water soluble nonwoven web described herein can include the carboxyl modified PVOH fiber forming material and the sulfonate modified PVOH and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone fiber forming materials can be provided in a weight ratio of about 3:1 to about 19:1, respectively.

Thus, any reference herein to, for example, a &#x201c;melt blown fiber&#x201d; or a &#x201c;carded nonwoven web&#x201d; should not be understood to be a product-by-process limitation for a particular melt blown or carding method, but rather merely identifying a particular fiber or web.

As used herein, and unless specified otherwise, &#x201c;bicomponent fibers&#x201d; do not refer to a fiber including a blend of fiber forming materials but, rather, refer to fibers including two or more distinct regions of fiber forming materials, wherein the composition of the fiber forming materials differ by region. Examples of bicomponent fibers include, but are not limited to, core/sheath bicomponent fibers, island in the sea bicomponent fibers, and side-by-side bicomponent fibers. Core/sheath bicomponent fibers generally include a core having a first composition of fiber forming materials (e.g., a single fiber forming material or a first blend of fiber forming materials) and a sheath having a second composition of fiber forming materials (e.g., a single fiber forming material that is different from the core material, or a second blend of fiber forming materials that is different from the first blend of fiber forming materials of the core).

Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that hygroscopic fibers in a nonwoven that have a shape providing a capillary or channel type directional passage for a liquid (e.g., a trilobal fiber) can facilitate capillary action/wicking of a liquid from a surface of the nonwoven, providing improved liquid acquisition relative to an identical nonwoven having a fiber shape that does not include a capillary or channel type direction passage.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0094">It will be understood that the diameter of a fiber refers to the cross-section diameter of the fiber along the longest cross-sectional axis.

The tenacity of the fiber correlates to the coarseness of the fiber. As the tenacity of the fiber decreases the coarseness of the fiber increases. Fibers used to prepare the water soluble nonwoven webs of the disclosure can have a tenacity in a range of about 1 to about 100 cN/dtex, or about 1 to about 75 cN/dtex, or about 1 to about 50 cN/dtex, or about 1 to about 45 cN/dtex, or about 1 to about 40 cN/dtex, or about 1 to about 35 cN/dtex, or about 1 to about 30 cN/dtex, or about 1 to about 25 cN/dtex, or about 1 to about 20 cN/dtex, or about 1 to about 15 cN/dtex, or about 1 to about 10 cN/dtex, or about 3 to about 8 cN/dtex, or about 4 to about 8 cN/dtex, or about 6 to about 8 cN/dtex, or about 4 to about 7 cN/dtex, or about 10 to about 20, or about 10 to about 18, or about 10 to about 16, or about 1 cN/dtex, about 2 cN/dtex, about 3 cN/dtex, about 4 cN/dtex, about 5 cN/dtex, about 6 cN/dtex, about 7 cN/dtex, about 8 cN/dtex, about 9 cN/dtex, about 10 cN/dtex, about 11 cN/dtex, about 12 cN/dtex, about 13 cN/dtex, about 14 cN/dtex, or about 15 cN/dtex.

The fineness of the fiber correlates to how many fibers are present in a cross-section of a yarn of a given thickness. Fiber fineness is the ratio of fiber mass to length. The main physical unit of fiber fineness is 1 tex, which is equal to 1000 m of fiber weighing 1 g. Typically, the unit dtex is used, representing 1 g/10,000 m of fiber. The fineness of the fiber can be selected to provide a nonwoven web having suitable stiffness/hand-feel of the nonwoven web, torsional rigidity, reflection and interaction with light, absorption of dye and/or other actives/additives, ease of fiber spinning in the manufacturing process, and uniformity of the finished article. In general, as the fineness of the fibers increases the nonwovens resulting therefrom demonstrate higher uniformity, improved tensile strengths, extensibility and luster. Additionally, without intending to be bound by theory it is believed that finer fibers will lead to slower dissolution times as compared to larger fibers based on density. Further, without intending to be bound by theory, when a blend of fibers is used, the average fineness of the fibers can be determined using a weighted average of the individual fiber components. Fibers can be characterized as very fine (dtex&#x2264;1.22), fine (1.22&#x2264;dtex&#x2264;1.54), medium (1.54&#x2264;dtex&#x2264;1.93), slightly coarse (1.93&#x2264;dtex&#x2264;2.32), and coarse (dtex&#x2265;2.32). The nonwoven web of the disclosure can include fibers that are very fine, fine, medium, slightly coarse, or a combination thereof. In embodiments, the fibers have a fineness in a range of about 1 dtex to about 10 dtex, about 1 dtex to about 7 dtex, about 1 dtex to about 5 dtex, about 1 dtex to about 3 dtex, or about 1.7 dtex to about 2.2 dtex. In embodiments, fibers have a fineness of about 1.7 dtex. In embodiments, fibers have a fineness of about 2.2 dtex.

Solvent replacement baths can include a series of solvent replacement baths having a gradient of solvent in which the water soluble polymer is soluble with the solvent in which the water soluble polymer is not soluble, a series of solvent replacement baths having only the solvent in which the water soluble polymer is not soluble, or a single solvent replacement bath having only the solvent in which the water soluble polymer is not soluble.

In embodiments, finishing includes drying the extruded polymer mixture. In embodiments, finishing includes cutting or crimping the extruded polymer mixture to form individual fibers. Wet drawing of the extruded polymer mixture provides a substantially uniform diameter to the extruded polymer mixture and, thus, the fibers cut therefrom. Drawing is distinct from extruding, as is well known in the art. In particular, extruding refers to the act of making fibers by forcing the resin mixture through the spinneret head whereas drawing refers to mechanically pulling the fibers in the machine direction to promote polymer chain orientation and crystallinity for increased fiber strength and tenacity.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0106">In embodiments wherein the water soluble fibers are prepared from a wet cooled gel spinning process, the water soluble polymer can be generally any water soluble polymer or blend thereof, e.g., two or more different polymers, as generally described herein.

Briefly, thermoplastic fiber spinning includes the steps of:</p><p id="p-0113" num="0000">(a) preparing a polymer mixture including the fiber forming polymer optionally including auxiliary agents;<br/>(b) extruding the polymer mixture through a spinneret nozzle to form an extruded polymer mixture;<br/>(c) optionally drawing the extruded polymer mixture; and<br/>(d) finishing the extruded polymer mixture to provide the fibers.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0109">The finished staple fibers of the thermoplastic fiber spinning process can be finished by drying, cutting, and/or crimping to form individual fibers. Drawing of the extruded polymer mixture mechanically pulls the fibers in the machine direction, promoting polymer chain orientation and crystallinity for increased fiber strength and tenacity. The preparing the polymer mixture for thermoplastic fiber spinning can typically include (a) preparing a solution of a fiber-forming material and a readily volatile solvent such that after extruding the solution through the spinneret when the solution is contacted with a stream of hot air, the solvent readily evaporates leaving solid fibers behind or (b) melting the polymer such that after extruding the hot polymer through the spinneret, the polymer solidifies by quenching with cool air. The thermoplastic fiber spinning method is distinct from the wet cooled gel spun method at least in that (a) in the thermoplastic fiber spinning method the extruded fibers are solidified by evaporation of the solvent or by quenching hot solid fibers with cool air, rather than by use of a solidification bath; and (b) in the wet-cool gel spun method, the optional drawing is performed while the fibers are in a gel state rather than a solid state.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0110">Fiber forming materials for preparing fibers from a thermoplastic fiber spinning process can be generally be any fiber forming polymer or blend thereof, e.g., two or more different polymers, provided that the polymer or blend thereof has suitable solubility in a readily volatile solvent and/or have a melting point lower than and distinct from their degradation temperature. Further, when a blend of fiber forming polymers are used to make a fiber, the fiber forming materials must have similar solubility in a readily volatile solvent and/or have similar heat profiles such that the two or more fiber forming materials will melt at similar temperatures. In contrast, the fiber forming materials for preparing fibers from the wet cooled gel spinning process are not as limited and fibers can be prepared from a blend of any two or more polymers that are soluble in the same solvent system, and the solvent system need not be a single solvent or even a volatile solvent.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0111">The fiber forming polymer(s) for preparing thermoplastic fiber spun fibers can have a degree of polymerization (DP), for example, in a range of 10 to 10,000 for example, at least 10, at least 20, at least 50, at least 100, at least 200, at least 300, at least 400, at least 500, at least 750, or at least 1000 and up to 10,000, up to 5,000, up to 2,500, up to 1,000, up to 900, up to 750, up to 500, or up to 250.

Melt spinning is a continuous process which directly prepares a nonwoven web in-line with fiber formation. As such, the melt-spun formed fibers are not finished and cut to any consistent length (e.g., staple fibers are not prepared by these processes). Additionally, melt spinning does not include a drawing step and, therefore, the only control over the diameter of the resulting melt-spun fibers is the size of the holes through which the fiber forming materials are extruded, and the polymer chains are typically not oriented in any specific direction.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0114">Briefly, melt spinning includes the steps of:</p><p id="p-0120" num="0000">(a) preparing a polymer mixture including the fiber forming polymer optionally including auxiliary agents;<br/>(b) extruding the polymer mixture into a die assembly to form an extruded polymer mixture;<br/>(c) quenching the extruded polymer mixture;<br/>(d) depositing the quenched, extruded polymer mixture on a belt to form a nonwoven web; and<br/>(e) bonding the nonwoven web.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0115">In the spun bond process, the extruded polymer mixture is pumped into the die assembly as molten polymer and quenched with cold air once passed through the die assembly. In the melt blown process, the extruded polymer mixture is pumped into a die assembly having hot air blown through it and is quenched upon exiting the die assembly and coming into contact with ambient temperature air. In both processes, the fibers are continuously dropped onto a belt or drum, usually facilitated by pulling a vacuum under the belt or drum.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0116">The diameter of melt-spun fibers are generally in a range of about 0.1 to about 50 micron, for example, at least about 0.1 micron, at least about 1 micron, at least about 2 micron, at least about 5 micron, at least about 10 micron, at least about 15 micron, or at least about 20 micron and up to about 50 micron, up to about 40 micron, up to about 30 micron, up to about 25 micron, up to about 20 micron, up to about 15 micron, up to about 10 micron, about 0.1 micron to about 50 micron, about 0.1 micron to about 40 micron, about 0.1 micron to about 30 micron, about 0.1 micron to about 25 micron, about 0.1 micron to about 20 micron, about 0.1 micron to about 15 micron, about 0.1 micron to about 10 micron, about 0.1 micron to about 9 micron, about 0.1 micron to about 8 micron, about 0.1 micron to about 7 micron, about 0.1 micron to about 6 micron, about 0.1 micron to about 6 micron, about 5 micron to about 35 micron, about 5 micron to about 30 micron, about 7.5 micron to about 25 micron, about 10 micron to about 25 micron, or about 15 micron to about 25 micron. It is well known in the art that melt blown processes can provide micro-fine fibers having an average diameter in a range of about 1-10 micron, however, the melt blown process has very high variation in fiber-to-fiber diameter, e.g., 100-300% variation. Further, it is well known in the art that spun bond fibers can have larger average fiber diameters, e.g., typically about 15 to about 25 micron, but improved uniformity between fibers, e.g., about 10% variation.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0117">The fiber forming material for heat extruded processes (e.g., melt-spun, thermoplastic fiber spinning) is more limited than for the wet-cooled gel spun process. In general, the degree of polymerization for heat extruding processes is limited to a range of about 200 to about 500. As the degree of polymerization decreases below 200, the viscosity of the fiber forming material is too low and the individual fibers prepared by pumping the material through the die assembly do not maintain adequate separation after exiting the die assembly. Similarly, as the degree of polymerization increases above 500, the viscosity is too high to efficiently pump the material through sufficiently small holes in the die assembly to run the process at high speeds, thus losing process efficiency and fiber and/or nonwoven uniformity. Further, processes requiring heating of the fiber forming material, are unsuitable for polyvinyl alcohol homopolymers as the homopolymers generally do not have the thermal stability required.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0118">The wet cooled gel spinning process advantageously provides one or more benefits such as providing a fiber that includes a blend of water soluble polymers, providing control over the diameter of the fibers, providing relatively large diameter fibers, providing control over the length of the fibers, providing control over the tenacity of the fibers, providing high tenacity fibers, providing fibers from polymers having a large degree of polymerization, and/or providing fibers which can be used to provide a self-supporting nonwoven web. Continuous processes such as spun bond, melt blown, electro-spinning and rotary spinning generally do not allow for blending of water soluble polymers (e.g., due to difficulties matching the melt index of various polymers), forming large diameter (e.g., greater than 50 micron) fibers, controlling the length of the fibers, providing high tenacity fibers, and the use of polymers having a high degree of polymerization. Further, the wet cooled gel spinning process advantageously is not limited to polymers that are only melt processable and, therefore, can access fibers made from fiber forming materials having very high molecular weights, high melting points, low melt flow index, or a combination thereof, providing fibers having stronger physical properties and different chemical functionalities compared to fibers prepared by a heat extrusion process. Further still, advantageously, the wet cooled gel spinning process is not limited by the viscosity of the polymer. In contrast, it is known in the art that processes that require melting of the fiber forming material are limited to fiber forming materials having viscosities of 5 cP or less. Thus, fibers including polymers, including polyvinyl alcohol homopolymers and copolymers, having a viscosity of greater than 5 cP are only accessible by wet cooled gel spinning.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0119">Nonwoven Web</p><p id="p-0126" num="0120">The nonwoven webs of the disclosure are generally sheet-like structures having two exterior surfaces, the nonwoven webs including a plurality of fibers. The nonwoven webs of the disclosures can be prepared from fibers using any known methods in the art. As is known in the art, when fibers are spun bond or melt blown, the fibers are continuously laid down to form the nonwoven web, followed by bonding of the fibers.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0121">Staple fibers can be carded or airlaid and bonded to provide a nonwoven web. Methods of carding and airlaying are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0122">Methods of bonding nonwoven webs are well known in the art. In general, bonding can include thermal, mechanical, and/or chemical bonding. Thermal bonding can include, but is not limited to calendaring, embossing, air-through, and ultra-sound. Mechanical bonding can include, but is not limited to, hydro-entangling (spunlace), needle-punching, and stitch-bonding. Chemical bonding can include, but is not limited to, solvent bonding and resin bonding.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0123">Thermal bonding is achieved by applying heat and pressure, and typically maintains the pore size, shape, and alignment produced by the carding process. The conditions for thermal bonding can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. In general, if the heat and/or pressure applied is too low, the fibers will not sufficiently bind to form a free-standing web and if the heat and/or pressure is too high, the fibers will begin to meld together. The fiber chemistry dictates the upper and lower limits of heat and/or pressure for thermal bonding. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that at temperatures above 235&#xb0; C., polyvinyl alcohol based fibers degrade. Methods of embossment for thermal bonding of fibers are known. The embossing can be a one-sided embossing or a double-sided embossing. Typically, embossing of water soluble fibers includes one-sided embossing using a single embossing roll consisting of an ordered circular array and a steel roll with a plain surface. As embossing is increased (e.g., as surface features are imparted to the web), the surface area of the web is increased. Without intending to be bound by theory it is expected that as the surface are of the web is increased, the solubility of the web is increased. Accordingly, the solubility properties of the nonwoven web can be advantageously tuned by changing the surface area through embossing.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0124">Air-through bonding generally requires a high thermoplastic content in the nonwoven web and two different melting point materials. In air-through bonding, the nonbonded nonwoven web is circulated around a drum while hot air flows from the outside of the drum toward the center of the drum. Air-through bonding can provide nonwovens having low density and higher basis weight (e.g., greater than 20 to about 2000 g/m<sup>2</sup>). Nonwovens bonded by air-bonding a typically very soft.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0125">Chemical bonding generally includes solvent bonding and resin bonding. In particular, chemical bonding typically uses a binder solution of a solvent and a resin (e.g., latex or the waste polymer left over from preparing the fibers). The nonwoven can be coated with the binder solution and heat and pressure applied to cure the binder and bond the nonwoven. The binder solution can be applied by immersing the nonwoven in a bath of binder solution, spraying the binder solution onto the nonwoven, extruding the binder solution onto the web (foam bonding), and/or applying the binder solution as a print or gravure.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0126">Chemical bonding can result in smaller, less ordered pores relative to the pores as carded/melt-spun. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that if the resin solution used for chemical bonding is sufficiently concentrated and/or sufficient pressure is applied, a nonporous water-dispersible nonwoven web can be formed. The solvent used in chemical bonding induces partial solubilization of the existing fibers in the web to weld and bond the fibers together. Thus, in general, the solvent for chemical bonding can be any solvent that can at least partially solubilize one or more fiber forming materials of the fibers of the nonwoven. In embodiments, the solvent is selected from the group consisting of water, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, glycerin, and a combination thereof. In embodiments, the solvent is selected from the group consisting of water, glycerin, and a combination thereof. In embodiments, the binder solution comprises a solvent selected from the group consisting of water, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, glycerin, and a combination thereof and further comprises a resin selected from the group consisting of polyvinyl alcohol, latex, and polyvinylpyrrolidone. The binder provided in the solution assists in the welding process to provide a more mechanically robust web. The temperature of the polymer solution is not particularly limited and can be provided at room temperature (about 23&#xb0; C.).</p><p id="p-0133" num="0127">In some embodiments, a second layer of fibers can be used to bond the nonwoven web. In embodiments, at least one nonwoven layer of the composite articles of the disclosure are bonded using a second layer of nonwoven web/fibers. In embodiments, at least two nonwoven layers of the composite articles of the disclosure are bonded using an additional layer of nonwoven web/fibers. In embodiments, at least one nonwoven layer of the composite articles of the disclosure are bonded using thermal, mechanical, or chemical bonding, alone or in addition to bonding using an additional layer of nonwoven web/fibers.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0128">Pore sizes can be determined using high magnificiation and ordered surface analysis techniques including, but not limited to Brunauer-Emmett-Teller theory (BET), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and molecular adsorption.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0129">Nonwoven webs can be characterized by basis weight. The basis weight of a nonwoven is the mass per unit area of the nonwoven. Basis weight can be modified by varying manufacturing conditions, as is known in the art. A nonwoven web can have the same basis weight prior to and subsequent to bonding. Alternatively, the bonding method can change the basis weight of the nonwoven web. For example, wherein bonding occurs through the application of heat and pressure, the thickness of the nonwoven (and, thus, the area of the nonwoven) can be decreased, thereby increasing the basis weight. Accordingly, as used herein and unless specified otherwise, the basis weight of a nonwoven refers to the basis weight of the nonwoven subsequent to bonding.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0130">The nonwoven webs of the disclosure can generally have any basis weight in a range of about 0.1 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 700 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 0.5 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 600 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 1 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 500 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 1 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 400 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 1 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 300 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 1 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 200 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 1 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 100 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 30 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 100 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 20 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 100 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 20 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 80 g/m<sup>2</sup>, or about 25 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 70 g/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0131">The nonwoven webs of the disclosure can generally have any thickness. Suitable thicknesses can include, but are not limited to, about 5 to about 10,000 &#x3bc;m (1 cm), about 5 to about 5,000 &#x3bc;m, about 5 to about 1,000 &#x3bc;m, about 5 to about 500 &#x3bc;m, about 200 to about 500 &#x3bc;m, about 5 to about 200 &#x3bc;m, about 20 to about 100 &#x3bc;m, or about 40 to about 90 &#x3bc;m, or about 50 to 80 &#x3bc;m, or about or about 60 to 65 &#x3bc;m for example 50 &#x3bc;m, 65 &#x3bc;m, 76 &#x3bc;m, or 88 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0132">The nonwoven webs of the disclosure can be characterized as high loft or low loft. In general, loft refers to the ratio of thickness to mass per unit area (i.e., basis weight). High loft nonwoven webs can be characterized by a high ratio of thickness to mass per unit area. As used herein, &#x201c;high loft&#x201d; refers to a nonwoven web of the disclosure having a basis weight as defined herein and a thickness exceeding 200 &#x3bc;m. The thickness of the nonwoven web can be determined by according to ASTM D5729-97, ASTM D5736, and ISO 9073-2: 1995 and can include, for example, subjecting the nonwoven web to a load of 2 N and measuring the thickness. High loft materials can be used according to known methods in the art, for example, thru-air bonding or cross-lapping, which uses a cross-lapper to fold the unbounded web over onto itself to build loft and basis weight. Without intending to be bound by theory, in contrast to water soluble nonwoven webs wherein the solubility of the nonwoven web can be dependent on the thickness of the nonwoven web; the solubility of a nonwoven web is not believed to be dependent on the thickness of the web. In this regard, it is believed that because the individual fibers provide a higher surface area than a water soluble film, regardless of the thickness of the nonwoven web, the parameter that limits approach of water to the fibers and, ultimately, dissolution of the fibers is the basis weight (i.e., fiber density in the nonwoven).</p><p id="p-0139" num="0133">The solubility of the water soluble nonwoven webs of the disclosure is generally a function of the type of fiber(s) used to prepare the web as well as the basis weight of the water soluble web. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the solubility profile of a nonwoven web follows the same solubility profile of the fiber(s) used to prepare the nonwoven web, and the solubility profile of the fiber generally follows the same solubility profile of the polymer(s) from which the fiber is prepared. For example, for nonwoven webs comprising PVOH fibers, the degree of hydrolysis of the PVOH polymer can be chosen such that the water-solubility of the nonwoven web is also influenced. In general, at a given temperature, as the degree of hydrolysis of the PVOH polymer increases from partially hydrolyzed (88% DH) to fully hydrolyzed (98% DH), water solubility of the polymer generally decreases. Thus, in one option, the water soluble nonwoven web can be cold water soluble. For a co-poly(vinyl acetate vinyl alcohol) polymer that does not include any other monomers (e.g., not copolymerized with an anionic monomer) a cold water soluble web, soluble in water at a temperature of less than 10&#xb0; C., can include fibers of PVOH with a degree of hydrolysis in a range of about 75% to about 90%, or in a range of about 80% to about 90%, or in a range of about 85% to about 90%. In another option the water soluble nonwoven web can be hot water soluble. For a co-poly(vinyl acetate vinyl alcohol) polymer that does not include any other monomers (e.g., not copolymerized with an anionic monomer) a hot water soluble web, soluble in water at a temperature of at least about 60&#xb0; C., can include fibers of PVOH with a degree of hydrolysis of at least about 98%.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0134">Modification of PVOH generally increases the solubility of the PVOH polymer. Thus, it is expected that at a given temperature the solubility of a water soluble nonwoven web prepared from a PVOH copolymer, would be higher than that of a nonwoven web prepared from a PVOH homopolymer having the same degree of hydrolysis as the PVOH copolymer. Following these trends, a water soluble nonwoven web having specific solubility characteristics can be designed by blending polymers within the fibers and/or fibers within the nonwoven web.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0135">Further, as the basis weight of the web increases the rate of dissolution of the web decreases, provided the fiber composition remains constant, as there is more material to be dissolved. For example, at a given temperature, a water soluble web prepared from fibers comprising PVOH polymer(s) and having a basis weight of, e.g., 40 g/m<sup>2</sup>, is expected to dissolve slower than an otherwise-identical water soluble web having a basis weight of, e.g., 30 g/m<sup>2</sup>. Accordingly, basis weight can also be used to modify the solubility characteristics of the water soluble nonwoven web. The water soluble nonwoven web can generally have any basis weight in a range of about 1 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 700 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 1 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 600 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 1 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 500 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 1 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 400 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 1 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 300 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 1 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 200 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 10 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 100 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 30 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 100 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 20 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 100 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 20 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 80 g/m<sup>2</sup>, about 25 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 70 g/m<sup>2</sup>, or about 40 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 60 g/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0136">Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that solubility (in terms of time to complete dissolution) of a water soluble nonwoven web is expected to surpass that of a water soluble film of the same size (L&#xd7;W) and/or mass, prepared from the same PVOH polymer. This is due to the higher surface area found in the nonwoven compared to a film, leading to faster solubilization. As shown in the Examples, below, a nonwoven web prepared from a PVOH homopolymer having a degree of hydrolysis of 88% dissolves in 14 seconds, while a water soluble film of similar size and prepared from the same PVOH homopolymer having a degree of hydrolysis of 88% dissolves in &#x2dc;100 seconds.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0137">The tenacity of the water soluble nonwoven web can be the same or different from the tenacity of the fibers used to prepare the web. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the tenacity of the nonwoven web is related to the strength of the nonwoven web, wherein a higher tenacity provides a higher strength to the nonwoven web. In general, the tenacity of the nonwoven web can be modified by using fibers having different tenacities. The tenacity of the nonwoven web may also be affected by processing. In general, the water soluble webs of the disclosure have relatively high tenacities, i.e., the water soluble nonwoven web is a self-supporting web that can be used as the sole material for preparing an article and/or pouch. In contrast, nonwoven webs prepared according to melt blown, electro-spinning, and/or rotary spinning processes typically have low tenacities, and may not be self-supporting or capable of being used as a sole web for forming an article or pouch.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0138">In general, the coefficient of dynamic friction and the ratio of the coefficient of static friction to the coefficient of dynamic friction for a water soluble nonwoven web of the disclosure will be lower than the coefficient of dynamic friction and the ratio of the coefficient of static friction to the coefficient of dynamic friction for a water soluble film due to the increased surface roughness of the nonwoven web relative to a water soluble film, which provides decreased surface contact to the nonwoven web. Advantageously, this surface roughness can provide an improved feel to the consumer (i.e., a cloth-like hand-feel instead of a rubbery hand-feel), improved aesthetics (i.e., less glossy than a water soluble film), and/or facilitate processability in preparing thermoformed, and/or vertical formed, filled, and sealed, and/or multichamber packets which require drawing the web along a surface of the processing equipment/mold. Accordingly, the fibers should be sufficiently coarse to provide a surface roughness to the resulting nonwoven web without being so coarse as to produce drag.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0139">The water soluble nonwoven web of the disclosure can be used as a single layer or can be layered with other water soluble nonwoven webs, or can be in the form of a laminate with a water soluble film. In some embodiments, the water soluble nonwoven web includes a single layer of water soluble nonwoven web. In some embodiments, the water soluble nonwoven web is a multilayer water soluble nonwoven web comprising two or more layers of water soluble nonwoven webs. The one or more layers can be laminated to each other. In refinements of the foregoing embodiment, the two or more layers can be the same (e.g., be prepared from the same fibers and basis weight). In refinements of the foregoing embodiment, the two or more layers can be different (e.g., be prepared from different types of fibers and/or have different basis weights).</p><p id="p-0146" num="0140">In general, a multilayer water soluble nonwoven web can have a basis weight that is the sum of the basis weights of the individual layers. Accordingly, a multilayer water soluble nonwoven web will take longer to dissolve than any of the individual layers provided as a single layer.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0141">In embodiments, the water soluble nonwoven web of the disclosure has a disintegration time of no more than 300 seconds according to MSTM 205 in 23&#xb0; C. water after exposure to a TCCA, SBS, or calcium hypochlorite composition for 6 or 8 weeks in a 38&#xb0; C. and 80% RH atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0142">In embodiments, the surface area of the nonwoven web residue after testing according to MSTM 205 in 23&#xb0; C. water after exposure to a TCCA, SBS, or calcium hypochlorite composition for 6 or 8 weeks in a 38&#xb0; C. and 80% RH atmosphere is less than about 50% of the surface area of the nonwoven web prior to testing according to MSTM 205.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0143">In embodiments, the nonwoven web maintains a b* value of no more than 3.5, or no more than 3.0, or no more than 2.5 after exposure to TCCA, SBS, or calcium hypochlorite composition for 6 or 8 weeks in a 38&#xb0; C. and 80% RH atmosphere.

Although both TCCA and calcium hypochlorite are oxidants, the nonwoven web comprising the AMPS modified PVOH performed well when exposed to calcium hypochlorite and did not perform as well when exposed to TCCA.
