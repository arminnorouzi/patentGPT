According to the present disclosure, a &#x201c;non-combustible&#x201d; aerosol provision system is one where a constituent aerosolizable material of the aerosol provision system (or component thereof) is not combusted or burned in order to facilitate delivery to a user. Throughout the following description the term &#x201c;e-cigarette&#x201d; or &#x201c;electronic cigarette&#x201d; may sometimes be used, but it will be appreciated this term may be used interchangeably with aerosol provision system/device and electronic aerosol provision system/device. Furthermore, and as is common in the technical field, the terms &#x201c;aerosol&#x201d; and &#x201c;vapor&#x201d;, and related terms such as &#x201c;vaporize&#x201d;, &#x201c;volatilize&#x201d; and &#x201c;aerosolize&#x201d;, may generally be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an aerosol provision system <b>100</b> is shown. The aerosol provision system <b>100</b> has a power source <b>110</b>. The aerosol provision system <b>100</b> has an aerosol generating component <b>120</b>. The aerosol provision system <b>100</b> has control circuitry <b>130</b>. The control circuitry <b>130</b> is arranged to control the power source <b>110</b> and the aerosol generating component <b>120</b> to provide a selection between at least a predetermined aerosolization profile and a variable aerosolization period to be applied to aerosol generating material.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The power source <b>110</b> is shown connected to the aerosol generating component <b>120</b>. The connection may be an electrical connection to allow the power source <b>110</b> to provide electrical signals to the aerosol generating component <b>120</b>. The power source <b>110</b> may provide energy to the aerosol generating component <b>120</b> for aerosolization of aerosol generating material.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The power source <b>110</b> is shown connected to the control circuitry <b>130</b>. The control circuitry <b>130</b> may control the delivery of energy from the power source <b>110</b> to the aerosol generating component <b>120</b>. The control circuitry <b>130</b> may operate to control delivery of energy from the power source <b>110</b> to aerosol generating component <b>120</b> to provide a predetermined amount of aerosolization from aerosol generating material.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The power source <b>110</b> may, in an example, be a battery or the like. The power source <b>110</b> may contain chemical energy which can be converted and delivered as electrical energy.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the aerosol provision system <b>100</b> has a housing <b>140</b> within which the power source <b>110</b>, the aerosol generating component <b>120</b> and the control circuitry <b>130</b> are located.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The predetermined aerosolization profile may comprise a plurality of aerosolization phases and a plurality of non-aerosolization phases. The aerosolization phases may be phases wherein the aerosol generating component <b>120</b> is supplied with energy from the power source <b>110</b>, under control of the control circuitry <b>130</b>. The non-aerosolization phases may be phases wherein the aerosol generating component <b>120</b> is not supplied with energy from the power source <b>110</b>. The predetermined aerosolization profile may be a profile that can be selected by a user desiring the delivery of aerosol over an extended &#x201c;smoking session&#x201d;. The predetermined aerosolization profile may therefore have a sequence of active periods and non-active periods, the timings of which may be predetermined and which may be different (or the same) for each period. This may produce aerosol for inhalation at specific timings over a given period.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The variable aerosolization period may be a continuous period, which can be varied in length, wherein the aerosol generating component <b>120</b> is supplied with energy from the power source <b>110</b>, under control of the control circuitry <b>130</b>. The variable aerosolization period may be user controlled so that the user can select a relatively long, or short, period over which to produce an aerosol. The variable aerosolization period therefore does not have non-aerosolization phases alongside aerosolization phases. The variable aerosolization period is rather an on or off use-mode for the system <b>100</b>. In an example, there is a cap on the maximum length of the variable aerosolization period so as to prevent misuse of this setting. For example, the longest single use may be capped at less than 30 s or the like. This can function as a safety feature so as to protect the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an aerosol provision system <b>200</b> is shown. The aerosol provision system <b>200</b> has similar features to the example of an aerosol provision system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Similar features have similar numerals with the number increased by 100. These will not necessarily be discussed in detail here.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The aerosol provision system <b>200</b> shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> has control circuitry <b>230</b> which has an activatable element <b>232</b>. The activatable element <b>232</b> is for controlling the power source <b>210</b> and aerosol generating material <b>220</b>. The activatable element <b>232</b> may be a user-activatable element (such as a button or switch or the like), a user interface (such as a touch sensitive screen, graphics user interface or the like) and/or a sensor (such as a fingerprint scanner, puff detector, QR code reader, barcode reader or the like). The activatable element <b>232</b> may be activated once a state detection is made. The state detection might be, for example, that an RFID sensor has detected an RFID known to be valid (by, for example, cross-reference with a database of valid RFIDs) such that the aerosol provision system <b>200</b> is controlled to provide energy from the power source <b>210</b> to the aerosol generating component <b>220</b>. The activatable element may therefore be user activatable or non-user activatable.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A puff detector may allow for puff activation of the system <b>200</b>. The puff detector may detect when the user is inhaling on the system <b>200</b> and therefore result in activation of the system <b>200</b>. The system <b>200</b> may be activated to provide a predetermined aerosolization profile or a variable aerosolization period based on e.g., the length of time of inhalation or intensity of inhalation. For example, a short (less than 2 seconds) inhalation results in the system <b>200</b> providing an aerosolization period and a long (more than 2 seconds) inhalation results in the system <b>200</b> providing a predetermined aerosolization profile. The skilled person would be aware of implementations that could utilize puff activation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The control circuitry <b>230</b> may be configured to determine a state of the activatable element <b>232</b> and based on the state of the activatable element <b>232</b>, determine whether to apply the predetermined aerosolization profile or the variable aerosolization period to aerosol generating material. This may be that, for example, a fingerprint scanner has detected a movement in a first direction which results in the selection, and application of, a predetermined aerosolization profile. Alternatively, a fingerprint scanner may detect a movement in a second direction which results in the selection, and application of, a variable aerosolization period.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, an aerosol provision system <b>300</b> is shown. The aerosol provision system <b>300</b> has similar features to the example of an aerosol provision system <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Similar features have similar numerals with the number increased by 100. These will not necessarily be discussed in detail here.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows an aerosol provision system <b>300</b> with control circuitry <b>330</b> with an activatable element <b>332</b>. The activatable element <b>332</b> is shown in a first state. The activatable element <b>332</b> is shown as a physical component, such as a button or switch or the like, however it may as easily be any of the above discussed options. The activatable element <b>332</b> merely needs to indicate a difference between states in which it may put, such as can be performed by a touchscreen. The activatable element <b>332</b> is put into a first state and signals to the control circuitry <b>330</b> that it is in the first state. The control circuitry <b>330</b> then controls the power source <b>310</b> to provide energy to the aerosol generating component <b>320</b> in a first manner. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows an example of an aerosol provision system <b>300</b> wherein the activatable element <b>332</b> is in a second state, which may lead to the control circuitry to control the power source <b>310</b> to provide energy to the aerosol generating component <b>320</b> in a second manner. The activatable element <b>332</b> is shown on the housing <b>340</b> of the aerosol provision system <b>300</b> however may be located inside the aerosol provision system <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an example, therefore, the activatable element <b>322</b> may be a user-activatable element, and the user-activatable element may be a switch that can be affected in a first way to provide a predetermined aerosolization profile to an aerosol generating material, and the switch can be affected in a second way to provide a variable aerosolization period to an aerosol generating material. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the switch <b>332</b> is moved towards one end of the system housing <b>340</b> for the first way and towards the other end of the system housing <b>340</b> for the second way. Another example may be a push button which is depressed slightly for a first way and depressed more/entirely for a second way.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The control circuitry <b>330</b> may have a database or the like for storing predetermined aerosolization profiles. The control circuitry <b>330</b> may therefore provide a selection between a plurality of predetermined aerosolization profiles and a variable aerosolization period to be applied to an aerosol generating material. This may allow the aerosol provision system <b>300</b> to accommodate users' preferences in aerosol. A first predetermined aerosolization profile may provide an aerosol with more or less nicotine (for example) than a second predetermined aerosolization profile. The user may select their preferred option of predetermined aerosolization profile. The user may make their selection from the activatable element <b>332</b>, such as a graphic user interface on a touchscreen on the aerosol provision system <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In another example, the predetermined aerosolisation profile supplied by the control circuitry may be based on consumable recognition. A consumable containing a specific aerosol generating material (or combination of aerosol generating materials) may be inserted into the aerosol provision system <b>300</b> prior to use. The consumable may have a detectable element on it, such as a barcode, QR code or the like. The detectable element may be detected by the control circuitry <b>330</b> (or activatable element <b>332</b>). This may allow the control circuitry <b>330</b> to provide a predetermined aerosolization profile to the consumable based on the specific aerosol generating material or aerosol generating materials present in the consumable, as detected and recognized by the control circuitry <b>330</b>. In this way a suitable predetermined aerosolization profile may be provided to any specific consumable across a range of consumables. This, in turn, provides greater flexibility of use for a user of the aerosol provision system <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The predetermined aerosolization profiles that may be provided by the control circuitry <b>330</b> may differ to one another by any suitable factor. These include the number of aerosolization phases, the intensity of aerosolization phases and, the frequency of aerosolization phases. In an example, a predetermined aerosolization profile for use with a consumable which has a majority aerosol generating material of menthol may have a lower intensity of aerosolization phase (e.g., a lower operational temperature to produce an aerosol from the aerosol generating material) than a consumable which has a majority aerosol generating material of tobacco. This may be based on the operational temperatures at which a menthol consumable and a tobacco consumable generate aerosols.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The consumable may have a plurality of different sections each of which contains one or more aerosol generating materials. A first section may be provided with a first predetermined aerosolization profile, whereas a second section may be provided with a second predetermined aerosolization profile. The second predetermined aerosolization profile may differ from the first predetermined aerosolization profile.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a specific example, the consumable has three sections. The first section may be heated to a low operational temperature (to release, for example, menthol). The second section may be heated to a high operational temperature (to release, for example, nicotine).
