end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Although several embodiments, examples, and illustrations are disclosed below, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the inventions described herein extend beyond the specifically disclosed embodiments, examples, and illustrations and includes other uses of the inventions and obvious modifications and equivalents thereof. Embodiments of the inventions are described with reference to the accompanying figures, wherein like numerals refer to like elements throughout. The terminology used in the description presented herein is not intended to be interpreted in any limited or restrictive manner simply because it is being used in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific embodiments of the inventions. In addition, embodiments of the inventions can comprise several novel features and no single feature is solely responsible for its desirable attributes or is essential to practicing the inventions herein described.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, the systems disclosed herein comprise an apparatus that holds an ultrasound probe and a needle in a particular alignment with respect to one another, for example as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The apparatus <b>100</b> has a base <b>102</b>, a swing arm <b>104</b> for angling and supporting a needle, cavity <b>106</b> for receiving an ultrasound probe, and finger hole <b>108</b> for receiving a finger of the user. The apparatus can be used to set and control a needle trajectory to increase the likelihood that the needle hits its target (e.g., a lumen in a patient, such as a vein) and does not hit other structures in the body. Some embodiments disclosed herein can make it easier to perform accurate needle insertions and procedures on &#x201c;hard stick&#x201d; patients (patients for whom drawing blood or placing a line is difficult due to obesity, drug abuse, or other factors). Some embodiments herein can simplify procedures by providing assistive devices that can be used to reliably insert a needle to an identified target location in the patient's body. The embodiments herein can be used for a variety of procedures including, for example, thoracentesis, paracentesis, central line placement, arterial line placement, nerve block, tumor biopsy, and so forth. In some embodiments, the systems, methods, and devices disclosed herein can be used by physicians, nurses, veterinarians, and other medical personnel. In some embodiments, a device can be powered and can have one or more active components to assist the user. In some embodiments, an apparatus can be unpowered. For example, an apparatus can use mechanically coupled components and passive indicators.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, a device comprises a cavity for receiving an ultrasound probe. In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a modular cavity insert <b>120</b> can be used for holding different ultrasound probes inside a standardized cavity <b>106</b>, while in other embodiments, apparatuses can be manufactured to fit a specific ultrasound probe. A modular cavity insert <b>120</b> can have several advantages. For example, an apparatus can include cavity inserts to accommodate different ultrasound probes. In some cases, a hospital or other user of the apparatus can keep a stock of apparatuses and a separate stock of inserts. In some cases, a manufacturer can have a single SKU for an apparatus that can accommodate different ultrasound probes, which can simplify supply chain issues. However, such an approach can increase cost and complexity as a result of having a separate modular cavity insert component.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, a device can include a needle support bracket <b>122</b> that is placed distally (e.g., near the tip of the needle and near the patient's skin) that can operate to stabilize the needle and thus to aid the user in inserting the needle to the desired location and depth. The needle can pass through a needle guide <b>112</b> that is mechanically coupled to the swing arm <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the needle guide <b>112</b> can be a separate component that is attached to the swing arm <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the system can include an angle adjustment knob <b>110</b> for setting the angle of the swing arm <b>104</b> with respect to the base <b>102</b>, thereby change the insertion angle of the needle.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, a device can have guide bars <b>124</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The guide bars <b>124</b> can be positioned such that they pass under an ultrasound probe placed in the cavity <b>106</b>. The guide bars <b>124</b> can disrupt the ultrasound probe, thereby producing a &#x201c;shadow&#x201d; on the ultrasound image, which can be used to help position and guide the needle into the desired location. For example, the device can be configured such that the needle will pass between the guide bars <b>124</b> when it is inserted into the patient. It will be appreciated that while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment with two guide bars <b>124</b> with the needle centered between them, some embodiments can include more or fewer guide bars. For example, some embodiments can include one guide bar or can include no guide bars.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">For some types of procedures, such as blood draws, the apparatus <b>100</b> can remain in place on the patient throughout the procedure. However, for some procedures, such as when inserting a catheter, it can be desirable to remove the apparatus <b>100</b> so that a provider can complete the procedure, or to allow the provider to move the needle freely (or partially freely, for example one degree of freedom, two degrees of freedom, three degrees of freedom, etc.) after the needle is inserted into the patient, even if the apparatus <b>100</b> is not completely removed. Thus, some embodiments of the apparatus <b>100</b> can include a needle release mechanism. For example, a needle guide <b>112</b> can have a display <b>116</b> that can be released to allow the needle to escape the needle guide <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Such a release mechanism can be important for some types of procedures. For example, when inserting a catheter, the needle may initially be inserted at a relatively high angle. However, it can be important to reduce the angle of the needle relative to the patient's skin before inserting the catheter. If the angle is too steep, the catheter could get stuck or break through the vein, for example.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref> illustrate example embodiments of needle guides <b>112</b> having needle locks <b>126</b>. The needle lock <b>126</b> can be located at the top, bottom, or side of the needle guide <b>112</b>. A needle guide <b>112</b> can include a needle release trigger <b>146</b>. The needle release trigger <b>146</b> can cause the needle lock <b>126</b> to slide out of place, thereby opening the hole in the needle guide <b>112</b> and permitting the needle to be removed from the needle guide <b>112</b>, for example by altering the angle of the needle.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Electronic Positioning</heading><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Correct positioning of the needle can be important for ensuring that the needle is inserted to the appropriate location inside the patient's body. Thus, some embodiments of the apparatus <b>100</b> can include one or more electronic sensors for measuring and setting needle length, insertion angle, insertion depth, and so forth. The electronic sensors can be linear position sensors, angle sensors, etc.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> comprises a central processing unit and a computer-readable storage medium. The apparatus <b>100</b> can be configured to determine a trajectory and to guide a user during a needle insertion procedure by determining and setting several values as discussed more fully below.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, in some embodiments, the swing arm <b>104</b> can have an active angle sensor arm <b>130</b> disposed at or near the distal end of the swing arm <b>104</b>. A passive angle sensor plate <b>128</b> can be mounted to the base <b>102</b> of the apparatus <b>100</b>. The passive angle sensor plate <b>128</b> can have a plurality of electrodes disposed thereon that can be used for detecting the angle of the swing arm <b>104</b> with respect to the base <b>102</b>. For example, as the active angle sensor arm <b>130</b> passes over the electrically conductive components of the passive angle sensor plate <b>128</b>, electronics inside the swing arm <b>104</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>) can determine the angle of the swing arm <b>104</b> by sensing, for example, capacitance, resistance, whether or not circuits are completed, which circuits are completed, and so forth, and particular combinations of measured values can indicate the angle of the swing arm <b>104</b> with respect to the base <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, in some embodiments an apparatus <b>100</b> can include a swing arm <b>104</b>. The swing arm <b>104</b> can have disposed therein a first track <b>132</b> and a second track <b>134</b>. The first track <b>132</b> and second track <b>134</b> can be coupled (i.e., mechanically coupled and electrically coupled) to a printed circuit board (PCB), main PCB <b>136</b>. The main PCB <b>136</b> can include components for performing calculations, storing computer-executable instructions, controlling the LED array <b>118</b>, the display <b>116</b>, and so forth. The swing arm <b>104</b> can have a power source <b>138</b> disposed therein. For example, the power source <b>138</b> can be a battery or a plurality of batteries. The needle guide <b>112</b> can be configured to slide along the first track <b>132</b>. The insertion depth slider <b>114</b> can be configured to slide along the second track <b>134</b>. As discussed more fully below, the first track <b>132</b> and second track <b>134</b> can include active sensing components for determining the position of the needle guide <b>112</b> and the insertion depth slider <b>114</b>, respectively. The needle guide <b>112</b> and insertion depth slider <b>114</b> can include one or more conductive components that can work with the active sensing components of the first track <b>132</b> and the second track <b>134</b> to determine the position of the needle guide <b>112</b> and the insertion depth slider <b>114</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> shows another view of the internal components of a swing arm <b>104</b> according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref> shows a main PCB <b>136</b> outside the housing of the swing arm <b>104</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>, the second track <b>134</b> can be coupled to the main PCB <b>136</b>. A needle measurement hole <b>140</b> can be disposed at the proximal end of the main PCB <b>136</b> (e.g., on a riser board or a section of PCB perpendicular to the main PCB <b>136</b> and can correspond to a hole at the proximal end of the swing arm <b>104</b>. Disposed about the needle measurement hole <b>140</b> is a hilt sensor <b>142</b>. The hilt sensor <b>142</b> can be an optical sensor, an electronic sensor, and so forth. The needle measurement hole <b>140</b> can be aligned such that when a user inserts a needle through the needle measurement hole <b>140</b>, the needle pushes the needle guide <b>112</b> along the first track <b>132</b> inside the swing arm <b>104</b>. When the hilt (or hub) of the needle hits the hilt sensor <b>142</b>, the apparatus can determine the length of the needle based on the position of the needle guide <b>112</b> along the first track <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As discussed above, an apparatus <b>100</b> can include various sensors for measuring distances, angles, and so forth. Accordingly, it can be advantageous to provide input and output devices to enable a user to interact with the apparatus <b>100</b>. The apparatus <b>100</b> can include a user input button <b>144</b> for interacting with the apparatus <b>100</b>. For example, the user input button <b>144</b> can be used to power on the device, to confirm inputs, to change units (e.g., changing a needle length, insertion depth, etc. from millimeters to centimeters), to alter configuration settings (e.g., minimum and/or maximum allowable deviations from target values), to power off the device, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E</figref>, the apparatus <b>100</b> can include a display <b>116</b> and LED array <b>118</b>, which can be disposed on the swing arm <b>104</b>. The display <b>116</b> can provide instructions to the user, provide feedback to the user, and so forth. In some embodiments the LED array <b>118</b> can include a plurality of LEDs. The LED array <b>118</b> can have LEDs of different colors. For example, the LED array <b>118</b> can include red LEDs to indicate an error state and green LEDs to indicate a success state. The number of LEDs in the LED array <b>118</b> can vary, for example depending on the adjustments available to the user. In the case where a user can adjust the needle length, the needle insertion depth, and the needle insertion angle, the LED array <b>118</b> can have, for example six LEDs, e.g., a red LED and a green LED for each of needle length, needle insertion depth, and needle insertion angle, respectively.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, a first step in a needle insertion process can comprise measuring the length of the needle to be used during a procedure. In some embodiments, the system can generate an audio command that will instruct the user to measure the length of the needle. In some embodiments, the device may, alternatively or additionally, instruct the user with a visual indicator, for example by illuminating a letter on the device (e.g., &#x201c;L&#x201d; for length), for example using the LED array <b>118</b>. In some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> may display relevant instructions on the display <b>116</b>. Having the user measure the needle can allow the device to be suitable for use with a wide range of needle lengths. In some embodiments, a user can insert a needle through the needle measurement hole <b>140</b>. When the user inserts the needle into the needle measurement hole <b>140</b>, the needle can push the needle guide <b>112</b> along the first track <b>132</b> inside the swing arm <b>104</b>. The hilt sensor <b>142</b> (e.g., a momentary switch) can be depressed when the needle is fully inserted into the swing arm <b>104</b> (into the needle measurement hole <b>140</b>) and can thereby cause the device to determine the length of the needle. In some embodiments, the apparatus may be configured to work with needles of at least a minimum size and no more than a maximum size. For example, a minimum size can be about 1 cm, about 2 cm, about 3 cm, about 4 cm, about 5 cm, or more.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> can prompt the user to find the depth of the target (e.g., vein). The system can include illumination, sounds, and so forth to aid the user in setting the target depth, in a manner similar to that described above with respect to measuring the needle length. Notably, however, the device may not have an automatic insertion depth measurement as it does for the needle length measurement. Rather, the user can measure the target depth using an ultrasound probe that can be inserted into the cavity <b>106</b> of the apparatus <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, a user can input the target depth by sliding the insertion depth slider <b>114</b> along the second track <b>134</b>. The second track <b>134</b> can have sensors embedded thereon that can be used by the apparatus <b>100</b> to detect the placement of the insertion depth slider <b>114</b>. After the user sets the insertion depth, the user can confirm that insertion depth using the user input button <b>144</b>, for example. In some embodiments, an LED corresponding to the insertion depth can be illuminated on the LED array <b>118</b>. For example, if the insertion depth is within an allowable range (e.g., about 1 mm, more than about 1 mm, about 2 mm, more than about 2 mm, about 3 mm, more than about 3 mm, about 4 mm, more than about 4 mm, 5 mm, or more than about 5 mm), the central processing unit may cause a green LED associated with the depth to illuminate (for example, by the letter &#x201c;D&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E</figref>). If the insertion depth is outside an allowable range, the CPU may cause a red LED to illuminate instead. In some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> can communicate wirelessly with an ultrasound probe (e.g., via Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, etc.) and can receive the depth from the ultrasound probe instead of the user inputting the depth. In some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> can be motorized to set insertion parameters automatically.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, the user can set a needle insertion angle by rotating the swing arm <b>104</b> relative to the base <b>102</b> using the angle adjustment knob <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the swing arm <b>104</b> can include a display <b>116</b> that can be configured to show the current angle of the swing arm <b>104</b>. The user can adjust the angle of the swing arm <b>104</b> until the display indicates the desired angle. The user can confirm the needle insertion angle using the user input button <b>144</b>. In some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> can be configured to calculate a target angle. The display <b>116</b> can be configured to show a target angle. In some embodiments, the display <b>116</b> can include an indication of the target angle, an indication of the current angle, and/or a relative positioning indicator that can help the user adjust the apparatus <b>100</b> to the target insertion angle. The angle can be measured using the active angle sensor arm <b>130</b> and passive angle sensor plate <b>128</b> described above. In some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> can illuminate an LED, make a sound, and/or provide another indication to the user when the target angle is reached. In some embodiments, the display <b>116</b> can be configured to display one or more arrows, circles, and so forth to indicate a direction the user should move the swing arm <b>104</b> to reach the target angle. The display <b>116</b> can be configured to show a circle, line, or other visual indicator that the user has reached the target angle. In some embodiments, the number of lights or similar can be used to indicate how far the current angle is from the target angle. As with the needle length and needle insertion depth, the system can be configured to light an LED in the LED array <b>118</b> based on the needle insertion angle setting. For example, if the insertion angle is too small or too large, the central processing unit can cause a red LED in the LED array <b>118</b> associated with the needle insertion angle to illuminate. On the other hand, if the needle insertion angle is within an allowable range, the system can illuminate a green LED associated with the needle insertion angle (e.g., an LED near the letter &#x201c;A&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E</figref>).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref> show an example linear sensing circuitry according to some embodiments.

As discussed briefly above, the electrodes <b>702</b>, electrodes <b>704</b>, electrodes <b>706</b>, and electrodes <b>708</b> can be used for detecting linear and/or angular position using capacitance, resistance, connectivity, and so forth. In some embodiments, the length of a passive sensor, e.g., having electrodes <b>704</b> or electrodes <b>708</b> disposed thereon, can be relatively small and/or can consist of multiple frames. In some embodiments, a coding scheme can be used to extend the measurement range and/or to increase the precision and/or accuracy of the measurements. In some embodiments, multiple linear sensors can share a common transmit driver, which can reduce power and input/output requirements. In some embodiments, the sensors described herein can support a high slew rate, for example using velocity detection. In some embodiments, the sensors herein can be configured to switch between absolute and relative measurement modes.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an example embodiment of an apparatus <b>100</b> in which the user is setting the needle insertion angle by adjusting the angle adjustment knob <b>110</b>.

The display <b>116</b> displays a target angle (here, 41.7 degrees) and the current angle (70.7 degrees). The display <b>116</b> also includes arrows and a circle near the distal end (i.e., near the angle adjustment knob <b>110</b>) that indicates the user should reduce the angle of the swing arm <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The LED array <b>118</b> may have functions in addition to or as an alternative to display error and success states. For example, LEDs in the LED array <b>118</b> can flash to indicate which step of a process the user is at. For example, one or more LEDs can flash under the &#x201c;L&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E</figref> when the user is supposed to perform a needle length measurement procedure. One or more LEDs can flash under the &#x201c;D&#x201d; when the user is supposed to perform a procedure for setting the needle insertion length. One or more LEDs can flash under the &#x201c;A&#x201d; when the user is supposed to perform a procedure for setting the needle insertion angle. As discussed above, the number of LEDs in the LED array <b>118</b> can vary depending on the number of adjustments, settings, and so forth available to the user. In some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> may not include a LED array <b>118</b> and may instead rely on the display <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> may not include the display <b>116</b> and may instead rely on the LED array <b>118</b>. In some embodiments, the system may not include the display <b>116</b> or the LED array <b>118</b> and can instead rely on alternative ways of providing guidance to the user, such as using audible feedback.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Stabilization</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The apparatus <b>100</b> above can be used to accurately insert a needle into a patient. However, setting the insertion depth, angle, and needle length appropriately does not guarantee successful insertion, and difficulties can be encountered in practice. For example, patients can move, providers can apply differing amounts of pressure to the relevant area (e.g., to the patient's forearm), and so forth. The depth of the target can vary as the provider pushes on the patient because soft tissue is pliable. For example, if a provider pushes down relatively hard on the patient, a vein can be at a shallower depth than if the provider presses relatively gently. Thus, if a physician applies more or less pressure to the patient (e.g., by pressing down an ultrasound probe and/or by pushing down on the apparatus <b>100</b>), the appropriate insertion depth can change.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Accordingly, some embodiments of the apparatus <b>100</b> can include a finger hole <b>108</b>, which can help the provider to hold the apparatus <b>100</b> against the patient in a more consistent manner. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, a provider can place their index finger in the finger hole <b>108</b> and can place their other fingers adjacent to the finger hole <b>108</b>. In some procedures, for example when inserting a needle into an arm or leg, the provider can place their thumb on the other side of the patient's limb, for example as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>. It will be appreciated that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref> are merely examples, and a provider may grip a patient and or apparatus in other ways as appropriate for the patient and the procedure. For example, the grip can be modified for pediatric patients. Advantageously, the apparatus <b>100</b> can facilitate a firm grip and steady placement in a wide variety of usage scenarios.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, the finger hole <b>108</b> can be open or closed. For example, the finger hole <b>108</b> can be a cylinder open on both ends. In other embodiments, the finger hole <b>108</b> can be open, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>. An open design may enhance user comfort and/or be usable by users with a wider range of finger sizes. In some embodiments, the finger hole <b>108</b> can extend substantially the entire width of the base <b>102</b>, while in other embodiments the finger hole <b>108</b> can have a relatively short length, for example half the width of the base <b>102</b> or less, such as about the width of a ring. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>D</figref> illustrate various embodiments of the finger hole <b>108</b>. Different embodiments of the finger hole <b>108</b> can be desirable depending on the provider's preferences, the type of procedure being performed, the type of patient (e.g., adult or pediatric), and so forth. The finger hole <b>108</b> can be placed at various locations on the base <b>102</b>. For example, the finger hole <b>108</b> can be placed at the front, rear, on a side, and so forth, and could be rotated (e.g., rotated 90 degrees) relative to the orientation shown in the figures.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Because the apparatus <b>100</b> can enable a provider to maintain a firm, stable placement with respect to the patient, the apparatus <b>100</b> can move as the patient moves in a manner that maintains the placement of the apparatus <b>100</b> and that preserves the insertion depth and/or insertion angle. Accordingly, the provider can have a greater chance of successfully placing the needle in the desired location without repeated attempts.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The shape of the base <b>102</b> can also play a role in the stability of the apparatus <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the base <b>102</b> of the apparatus <b>100</b> can be curved or flat. For example, a curved base <b>102</b> can be desirable when performing an insertion into an arm, leg, and so forth, while a flat base <b>102</b> can be desirable when performing an insertion into, for example, a patient's chest or other relatively flat area. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows various views of a base <b>102</b>, which can have a flat bottom or a curved bottom.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Sterilization</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The apparatus <b>100</b> is generally for use in procedures that involve puncturing a patient's skin. Thus, it can be important to ensure that the apparatus <b>100</b> and any associated components that come into contact with the patient are sterile. In some cases, some components used in a procedure may not be sterile, such an ultrasound probe and its associated cord. Measures can be taken to protect the patient from exposure to non-sterile components.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">As discussed above, the apparatus <b>100</b> can be used in conjunction with an ultrasound probe. In some cases, the ultrasound probe can be wired and have a cord associated therewith, while in other cases, the ultrasound probe can be wireless. In some cases, the ultrasound probe can be considered non-sterile. In some cases, the ultrasound probe cord can be considered non-sterile. Accordingly, it can be important to prevent the non-sterile components from coming into contact with objects that should be kept sterile (e.g., objects that will be placed on the patient, such as the apparatus <b>100</b>). In some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> can comprise a bag <b>148</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B</figref>. In some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> can comprise a sterile handle <b>150</b>. In some embodiments, the bag <b>148</b> can be attached to the sterile handle <b>150</b>. The sterile handle <b>150</b> can have a non-sterile portion and a sterile portion. In some embodiments, the bag can be open at both ends. In some embodiments, one end of the bag <b>148</b> can be attached to the cavity <b>106</b> and the other end can be attached to a tab. In some embodiments, the bag can be attached to the cavity <b>106</b>. n some embodiments, the sterile handle <b>150</b> can include a wire that can be used to tie off the end of the bag <b>148</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">A provider can place the ultrasound probe (and, if applicable, the cord for the ultrasound probe) into the bag.

In some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> can include a protective sterile film <b>152</b>. The protective sterile film <b>152</b> can provide a barrier between the ultrasound probe and the patient's skin. In some embodiments, a user can provide ultrasound gel into the cavity <b>106</b> prior to inserting the ultrasound probe. For example, the provider can dispense an amount of ultrasound gel on top of the protective sterile film <b>152</b> and then insert the ultrasound probe into the cavity <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>C</figref>, in some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> can be inside a sterile packaging <b>154</b>.

The sterile packaging <b>154</b> can include sterile packaging tabs <b>156</b> and/or sterile packaging posts <b>158</b> can be used to, for example, aid in positioning the cord of an ultrasound probe.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">As discussed above, the apparatus <b>100</b> can include a variety of active components such as the active angle sensor arm <b>130</b>, the display <b>116</b>, LED array <b>118</b>, linear position sensors, batteries, processing hardware, memory hardware, printed circuit boards, and so forth. Preferably, some of these components can be reused, which can reduce the cost associated with using the apparatus <b>100</b>. However, it is important that any reusable components be kept out of contact with the patient.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> depicts an example embodiment of a swing arm <b>104</b> in which an electronics package <b>160</b> can be placed inside an electronics package sleeve <b>162</b>.

The electronics package sleeve <b>162</b> can come into contact with the patient, with body fluids, and so forth, and thus can be discarded after each use.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The apparatus <b>100</b> described above can be designed to accommodate a range of needle lengths, insertion depths, and insertion angles. However, in some embodiments, such flexibility may not be needed. Thus, some embodiments of the apparatus <b>100</b> may not allow for adjustment of all three parameters. Such limitations can have several advantages. For example, a device with fewer adjustable parameters can be easier to use, and thus may reduce errors, reduce the time needed to use the apparatus, and so forth. A device with fewer adjustable parameters can be cheaper to manufacture. For example, a device that does not allow for adjusting the needle length can cost less to manufacture because hardware specific to measuring the needle length can be omitted. Similarly, cost savings and reduced device complexity can be realized by, for example, limiting the insertion angle.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As one example, an apparatus <b>100</b> can be configured for inserting pediatric IV catheters. In some embodiments, needle length can be fixed. In some embodiments, diameter can be fixed. In some embodiments, the electronics of the apparatus <b>100</b> can be pre-programmed to work with a particular needle length or a particular range of needle lengths. For example, if a user wants to insert an 18 gauge IV catheter using a needle of a known length L, the apparatus <b>100</b> can be configured so that the user can select the length L, for example by pressing a button or adjusting a slider on the apparatus <b>100</b> until the display <b>116</b> indicates the appropriate needle length L.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some embodiments, a needle guide <b>112</b> can be configured to receive a needle of a particular length. For example, a needle can include a side port <b>166</b>, and the needle guide <b>112</b> can be configured to include receivers <b>164</b> that the side port <b>166</b> can fit into. In some embodiments, the shape of the side port can indicate one or more properties of the needle such as the needle length and/or the needle gauge, and the apparatus <b>100</b> can be configured to recognize the needle length, gauge, etc., based on the receiver <b>164</b> into which the port was inserted (for example, using sensors embedded in the receivers <b>164</b>). In some embodiments, the shape of the receiver <b>164</b> can be circular, rectangular, hexagonal, and so forth. In some embodiments, receivers <b>164</b> can be placed on the needle guide <b>112</b> such that, regardless of the length of the needle, the tip of the needle is always at the same place as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In some embodiments, the apparatus can be pre-configured to support a fixed number of needle lengths. For example, the user may select an appropriate needle length using the user input button <b>144</b> until the display <b>116</b> shows the correct needle length.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some embodiments, an apparatus <b>100</b> can be configured so that the needle always pierces the patient's skin at a fixed distance from the ultrasound probe, and the insertion depth can be controlled by adjusting the insertion angle. In some embodiments, instead of adjusting the insertion angle, the insertion angle can be fixed and the insertion depth can be adjusted by modifying the distance between the insertion point and the ultrasound probe.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some embodiments, a needle insertion point on the patient's skin can be fixed. In some embodiments, the needle insertion depth can vary. In some embodiments, an insertion apparatus can be a mechanical device (i.e., a device without electronics). A mechanical device can have several advantages. For example, a mechanical device can be relatively simple and cheap to manufacture.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some embodiments, a needle can be inserted at a fixed distance x/2 away from the ultrasound probe, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The needle can be raised a distance x from the ultrasound probe, such that the angle of the needle above the skin is the same as the angle of the needle below the skin and the height of the needle above the skin corresponds to the distance of the needle below the skin when the needle is inserted such that the tip of the needle is below (e.g., directly below) the ultrasound probe.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, a needle a horizontal distance x away from an ultrasound probe can be inserted to a first depth d<sub>1 </sub>by raising the needle to a height d<sub>1 </sub>above the skin of the patient and inserting the needle at an angle &#x3b1; such that the needle contacts the skin at x/2. The angle &#x3b1; can be determined by &#x3b1;=tan<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>2d<sub>1</sub>/x.

At block <b>302</b>, the user can set the needle sled to zero. The user can then, at block <b>304</b>, inset the needle into the device, for example through the needle measurement hole <b>140</b>. At block <b>306</b>, the user can depress the hilt sensor <b>142</b> with the needle hilt when the needle is fully inserted into the needle measurement hole <b>140</b>. The device can be configured to determine the length of the needle when the hilt sensor <b>142</b> is depressed. At decision point <b>308</b>, the device can determine if the needle length measurement is acceptable. For example, the system can determine if the needle length is within an allowable range. For example, in some embodiments, a device can be configured to require a minimum needle length. In some embodiments, a device can be configured to accept a maximum needle length. If the measurement is not okay (e.g., the needle length is too short, which may indicate that the hilt sensor <b>142</b> was improperly or accidentally triggered), the device can provide an error notification to the user at block <b>310</b>, for example by displaying a message on the display <b>116</b>, showing a red color on the LED array <b>118</b>, playing a sound, and so forth, and the user can retry to needle measurement procedure.

The apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B</figref> can include a needle holder <b>168</b>, a plunger <b>170</b>, a needle/plunger lock <b>172</b>, a fixed door portion <b>174</b>, a movable door portion <b>176</b>, and an angle adjuster <b>178</b>. The angle adjuster <b>178</b> can, in contrast to the angle adjustment knob <b>110</b>, be configured to adjust the angle of the swing arm <b>104</b> by traveling linearly. In some embodiments, the swing arm <b>104</b> can contain electronics similar to the electronics discussed above, or the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B</figref> can operate without electronics.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>A-G</figref> show views of an apparatus having a fixed door portion <b>174</b> and movable door portion <b>176</b> during various stages of a procedure for inserting a needle into a patient. With this mechanism, all needles can start at the same angle and distance, which can reduce or eliminate the need to measure the needle length.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B</figref>, the apparatus can have a fixed door portion <b>174</b> and a movable door portion <b>176</b>. the movable door portion <b>176</b> can be initially positioned to prevent a needle from traveling forward or downed (i.e., from moving toward the patient). Thus, in a closed configuration, the movable door portion <b>176</b> can prevent the needle from puncturing the patient's skin. For example, the movable door portion <b>176</b> can be positioned as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B</figref> when the provider is scanning for a target vein using an ultrasound probe.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">After locating a target vein, the provider can move the movable door portion <b>176</b> into a second position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>C and <b>22</b>D</figref>. In the second position, the needle may password forward toward the patient, for example as a result of the provider pushing on the plunger <b>170</b>, but the path of the needle can be constrained because the fixed door portion <b>174</b> and movable door portion <b>176</b> form a hole that confines the needle to substantially linear movement. The needle may have a small degree of flexibility in pose and direction, for example because the opening created by the fixed door portion <b>174</b> and movable door portion <b>176</b> may be somewhat larger than the outer diameter of the needle.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Once the needle is inserted into the patient to the desired depth, the movable door portion <b>176</b> can be moved to a third position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>E and <b>22</b>F</figref>. In this configuration, the angle of the needle can be freely decreased with respect to the patient's skin surface. For example, a provider may reduce the angle in preparation for feeding a catheter. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>G</figref> shows another view of the apparatus when the movable door portion <b>176</b> is in the third position.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>A-<b>22</b>D</figref> show another example embodiment of an apparatus for guided insertion of a needle, catheter, and so forth. The apparatus can include a base <b>102</b>, a reference ruler <b>180</b> that is immovably fixed to the base at a predetermined angle, a measurement post <b>182</b>, a ramp <b>184</b>, a needle/plunger holder <b>186</b>, a positioning guide <b>188</b>, a release peg <b>190</b>, a fixed door portion <b>192</b>, and a movable door portion <b>194</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The ramp <b>184</b> can slide inside the positioning guide <b>188</b>, which can have markings to indicate the distance of the needle tip from the ultrasound probe. The measurement post <b>182</b> can be attached to and move with the ramp <b>184</b>. The measurement post <b>182</b> can be used in conjunction with the reference ruler <b>180</b>. The distance markings on the device can be used to determine how far to push the needle to achieve a desired insertion depth when the needle is below (e.g., directly below) the ultrasound probe.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>A-D</figref> can be configured so that the ramp <b>184</b> is set to a predetermined angle. When the release peg <b>190</b> is removed or pulled from under the ramp <b>184</b>, the ramp <b>184</b> may freely fall, thereby enabling the provider to adjust the angle of the needle.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-E</figref> illustrate an embodiment of a fixed door portion <b>192</b> and movable door portion <b>194</b> that operates similarly to the fixed door portion <b>174</b> and movable door portion <b>176</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>A-G</figref>.

However, the embodiments described above still require that the user insert the needle manually. While this approach offers flexibility to the user, for example, the user can make small alterations if warranted, such as if the user observes some movement on the ultrasound display. However, this approach can also lead to errors, such as not pushing the need in far enough or pushing the needle too far.

The first motor <b>600</b> and first plate <b>604</b> can then drive the needle further into the patient. The first motor <b>600</b> can drive the second motor <b>602</b> backwards, away from the patient, to extract the needle, leaving the second plate <b>606</b> in place and holding the catheter. In some cases, the needle and catheter can also include a protective housing. The protective housing can include a lever or push button that, when depressed, causes the needle to retract into the protective housing.
