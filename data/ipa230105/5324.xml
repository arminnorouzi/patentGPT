Other factors are environmental factors over which the casino has no or little ability to control. For example, factors that the casino can control include its player-loyalty program, complementary amenities to players, promotions, and bonuses, which are awards given to players over and above any payment required by a paytable in a game. The type of games available to play, and factors such as their payback percentages, location, denomination, and speed are also under control of the casino.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The player-loyalty program tracks the play of enrolled players and typically provides goods and services, including additional gaming credits, in proportion to the amount wagered. All of the foregoing can be configured by the casino to be richer or leaner from the players' perspective. Obviously, if the casino is always packed with players there is little motivation to provide extensive promotional give-aways, free gaming credit, and lavish complementary amenities, all of which cut into casino profitability. On the other hand, if there are few players on the floor, profitability might be increased by spending more for these kinds of inducements to draw players to the games.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another factor over which the casino can exert control is staffing levels, which are set by the casino. Too few staff for the customers results in poor service and may ultimately result in lower profitability, even thought there is a labor savings. Similarly, if there is too many staff for the crowd, although service is presumably at a high level, cost is up thus reducing profitability.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Advertising by the casino, either through print or broadcast media, or directly targeted by mail, email, phone call, text message, and similar communications, also affects business. Too little advertising may save money in the budget, but diminishing customer numbers results in decreased profitability. Like staffing, there is a law of diminishing returns: too much advertising may not be drawing in much in the way of additional players while increasing casino expenses.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Environmental factors over which the casino has virtually no control include such things as the weather, local traffic, cost and availability of transportation (gas, airline tickets, rental cars, etc.), and competition for the gaming dollar, including competitor casinos and other area events. The time of each day and the day of the week correlate with the numbers of players on a casino floor. Holidays and the times immediately before and after also have a generally known effect that either tends to increase or decrease the number of players.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is extremely complex to consider all of the factors that might affect casino performance, such as profitability a market share, and to adjust the variables over which the casino can exert control in a way that optimizes desired performance.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a functional block diagram that illustrates a gaming device according to embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is an isometric view of the gaming device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C</figref> are detail diagrams of exemplary types of gaming devices according to embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a functional block diagram of networked gaming devices according to embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a functional block diagram showing an additional portion of the network of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow chart depicting operation of an embodiment of the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate example gaming devices according to embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, a gaming device <b>10</b> is an electronic gaming machine.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Although an electronic gaming machine or &#x201c;slot&#x201d; machine is illustrated, various other types of devices may be used to wager monetarily based credits on a game of chance in accordance with principles of the invention. The term &#x201c;electronic gaming device&#x201d; is meant to include various devices such as electro-mechanical spinning-reel type slot machines, video slot machines, and video poker machines, for instance. Other gaming devices may include computer-based gaming machines, wireless gaming devices, multi-player gaming stations, modified personal electronic gaming devices (such as cell phones), personal computers, server-based gaming terminals, and other similar devices. Although embodiments of the invention will work with all of the gaming types mentioned, for ease of illustration the present embodiments will be described in reference to the electronic gaming machine <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The gaming device <b>10</b> includes a cabinet <b>15</b> housing components to operate the gaming device <b>10</b>. The cabinet <b>15</b> may include a gaming display <b>20</b>, a base portion <b>13</b>, a top box <b>18</b>, and a player interface panel <b>30</b>. The gaming display <b>20</b> may include mechanical spinning reels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), a video display (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref>), or a combination of both spinning reels and a video display (not shown). The gaming cabinet <b>15</b> may also include a credit meter <b>27</b> and a coin-in or bet meter <b>28</b>. The credit meter <b>27</b> may indicate the total number of credits remaining on the gaming device <b>10</b> that are eligible to be wagered. In some embodiments, the credit meter <b>27</b> may reflect a monetary unit, such as dollars. However, it is often preferable to have the credit meter <b>27</b> reflect a number of &#x2018;credits,&#x2019; rather than a monetary unit. The bet meter <b>28</b> may indicate the amount of credits to be wagered on a particular game. Thus, for each game, the player transfers the amount that he or she wants to wager from the credit meter <b>27</b> to the bet meter <b>28</b>. In some embodiments, various other meters may be present, such as meters reflecting amounts won, amounts paid, or the like. In embodiments where the gaming display <b>20</b> is a video monitor, the information indicated on the credit meters may be shown on the gaming display itself <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The base portion <b>13</b> may include a lighted panel <b>14</b>, a coin return (not shown), and a gaming handle <b>12</b> operable on a partially rotating pivot joint <b>11</b>. The game handle <b>12</b> is traditionally included on mechanical spinning-reel games, where the handle may be pulled toward a player to initiate the spinning of reels <b>22</b> after placement of a wager. The top box <b>18</b> may include a lighted panel <b>17</b>, a video display (such as an LCD monitor), a mechanical bonus device (not shown), and a candle light indicator <b>19</b>. The player interface panel <b>30</b> may include various devices so that a player can interact with the gaming device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The player interface panel <b>30</b> may include one or more game buttons <b>32</b> that can be actuated by the player to cause the gaming device <b>10</b> to perform a specific action. For example, some of the game buttons <b>32</b> may cause the gaming device <b>10</b> to bet a credit to be wagered during the next game, change the number of lines being played on a multi-line game, cash out the credits remaining on the gaming device (as indicated on the credit meter <b>27</b>), or request assistance from casino personnel, such as by lighting the candle <b>19</b>. In addition, the player interface panel <b>30</b> may include one or more game actuating buttons <b>33</b>. The game actuating buttons <b>33</b> may initiate a game with a pre-specified amount of credits. On some gaming devices <b>10</b> a &#x201c;Max Bet&#x201d; game actuating button <b>33</b> may be included that places the maximum credit wager on a game and initiates the game. The player interface panel <b>30</b> may further include a bill acceptor <b>37</b> and a ticket printer <b>38</b>. The bill acceptor <b>37</b> may accept and validate paper money or previously printed tickets with a credit balance. The ticket printer <b>38</b> may print out tickets reflecting the balance of the credits that remain on the gaming device <b>10</b> when a player cashes out by pressing one of the game buttons <b>32</b> programmed to cause a &#x2018;cashout.&#x2019; These tickets may be inserted into other gaming machines or redeemed at a cashier station or kiosk for cash.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The gaming device <b>10</b> may also include one or more speakers <b>26</b> to transmit auditory information or sounds to the player. The auditory information may include specific sounds associated with particular events that occur during game play on the gaming device <b>10</b>. For example, a particularly festive sound may be played during a large win or when a bonus is triggered. The speakers <b>26</b> may also transmit &#x201c;attract&#x201d; sounds to entice nearby players when the game is not currently being played.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The gaming device <b>10</b> may further include a secondary display <b>25</b>. This secondary display <b>25</b> may be a vacuum fluorescent display (VFD), a liquid crystal display (LCD), a cathode ray tube (CRT), a plasma screen, or the like. The secondary display <b>25</b> may show any combination of primary game information and ancillary information to the player. For example, the secondary display <b>25</b> may show player tracking information, secondary bonus information, advertisements, or player selectable game options.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The gaming device <b>10</b> may include a separate information window (not shown) dedicated to supplying any combination of information related to primary game play, secondary bonus information, player tracking information, secondary bonus information, advertisements or player selectable game options. This window may be fixed in size and location or may have its size and location vary temporally as communication needs change. One example of such a resizable window is International Game Technology's &#x201c;service window&#x201d;. Another example is Las Vegas Gaming Incorporated's retrofit technology which allows information to be placed over areas of the game or the secondary display screen at various times and in various situations.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The gaming device <b>10</b> includes a microprocessor <b>40</b> that controls operation of the gaming device <b>10</b>. If the gaming device <b>10</b> is a standalone gaming device, the microprocessor <b>40</b> may control virtually all of the operations of the gaming devices and attached equipment, such as operating game logic stored in memory (not shown) as firmware, controlling the display <b>20</b> to represent the outcome of a game, communicating with the other peripheral devices (such as the bill acceptor <b>37</b>), and orchestrating the lighting and sound emanating from the gaming device <b>10</b>. In other embodiments where the gaming device <b>10</b> is coupled to a network <b>50</b>, as described below, the microprocessor <b>40</b> may have different tasks depending on the setup and function of the gaming device. For example, the microprocessor <b>40</b> may be responsible for running the base game of the gaming device and executing instructions received over the network <b>50</b> from a bonus server or player tracking server. In a server-based gaming setup, the microprocessor <b>40</b> may act as a terminal to execute instructions from a remote server that is running game play on the gaming device.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The microprocessor <b>40</b> may be coupled to a machine communication interface (MCI) <b>42</b> that connects the gaming device <b>10</b> to a gaming network <b>50</b>. The MCI <b>42</b> may be coupled to the microprocessor <b>40</b> through a serial connection, a parallel connection, an optical connection, or in some cases a wireless connection. The gaming device <b>10</b> may include memory <b>41</b> (MEM), such as a random access memory (RAM), coupled to the microprocessor <b>40</b> and which can be used to store gaming information, such as storing total coin-in statistics about a present or past gaming session, which can be communicated to a remote server or database through the MCI <b>42</b>. The MCI <b>42</b> may also facilitate communication between the network <b>50</b> and the secondary display <b>25</b> or a player tracking unit <b>45</b> housed in the gaming cabinet <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The player tracking unit <b>45</b> may include an identification device <b>46</b> and one or more buttons <b>47</b> associated with the player tracking unit <b>45</b>. The identification device <b>46</b> serves to identify a player, by, for example, reading a player-tracking device, such as a player tracking card that is issued by the casino to individual players who choose to have such a card. The identification device <b>46</b> may instead, or additionally, identify players through other methods. Player tracking systems using player tracking cards and card readers <b>46</b> are known in the art. Briefly summarizing such a system, a player registers with the casino prior to commencing gaming. The casino issues a unique player-tracking card to the player and opens a corresponding player account that is stored on a server or host computer, described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The player account may include the player's name and mailing address and other information of interest to the casino in connection with marketing efforts. Prior to playing one of the gaming devices in the casino, the player inserts the player tracking card into the identification device <b>46</b> thus permitting the casino to track player activity, such as amounts wagered, credits won, and rate of play.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">To induce the player to use the card and be an identified player, the casino may award each player points proportional to the money or credits wagered by the player. Players typically accrue points at a rate related to the amount wagered, although other factors may cause the casino to award the player various amounts. The points may be displayed on the secondary display <b>25</b> or using other methods. In conventional player tracking systems, the player may take his or her card to a special desk in the casino where a casino employee scans the card to determine how many accrued points are in the player's account. The player may redeem points for selected merchandise, meals in casino restaurants, or the like, which each have assigned point values. In some player tracking systems, the player may use the secondary display <b>25</b> to access their player tracking account, such as to check a total number of points, redeem points for various services, make changes to their account, or download promotional credits to the gaming device <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, the identification device <b>46</b> may read other identifying cards (such as driver licenses, credit cards, etc.) to identify a player and match them to a corresponding player tracking account. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows the player tracking unit <b>45</b> with a card reader as the identification device <b>46</b>, other embodiments may include a player tracking unit <b>45</b> with a biometric scanner, PIN code acceptor, or other methods of identifying a player to pair the player with their player tracking account.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">During typical play on a gaming device <b>10</b>, a player plays a game by placing a wager and then initiating a gaming session. The player may initially insert monetary bills or previously printed tickets with a credit value into the bill acceptor <b>37</b>. The player may also put coins into a coin acceptor (not shown) or a credit, debit or casino account card into a card reader/authorizer (not shown). One of skill in the art will readily see that this invention is useful with all gambling devices, regardless of the manner in which wager value-input is accomplished.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The credit meter <b>27</b> displays the numeric credit value of the money inserted dependent on the denomination of the gaming device <b>10</b>. That is, if the gaming device <b>10</b> is a nickel slot machine and a $20 bill inserted into the bill acceptor <b>37</b>, the credit meter will reflect 400 credits or one credit for each nickel of the inserted twenty dollars. For gaming devices <b>10</b> that support multiple denominations, the credit meter <b>27</b> will reflect the amount of credits relative to the denomination selected. Thus, in the above example, if a penny denomination is selected after the $20 is inserted the credit meter will change from 400 credits to 2000 credits.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A wager may be placed by pushing one or more of the game buttons <b>32</b>, which may be reflected on the bet meter <b>28</b>. That is, the player can generally depress a &#x201c;bet one&#x201d; button (one of the buttons on the player interface panel <b>30</b>, such as <b>32</b>), which transfers one credit from the credit meter <b>27</b> to the bet meter <b>28</b>. Each time the button <b>32</b> is depressed an additional single credit transfers to the bet meter <b>28</b> up to a maximum bet that can be placed on a single play of the electronic gaming device <b>10</b>. The gaming session may be initiated by pulling the gaming handle <b>12</b> or depressing the spin button <b>33</b>. On some gaming devices <b>10</b>, a &#x201c;max bet&#x201d; button (another one of the buttons <b>32</b> on the player interface panel <b>30</b>) may be depressed to wager the maximum number of credits supported by the gaming device <b>10</b> and initiate a gaming session. If the gaming session does not result in any winning combination, the process of placing a wager may be repeated by the player. Alternatively, the player may cash out any remaining credits on the credit meter <b>27</b> by depressing the &#x201c;cash-out&#x201d; button (another button <b>32</b> on the player interface panel <b>30</b>), which causes the credits on the credit meter <b>27</b> to be paid out in the form of a ticket through the ticket printer <b>38</b>, or may be paid out in the form of returning coins from a coin hopper (not shown) to a coin return tray.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">If instead a winning combination (win) appears on the display <b>20</b>, the award corresponding to the winning combination is immediately applied to the credit meter <b>27</b>. For example, if the gaming device <b>10</b> is a slot machine, a winning combination of symbols <b>23</b> may land on a played payline on reels <b>22</b>. If any bonus games are initiated, the gaming device <b>10</b> may enter into a bonus mode or simply award the player with a bonus amount of credits that are applied to the credit meter <b>27</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrate exemplary types of gaming devices according to embodiments of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates an example spinning-reel gaming machine <b>10</b>A, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates an example video slot machine <b>10</b>B, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates an example video poker machine <b>10</b>C.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, a spinning-reel gaming machine <b>10</b>A includes a gaming display <b>20</b>A having a plurality of mechanical spinning reels <b>22</b>A. Typically, spinning-reel gaming machines <b>10</b>A have three to five spinning reels <b>22</b>A. Each of the spinning reels <b>22</b>A has multiple symbols <b>23</b>A that may be separated by blank areas on the spinning reels <b>22</b>A, although the presence of blank areas typically depends on the number of reels <b>22</b>A present in the gaming device <b>10</b>A and the number of different symbols <b>23</b>A that may appear on the spinning reels <b>22</b>A. Each of the symbols <b>22</b>A or blank areas makes up a &#x201c;stop&#x201d; on the spinning reel <b>22</b>A where the reel <b>22</b>A comes to rest after a spin. Although the spinning reels <b>22</b>A of various games <b>10</b>A may have various numbers of stops, many conventional spinning-reel gaming devices <b>10</b>A have reels <b>22</b>A with twenty two stops.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">During game play, the spinning reels <b>22</b>A may be controlled by stepper motors (not shown) under the direction of the microprocessor <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). Thus, although the spinning-reel gaming device <b>10</b>A has mechanical based spinning reels <b>22</b>A, the movement of the reels themselves is electronically controlled to spin and stop. This electronic control is advantageous because it allows a virtual reel strip to be stored in the memory <b>41</b> of the gaming device <b>10</b>A, where various &#x201c;virtual stops&#x201d; are mapped to each physical stop on the physical reel <b>22</b>A. This mapping allows the gaming device <b>10</b>A to establish greater awards and bonuses available to the player because of the increased number of possible combinations afforded by the virtual reel strips.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A gaming session on a spinning reel slot machine <b>10</b>A typically includes the player pressing the &#x201c;bet-one&#x201d; button (one of the game buttons <b>32</b>A) to wager a desired number of credits followed by pulling the gaming handle <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B</figref>) or pressing the spin button <b>33</b>A to spin the reels <b>22</b>A. Alternatively, the player may simply press the &#x201c;max-bet&#x201d; button (another one of the game buttons <b>32</b>A) to both wager the maximum number of credits permitted and initiate the spinning of the reels <b>22</b>A. The spinning reels <b>22</b>A may all stop at the same time or may individually stop one after another (typically from left to right) to build player anticipation.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Because the display <b>20</b>A usually cannot be physically modified, some spinning reel slot machines <b>10</b>A include an electronic display screen in the top box <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>), a mechanical bonus mechanism in the top box <b>18</b>, or a secondary display <b>25</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) to execute a bonus.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, a video gaming machine <b>10</b>B may include a video display <b>20</b>B to display virtual spinning reels <b>22</b>B and various other gaming information <b>21</b>B. The video display <b>20</b>B may be a CRT, LCD, plasma screen, or the like. It is usually preferable that the video display <b>20</b>B be a touchscreen to accept player input. A number of symbols <b>23</b>A appear on each of the virtual spinning reels <b>22</b>B. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows five virtual spinning reels <b>22</b>B, the flexibility of the video display <b>20</b>B allows for various reel <b>22</b>B and game configurations. For example, some video slot games <b>10</b>B spin reels for each individual symbol position (or stop) that appears on the video display <b>20</b>B. That is, each symbol position on the screen is independent of every other position during the gaming sessions. In these types of games, very large numbers of pay lines or multiple super scatter pays can be utilized since similar symbols could appear at every symbol position on the video display <b>20</b>B. On the other hand, other video slot games <b>10</b>B more closely resemble the mechanical spinning reel games where symbols that are vertically adjacent to each other are part of the same continuous virtual spinning reel <b>22</b>B.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Because the virtual spinning reels <b>22</b>B, by virtue of being computer implemented, can have almost any number of stops on a reel strip, it is much easier to have a greater variety of displayed outcomes as compared to spinning-reel slot machines <b>10</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) that have a fixed number of physical stops on each spinning reel <b>22</b>A.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">With the possible increases in reel <b>22</b>B numbers and configurations over the mechanical gaming device <b>10</b>A, video gaming devices <b>10</b>B often have multiple paylines <b>24</b> that may be played. By having more paylines <b>24</b> available to play, the player may be more likely to have a winning combination when the reels <b>22</b>B stop and the gaming session ends. However, since the player typically must wager at least a minimum number of credits to enable each payline <b>24</b> to be eligible for winning, the overall odds of winning are not much different, if at all, than if the player is wagering only on a single payline. For example, in a five line game, the player may bet one credit per payline <b>24</b> and be eligible for winning symbol combinations that appear on any of the five played paylines <b>24</b>. This gives a total of five credits wagered and five possible winning paylines <b>24</b>. If, on the other hand, the player only wagers one credit on one payline <b>24</b>, but plays five gaming sessions, the odds of winning would be identical as above: five credits wagered and five possible winning paylines <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Because the video display <b>20</b>B can easily modify the image output by the video display <b>20</b>B, bonuses, such as second screen bonuses are relatively easy to award on the video slot game <b>10</b>B. That is, if a bonus is triggered during game play, the video display <b>20</b>B may simply store the resulting screen shot in memory and display a bonus sequence on the video display <b>20</b>B. After the bonus sequence is completed, the video display <b>20</b>B may then retrieve the previous screen shot and information from memory, and re-display that image.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Also, as mentioned above, the video display <b>20</b>B may allow various other game information <b>21</b>B to be displayed. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, banner information may be displayed above the spinning reels <b>22</b>B to inform the player, perhaps, which symbol combination is needed to trigger a bonus. Also, instead of providing a separate credit meter <b>27</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) and bet meter <b>28</b>, the same information can instead be displayed on the video display <b>20</b>B. In addition, &#x201c;soft buttons&#x201d; <b>29</b>B such as a &#x201c;spin&#x201d; button or &#x201c;help/see pays&#x201d; button may be built using the touch screen video display <b>20</b>B. Such customization and ease of changing the image shown on the display <b>20</b>B adds to the flexibility of the game <b>10</b>B.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Even with the improved flexibility afforded by the video display <b>20</b>B, several physical buttons <b>32</b>B and <b>33</b>B are usually provided on video slot machines <b>10</b>B. These buttons may include game buttons <b>32</b>B that allow a player to choose the number of paylines <b>24</b> he or she would like to play and the number of credits wagered on each payline <b>24</b>. In addition, a max bet button (one of the game buttons <b>32</b>B) allows a player to place a maximum credit wager on the maximum number of available paylines <b>24</b> and initiate a gaming session. A repeat bet or spin button <b>33</b>B may also be used to initiate each gaming session when the max bet button is not used.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, a video poker gaming device <b>10</b>C may include a video display <b>20</b>C that is physically similar to the video display <b>20</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. The video display <b>20</b>C may show a poker hand of five cards <b>23</b>C and various other player information <b>21</b>C including a paytable for various winning hands, as well as a plurality of player selectable soft buttons <b>29</b>C. The video display <b>20</b>C may present a poker hand of five cards <b>23</b>C and various other player information <b>21</b>C including a number of player selectable soft (touch-screen) buttons <b>29</b>C and a paytable for various winning hands. Although the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> shows only one hand of poker on the video display <b>20</b>C, various other video poker machines <b>10</b>C may show several poker hands (multi-hand poker). Typically, video poker machines <b>10</b>C play &#x201c;draw&#x201d; poker in which a player is dealt a hand of five cards, has the opportunity to hold any combination of those five cards, and then draws new cards to replace the discarded ones. All pays are usually given for winning combinations resulting from the final hand, although some video poker games <b>10</b>C may give bonus credits for certain combinations received on the first hand before the draw. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> a player has been dealt two aces, a three, a six, and a nine. The video poker game <b>10</b>C may provide a bonus or payout for the player having been dealt the pair of aces, even before the player decides what to discard in the draw. Since pairs, three of a kind, etc. are typically needed for wins, a player would likely hold the two aces that have been dealt and draw three cards to replace the three, six, and nine in the hope of receiving additional aces or other cards leading to a winning combination with a higher award amount. After the draw and revealing of the final hand, the video poker game <b>10</b>C typically awards any credits won to the credit meter.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The player selectable soft buttons <b>29</b>C appearing on the screen respectively correspond to each card on the video display <b>20</b>C. These soft buttons <b>29</b>C allow players to select specific cards on the video display <b>20</b>C such that the card corresponding to the selected soft button is &#x201c;held&#x201d; before the draw. Typically, video poker machines <b>10</b>C also include physical game buttons <b>32</b>C that correspond to the cards in the hand and may be selected to hold a corresponding card. A deal/draw button <b>33</b>C may also be included to initiate a gaming session after credits have been wagered (with a bet button <b>32</b>C, for example) and to draw any cards not held after the first hand is displayed.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Although examples of a spinning reel slot machine <b>10</b>A, a video slot machine <b>10</b>B, and a video poker machine <b>10</b>C have been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, gaming machines and various other types of gaming devices known in the art are contemplated and are within the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating networked gaming devices according to embodiments of the invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, multiple electronic gaming devices (EGMs) <b>70</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>73</b>, <b>74</b>, and <b>75</b> may be coupled to one another and coupled to a remote server <b>80</b> through a network <b>50</b>. For ease of understanding, gaming devices or EGMs <b>70</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>73</b>, <b>74</b>, and <b>75</b> are generically referred to as EGMs <b>70</b>-<b>75</b>. The term EGMs <b>70</b>-<b>75</b>, however, may refer to any combination of one or more of EGMs <b>70</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>73</b>, <b>74</b>, and <b>75</b>. Additionally, the gaming server <b>80</b> may be coupled to one or more gaming databases <b>90</b>. These gaming network <b>50</b> connections may allow multiple gaming devices <b>70</b>-<b>75</b> to remain in communication with one another during particular gaming modes such as tournament play or remote head-to-head play. Although some of the gaming devices <b>70</b>-<b>75</b> coupled on the gaming network <b>50</b> may resemble the gaming devices <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, other coupled gaming devices <b>70</b>-<b>75</b> may include differently configured gaming devices. For example, the gaming devices <b>70</b>-<b>75</b> may include traditional slot machines <b>75</b> directly coupled to the network <b>50</b>, banks of gaming devices <b>70</b> coupled to the network <b>50</b>, banks of gaming devices <b>70</b> coupled to the network through a bank controller <b>60</b>, wireless handheld gaming machines <b>72</b> and cell phones <b>73</b> coupled to the gaming network <b>50</b> through one or more wireless routers or antennas <b>61</b>, personal computers <b>74</b> coupled to the network <b>50</b> through the internet <b>62</b>, and banks of gaming devices <b>71</b> coupled to the network through one or more optical connection lines <b>64</b>. Additionally, some of the traditional gaming devices <b>70</b>, <b>71</b>, and <b>75</b> may include electronic gaming tables, multi-station gaming devices, or electronic components operating in conjunction with non-gaming components, such as automatic card readers, chip readers, and chip counters, for example.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Gaming devices <b>71</b> coupled over an optical line <b>64</b> may be remote gaming devices in a different location or casino. The optical line <b>64</b> may be coupled to the gaming network <b>50</b> through an electronic to optical signal converter <b>63</b> and may be coupled to the gaming devices <b>71</b> through an optical to electronic signal converter <b>65</b>. The banks of gaming devices <b>70</b> coupled to the network <b>50</b> may be coupled through a bank controller <b>60</b> for compatibility purposes, for local organization and control, or for signal buffering purposes. The network <b>50</b> may include serial or parallel signal transmission lines and carry data in accordance with data transfer protocols such as Ethernet transmission lines, Rs-232 lines, firewire lines, USB lines, or other communication protocols. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, substantially the entire network <b>50</b> may be made of fiber optic lines or may be a wireless network utilizing a wireless protocol such as IEEE 802.11 a, b, g, or n, Zigbee, RF protocols, optical transmission, near-field transmission, or the like.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As mentioned above, each gaming device <b>70</b>-<b>75</b> may have an individual processor <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) and memory <b>41</b> to run and control game play on the gaming device <b>70</b>-<b>75</b>, or some of the gaming devices <b>70</b>-<b>75</b> may be terminals that are run by a remote server <b>80</b> in a server based gaming environment. Server based gaming environments may be advantageous to casinos by allowing fast downloading of particular game types or themes based on casino preference or player selection. Additionally, tournament based games, linked games, and certain game types, such as BINGO or keno may benefit from at least some server <b>80</b> based control.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thus, in some embodiments, the network <b>50</b>, server <b>80</b>, and database <b>90</b> may be dedicated to communications regarding specific game or tournament play. In other embodiments, however, the network <b>50</b>, server <b>80</b>, and database <b>90</b> may be part of a player tracking network. For player tracking capabilities, when a player inserts a player tracking card in the card reader <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), the player tracking unit <b>45</b> sends player identification information obtained on the card reader <b>46</b> through the MCI <b>42</b> over the network <b>50</b> to the player tracking server <b>80</b>, where the player identification information is compared to player information records in the player database <b>90</b> to provide the player with information regarding their player account or other features at the gaming device <b>10</b> where the player is wagering. Additionally, multiple databases <b>90</b> and/or servers <b>80</b> may be present and coupled to one or more networks <b>50</b> to provide a variety of gaming services, such as both game/tournament data and player tracking data.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The various systems described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> can be used in a number of ways. For instance, the systems can be used to track data about various players. The tracked data can be used by the casino to provide additional benefits to players, such as extra bonuses or extra benefits such as bonus games and other benefits as described above. These added benefits further entice the players to play at the casino that provides the benefits.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Indicated generally at <b>92</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is another portion of network <b>50</b>. It includes a configuration server <b>94</b> and a workstation <b>96</b>, both of which are operatively connected for communication with other elements on the network. Network <b>50</b> is also operatively connected to at least one electronics communications network <b>98</b>. Network <b>98</b> comprises or may be connected to a cellular network for sending text and voice messages, a telephone network for sending voice messages, and/or a global communications network such as the Internet for sending email messages or posting messages, such as banner ads, to websites.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The configuration server <b>94</b> includes a memory having a computer program for processing data that is also stored in the memory. Workstation <b>96</b> may be used by casino personnel to enter data that can be stored in memories connected to the network, including the memory in configuration server <b>94</b>, and to issue commands on the network.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Among other things, the memory associated with server <b>94</b> may store a budget, or a process for calculating a budget, for at least a portion of the casino operating expenses and projected revenues. Such a budget typically includes amounts allocated to the cost and numbers of staff for providing gaming and ancillary services provided on the casino floor and to advertising for the casino. The advertising budget may be subdivided to include Internet advertising, which may include banner ads on websites and direct emailing; advertising on broadcast radio and television as well as on cable and satellite providers; print media; and phone advertising, including delivery by voice and text on telephone and cellular networks.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition to budget items allocated to advertising, portions of the budget related to marketing may also be included. Such marketing promotions may include complementary amenities provided to selected players as well as promotions to induce players to come to the casino. Such marketing promotions may be tiered to provide incentives that are roughly proportional to the amount of wagering that may be expected from a particular player or a particular class of players.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The computer program in the memory of server <b>94</b> implements an artificial intelligence (AI) process. The program may be of several different types, e.g., search and optimization. This approach searches for a solution among a number of possibilities or takes a base solution and optimizes it until it cannot be improved. It may include evolutionary computation in which solutions over several generations are evolved. Another AI approach that could implement the present method includes logical models, such as propositional or sentential logic, first-order logic, and fuzzy logic. Probabilistic methods are other AI approaches that are suitable for the present method. These include Bayesian networks, Markov models, Kalman filters, decision theory, game theory, and utility theory. Still further approaches include classifiers and statistical learning models, neural networks, and control theory. A person having ordinary skill in the art could use any of these kinds of programs to implement the preferred embodiment as described herein.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition to the computer program and the budget, server <b>94</b> receives and monitors a number of performance variables that indicate how well the casino is performing. It should be appreciated that there may be different kinds of casino performance. An obvious one, of course, is casino profitability. But that is not necessarily always the single objective. For example, a casino may want to develop market share at the expense of profitability, at least for a while.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Other performance objectives may also be targeted.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The performance variables may include accounting data gathered from network <b>50</b> and information gathered from the player-tracking system on the network, both of which can be contrasted against the budget data stored in the memory associated with server <b>94</b>. A dedicated accounting server (not shown) may receive information on the network from all of the gaming machines concerning amounts wagered, jackpots paid, and other accounting data. This accounting information, or some portion of it, may in turn be provided to server <b>94</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In addition to the performance variables, server <b>94</b> is provided with data that includes information about local weather; local traffic; transportation costs, including information about the price of gas, plane tickets, and rental cars; competitors' activities, including promotions, activities and other inducements offered by direct competitors as well as competition from other types of entertainment, such as musical and theatrical performances; cost of advertising via, e.g., website banners, print media, broadcast media, etc.; and time, day, date, month, and timing of holidays. These types of factors are referred to herein as environmental factors.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Many of these environmental variables are now available as electronic data from electronic communications network <b>98</b>, including the Internet. Others may be entered manually by casino personnel via workstation <b>96</b>. Still others, such as the time, may be provided from other sources.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As discussed above, the casino can exercise control over a number of variables that affect casino performance. And many of these variables are associated with elements that reside on and/or may be controlled by network <b>50</b>. For example, the player-tracking system may be located on server <b>80</b> or on an independent server (not shown) connected to network <b>50</b>. The player tracking system provides incentives to wager, much like airline frequent-flier programs provide incentives to fly. Player-tracking incentives may be added or modified, by reducing or enhancing incentives, as a result of a command sent over network <b>50</b> to either the player-tracking server or to one or more of gaming machines <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Concerning complementary amenities (&#x201c;comps&#x201d;), some casinos use customer relationship databases (not shown), which is also on network <b>50</b>. It may include contact information such as mailing address, with zip code, and phone and email contact information. This database tracks the level of play and other information about customers and potential customers. It typically indicates what kinds of comps, such as free meals, drinks, rooms, shows, etc., each tracked customer may be entitled to. As with the player-tracking system, commands over network <b>50</b> from server <b>94</b> may add or modify, by reducing or enhancing, comps associated with a particular player or with a class of players. The customer relationship databases receive information from a variety of sources, including over the network in the form of accounting data related to wagers placed. This information enables the casino to consider individual players, or an aggregate group of players with a least one common attribute, in accordance with their potential or estimated net worth, which is often useful to the casino.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In other words, the casino can infer how much money a player or group of players is likely to spend n the future. Worth is traditionally estimated by reviewing a player's past play records and projecting future potential. Such a projection is not possible when the player's past performance records are unavailable or the player's past performance has been limited. For example, a player might have a significant capacity to spend and even a propensity to gamble. But if that player felt mistreated, believed the cost of gambling was too expensive, gambled at another location, was not tracked in prior play at a given location or simply did not like&#x2014;or did not understand&#x2014;an offering, his play history would not accurately reflect his worth.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The first element of worth valuation is capacity to spend. Does a given player, or group of players, have funds with which to gamble and, if so, how much do they have? When this measure is known, management can decide what incentives to potentially offer. For example, a player with capacity to spend $2,000/month is a very valuable player. But a casino could not afford to charter a jet to fly him cross-country, nor could it put him up in a $3,000/night suite. The casino could offer a free standard room, dinner for two in the steak house and free tickets to a concert. For reasons just described, the player's capacity to spend has great influence on incentives and rewards that can be profitably offered to him.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The second element of worth valuation is propensity to gamble. Many people have significant available financial funds but have no desire to gamble. In these cases, management may offer significant benefits&#x2014;possibly including a charted jet&#x2014;because if the player rejects the offer, the casino has only spent the cost of making the offer. In these cases, the magnitude of offer may be a secondary consideration to the cost of marketing and communicating the offer.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Both capacity to spend and propensity to spend may be determined by historical performance, as described earlier, or by projection. This last technique uses known attributes (besides historic play) to project a player's characteristics. For example, a person living in an affluent neighborhood, as determined by physical address, could imply having a significant capacity to spend. Management could turn to a free website, such as Zillow.com, to determine specific worth of the home or it could turn to fee-based services such as credit checks, credit card ratings, etc. for information on which to base a projection. This is one of the sources of information on which the present implementation of the method could rely.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The same home address information could be used to assess propensity to gamble. If the person lives in a neighborhood with other known gamblers, he is more likely to be a gambler too. Similarly, the person's name could be compared against public records of slot tournaments, golf tournaments, participants in World Series of Poker, membership in Internet gambling sites, etc. to better gauge propensity to gamble.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The above is simply a brief description of determining a player's potential worth. The Internet, available mailing lists, housing records and other such databases of information, combined with personal referrals and other information sources are all useful in determining player worth.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">When such information is made part of the automated configuration decisions accomplished by the implementation of the present method, the efficiency and efficacy of casino operations are vastly improved.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">A bonus is an award to a player that is beyond what the game played by the player is required to pay according to the game's paytable. These are often delivered via network <b>50</b> to the player's gaming machine and may include credits for game play, double jackpots, random awards, and other bonuses. Commands from configuration server <b>94</b> may be issued over network <b>50</b> to the bonus server to affect the amount and frequency of bonus awards.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The characteristics of the games themselves, including both electronic gaming machines and table games, are important in determining casino performance. These characteristics can include some aspects that can be implemented and/or changed over network <b>50</b> and other aspects that cannot be. Game features that might be changed by network commands include payback percentage and game speed. Other characteristics, such as the type of game and whether that game or another game should be on the floor, game location, and game denomination may require human intervention to, e.g., change the location of a game on the floor or change a rule of a table game. As will be seen, however, configuration server <b>94</b> may be helpful in determining when and how to change operating parameters that require human intervention to optimize casino performance.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Additional operating parameters that may be influenced by network <b>50</b> include advertising and promotions. As will be described in more detail, configuration server <b>94</b> may determine that a particular kind of advertising should be increased, decreased, or redirected. If so, an electronic message such as an email or text message can be generated by server <b>94</b> and transmitted via electronic communications network <b>96</b>. It may be transmitted to an advertising agency with an instruction to modify the current advertising or it may be transmitted directly to broadcasters and/or publishers with instructions concerning further placement of ads.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Similarly, in response to a command by server <b>92</b> a promotional email, letter, or text message may be delivered via network <b>98</b>. In the case of a letter, an electronic message could go to direct-mailing concern or other entity charged with sending promotional letters to initiate a mailing or place an Internet ad or series of ads. In any event, the promotional communication could contain information about an incentive for a potential player to come to the casino and play its gaming devices. Such an incentive might include, e.g., free credits usable only to make wagers on machines connected to network <b>50</b>. A promotional code might be required to be entered, e.g., by the player via the player tracking system to permit the programmed configuration server to evaluate the effectiveness of various promotions.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Implementation of these bonuses is accomplished by broadcasting corresponding instructions to the casino floor and the player tracking or bonus servers. For example, a promotion saying that all players are eligible for doubled payments on any jackpot won of $100 or above during the next 24 hours is described in an email blast to known players and in an electronic billboard along a busy freeway. Additionally, newspaper ads carry the same message. Within each message is a code, for example &#x201c;12369.&#x201d; The code varies according to the ad in which it is run. To be eligible for the bonus, a player must enter the code into the player tracking unit <b>45</b> before inserting money into the game. The casino floor is configured to recognize this code and activate the doubled bonus opportunity.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The system tracks all codes entered and the amount of play generated by players using each code. It then automatically compares the value of each group's response to the cost of the advertisement. The advertising venues and formats that return a profitable response are increased while the less profitable ones are decreased or eliminated. The system thus learns which advertising is most effective. It may, however, continue to run small tests on the lower-performing mediums to see if they eventually become more effective.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">All sorts of promotions are possible in addition to doubled jackpots. For example, by entering the proper code, a game outcome of BAR BAR BLANK could become a winning outcome even though it otherwise is not. Also, the player may enter his code through the game itself and not the player tracking system. Or the player could enter the code from his cell phone through the Internet and specify which game he is currently playing. In some cases a code could be entered only when the promoted event occurs. A prerequisite could be the use of a player tracking card.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, indicated generally at <b>100</b> is a flow chart that depicts the operation of the AI program associated with server <b>94</b>. To begin, operating parameters are set to an initial value at <b>102</b>. These operating parameters include those things, some of which are discussed above, over which the casino can exert control, e.g., game configuration and location, player-loyalty program, comps, promotions, bonuses, staffing levels, advertising, etc. These initial parameters may be set by the managers of the casino where network <b>50</b> is implemented, and may be based on their training and experience in connection with managing a casino toward a performance goal.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">After so setting the initial parameters at <b>102</b>, the environment variables and the performance variables are monitored at <b>104</b> as described above. Examples of the environmental factors include weather, traffic, transportation cost, time, and cost of advertising. Examples of performance variables may be derived from the accounting data and may include gross revenues or revenues related to specific aspects of casino operations or calculations based on the budget stored in the memory associated with server <b>92</b> to determine such things as overall profitability or profitability of specific aspects of casino operations, etc. Alternatively, performance variables could be derived from the player-tracking system and may include total tracked players or tracked players playing a particular type or class of games. Still another performance variable might be the total number of games being played, regardless of whether each player is tracked, or the total number&#x2014;tracked and untracked&#x2014;of a particular type or class of games being played. Any performance goal that can be derived from data on the network can comprise a performance variable according to the present method.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">After monitoring has begun at <b>104</b> the AI program makes a determination concerning whether or not to change one of the operating parameters at <b>106</b>. The decision concerning whether to change&#x2014;and, if so, by how much&#x2014;may be based on several factors. First, different operating parameters require different lengths of time after implementation or changing to determine what, if any, effect the change makes. For example, initiating a round of double jackpots or random bonuses might have an almost immediate effect as those in the casino observe celebrations, by the gaming machines as well as by the players, resulting from an increase in bonus payments over and above the pay tables. Whether this effect tends to drive the system toward or away from the performance objective must then be considered. But it can be considered fairly quickly after the bonus is implemented or changed.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">On the other hand, some operating parameters require a longer time period to determine their affect on the performance goal. For example, advertising in print media might not even be published for several days or longer, and a single publication may not make an impact on the performance goal. As a result, the determination concerning whether to change an operating parameter at <b>106</b> will be delayed by different times for different parameters.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Some promotions may take longer to evaluate than others. Perhaps an initial response to a double jackpot offer is very strong but falls off after two weeks of use. A second promotion offering a payment on BAR BAR BLANK outcomes is then instituted in place of doubled jackpots, thus causing revenues to rise again. The system tracks long-term effectiveness. If response is building, the system may retain a promotion, or even amplify it, in the belief that player response will eventually rise enough to justify its costs. In the case of declining response, the system may substitute alternate promotions, as just described, and test different periods between alternations. The system may learn, for example, that rotating between five different promotions is effective. It may learn that promotion A is good for 10 days, promotion B is good for 7, etc. As the system learns, it remembers and uses that information as a starting point for the next promotional cycle. However, just as with direct marketing, the system regularly tests new ideas, or even ideas that had worked in the past, or even ideas that never worked, to see if the market's appetite has changed. Retaining a benchmark of performance and constantly testing new promotions and configurations is vital to finding the most effective combinations and configurations for current times. Also, promotions may only be offered to certain player segments or audiences. Some promotions might go to known loyal players, while others are available to known players, i.e., anyone in the player-tracking system and still others can include, or even be limited to, unknown players.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In addition to the variations in response times, at least some of the parameters will have defined limits beyond which the AI program cannot change them. This prevents a single parameter from being driven to an extreme that might tend to achieve the performance goal, but might be objectionable for one reason or another. When a performance variable is set at a limit, the AI program will continue adjusting other variables in a manner that tends to optimize at least one of the performance variables.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">If the AI program decides to make a change to the operating parameter at <b>106</b>, the parameter is changed at <b>108</b> by sending a network command from configuration server <b>94</b> and monitoring continues at <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Even if there is no change to the performance variable under consideration at <b>106</b>, monitoring continues at <b>104</b>. In addition, casino personnel may enter a manual change at <b>108</b> via workstation <b>96</b>. This enables the casino to control a performance variable for reasons that may, at least temporarily, supersede a longer term goal of achieving the performance objective. In addition, the casino has the opportunity at <b>108</b> to set at least some of the operating parameters beyond the limits contained in the AI program. As just mentioned, this allows the casino to achieve a shorter term objective, such as generating excitement on the floor by awarding extra bonuses, which might not necessarily align with the performance goal. What is more, setting a single operating parameter outside its limit may result in the AI program determining values for at least one other operating parameter that are helpful in achieving the performance variable and which may ultimately result in resetting the limits for the operating parameter in question.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Whether or not there is a manual change at <b>110</b>, monitoring ultimately continues at <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Because the system is constantly receiving information about revenues and expenses, it can calculate or modify the budget or a portion thereof based on current and projected operations.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Consideration will now be given to specific examples of changes made by the present embodiment of the method. The AI program may call for a very specific change in advertising, e.g., relying on, among other things, the information in the customer relationship database to increase a certain type of advertising in a certain zip code. This may result in an email initiated by the AI program to the casino advertising manager to that effect. The advertising manager can proceed to place the ad(s) in a conventional manner. Or the email may go direct to an ad agency or the entity that will carry the ad.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Some entities could have a set of pre-existing orders, such as &#x201c;place banner ad abc on website xyz for n days.&#x201d; Electronic notification via network <b>98</b> by the AI program could easily implement this or any number of similar orders from a library of possible orders. Using the budget stored in configuration server <b>94</b>, the AI program may determine where to advertise and at what rate.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Some advertising mediums, e.g., Google, allow bidding on ads, such as website banner ads. The system could set the maximum amount bid on a keyword, or set of keywords, and change the bid depending on conditions. The bid can be submitted electronically as described above or could be placed by casino management or its advertising agency in response to a prompt from the system.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Concerning game types and placement, the AI program can generate directions that could be used by casino employees to change out gaming machines, change the placement of gaming machines or implement any other proposed configuration change that cannot be effectively implemented by network <b>50</b> or elements connected to the network.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Emails may be automatically directed to those in the customer relationship database and to any other email addresses the casino might have access to. The email could be a simple as &#x201c;Come in to play tonight.&#x201d; Or it might contain a promotional code that when entered, e.g., via player interface panel <b>39</b>, entitle the player to free or reduced cost gaming credits. The code enables the system to track its costs and evaluate its effectiveness in achieving the performance goal. In this manner feedback loops among a plurality of variables are created. A parameter is changed and the AI program determines the effect of the change relative to a performance variable. After changing the AI program whether to maintain that change or make further modifications. The system therefore tends to optimize at least one performance variable of the casino.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Some embodiments of the invention have been described above, and in addition, some specific details are shown for purposes of illustrating the inventive principles.
