depositing polysilicon by supplying a source gas to a surface of a heated silicon core wire.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application claims the priority of Japanese Patent Application No. 2021-111400 filed on Jul. 5, 2021, the contents of which are entirely incorporated by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Polysilicon is a raw material of monosilicon for semiconductor or silicon for solar cell. As a method for manufacturing polysilicon, a Siemens method is known. The Siemens method is a method in which a silane source gas is generally brought into contact with a heated silicon core wire to deposit polysilicon on the surface of the silicon core wire using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the Siemens method, two silicon core wires in a vertical direction and one silicon in a horizontal direction are assembled in an inverted U-shape, and both end parts of the inverted U-shaped silicon core wire are connected to respective core wire holders and fixed to a pair of metal electrodes disposed on a bottom plate. In general, a plurality of sets of inverted U-shaped silicon core wires is disposed in the reaction furnace.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An inverted U-shaped silicon core wire is heated to a deposition temperature by energization, a mixed gas of, for example, trichlorosilane and hydrogen is brought into contact with the silicon core wire as a source gas, and silicon is vapor-grown to form a polysilicon rod having a desired diameter in an inverted U-shape.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the bottom plate used in the Siemens method, the silicon core wire electrode is generally inserted into the through hole of the bottom plate of the reaction furnace. Since a plurality of sets of silicon core wires is disposed as described above, there is a plurality of silicon core wire electrodes penetrating the bottom plate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Under such circumstances, various proposals have been made on the arrangement of electrodes.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent Document 1 (JP 2011-231005 A) proposes a positional relationship between a silicon core rod, a source gas supply port, and an exhaust port in order to provide a polysilicon reduction furnace in which polysilicon can be easily deposited so as not to have a surface shape defect or warpage.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Patent Document 2 (WO 2011/123998 A) proposes an arrangement capable of increasing thermal efficiency and uniformity of a gas flow to increase a production amount, improve surface quality, and reduce energy consumption.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also in Patent Document 3 (WO 2012/171149 A) and Patent Document 4 (WO 2013/093051 A) propose an arrangement in a reaction furnace for the purpose of productivity and uniformity in the reaction furnace.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Under such circumstances, Patent Document 5 (JP 2014-101256 A) proposes to make the arrangement variable in order to extend the life of the heater installed in the furnace.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problem to be Solved by Invention</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, the optimal arrangements proposed in Patent Documents 1 to 4 are different from each other. In addition, an increase in size of the reaction furnace is also progressing, and the cost for the reactor is very large. Nevertheless, it is necessary to determine the arrangement of the silicon core wire electrodes penetrating the bottom plate before installation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, in practice, the growth shape of the polysilicon cannot be known unless the polysilicon is grown in the installed reactor itself.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, an aspect as in Document 5 is also proposed, but even when the arrangement of the heater can be optimized by Document 5, the arrangement of the core wire cannot be readjusted because the polysilicon is deposited on the adapter or the like, and the adapter or the like itself is difficult to reuse and has to be discarded. Even when it can be reused, the deposited polysilicon may be peeled off from the adjustment member at the time of readjustment of the arrangement. The polysilicon deposited on the adapter or the like is in contact with the member, and the quality is deteriorated. The polysilicon falls into the furnace, and as a result, contamination in the furnace increases. In addition, since the deposited polysilicon is not suitable as polysilicon for semiconductors or solar cells, it has to be allocated to products with low quality requirements.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention has been made in view of such a problem, and an object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for manufacturing a polysilicon rod and a method for manufacturing a polysilicon rod capable of suppressing deposition of silicon on an adapter or the like, and moving the position of a core wire electrode without any trouble.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving Problem</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="2">[Concept 1]</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">An apparatus for manufacturing a polysilicon rod in the present invention may comprise:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">a core wire on which polysilicon is deposited;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">a core wire electrode provided to penetrate a bottom plate;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">an adjustment member provided between the silicon core wire and the core wire electrode, and movable with respect to the bottom plate; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">a cooling part capable of cooling the adjustment member.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">[Concept 2]</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the apparatus for manufacturing a polysilicon rod according to concept 1, the cooling part may have a nozzle that blows gas toward the adjustment member.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">[Concept 3]</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the apparatus for manufacturing a polysilicon rod according to concept 2, the gas may be a silane source gas.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">[Concept 4]</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the apparatus for manufacturing a polysilicon rod according to any one of concepts 1 to 3, the cooling part may have a heat dissipation insulating member provided between the bottom plate and the adjustment member and configured to cool the adjustment member via the bottom plate.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">[Concept 5]</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the apparatus for manufacturing a polysilicon rod according to any one of concepts 1 to 4, the cooling part may be provided in the core wire electrode and has a flow path through which a coolant flows.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">[Concept 6]</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the apparatus for manufacturing a polysilicon rod according to any one of concepts 1 to 5, the adjustment member may connect the core wire electrode and the silicon core wire so that a central axis of the core wire electrode is different from a central axis of the silicon core wire.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">[Concept 7]</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the apparatus for manufacturing a polysilicon rod according to any one of concepts 1 to 6, the adjustment member may be made of a material different from a material of the core wire electrode.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">[Concept 8]</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the apparatus for manufacturing a polysilicon rod according to any one of concepts 1 to 7, the adjustment member may have a resistivity lower than a resistivity of the core wire electrode.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">[Concept 10]</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A method for manufacturing a polysilicon rod using the apparatus for manufacturing a polysilicon rod according to any one of concepts 1 to 8, the method may comprise</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">a step of depositing the polysilicon on the core wire,</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">wherein the step of depositing the polysilicon may include cooling an adjustment member by the cooling part.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">By applying the present invention to an apparatus or a method for growing a polysilicon rod, the position of the silicon core wire electrode can be smoothly moved, and the arrangement can be optimized.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">By adopting the mechanism and the member for cooling the adjustment member as an aspect of the present invention, the adjustment member can be cooled at the time of manufacturing the polysilicon, so that the deposition of the polysilicon on the adjustment member can be prevented and the movement of the adjustment member is not hindered.

A silicon core wire electrode <b>60</b> is generally inserted into a through hole of the bottom plate <b>80</b> of the reaction furnace <b>100</b>. In general, since a plurality of sets of silicon core wires <b>1</b> is disposed, there is a plurality of silicon core wire electrodes <b>60</b> penetrating the bottom plate <b>80</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Therefore, the position of the through hole of the bottom plate <b>80</b> is required to be determined at the time of designing the reaction furnace <b>100</b>. However, in practice, the growth shape of the polysilicon cannot be known unless the polysilicon is grown in the installed reaction furnace <b>100</b> itself.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the reaction furnace <b>100</b> is added under exactly the same conditions, there is no big problem. However, in many cases, an improved reaction furnace <b>100</b> is designed for the purpose of improving the shape of popcorn, which is a type of productivity and surface shape, the shape of polysilicon during growth, and the like.

In the reaction conditions, the temperature, the supply gas concentration, the supply gas flow rate, the reaction pressure, and the like are often changed together. In this case, since the arrangement is changed and the reaction conditions are changed, in practice, the growth shape of the polysilicon including the popcorn shape is not known unless the polysilicon is grown in the installed reaction furnace <b>100</b> itself.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In addition, as shown in Patent Document 5, even when the arrangement of only the heater can be optimized, since the heater is used for initial heating and the heater stops energization while the polysilicon is growing, there is almost no deposition of the polysilicon on the heater. For this reason, Patent Document 5 may be used to adjust only the position of the heater before the polysilicon is deposited, but there may be a problem in moving the arrangement of the silicon core wire <b>1</b> after the polysilicon is deposited.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Therefore, care for preventing deposition of polysilicon on the moving member is required in a case where the arrangement of the silicon core wire <b>1</b> moves on the bottom plate <b>80</b> when the silicon core wire <b>1</b> is energized in a state where the reaction gas is supplied and the reaction temperature is reached, or at the time of cooling after completion of the reaction.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the present embodiment, it is possible to freely dispose the silicon core wire <b>1</b> above the bottom plate <b>80</b> without being affected by the position of the through hole of the silicon core wire electrode <b>60</b>. In this case, the adjustment can be made above the bottom plate <b>80</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As an example, the apparatus for manufacturing a polysilicon rod according to the present embodiment is an apparatus for manufacturing a polysilicon rod by the Siemens method. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the apparatus for manufacturing a polysilicon rod has a silicon core wire (core wire) <b>1</b> on which polysilicon is deposited, a silicon core wire electrode (core wire electrode) <b>60</b> provided to penetrate a bottom plate <b>80</b>, an adjustment member <b>10</b> provided between the silicon core wire <b>1</b> and the silicon core wire electrode <b>60</b> and including an adapter or the like movable with respect to the bottom plate <b>80</b>, and a cooling part (cooling mechanism) capable of cooling the adjustment member <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In order to relax the stress when the diameter of the polysilicon increases during the reaction or when the polysilicon rod is cooled at the end of the reaction, the adjustment member <b>10</b> naturally moves in the plane.

When the average diameter of the polysilicon in the reaction furnace was 150 mm, the amount of movement of the adjustment member <b>10</b> was 10 mm at the maximum.

As described above, both lower end parts of the silicon core wire <b>1</b> of the present embodiment are movable. There are various aspects of moving both lower end parts of the silicon core wire <b>1</b>, and for example, both lower end parts of the silicon core wire <b>1</b> may be moved by sliding in an in-plane direction (horizontal direction) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). In this case, for example, a recess <b>115</b> may be provided at the bottom face of the adjustment member <b>10</b>, and a protrusion <b>110</b> to be inserted into the recess <b>115</b> may be provided on the upper face of the core wire electrode <b>60</b>. Then, the adjustment member <b>10</b> may be movable along the protrusion <b>110</b>, and the position thereof may be fixed to a fixture <b>121</b> fixed to the bottom plate <b>80</b> by the fastening member <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the cooling part may have a gas supply unit <b>25</b> that supplies the stored gas or the generated gas, a nozzle (cooling nozzle) <b>20</b> that blows the gas toward the adjustment member <b>10</b>, and a gas supply pipe <b>26</b> that is provided between the gas supply unit <b>25</b> and the nozzle <b>20</b> and guides the gas supplied from the gas supply unit <b>25</b> to the nozzle <b>20</b>. The gas supplied from the gas supply unit <b>25</b> may be a silane source gas. In this case, the silane source gas may be, for example, a mixed gas of trichlorosilane and hydrogen. Since the movement distance of the adjustment member <b>10</b> due to the stress generation during the deposition reaction of the polysilicon and/or during the cooling of the polysilicon rod is about 10 nu, the adjustment member <b>10</b> can be sufficiently cooled even when the position of the nozzle <b>20</b> is fixed. However, the present invention is not limited to such an aspect, and the position of the nozzle <b>20</b> may be movable in the in-plane direction by sliding or the like. In addition, the supply amount of gas from the gas supply unit <b>25</b> and/or the direction of the nozzle <b>20</b> can be freely changed, and even when the adjustment member <b>10</b> moves due to stress generation during the deposition reaction of the polysilicon and/or during cooling of the polysilicon rod, sufficient cooling may be performed on the adjustment member <b>10</b> by adjusting the supply amount of gas and the direction of the nozzle <b>20</b>. The control of each member at this time may be performed in response to a command from a control unit <b>50</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the cooling part may include a heat dissipation insulating member <b>30</b> provided between the bottom plate <b>80</b> and the adjustment member <b>10</b> to cool the adjustment member <b>10</b> via the bottom plate <b>80</b>. A bottom plate coolant passage <b>70</b> through which a coolant such as cooling water passes may be provided inside the bottom plate <b>80</b>, and the bottom plate <b>80</b> may be cooled by the coolant passing through the bottom plate coolant passage <b>70</b>. By providing the heat dissipation insulating member <b>30</b> described above, the adjustment member <b>10</b> can be cooled by the cooled bottom plate <b>80</b>. Silicon rubber or the like blended with a thermally conductive filler may be used for the heat dissipation insulating member <b>30</b>. For example, an insulating composition obtained by blending 100 to 800 parts by weight of at least one metal oxide selected from beryllium oxide, aluminum oxide, hydrated aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, and zinc oxide into 100 parts by weight of synthetic rubber such as silicon rubber may be used. Furthermore, ceramics may be used. As another example of the heat dissipation insulating member <b>30</b>, for example, silicon nitride, silicon carbide, aluminum nitride, aluminum oxide, zirconia, or the like may be used. When the core wire electrode <b>60</b> is made of copper, the thermal conductivity is very high. When the cooling water flows in the core wire electrode <b>60</b>, the heat dissipation insulating member <b>30</b> can be cooled by the core wire electrode <b>60</b>, and as a result, the adjustment member <b>10</b> can be cooled.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The heat dissipation insulating member <b>30</b> may be fixed to the adjustment member <b>10</b> and not fixed to the bottom plate <b>80</b>.

As an example, when the adjustment member <b>10</b> moves by about 10 mm during the deposition reaction of the polysilicon and/or during the cooling of the polysilicon rod, even when the size of the heat dissipation insulating member <b>30</b> in the in-plane direction is not so large, the adjustment member <b>10</b> and the bottom plate <b>80</b> can be always brought into contact with each other via the heat dissipation insulating member <b>30</b> regardless of the position of the adjustment member <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the cooling part may have a liquid supply unit <b>40</b> that supplies a coolant such as cooling water, and an electrode coolant flow path <b>41</b> that is provided in the core wire electrode <b>60</b> and allows the coolant to flow.

That is, when the cooling part (cooling mechanism) is not provided, silicon crystals may deposit on the adjustment member <b>10</b> due to heat generation by energization or the like. When the silicon crystal is deposited on the adjustment member <b>10</b> in this manner, in a case where the position of the adjustment member <b>10</b> is adjusted and moved before the start of the growth of next polysilicon (new polysilicon), the crystal deposited during the movement falls into the furnace, resulting in contamination. In addition, when silicon crystals are deposited on the adjustment member <b>10</b> in this manner, there may be a problem that adjustment by the adjustment member <b>10</b> cannot be performed smoothly. In this respect, adopting the cooling part as described above is very advantageous in that heat generation due to energization in the adjustment member <b>10</b> can be removed, and occurrence of such a problem can be prevented in advance. According to the present aspect, it is also possible to prevent the resistance value of the adjustment member <b>10</b> from increasing due to heat generation.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In addition, since the adjustment member can be cooled at the time of manufacturing the polysilicon by adopting the cooling part (cooling mechanism) for cooling the adjustment member <b>10</b> in this manner, it is also possible to prevent the deposition of the polysilicon on the adjustment member <b>10</b> and prevent hindrance to the movement of the adjustment member <b>10</b>. As a result, the adjustment member <b>10</b> can be moved without any trouble, and the stress applied to the core wire electrode <b>60</b> by the growing polysilicon and the polysilicon in the cooling step in which the growth is completed can be relaxed. For this reason, it is possible to prevent cracking or collapse of the polysilicon during growth or post-manufacturing cooling.
