In order to know about the yield of oil wells, it is necessary to use relevant equipment to meter the yield of oil wells. In theory, flowmeters such as vortex flowmeters, ultrasonic flowmeters, and metal float flowmeters can be installed in the oil transport pipeline to measure the flow rate of crude oil, and then the yield of the oil wells can be obtained through conversion. However, in practical applications, flowing characteristics of the crude oil in the ground pipeline of oil wells are closely related to the way the liquid comes out of the oil wells. The working process of the oil extraction apparatus includes two strokes, i.e., an upward stroke and a downward stroke. During the upward stroke, the crude oil flows out to the ground pipeline through a sucker rod. During the downward stroke, there is basically no crude oil flowing out, so the liquid in the ground pipeline of the oil well will flow stream by stream. In addition, the unprocessed crude oil itself that has just been mined has a complex composition. It is a mixed liquid that integrates oil, gas, water, various other liquid components, and solid particles, which is viscous and has poor fluidity. The liquid will also entrain agglomerated oil mass. If devices such as the above-mentioned vortex flowmeter, ultrasonic flowmeter, turbine flowmeter, and metal float flowmeter are used to measure the flow rate in the ground pipeline of the oil well, first, due to the unique way of discharging liquid of the oil well, the metering error will be too large and the accuracy requirements cannot be met. In addition, due to the liquid properties of the crude oil, a measuring tube of the flowmeter will be easily blocked, which not only makes it impossible to measure, but also easily causes the pressure in the pipeline to rise and burst the pipeline, thereby leading to safety accidents such as oil leakage and pipeline burst. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a flow metering device that is safe, convenient to install, and meets the accuracy requirements. In addition, in order to obtain other parameters of the oil pipeline, such as pipeline pressure and water content of the crude oil in the pipeline, the current common practice is to drill holes in the oil transport pipeline to install these parameter detection devices. The installation positions are arbitrary, and the type of data obtained is single.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In view of the technical problem existing in the prior art, the present disclosure proposes a crude oil parameter detection device, which can safely meter the crude oil flow rate of a crude oil transport pipeline and meet the accuracy of metering the crude oil.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to solve the above technical problem, the present disclosure provides a crude oil parameter detection device, which includes a liquid cavity, a flow measurement cavity, a float assembly, a detection cavity, a connector, a position detection module, and a processing module; in which the liquid cavity is constituted by a first housing, and includes a first liquid inlet and a first liquid outlet; the flow measurement cavity is constituted by a second housing and is in-built in the liquid cavity, and includes a second liquid inlet and a second liquid outlet; the second liquid outlet is in communication with the first liquid outlet through a liquid outlet pipeline; the float assembly is in-built in the flow measurement cavity, and includes a float and a float connection rod integrally connected with the float; an end of the float connection rod is connected to a detection part; the detection cavity is composed of a third housing, and at least internally includes the position detection module; an upper part of the connector is fixed to the third housing constituting the detection cavity, and a lower part of the connector is connected to the first housing constituting the liquid cavity and the second housing constituting the flow measurement cavity respectively; the connector is provided with a through hole, and the end of the float connection rod can protrude out of the detection cavity via the through hole; the processing module is at least connected to the position detection module; when the detection part at the end of the float connection rod extends into the detection cavity, the position detection module detects a position of the detection part at the end of the float connection rod to obtain a float height detection signal; and the processing module calculates a flow rate of measured crude oil according to the float height detection signal.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Preferably, the crude oil parameter detection device further includes: a gas separation structure, which includes a gas separation baffle in-built in the liquid cavity and placed between the second housing and the first housing with a plurality of ventilation holes distributed thereon; a gas inlet provided on the first housing between the gas separation baffle and a lower surface of the connector; a gas outlet provided on the liquid outlet pipeline located outside the liquid cavity; and a gas pipeline, two ends of which are connected to the gas inlet and the gas outlet through interfaces respectively.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Preferably, the crude oil parameter detection device further includes a pressure sensor which is configured to be installed on the upper part of the connector; a pressure sensing part of the pressure sensor communicates into the liquid cavity through the connector, and a signal end of the pressure sensor is connected to the processing module; and the processing module calculates a current pipeline pressure according to a pressure sensing signal sent by the pressure sensor, or receives pressure value data sent by the pressure sensor.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Preferably, the crude oil parameter detection device further includes a water content detection device; a connection base of the water content detection device is installed in the first housing constituting the liquid cavity, a water content sensing end of the water content detection device is in-built in the liquid cavity, and a signal end of the water content detection device is connected to the processing module; the processing module calculates a current water content according to a water content sensing signal sent by the water content detection device, or receives water content data sent by the water content detection device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">During the flow of the measured crude oil from the liquid inlet to the liquid outlet of the measuring tube, the float in the present disclosure can overcome the resistance generated by the viscosity of the crude oil and, in accordance with the flowing pattern (i.e., the crude oil flows stream by stream), rises, stabilizes at a certain height, falls, rises again, stabilizes at a certain height, and falls again, etc. The float can also stabilize at different heights according to the magnitude of the flow rate when the crude oil flows continuously.

Apparently, the described embodiments are some of the embodiments of the present disclosure, not all of them. All the other embodiments obtained by those skilled in the art based on the embodiments of the present disclosure without creative efforts will fall within the scope of protection of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the following detailed description, reference may be made to various drawings which constitute a part of the present application and which serve to explain specific embodiments of the present application. In the drawings, similar reference signs denote substantially similar components in different figures. The individual specific embodiments of the present application will be described in sufficient detail below to enable those of ordinary knowledge and skills in the art to carry out the technical solutions of the present application. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized, or structural, logical or electrical changes may be made to the embodiments of the present application.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present disclosure provides a crude oil parameter detection device, in which a basic detection parameter is a flow rate of an oil transport pipeline connected. A rising height of a float in a measuring tube is determined by detecting a position of a detection part on a float connection rod, thereby calculating a flow rate of measured crude oil. Out of the existing flow metering devices, the float type flowmeter is a widely used device for metering the flow rate of gas and liquid. Metering elements of the float type flowmeter include a measuring tube and an indicator. An interior of the measuring tube is a cone-shaped measuring chamber that gradually expands from bottom to top, with a fluid inlet at a lower end and a fluid outlet at an upper end. A float, which is guided by a guide rod and can move up and down freely, is in-built in the cone-shaped measuring chamber. When the measured fluid flows through the cone-shaped measuring tube from bottom to top, a differential pressure is generated between upper and lower ends of the float to form a rising force. When the rising force acting on the float is greater than the weight of the float immersed in the fluid, the float will rise, and the area of the annular gap between the float and a wall of the measuring tube will increase accordingly; a flow velocity of the fluid at the annular gap decreases immediately, the differential pressure between the upper and lower ends of the float decreases, and the rising force acting on the float also decreases until the rising force equals to the weight of the float immersed in the fluid, at which time the float stabilizes at a certain height, and the area of the annular gap between the float and the wall of the measuring tube remains constant. The area of the annular gap is related to the rising height of the float, that is, a rising position of the float in the measuring tube represents the magnitude of the flow rate. There are usually two types of indicators. One type is to set scales on a tube body, and a value of the scale is determined according to a correspondence between the position and the flow rate. In this type of flowmeter, the flow rate value can be obtained by observing the scale position where the liquid is located. Another type of indicator is a pointer indicator. In this type of flowmeter, the float is in-built with a first steel magnet, the indicator is in-built with a second steel magnet coupled with the first steel magnet, and the second steel magnet is connected to a pointer through a transmission mechanism such as a connection rod. When the float moves up and down and rotates with the measured fluid, a magnetic field generated by the first magnetic steel in-built in the float changes with the movement and rotation of the float. Since the second steel magnet in the indicator is magnetically coupled with the first steel magnet, the second steel magnet rotates with the change of the magnetic field, and the second magnet drives the pointer of the indicator to rotate through the connection rod which serves as the transmission mechanism. After correction, the rising height of the float corresponds to the position of the pointer in a one-to-one correspondence, and the position of the pointer indicates the corresponding flow rate. However, after long-term use of the above-mentioned metal float type flowmeter, due to the limitations of processing and material conditions, the connection rod in the transmission mechanism will not be able to accurately transmit the position of the float due to the fatigue damage suffered, thus resulting in inaccurate measurement and deterioration of the reliability after long-term use. No transmission mechanism is used in the present disclosure, so the present disclosure is not subjected to the fatigue damage of the traditional float position detection assembly, and the accuracy during long-term use can be ensured. In addition, traditional floats have a relatively small weight and cannot adapt to such viscous fluids as crude oil which has a complex composition. In order to adapt to the special flowing state and fluid composition of the crude oil, the device provided by the present disclosure is significantly different from the traditional float type flowmeters in structure. Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be described in detail through specific embodiments as follows.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view of an external structure of a crude oil parameter detection device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded view of the crude oil parameter detection device according to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>4</b></figref> are partial sectional views of the crude oil parameter detection device according to this embodiment.

The first housing <b>1</b> is connected to a lower part of the lower flange <b>44</b>, and the second housing <b>2</b> is fixed to a lower part of the lower flange <b>44</b> through the installation base. Through holes are provided at the centers of the upper flange <b>43</b> and the lower flange <b>44</b> to allow the float connection rod <b>23</b> to pass through. The third housing <b>3</b> is connected to an upper part of the upper flange <b>43</b>, and a sensor sleeve serving as the position detection module <b>91</b> is fixed on the upper flange <b>43</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0054">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, when compared with the structure of the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the gas separation structure, the water content detection device and the pressure sensor are not provided in this embodiment. Therefore, the processing module in the gauge outfit in this embodiment only needs to calculate the flow rate data, and display or transmit the flow rate data to a remote end. Of course, according to application requirements, a water content detection device and a pressure sensor may be added to the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. In addition, regarding the gas separation structure, due to the different components of the crude oil produced by different oil wells, more gas will affect the accuracy of metering the flow rate, so gas separation is required before metering the flow rate. At this time, a device with a gas separation structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>11</b></figref> may be used, or other gas separation devices may also be separately provided in the transport pipeline. The structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is connected to the transport pipeline having a gas separation device added thereon. Since the gas separation has been performed when the liquid flows through the device, the device does not need to be provided with a gas separation structure. In addition, the petroleum produced from some oil wells does not contain much gas, and gas separation is not required in this case, so the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> can be connected to the transport pipeline to meter the flow rate.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0055">The position detection module in each of the foregoing embodiments is a Hall sensor array; of course, other sensors or position detection methods may also be used. For example, the present disclosure can also detect the rising position of the float through an image capture device or a photoelectric sensor arranged in the detection cavity when in cooperation with a dividing ruler.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, a bracket <b>126</b><i>a </i>is provided outside of the connection rod sleeve <b>125</b><i>a</i>, and a slideway <b>127</b><i>a </i>is provided in the bracket <b>126</b><i>a</i>. A moving block <b>129</b><i>a </i>is provided at a position corresponding to the magnet <b>123</b><i>a</i>, and the moving block <b>129</b><i>a </i>is connected to a dividing ruler <b>128</b><i>a</i>. In an embodiment, the moving block <b>129</b><i>a </i>is an iron block. When the float rises in the measuring tube, the magnet <b>123</b><i>a </i>at its end rises and attracts the moving block <b>129</b><i>a </i>to rise together, and the dividing ruler <b>128</b><i>a </i>connected to the moving block <b>129</b><i>a </i>rises at the same time. Corresponding to the end of the connection rod sleeve <b>125</b><i>a</i>, an image capture device <b>130</b><i>a</i>, such as a camera, is installed on the housing <b>41</b><i>a</i>. Scales of the dividing ruler <b>128</b><i>a </i>are marked from top to bottom; that is, when the float is at the bottom, the top position of the dividing ruler <b>128</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the image capture device <b>130</b><i>a </i>is a starting position 0, and starting from 0 and going downward, the position of the moving block <b>129</b><i>a </i>is the maximum scale. When the float rises, the magnet <b>123</b><i>a </i>at its end attracts the moving block <b>129</b><i>a </i>to drive the dividing ruler <b>128</b><i>a </i>to rise, and the image capture device <b>130</b><i>a </i>collects the current image of the dividing ruler, so that the rising height of the float can be obtained through the image recognition of the processing module.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>, in this embodiment, a dividing ruler <b>128</b><i>b </i>is fixed to a bracket <b>126</b><i>b</i>, and the starting position of the dividing ruler <b>128</b><i>b </i>is at the lowermost moving block <b>129</b><i>b</i>. Moreover, its scales are represented by the depth. A photoelectric sensor is provided on the moving block <b>129</b><i>b</i>. When the moving block <b>129</b><i>b </i>rises with the magnet <b>123</b><i>a </i>along a slideway <b>127</b><i>b</i>, light emitted from a light emitter of the photoelectric sensor is irradiated onto the dividing ruler <b>128</b><i>b</i>, and a light receiver receives the light reflected back from the dividing ruler <b>128</b><i>b</i>, so that the current scale of the dividing ruler <b>128</b><i>b </i>is determined according to the change in the light energy of the received light signal.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0058">In addition, other methods can also be used to realize the tracking movement of the moving blocks and magnets <b>123</b><i>a </i>and <b>123</b><i>b</i>. For example, Hall sensors and linear motors are provided on the moving blocks <b>129</b><i>a </i>and <b>129</b><i>b</i>. When the hall sensors sense the magnets <b>123</b><i>a </i>and <b>123</b><i>b</i>, the linear motors drive the dividing ruler <b>128</b><i>a </i>or the photoelectric sensor to follow the magnets <b>123</b><i>a </i>and <b>123</b><i>b </i>to move.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref>, in this embodiment, a sensor sleeve <b>40</b><i>c </i>is provided, which is sleeved outside a bracket <b>126</b><i>c</i>, a slideway <b>127</b><i>c </i>and a moving block <b>129</b><i>c</i>. In some other embodiments, there is no need to provide a dividing ruler, but a plurality of photoelectric sensors are provided on the sensor sleeve <b>40</b><i>c </i>to form a sensor array. The section of the sensor sleeve <b>40</b><i>c </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>. The sensor array is composed of a plurality of photoelectric sensors <b>212</b><i>c </i>vertically arranged on an inner surface of a side surface of the sensor sleeve <b>40</b><i>c</i>. Each photoelectric sensor <b>212</b><i>c </i>at a horizontal position includes a light emitting part <b>2121</b><i>c </i>and a light receiving part <b>2122</b><i>c</i>, both of which are fixed on the sensor sleeve <b>40</b><i>c</i>. A path <b>2123</b><i>c </i>formed by the light emitting part <b>2121</b><i>c </i>and the light receiving part <b>2122</b><i>c </i>intersects the up-and-down vertical movement path of the moving block <b>129</b><i>c</i>. The float connection rod moves telescopically in the second sensor sleeve <b>125</b><i>c</i>, and drives the moving block <b>129</b><i>c </i>in the sensor sleeve <b>40</b><i>c </i>to move on the slideway <b>127</b><i>c</i>. When it blocks the path <b>2123</b><i>c </i>formed by the light emitting part <b>2121</b><i>c </i>and the light receiving part <b>2122</b><i>c </i>of one photoelectric sensor, the photoelectric sensor sends a signal. The position of the float connection rod can be determined according to the position of the photoelectric sensor that sends the signal, so that the rising height of the float when it rises from the lowest point to the detection position can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0060">In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>, the sensor array on a sensor sleeve <b>40</b><i>d </i>is composed of light receiving parts <b>2122</b><i>d </i>of a plurality of photoelectric sensors, the light receiving parts <b>2122</b><i>d </i>are installed on an inner wall of the sensor sleeve <b>40</b><i>d</i>, and light emitting parts <b>2121</b><i>d </i>are installed on a moving block <b>129</b><i>d</i>. The light emitting parts <b>2121</b><i>d </i>always emit light. When the moving block <b>129</b><i>d </i>moves on a slideway <b>127</b><i>d</i>, the light emitted from the light emitting parts <b>2121</b><i>d </i>can be received by the light receiving parts <b>2122</b><i>d </i>at different heights, and electrical signals can be sent. The position of the float connection rod can be determined by the processing module according to the position of the photoelectric sensor that sends the electrical signal.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0061">The processing module stores the table of correspondence between the sensor position and the height, and the processing module queries the table of correspondence according to the sensor position to obtain the rising height of the float, so that the flow rate of the measured petroleum can be calculated. For the specific process, reference may be made to the embodiment in which the Hall sensors are used as the sensor array, for which a detailed description will be omitted herein.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0062">The above position detection module and the corresponding structure only reveal the relevant position detection means.

This device can measure the flow rate in the crude oil transport pipeline. Since the transmission device in the traditional float flowmeters is not required, the measurement accuracy will not be affected by the fatigue damage caused by the transmission device in the long-term use. Moreover, the present disclosure can be integrated with other parameter detection devices in view of actual application requirements, so that multiple types of data can be detected. The device has a strong and durable structure, can be applied to various field environments and work stably for a long time.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0064">The above embodiments are only for the purpose of illustrating the present disclosure, rather than limiting the present disclosure.
