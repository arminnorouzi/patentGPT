Such a conveyance device is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2019-062614, for example.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2019-062614 discloses a conveyance device including a platform car (slider) and a conveyor that conveys the platform car. The conveyor includes a linear motor and a plurality of guide rails over which the platform car is transferable. In the conveyance device described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2019-062614, the position of the guide rail over which the platform car is transferred is corrected based on information on the positions of the guide rails such that a connecting position between the guide rails is accurately determined.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the conveyance device described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2019-062614, when the bimetallic effect with a platform on which the platform car is installed occurs due to a change in the installation environment temperature, or the shape of a connecting portion of the guide rails changes due to a change over time, for example, it becomes difficult to accurately align the connecting position of the plurality of guide rails. In this case, there is a high possibility that an impact occurs on the platform car at the connecting position of the plurality of guide rails, and the platform car and the guide rails are damaged.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly the present disclosure provides a conveyance device capable of significantly reducing or preventing damage to a plurality of guide rails and a slider due to an impact on the slider at a connecting position of the guide rails.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A conveyance device according to an aspect of the present disclosure includes a slider, and a conveyor including a linear motor and a plurality of guide rails over which the slider is transferable. The conveyor is configured to convey the slider. The conveyance device further includes a controller configured or programmed to acquire, based on a vibration in a connecting portion between the plurality of guide rails or driving electric power of the linear motor in the connecting portion between the plurality of guide rails, a transfer state of the slider between the guide rails.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As described above, the conveyance device according to this aspect of the present disclosure includes the controller configured or programmed to acquire, based on the vibration or the driving electric power of the linear motor in the connecting portion between the plurality of guide rails, the transfer state of the slider between the guide rails. Accordingly, when the slider passes through the connecting portion between the guide rails, the transfer state of the slider between the guide rails can be understood based on the vibration or the driving electric power, and thus it is possible to predict in advance that an impact will occur on the slider in the connecting portion between the guide rails. Thus, generation of the vibration can be effectively reflected in the preventive maintenance of the guide rails and the slider. Consequently, it is possible to significantly reduce or prevent damage to the guide rails and the slider due to the impact on the slider at a connecting position of the guide rails.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the aforementioned conveyance device according to this aspect, the controller is preferably configured or programmed to perform a control to provide notification of the transfer state based on the transfer state of the slider between the guide rails. Accordingly, it is possible to provide notification before an abnormality occurs based on the transfer state of the slider between the guide rails, and thus before the guide rails and the slider are damaged, an operator can perform maintenance and inspection of the slider and the conveyor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the aforementioned conveyance device according to this aspect, the conveyor preferably includes fixed first and second conveyors, and a third conveyor including a movement mechanism configured to move the guide rails and the linear motor.

Accordingly, in the connecting portion between the guide rails of the third conveyor that moves with respect to the fixed first and second conveyors and the first or second conveyor, a change in the transfer state due to a change in the alignment accuracy can be acquired. Thus, it is possible to significantly reduce or prevent damage to the guide rails and the slider in the connecting portion between the guide rails that move relative to each other.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The aforementioned conveyance device including the conveyor including the first conveyor, the second conveyor, and the third conveyor preferably further includes a vibration sensor provided in a vicinity of the connecting portion of the guide rails between the third conveyor and the first or second conveyor, and the controller is preferably configured or programmed to acquire the transfer state of the slider between the guide rails based on a vibration detection result of the vibration sensor.

Accordingly, when the vibration or the driving electric power of the linear motor increases beyond the predetermined threshold, the operator can be prompted to perform maintenance and inspection of the slider and the conveyor.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the aforementioned conveyance device according to this aspect, the controller is preferably configured or programmed to provide notification of the transfer state of the slider between the guide rails when the vibration or the driving electric power of the linear motor in the connecting portion between the guide rails increases by a predetermined percentage from an initial state. Accordingly, when the vibration or the driving electric power of the linear motor increases by the predetermined percentage from the initial state, the operator can be prompted to perform maintenance and inspection of the slider and the conveyor.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the aforementioned conveyance device according to this aspect, the slider preferably includes a plurality of sliders, and the controller is preferably configured or programmed to distinguish each of the plurality of sliders and acquire the transfer state of the slider between the guide rails. Accordingly, it is possible to easily determine whether an increase in the vibration or the driving electric power of the linear motor is caused by the individual sliders or the connecting portion between or the guide rails.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the present disclosure, as described above, it is possible to significantly reduce or prevent damage to the guide rails and the slider due to the impact on the slider at the connecting position of the guide rails.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a plan view showing a conveyance device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram showing the overall configuration of the conveyance device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a sectional view showing a conveyor and a slider of the conveyance device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram showing an example of vibration detection of the conveyance device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a transfer state notification process performed by a controller of the conveyance device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">An embodiment embodying the present disclosure is hereinafter described on the basis of the drawings.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The configuration of a conveyance device <b>100</b> according to the embodiment of the present disclosure is now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref></p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Configuration of Conveyance Device</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The conveyance device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment conveys an object to be conveyed placed on a slider <b>30</b> along conveyors <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>.
