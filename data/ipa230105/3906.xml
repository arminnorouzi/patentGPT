id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A navigation processing system includes at least one processor configured to execute operational instructions that cause the at least one processor to perform operations that include generating navigation data. A data stream is generated based on the navigation data and a data channel spreading sequence. A pilot stream is generated based on a pilot channel spreading sequence. A navigation signal is generated based on applying a bandwidth-efficient modulation scheme to the data stream and the pilot stream. The navigation is signal is broadcast via a navigation signal transmitter for receipt by at least one client device.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img

satellite constellation system <b>100</b>. Satellite constellation system <b>100</b> can include a plurality of satellites <b>110</b>, which can be implemented via combination of devoted purpose-built satellites, purpose built payloads on a standard satellite bus, and/or hosted payloads or services part of another satellite network. These satellite bus and navigation components can make use of commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) components and be compatible with CubeSat and other standard bus architectures. In some embodiments, some or all of the plurality of satellites <b>110</b> of satellite constellation system <b>100</b> orbit in accordance with low earth orbit (LEO), and can be referred to as &#x201c;LEO satellites&#x201d;. Alternatively, some or all satellites of the first satellite constellation can orbit in accordance with medium earth orbit (MEO), and/or geostationary orbit (GEO). Satellite constellation system <b>100</b> is operable to provide secure precision location and time transfer services and/or monitoring atmospheric and environmental conditions.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Some or all of the satellites <b>110</b> can receive signals <b>132</b> from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites <b>130</b> of a GNSS constellation <b>120</b>. The signals <b>132</b> include for example, a ranging signal containing clock information and almanac and ephemeris information that can be used for precision positioning, navigation and timing. The GNSS constellation <b>120</b> can be implemented by utilizing one or more of the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite constellation, the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, the Galileo positioning system, the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System, any Radio Navigation Satellite Service (RNSS) system, and/or any other satellite constellation utilized for navigation services. In some embodiments, some or all of the plurality of GNSS satellites <b>130</b> of the GNSS constellation <b>120</b> can orbit in accordance with MEO, and/or some or all of the plurality of GNSS satellites <b>130</b> or otherwise can orbit in another outer orbit from the satellites <b>110</b> of the satellite constellation system <b>100</b>. In either case, when the satellites <b>110</b> are LEO satellites, the GNSS satellites can be referred to as &#x201c;non-LEO satellites&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Some or all of the satellites <b>110</b> can send signals to and/or receive signals from one or more backhaul satellites <b>150</b>. Backhaul satellite <b>150</b> can be implemented by utilizing a satellite in any orbit, such as (LEO), (MEO), and/or (GEO), provided satellite <b>150</b> is capable of transmitting and/or receiving data from satellite <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, a backhaul satellite constellation <b>140</b> can include a plurality of backhaul satellites <b>150</b> operable to bidirectionally communicate with satellites <b>110</b>. In various embodiments, one or more backhaul satellites include an atomic clock for transmitting a timing reference in communications to the satellites <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In various embodiments, the one or more backhaul satellites <b>150</b> can be selectively implemented via one or more of the satellites <b>110</b> that have been assigned this functionality, on a dedicated basis, when for example, the navigation functionality of a satellite <b>110</b> has degraded to the point where it is no longer useful to provide secure precision location and time transfer services and/or monitoring atmospheric and environmental conditions. Furthermore, one or more satellites <b>110</b> can be assigned the role of backhaul satellite based on its status such as its position in orbit, current utilization, battery capacity and/or other state or condition of the satellite <b>110</b> or otherwise, as will be discussed later, for example, in conjunction with the resource allocation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The satellite constellation system <b>100</b> can be operable to provide navigation services through a space-based broadcast of encrypted and/or unencrypted navigation messages, atmospheric and/or other signal(s) which can include timing data and overlaid data for satellite identification and precision positioning and navigation. This data can include, but is not limited to, (i) precision orbit and clock data of both the precision satellite system and of the GNSS constellation; (ii) atmospheric data, models and/or other atmospheric monitoring data used for determining a current weather state, for weather prediction, for control of the satellites <b>110</b> and/or for further orbit or clock data correction; (iii) cryptographic parameters including encryption key management; (iv) integrity information concerning the backhaul satellites <b>150</b>, satellite constellation system <b>100</b>, the GNSS satellites <b>130</b> and/or their constellations; and (v) general messages to pass information (such as state, conditions, health, and other command and control information) between satellites <b>110</b> and the ground and/or other types of data discussed herein. This data can be derived based on some combination of measurements from (i) terrestrial monitoring stations; and (ii) GNSS measurements taken by the satellite constellation system <b>100</b> in-situ. In case (ii), precision orbit data of the GNSS satellites can be uploaded to the satellite constellation system <b>100</b> via space-based backhaul communications, reducing the need for ground links, though ground links and intersatellite links can also be used. This enables autonomous orbital position and clock determination in orbit.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Alternatively or in addition, the satellite constellation system <b>100</b> can be operable to collect atmospheric data by means of radio occultation (RO) through some combination of GNSS and other signals of opportunity including some broadcast by satellites <b>110</b> of the satellite constellation system <b>100</b> themselves. Higher broadcast power than GNSS utilized by the satellite constellation system <b>100</b> allows for deeper penetration into the atmosphere that enable processing to yield higher fidelity ionospheric and tropospheric models both in terms of spatial and temporal updates. These high density models can serve multiple purposes such as (i) data for weather prediction models on the ground or in situ in the satellite <b>110</b>; and (ii) the construction of local, regional and/or global ionospheric and tropospheric corrections for use in precision navigation both by the satellite constellation system <b>100</b> and by standard GNSS. The raw or processed data can be transmitted back from the ground to the satellite constellation system <b>100</b> by some combination of ground stations or space-based backhaul communications.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The GNSS satellites <b>130</b> can provide signals to satellites <b>110</b> for GNSS Radio Occultation for use in atmospheric monitoring, mapping and other atmospheric data generation. These measurements can, in turn, be sent to the ground through a combination of communication links, as discussed in further detail in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Through this connection with the ground, precise orbits and clocks of the GNSS satellites <b>130</b> can be uploaded to the satellite constellation system <b>100</b>. This orbit and clock data can used along with measurements from GNSS, other correction data, sensors onboard, and/or other information to autonomously perform orbit and clock determination onboard satellite <b>110</b>. Atmospheric models can be generated indicating signal delays in the ionosphere and troposphere and/or indicating weather data including a current weather state, a predictive weather model or other atmospheric data, can be broadcast along with precision orbit and clock data for use in precision navigation on Earth, included in backhaul and/or inter-satellite communication and used by the satellites <b>110</b> to further enhance the determination of their orbital position. The atmospheric data can include corrections created on the ground as part of the data products produced as part of atmospheric monitoring. Alternatively or in addition, these atmospheric data and corrections can be created autonomously by one or more satellites in situ, where data is shared between satellites in the satellite constellation system <b>100</b>, and where, for example, edge computing on board one or more satellites <b>110</b> is used to create local, regional or global atmospheric and/or weather models.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">At least one client device <b>160</b> can include a receiver configured to receive the signals transmitted by at least one satellite <b>110</b>. The receiver can be configured to receive the signals directly from the satellites <b>110</b>, and/or can be configured to receive this information from ground stations, server systems, and/or via a wired and/or wireless network. The client device <b>160</b> can include at least one memory that stores operational instructions for execution by at least one processor of the client device <b>160</b>, enabling the client device <b>160</b> to process signals transmitted by the satellites <b>110</b> to extract the atmospheric models, precision orbit data, clock data, and/or other data from the signals. The client device <b>160</b> can be operable to process the signals and/or this data to compute its precise position (i.e. an &#x201c;enhanced position&#x201d; with greater accurate when compared with ordinary positioning provided by the GNSS system) and/or a precise time. This precise position and/or precise time can be further processed by client device <b>160</b> and/or can be otherwise utilized by the client device <b>160</b> for positioning, navigation and/or timing and/or otherwise to perform its functionality in conjunction with one or more of a range of applications discussed herein. A client device <b>160</b> can be operable to display, via a display device of the client device some or all of the atmospheric models, precision orbit data, and/or clock data received from the least one satellite <b>110</b> for review by a user of the client device <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Alternatively or in addition, this precise position and/or other data generated utilizing the signals received from satellites <b>110</b> can be transmitted, via a transmitter of the client device <b>160</b>, to a server system or other computing device, for example via network <b>250</b>. For example, this server system and/or other computing device can be associated with an entity responsible for tracking of client device <b>160</b> and/or responsible for monitoring secure performance of client device <b>160</b>. Thus, storing, processing, and/or display of this information received from one or multiple client devices <b>160</b> can be facilitated by the server system and/or another computing device, for example, via its own at least one processor and/or at least one memory.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Client devices <b>160</b> can include, can be implemented within, and/or can be otherwise utilized by devices on the ground, devices near the earth's surface, devices within the atmosphere, and/or other space-based systems. Client devices <b>160</b> can include, can be implemented within, and/or can be otherwise utilized by mobile devices, cellular devices, wearable devices, autonomous or highly automated vehicles or other vehicles such as cars, planes, helicopters, boats, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), fixed devices installed upon or within infrastructure, and/or other computing devices operable to receive and/or utilize the atmospheric models, precision orbit data, and/or clock data.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The LEO satellite <b>110</b> provides a reduced distance to earth, which, combined with the greater signal power compared with GNSS, provides client devices <b>160</b> with much stronger signals. The reduced orbital period of the LEO further provides faster signal convergence. The LEO satellite <b>110</b> includes many additional technological improvements and advantages including many functions, features and combinations thereof as described further herein.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates embodiments of the communication of various data via satellite constellation system <b>100</b>.

A message can be transmitted and/or received over a combination of links (e.g. from an inter-satellite link to the backhaul) and can change encryption state as it goes from one node in the communication chain to another. Encrypting the data transmitted by the satellite constellation system <b>100</b> allows more control over who can receive the necessary data for making radio occultation (RO) measurements and precision navigation, enabling the licensing of the usage of the data. In addition to encrypting the data itself, the spreading code of the navigation signal that is used for ranging can also be encrypted.

Radio occultation enables detailed monitoring of the Earth's atmosphere, which allows for more accurate weather forecasting. This is performed by characterizing elements of a transmitted signal as it passes through Earth's atmosphere. In particular, each satellite <b>110</b> can be operable to observe and/or generate RO data based on received signals transmitted by other satellites <b>110</b> and/or GNSS satellites <b>130</b>, such as navigation signals <b>240</b> and/or GNSS signals. This RO data includes measurements and/or other data that characterizes a portion of the atmosphere that the received signal traversed in its transmission from the other satellite. A satellite <b>110</b>'s generation of RO data based on received signals, and/or a satellite <b>110</b>'s transmission of this generated RO data, can be accomplished by utilizing radio occultation module <b>321</b>.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0154">RO can be performed using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals that are being transmitted from Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and subsequently monitored from satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). These GNSS signals provide RO information on the upper atmosphere, but due to their weak signal strength, these GNSS signals are unable to provide high quality measurements to the lower portions (altitudes) of the atmosphere. Furthermore, the GNSS signals come from a limited number of MEO satellites. This limitation on number and the relatively slow orbital period of these GNSS satellites <b>130</b> naturally constrains the rate of change of observation vectors and therefore the amount of atmosphere being observed. These factors limit both the spatial and temporal resolution of the atmosphere being monitored.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0155">Satellite constellation system <b>100</b> presents improvements to current atmospheric monitoring techniques. In contrast to existing GNSS-based RO methods, satellite constellation system <b>100</b> can handle the transmission and/or reception of navigation signals <b>240</b> in addition to traditional GNSS signals received from GNSS satellites <b>130</b>. The geometry of the line of sight vector, in this case a line of sight vector being a radio line of sight such that the receiving end can receive a transmission from the transmission end, between satellites <b>110</b> in a LEO orbit provides a unique geometry that gives rise to uncommon atmospheric cuts that are capable of providing a deeper understanding of the Earth's atmosphere, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. To further atmospheric modeling capabilities, navigation signal <b>240</b> is transmitted by satellites <b>110</b> in LEO, and can be delivered at higher power levels than those from MEO. This enables deeper penetration of the atmosphere down to the planetary boundary layer and/or to less than 5 km in altitude, even in heavy moisture conditions. This provides an unprecedented level of detailed information of all levels of the atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0156">Additionally, using LEO satellites for both transmission and reception in RO results in an unprecedented number of RO events due to the smaller LEO orbital period. This greatly increases the temporal and spatial resolution of atmospheric measurements, resulting in a higher fidelity model and in turn a better understanding of its dynamics. Furthermore, a LEO constellation with a high density of satellites, with groups spaced across different orbital planes will result in sections of the atmosphere between the orbital planes being observed with a very high frequency (e.g. 10 minutes between observations depending on the spacing in the orbital plane), providing near real time tomography of the atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0157">Furthermore, navigation signal <b>240</b> of satellite constellation system <b>100</b> can reside in one or more different frequency bands than GNSS signals used for RO today, enabling another dimension of atmospheric characterization than what is possible today.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0158">The data links (Backhaul uplink <b>220</b>, downlink <b>210</b>, inter-satellite link <b>230</b>, and/or navigation signal <b>240</b>) permit the RO data obtained by the satellites to be transmitted down to the ground quickly for optimal use. The RO data can include the raw RO measurements observed by each satellite <b>110</b> and/or can include post-processed data that can, for example, contain already computed temperature and/or humidity profiles of the atmosphere. For example, satellites <b>110</b> can be operable to compute temperature and/or humidity profiles of the atmosphere based on the observed RO measurements.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0159">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, three satellites A, B, and C, are located in a LEO orbit, and a single GNSS satellite <b>130</b> is located in a MEO orbit. The satellites A, B, and C are each distinct satellites <b>110</b> of the satellite constellation system <b>100</b>. The satellites A, B, and C and the single GNSS satellite <b>130</b> are depicted at two different time steps: t<sub>0 </sub>and t<sub>1</sub>.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0160">At the first time step, t<sub>0</sub>, all three satellites <b>110</b> can see, and/or can otherwise be operable to receive, each other's navigation signal <b>240</b>. Since each satellite <b>110</b> is capable of transmitting and/or receiving navigation signal <b>240</b>, each of the line of sight vectors, representing an ability to transmit and/or receive navigation signal <b>240</b>, are shown as two-way vectors. Due to the placement of the satellites <b>110</b> in orbit and the properties of navigation signal <b>240</b> such as the broadcast power, each of these lines of sight traverse through different layers of the Earth's atmosphere, including layers that are close to the Earth's surface. The signal from GNSS satellite <b>130</b> can also be used by satellites A and B at the first time step, t<sub>0</sub>, to get information through the uppermost part of the atmosphere. Note that while satellite C does have a line of sight to GNSS satellite <b>130</b>, that signal does not traverse any layers of the atmosphere of interest for monitoring and is unable to produce RO measurements, and is therefore omitted from the figure.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0161">At the second time step, t<sub>1</sub>, which is shortly after the first time step, all three of satellites <b>110</b> have moved in their orbit. For this example, the time between t<sub>0 </sub>and t<sub>1 </sub>is such that GNSS satellite <b>130</b> has effectively not changed location due to the much longer orbital period of a MEO satellite compared to a LEO satellite. At time step t<sub>1</sub>, once again all three of the satellites <b>110</b> are able to maintain their lines of sight, this time at slightly different locations in the atmosphere, providing new measurement data. Due to the placement of satellites <b>110</b> in their orbit in this example, only one of the satellites is able to use the signal from GNSS satellite <b>130</b> for RO purposes. The line of sight vector from GNSS satellite <b>130</b> and Satellite A no longer goes through the atmosphere to create observations and the line of sight vector from GNSS satellite <b>130</b> and Satellite C still does not go through the atmosphere. Note that while the line of sight vector from GNSS satellite <b>130</b> and Satellite B is maintained that measurement will be degraded due to how much atmosphere the signal must traverse. This exemplifies one of the drawbacks of RO systems today using existing GNSS signals unable to constantly provide information as there are some cases where the geometry is in such a way that does not allow high quality RO observations to be made.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0162">Building from this example, considering a typical orbital period for a LEO satellite of 90 minutes, every 90 minutes a LEO satellite will complete a full sweep of its trajectory around Earth's atmosphere. Furthermore, with a dense constellation of satellites spread across a given number of orbital planes, the time between one pair of satellites passing through a part of the atmosphere and the following pair passing through nearly the same region of the atmosphere can be very short (e.g. tens of minutes). Thus, the satellites <b>110</b> of the satellite constellation system <b>100</b> allow for an unprecedented temporal revisit of regions of the atmosphere that can be used to better predict weather and improve models. When performing RO with MEO GNSS signals, the geometry change is much slower since a MEO satellite's orbital period is approximately 12 hours. Furthermore, the LEO and MEO satellite orbits are not in sync, which does not guarantee the ability to repeatedly pass through the same parts of the atmosphere and therefore cannot provide the spatially correlated temporal data that can be provided by this satellite system.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0163">The raw RO measurements and/or processed data can be processed by one or more client devices <b>160</b> and/or other computing devices that receive the RO data from the satellites <b>110</b> and/or from ground station <b>200</b> and/or <b>201</b>, for example, via network <b>250</b>. The processing of this data can enable a range of applications, for example, by various other entities that benefit from improved characterizations and/or profiles of the atmospheric.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0164">One example application of utilizing the received raw RO measurements and/or processed data includes generating weather forecasting data.

This can include generating real-time and/or substantially close to real-time ionospheric mappings. This can include generating models that can be utilized to generate prediction data utilized predict and/or improve upon predictions of future states of the ionosphere.

With these two-way links, each of the satellites in the link pair is capable of making RO observations for the same portion of the atmosphere and is capable of logging the necessary data, for example by generating and/or otherwise observing the RO data based on the received navigation signal <b>240</b>, by temporarily storing the RO data in memory module <b>310</b> in a queue for transmission, and/or by transmitting the RO data via a backhaul link. Therefore, only one of the satellites need to be in view a ground station <b>200</b>, and/or the backhaul satellite <b>150</b>, or a backhaul node, such as one of the plurality of nodes of the satellite constellation system <b>100</b> in the transmission chain of backhaul links to the ground station <b>200</b> and/or the backhaul satellite <b>150</b>.

Having the orbit and clock determination onboard, enables the satellite to make use of additional sensors that help decouple the attitude from the orbit as well as the orbit from the clock. Decoupling the attitude is important as it enables the use of this orbit and clock determination system to be used on a variety of satellites including small satellites where only minimal attitude control may be available. For example, in a satellite configuration where the broadcast signals are nadir pointing and the received GNSS L1/L2/L5 signals are received from a zenith antenna, a non-trivial offset will be present between these antennas which must be accounted for in user precise positioning. Inertial sensors, which are essentially only affected by orbital effects and not clock effects, can be integrated into the orbit determination and propagation process and help separate orbit and clock errors, especially as GNSS geometry worsens in polar regions.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0226">The orbit determination can be aided by terrestrial stations, especially in polar regions, where not only would ground stations be typically visible to the greatest number of satellites, but the GNSS geometry is weakest on orbit. The ground stations can broadcast another ranging signal that can be received by satellites on orbit to aid in the orbit determination by providing more high accuracy range measurements. This allows for the measurements to very cleanly enter the estimator. This also allows for the ground station to be broadcast-only (one-to-many) rather than talking directly to a specific satellite, keeping orbit determination autonomous without need for direct communication to the ground station. The ground stations can also be capable of receiving the ranging signal broadcast by this satellite system, allowing the ground stations to either do some estimation on the ground and send the estimate back to the satellite or more simply send the measurements collected on the ground up to the satellites on orbit and let the satellite use the measurements in their onboard estimators. The latency between the collection of the measurement on the ground and the reception of that on orbit may introduce some complications in the estimation. Ground stations can also be equipped with a laser to point at a retroreflector on the satellite providing another accurate range measurement to the satellite. Once again, this measurement can then be used on the ground and estimates can be sent to the satellite, or the measurements can be directly sent to the satellites to be used in the onboard estimators.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0227">The precise orbit determination computed onboard the satellites can use Precise Point Positioning (PPP) correction data, which consists of precise orbit and clock estimates of GNSS satellites. PPP data can be transmitted from the ground to the satellites via any combination of the links depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0228">The navigation message creation is a second loop running onboard the satellite that can be set to its own rate independent of the precise orbit determination rate. The process flow for the navigation message creation is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>. This loop can be either triggered by timing for a fixed frequency of operation or by a trigger based on a computed error metric that is computed at the precise orbit determination rate. One manifestation is that the navigation message is generated by computing a best fit curve on the expected future state computed by running the filter's prediction step. Such a best fit curve has a set of parameters (e.g. that define the orbit and clock state) that can be put into a binary message to be sent as part of the navigation message.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0229">The broadcast flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> can be once again running at an independent rate, this time specified by the desired data rate for data to be transmitted on the ranging signal, handles the transmission of the navigation message, along with any other data messages that are desired. This transmission system reads a queue of messages and modulates the data contained in the messages onto the navigation signal (which in some embodiments has a ranging signal already modulated onto the carrier), which can be at various different frequencies. Note that in some cases only the ranging is modulated on the carrier to make the navigation signal.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0230">Once modulated, that signal is transmitted from the satellite <b>110</b> and can be received by at least one client device <b>160</b> which can include, but is not limited to, devices on the ground (such as handheld devices, vehicles, etc.), devices in the air (such as planes, drones, etc.), devices in space, and/or other embodiments of client device <b>160</b> discussed herein.

Many LEO satellites at lower altitudes feel forces due to atmospheric drag. While the upper atmosphere is very thin, it still provides an appreciable amount of force that eventually leads to the de-orbit of these satellites unless preventative measures are taken. While existing rough models can be used for the density of air in the upper atmosphere, it is known that this density is not temporally or spatially constant. Satellite constellation system <b>100</b> can be capable of taking precise GNSS measurements, as described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref>, and thus can have precisely known positions and velocities. Satellite <b>110</b> can also know its orientation (pose) precisely and can therefore calculate the expected forces due to solar and/or albedo radiation pressure, among other forces acting on the satellite. Once all other large orbital perturbations are taken into account, this information can be processed on board the satellite and/or on the ground and used to determine the magnitude of the atmospheric drag force acting on a given satellite <b>110</b>. Once this drag force is calculated, the density of the atmosphere at these specific satellite <b>110</b> positions can be calculated. With a dense constellation of satellite <b>110</b> and this data from each satellite <b>110</b>, models of the upper atmospheric density can be generated by either interpolating values spatially and/or temporally, or through other means. The resulting atmospheric density models can be used to help with on-orbit trajectory prediction for satellite <b>110</b> and/or any other satellite in similar orbits that are capable of receiving the atmospheric density model data. Additionally, these models can form the foundation for creating forecasts of upper atmosphere density.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0247">In various embodiments, certain users can be become nodes transmitting navigation signals to expand the network of satellite constellation system <b>100</b>, giving rise to substantially more navigation signals and an improved service.

Each additional receiver works as a node in a more substantial network of navigation signals, aiding both in collaborative positioning and in current GNSS-challenged environment.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0249">Employing similar estimation processes as satellites <b>110</b> from satellite constellation system <b>100</b>, user devices or other devoted ground or aerial navigation nodes can create and/or transmit their own navigation signals. This gives rise to substantially more signals for more robust positioning in traditionally challenging GNSS environments. In one embodiment, these navigation signals can be nearly identical to those transmitted by satellites as part of satellite constellation system <b>100</b>. In other implementations, different schema maybe be considered for specific applications or use cases. This may include the usage of different electromagnetic spectrum or other transmission modalities including but not limited to, optical and/or ultrasonic. This can also include a different number of transmission frequencies or signal modulations.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0250">As an example, consider a dense urban environment with several aerial and ground-based robotic systems in operation. Aerial systems flying above buildings can utilize the line of sight signals to a combination of GNSS satellite and satellite constellation system <b>100</b> satellite navigation signals for precise and secure positioning. With its position solution computed, this aerial platform can broadcast its own navigation message, in much the same way as the satellites in satellite constellation system <b>100</b>. This, along with aerial and other navigation nodes in the network, including potentially as stationary infrastructure, adds significant diversity in line of sight in urban canyons, substantially aiding ground vehicle navigation. For example, the top corners of certain tall buildings can be good candidates for infrastructure node locations, having a clear line of sight to the sky and the road below. To further aid in this problem, ground vehicles can broadcast their own navigation signals to improve collaborative localization at the street level where now relative range measurements help the multi-agent navigation system.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0251">In various embodiments, the satellite constellation system <b>100</b> can provide secure data to its users. Current GNSS signals that are available for civilian use are broadcast unencrypted with known signal and data structures. This was pivotal in the global adoption of GNSS as the standard bearer for positioning, but as the number of those that depend on GNSS services has grown, the vulnerabilities of GNSS have become more apparent. GNSS being at such low power is often jammed unintentionally and since its signal structure is publicly available it is subject to malicious spoofing attacks.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0252">The satellite constellation system <b>100</b> improves upon traditional GNSS services by performing full encryption of the spreading code along with the navigation data. In this case, there can be several channels that offer different data at different rates. This is accomplished using a combination of code shift keying along with encrypted data modulated at a lower rate. Where appropriate, the data is encoded using a Low Density Parity Check scheme that allows for forward error correction, enabling the satellites to deliver data to ground users at a high, robust data rate.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0253">The encryption keys can be locally stored in memory of client devices <b>160</b>, for example, in some manifestation of tamper-resistant hardware within the receiver utilized by some or all client devices <b>160</b> to receive navigation signals <b>240</b> from satellites <b>110</b>. Each client device's key can be leaf that belongs to a layered Merkle-Damgard tree, giving this satellite constellation system <b>100</b> the ability to provide service to any number of client devices <b>160</b> while denying service to anyone who breaks the terms of service. These keys can be changed collectively at predetermined intervals that allow for a subscription plan alongside permanent users. These changeovers can be carried out using secure one-way functions.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0254">There can be several acquisition methods for the encrypted signal. Any client devices <b>160</b> with preexisting knowledge of their location and time within reason can carry out direct acquisition of the signal using a parallel search strategy. All other client devices <b>160</b> can directly acquire these signals as the required computational resources are available to them. Once a single satellite from the constellation has been acquired, a coarse almanac is recovered that allows the user to find any other satellites that may also be in view along while anticipating the satellites that will soon be in view.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0255">With a single satellite in view, a client device <b>160</b> in a known location can have secure knowledge of their time. Likewise, any users that know 3 out of 4 position domain parameters (latitude, longitude, height, clock-bias) can securely determine the fourth with this satellite system. In a secure time example, a receiver is surveyed and has a known latitude, longitude, and height. In order to provide a secure timing service, the receiver need only acquire a single satellite signal. The pseudo range calculated from the user to the satellite can subtracted by the predicted range to the satellite knowing the surveyed receiver location. The clock bias can be calculated from this difference. Since the signals and data are encrypted, the user can trust that the signal came from a trusted satellite in this constellation and thus the clock bias calculation can be trusted. With four satellites in view, an unambiguously secure position and time solution can be solved for using these satellite signals.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0256">Application data corresponding to a secure service of the satellite constellation system <b>100</b> can be stored in at least one memory of the client device <b>160</b>.

When this application data, and/or other executable instructions stored in memory of the client device <b>160</b>, are executed by at least one processor of the client device <b>160</b>, this can cause the client device <b>160</b> to securely obtain and/or update their key, to utilize their key to securely determine their position and/or time based on encrypted signals received from satellites <b>110</b>, and/or to utilize their key to confirm authenticity of received signals as being transmitted by received from satellites <b>110</b> as opposed to a spoofing entity.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0257">In various embodiments, the satellite constellation system <b>100</b> can be operable to perform space-based GNSS Constellation Monitoring. A GNSS satellite fault can produce serious positioning errors if incorporated into a calculated position. In order for GNSS signals to be incorporated in safety-critical applications, such as aviation, their performance must be constantly monitored for such fault events. Many receivers used in these applications incorporate autonomous monitoring techniques such as Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) to detect and exclude signals that may be faulty, but autonomous integrity techniques for receivers using code-phase positioning have severe limitations in that they cannot easily observe some satellite faults. These techniques may be enough to ensure that the true position is within one-third of a mile from the calculated position, but in order to obtain tighter bounds, also known as protection levels, on true position, local or wide area monitoring techniques must be employed. Satellite monitoring can be accomplished through systems known as Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS). In existing systems, reference stations in a region of interest can use these measurements to estimate the different error sources that may be present. These error estimates are then passed to central processing facilities where they are then then broadcast to users via a satellite link from a geostationary satellite. These systems are able to detect satellite faults and broadcast alerts to users, for example, within 6 seconds of the beginning of such faults.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0258">Similar GNSS satellite fault monitoring can be carried out by satellite <b>110</b> in LEO when satellite <b>110</b> is using carrier phase precise positioning techniques, such as described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref>. Autonomous integrity monitoring techniques can be utilized to achieve precise protection levels, for example, by calculating position solutions using subsets of GNSS satellites running in parallel. For instance, if there are N satellites in view, there are N+1 position solutions calculated for the case that one GNSS satellite is excluded. These solutions are compared with each other in order to derive protection levels for the calculated position. If a single GNSS satellite is faulted, all N+1 solutions will begin to deviate from the true position except for the subset solution that has excluded that GNSS satellite. If the solutions become separated by an amount set by a threshold, then it can be determined that there is a fault in the GNSS signal emanating from the GNSS satellite. By computing these subsets and comparing the solutions to a given threshold, satellite <b>110</b> can know that a GNSS satellite was producing a faulty measurement if the solutions separated by more than the given threshold and can then transmit alert information for the faulted GNSS satellite.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0259">A single satellite <b>110</b> in LEO can use the above method to detect a faulty GNSS measurement. Satellite constellation system <b>100</b> can have multiple satellites <b>110</b> in view of the same faulted GNSS satellite. Because of this, there will be larger observability of such a GNSS satellite fault and this will allow all satellite <b>110</b> observing the faulted GNSS satellite to form a consensus and thus have higher confidence in a decision to alert users. This technique differs from existing services in that all current GNSS satellite health monitoring is carried out by terrestrial reference stations whereas this provides a satellite-based solution that carries out this task autonomously. Satellite constellation system <b>100</b> can also be capable of transmitting alerts via navigation messages or other alert data to users in the event that there is an observed GNSS satellite fault through any combination of links in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0260">Beyond GNSS faults, satellite constellation system <b>100</b> can also transmit parameters describing the performance of the GNSS satellites.

This presents an improvement to existing systems by facilitating this GNSS monitoring without any dependence on ground-based reference stations or ground based central processing facilities. Existing systems are further improved due to the better geometry, higher signal strength, and greater number of satellites more satellites in view as a result of utilizing the satellites <b>110</b> rather than ground-based facilities.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0262"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B, and <b>8</b>C</figref> illustrate the service levels available to ground and/or aerial users as a function of the number of satellites <b>110</b> in view from satellite constellation system <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> shows the scenario with one satellite <b>110</b> in view with a client device <b>160</b> corresponding to a mobile user such as a vehicle.
