The Insurance Information Institute reports total accidents in the U.S. for 2017 at 6,452,000 resulting in approximately 1,889,000 injuries, 34,247 deaths and $4,530,000 in property damage. The cost to respond by police, fire departments and cleanup crews to these accidents is substantial, as is the cost in terms of time and fuel consumed by drivers delayed by these accidents. Moreover, time is typically of the essence in such scenarios. Present methods of deploying drones or UAVs for specific operations, such as to observe traffic incidents or security breaches generally require drones to be physically transported to locations of interest, set up, and launched and controlled by operators with appropriate expertise. This process takes considerable time and effort and can result in missing the window of opportunity to successfully capture the incident or data of interest. Thus, there is a need for timely/efficient approach to the launch, operation and housing of monitoring drones.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention is a drone and drone docking port (DDP) preferably sized so as to be large enough to house (enclose) a drone or multiple drones but small enough to be mounted on a pole&#x2014;a fence pole, a street light pole, a roadway sign pole, a traffic light pole, a cell tower pole, a bridge pillar, etc.&#x2014;and having an openable and closable enclosure, a docking plate having integrated battery wired or wireless recharging pads, and a control module. The control module (CM) is adapted to preferably autonomously control all functions of the DDP including actuation of the enclosure and relay of video, audio, and flight control information between the CM and a central monitoring center and/or emergency personnel. The DDP is preferable positioned in close proximity to an intended monitoring site&#x2014;e.g. so as to facilitate the rapid launch of a drone to monitor and/or inspect an incident, to provide light on or act as a beacon at the intended site, to act as a traffic signal to control and direct traffic around an incident in a safe, efficient manner, to relay information about the monitored site to a central monitoring center and/or emergency personnel, to emit audible sounds at the site (e.g. warnings or instructions), and for the rapid recovery and docking of the same. When the DDP enclosure is in an open position, a drone or drones may initiate flight from the DDP and when a drone or drones flight is completed and a drone or drones has re-docked therein, the enclosure may be closed so as to protect the drone or drones docked therein from external weather. The DDP may further include EO/IR (Electro-Optical/Infra-Red) cameras and sensors so as to detect disruptive or other predetermined behavior.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">More specifically, various embodiments of the DDP and drone are contemplated. In a first embodiment, the DDP includes an enclosure that is openable and closeable by means of a motor mechanism, a docking plate, drone battery recharging pads and/or wireless recharging pad, a control module (CM), and a battery pack. Optional DDP equipment may include solar panels, an air conditioning unit and an anemometer and related weather station equipment. In an inactive state, the DDP enclosure remains in the closed position and preferably fully contains a drone or drones. In response to receipt of a signal from remote sensors, central monitoring center, and/or emergency personnel, or local&#x2014;e.g. located on the DDP and/or in the nearby vicinity of the DDP and a potential incident&#x2014;the DDP activates, thereby opening to expose the drone and allows for drone take-off and manual or autonomous flight directly to and hover above the incident (preferably with FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) authorization).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The DDP preferably includes an enclosure which takes the form of a cylindrical container with two cylindrical halves and an opening/closing mechanism, containing a drone or multiple drones in a stack. The DDP enclosure contains all devices and equipment necessary for manual or autonomous drone deployment and drone battery recharging, and to protect the drone from the outside environment while stored (in the inactive state). Furthermore, the DDP enclosure is preferably attached to an inverted support cone which is attached to the top of a pole where it may remain for the service life of the DDP.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Preferably the DDP enclosure comprises a cylindrical container (CC) with two cylindrical halves and an opening/closing mechanism comprising two support/actuator rods securely affixed to the DDP base plate with rod hinges of one support/actuator rod attached to one of the cylindrical halves, and the other support/actuator rod hinges to the other cylindrical half. The support/actuator rods provide sufficient support in high wind conditions and are attached to the cylindrical halves and an opening/closing motor with gears to open and close each cylindrical half in a rapid, synchronized motion. The opening/closing motor is firmly affixed to the DDP base plate underside. In the inactive state, the edges on one cylindrical half have a mating edge with weather stripping, so that when the two cylindrical halves close, the edges come together and mate, also mating with the DDP base plate, to compress the weather strips to form a weather tight seal from the outside environment, and enclose the drone or multiple drones in a stack. In the active state, the opening/closing motor is activated, the support/actuator rods are turned, opening the two cylindrical halves, exposing the drone or multiple drones in a stack to the outside environment and once the enclosure or cylindrical halves are fully open, the drone or multiple drones can manually or automatically be deployed to a target monitoring site.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The DDP preferably includes a docking plate that comprises of a metal, plastic or fiberglass plate that is formed to fit the drone bottom surface profile in such a manner as to allow the landing drone to easily land and slide into place upon initial contact with the docking plate. The docking plate preferably includes drone recharging pads or a wireless recharging pad adapted such that when a drone is in the docked or nested position, the recharging pads will make contact with recharging contacts located on the drone or the wireless recharging pad will be in close proximity to the drone's wireless recharging pad. Preferably the drone bottom surface profile and top surface profile are similar, flat surface with curved surface edges, such that a second landing drone bottom surface profile will mate with the first docked drone top surface profile in such a manner as to allow the landing drone to easily land and slide into place upon initial contact with the previously docked drone. Preferably recharging pads located around the drone periphery top and bottom curved surfaces allow wired charging from the docking plate to a first docked drone, then to a second docked drone, then a third, and forth, and so on, to the top docked drone. Preferably the DDP includes wireless charging from the docking plate and cylindrical halves.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The DDP preferably includes a control module (CM) that controls all aspects of the DDP including enclosure opening and closing, drone battery recharging and communications with other traffic sensor systems, central monitoring stations, first responder personnel and the relay communications to the drone in flight and/or with other drones in flight in the near vicinity. The CM may relay video signals to a central monitoring center and may provide for video recording at or in close proximity to the CM. The CM may also relay flight or camera control signals and audio commands from a central monitoring center to a drone in flight enabling central monitoring center personnel to override autonomous drone flight control should they desire. For example, the CM may receive a traffic alert from a Traffic Flow Sensor System (TFSS) of a nearby traffic accident. The TFSS is a separate device and consists of Electro-Optical/Infra-Red (EO/IR) video, stereo pair video, lidar and/or radar sensors and any combination thereof and detects and monitors traffic flow and abnormal traffic flow to include traffic incidences. Upon the TFSS issuing a traffic alert or accident indication and preferably upon approval by a central monitoring center and the FAA, the CM initiates a signal to the DDP to open the enclosure and to initiate (preferably autonomous) flight of a drone housed therein so as to enable flight and hovering of the drone over the accident, to take photographs and videos of the scene, to assist in accident scene forensics, to act as a traffic signal control with red, yellow and green signal lights so as to direct traffic around an incident in a safe, efficient manner, and to assist police in clearing the scene more rapidly so as to resume normal traffic flow. Central monitoring center personnel are provided the ability to override the (preferably autonomous) drone on demand so as to aid in the resolution and clearing of a traffic incidence. Designated emergency personnel with first-hand knowledge of the incident may also have the ability to override the (preferably autonomous) drone on demand so as to aid in the resolution and clearing of traffic incidence through their portable communications devices or cell phone apps at the incident scene. Communication with the DDP and drone may be made through the use of Bluetooth communication, LoRa Communication, internet communication, cell phone network communication (4G/5G), independent intranet network communication, RF communication, wired communication, and optic fiber communication. Data, video, audio and remote control commands are preferably communicated or streamed in real time with very low latency in both directions&#x2014;to and from the deployed drone, DDP and central monitoring center. In the event of a malfunction, a malfunction signal or code is sent to the central traffic control monitoring center for resolution.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The DDP preferably includes a Battery Pack installed in the DDP enclosure base or within a support pole upon which the DDP is mounted, providing backup electrical power to all components on the DDP, preferably for a period of 36 hours, in the event of an electrical power disruption and/or solar panel malfunction or cloud coverage. The CM monitors electrical power, solar panels and battery pack status and in the event of electrical power disruption, preferably immediately switches power from the main source to the battery pack and resumes normal operations preferably for a period up to 36 hours and will operate on battery power during at least one enclosure opening and closing and preferably during continuous drone battery recharging for at least 2 hours. In the event of a malfunction, the CM will forward a malfunctioning code to the central monitoring center for resolution and the battery pack would be recharged from local grid electric power or from solar panels in order to resume normal operations.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The DDP preferably includes a microphone and is enabled to detect useful information (e.g. traffic horns, wheel sketching, vehicle collisions, etc.) and relay such information to a central traffic control monitoring center for resolution.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, if the DDP malfunctions, the CM switches the DDP to work in the inactive mode, and transmits a malfunction code to a central monitoring center for resolution.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The DDP preferably further includes a support structure such as a pole upon which the DDP is mounted. The electrical power wiring and any other wiring from sensors, battery pack or the like are preferably enclosed within the support pole.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the DDP and autonomous drone are in an inactive mode more than they are in an active mode. In the event of a (preferably nearby) incident or accident as detected by local or remote sensors, the (preferably autonomous) drone will be deployed. Once deployed, the drone will preferably immediately fly to the incident, hover over the incident, take photographs and video of the incident and surrounding scene, audibly communicate with accident victims or emergency personnel, communicate with central traffic control monitoring center operators and/or designated emergency personnel at the scene, and may perform other tasks while at or near the scene, prior to returning the DDP. Tasks, as embodied in various modes, that may be performed by the DDP in cooperation with a drone or stack of drones housed therein include the following:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Mode 1&#x2014;As a closest drone to an incident, preferably autonomously fly the drone to the accident scene, take video and audio of injured, attempt to help and comfort injured through an audio transmission, transmit video and audio to a central monitoring and control station operator to enable the operator's viewing of the video and listening to the audio so as to asses injury and damage severity. Help direct personnel and resources once on the scene, and video record injury and vehicle damage.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Mode 2&#x2014;Once mode 1 is complete, mode 2 may be started or the second drone in a stack of drones may be deployed simultaneously to commence mode 2. In mode 2, fly a drone at an appropriate height to capture video of the overall incident scene to include skid marks, etc. so as to help determine the accident cause.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Mode 3&#x2014;Once modes 1 and 2 are complete, mode 3 may be started or the third drone in a stack of drones may be deployed simultaneously to commence mode 3. In mode 3, hover the drone high enough over the scene to not interfere with personnel and in a position to provide overhead lighting during operations at night.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Mode 4&#x2014;Once modes 1, 2 and 3 are complete, mode 4 may be started or the fourth drone in a stack of drones may be deployed simultaneously to commence mode 4. In mode 4, fly a drone high so as to function as a beacon for police, emergency personnel and vehicle drivers and passengers, so as to provide an indication of accident location and potential traffic delays.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Mode 5&#x2014;In mode 5, upon drone low battery indication, fly a drone back to the DDP and preferably autonomously land and recharge the drone batteries.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Mode 6&#x2014;Enable the support of drones from the stack of drones within the DDP, nearby DDPs and/or drones from emergency vehicles to provide function as an emergency traffic signal and to enable the stopping of traffic and guiding of traffic around an incident. To accomplish this function, drone swarms comprising two or more drones may coordinate traffic signaling. For example, a freeway incident covering several lanes of traffic may require 4 to 6 drones positioned over each lane and high enough above and at a distance for vehicles traveling toward the incident to be directed by signal lights on the drone so as to provide an indication to the traffic to stop, proceed with caution and proceed in specific lanes so as to allow alternate lanes of travel and consistent travel times for all vehicles to skirt the incident. The disclosed drones include cameras having solid state memory recording cards or modules which can be reviewed at a later date so as to possibly determine drone traffic signal violations or accident fault.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Mode 7&#x2014;Enable the support of drones from DDPs that are in close proximity to incidents or drones that are carried and deployed from police vehicles and/or emergency vehicles so as to observe &#x201c;rubber neck&#x201d; drivers at an incident scene. Such drones would be positioned in a stationary (hovering) position high enough so as not to interfere with personnel or clean up procedures and yet in close enough proximity to the incident to observe &#x201c;rubber neck&#x201d; drivers with the objective of reducing the time drivers look at the incident and to increasing the attention paid to driving efficiently and safely around the incident so as to possibly significantly reduce vehicle wait times around an accident site. Enable video recordings to be reviewed at a later date so as to possibly determine &#x201c;Rubber Necking&#x201d; violations.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Mode 8&#x2014;Enable the support of drones from the DDPs stack of drones or from other DDPs or from Police, Fire or Emergency vehicles to function as a signal light control at an intersection so as to assist or replace police controlling traffic flow from the center of an intersection, particularly at the end of events such as sporting events, concerts, etc.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Mode 9&#x2014;Enable the support of drones from the DDPs stack of drones or DDPs in close proximity to an accident or police vehicles and/or emergency vehicles to be controlled autonomously, semi-autonomously or manually by control monitoring station personnel or more preferably by police at the scene. Enable the support of drones to target, track and follow a specific vehicle or person, preferably at sufficient height so as to act as a beacon and so as to provide ground personnel an indication of the tracked vehicle or person location. Enable the support of audio communications such as for police commands.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The DDP preferably includes optional solar panels in case electrical power through the grid is not available. Such solar panels are adapted to capture the Sun's rays so as to provide electrical power for all devices mounted within the DDP including the CM, the DDP enclosure opening/closing Motor, the DDP battery and drone battery, thus creating a completely self-sufficient system.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The DDP preferably includes an optional air conditioning and heating unit that maintains a stable temperature and humidity environment within the DDP when the enclosure is in the closed position. In such case a cooling coil is affixed to the outside of the DDP or on the DDP support pole. As temperature outside the DDP and solar load increases, the air conditioning system is activated and reduces the DDP inner temperature and humidity. As the temperature outside the DDP decreases, the heater is activated and increases the temperature inside the DDP. By such heating and cooling, the DDP interior temperature and humidity are stabilized within an acceptable range so that the batteries within the DDP and drones can be maintained at an optimum temperature to maximize battery performance.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The DDP enclosure may preferably be adjusted by slightly opening the enclosure so that the internal space of the DDP comes into temperature equilibrium with the DDP external space temperature. Under certain conditions, as the temperature outside the DDP and solar load increases, slightly opening the enclosure such that there is a small opening toward the side of the DDP results in a sufficient reduction in temperature so as not to need to use the air conditioning system and to minimize internal moisture from precipitation. The ability to open the enclosure in this fashion is an advantage of the enclosure type.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The DDP preferably includes an optional weather station, environmental sensors and anemometer so as to detect weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, rain, snow, ice, fog, dust and high winds. Upon detection of a weather condition that would be hazardous to drone flight, particularly a high wind condition, the CM prevents opening of the enclosure and deployment of the drones, and sends an adverse weather signal or code to the central monitoring center for further resolution.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a first alternate embodiment, the DDP docking plate typically comprises a square or rectangular and flat plate with downward curved surface edges from approximately 1 inch from the surface edge, recharging pads and a target painted thereon. So that upon drone landing or docking the first drone in a stack of drones to land is able to distinguish the target with the on-board cameras and autonomously land the drone on the docking plate in the proper drone docking orientation. Upon landing, the drone has a similar bottom surface profile as the docking plate's top surface profile and once docked will be secured on the docking plate from external events such as high winds, etc. due to the curved edges. The recharging pads on the drone will make contact with the recharging pads on the docking plate allowing the drone's batteries to be recharged. Furthermore the remaining drones in the stack of drones will return to the DDP based on a GPS location and hover above the DDP, observe an orientation of the first landed drone with the drone's on-board camera and proceed to land or dock. Upon landing, the next drone to dock has a similar bottom surface profile as the docked drone's top surface profile and once docked will be secured on the docking plate or docked drone from external events such as high winds, etc. due to the curved edges, and the recharging pads on the drone will make contact with the recharging pads on the docked drone allowing the drone's batteries to be recharged. This process continues until all drones in the stack of drones returns, lands and securely docked within the DDP enclosure. In the event of a drone landing that fails to make contact with the recharging pads, the drone takes off, hovers, reorients, lands, securely docks and begins to recharge batteries. A base plate is located below the docking plate having docking plate support rods to firmly support the docking plate. The DDP control module (CM) and DDP battery pack are mounted on the base plate and underneath the docking plate. The CM controls all aspects of DDP to include opening and closing of the enclosure, recharging the DDP and drone batteries, and communicating with on-board and off-board sensors, central monitoring center and emergency personnel. In an inactive mode, the DDP contains the stack of drones within the enclosure in the Closed position and enclosing the drones from the outside environment, while preferably continuously monitoring and charging the drone batteries. In an active mode, the enclosure opens exposing the stack of drones, the highest or top drone's motors start to allow drone takeoff. Then the next highest drone in the stack motors start to allow drone takeoff, and this process continues until all drones in the stack of drones takeoff. Upon drone return, the drone preferably autonomously positions itself above the DDP for landing, verifies proper orientation with distinguishing marks painted on the docking plate, then descends to the docking plate, lands and recharges its batteries. The second drone to arrive at the DDP for landing, verifies proper orientation with respect to the first docked drone, then descends, lands on the first docked drone and recharges its batteries The process continues until all drones in the stack of drones have landed. Once secure, the enclosure closes to cover the stack of drones and enclose them from the outside environment and reverts to the inactive mode where the drones are docked until the next drone activation after drone's batteries are recharged.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a fourth alternate embodiment, two cameras located on the bottom of a drone and pointing downward are employed for precision landing maneuvers. One of the docking cameras is designated as the prime camera and other docking cameras are designated as secondary docking camera. The docking camera video is processed through a docking processor module located within the CM which comprises a combination processor defining a video processing unit and neural network having recognition and flight control capability. Upon landing, the drone returns to and hovers above the DDP location, the prime docking camera initially recognizes the orientation symbol on the docking plate, provides flight control signals to the drone for proper orientation, and the secondary docking camera is implemented in a stereo camera mode to provide precise distance and drone location above the docking plate or other landed drones. The processed video provides flight control and guidance necessary for precision landing and docking maneuvers and land on the docking plate and recharging pads and to shut of the drone propellers so as to complete the landing or docking. The docking cameras can further be employed to provide mission video from directly below the drone, as the docking cameras are fixed position cameras and will only provide video from a straight downward perspective.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a fifth alternate embodiment, a drone has affixed to each exterior side of the drone are multicolor LED lights or LED panel module (LPM) displaying a high illumination&#x2014;green, yellow, red, blue and/or white lights which are suitable for traffic signals, a blue light as a beacon, and a white light to assist emergency personnel with overhead illumination. When two opposing LPMs display a green or yellow signal light to a first direction of traffic, two 90 degree adjacent LPMs display a red signal light for a second direction of traffic. The signal lights are controlled by an LED light control processor (LCP) within the LPM and the LCP communicates with the drone which in turn communicates with the DDP, and DDP communicates with the central monitoring center and/or emergency personnel located at the scene via remote control units, so that emergency personnel or police can control the traffic signal lights and traffic flow around an incident or accident.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a sixth alternate embodiment, the LPM also contains cameras on each side of the LPM providing a stereo view and to provide distance and location of vehicles in the flow of traffic and enabling observers to view a direction of traffic and assist in the control of traffic flow around an incident. The camera video communicates with and is processed through the LCP video processing unit within the LPM.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a seventh alternate embodiment, the drone includes high illumination white LED lights on the bottom of the drone so as to assist emergency personnel by providing overhead illumination.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an eighth alternate embodiment, multiple drones from the DDP, multiple DDP's or from emergency vehicles coordinate to work synchronously or as a swarm of drones at the scene of an incident to control traffic flow and aid in traffic incident forensics and to replace other drones when other drones are required to recharge their batteries.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a ninth alternate embodiment, the FAA is advised prior to drone flight through a third-party application (app) to a Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) for flight and airspace approval, specifically for flights in Class B, C, D and some Class E airspace around airports. LAANC is powered by a small group of third party dedicated application providers that act as the medium between flight planning and approvals from the appropriate Air Traffic Control. The DDP initially advises the central monitoring center and/or submits a cell phone app for LAANC approval, often within seconds to minutes, and once approved the DDP begins drone deployment procedures. If the point of deployment is within Class G airspace, no LAANC approval is required.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a tenth alternate embodiment, the DDP contains a multitude of drones or a stack of drones wherein each drone contains recharging pads to allow electrical current to be passed from one drone to another drone and up the stack so that all drone batteries will be recharged either in a serial or parallel fashion, or wirelessly recharged. Each drone may be deployed and operate independently, deployed in rapid succession and operate independently, and/or deployed in rapid succession and operate synchronously or as a swarm of drones.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In order that the advantages of the invention will be readily understood, a more particular description of the invention briefly described above will be rendered by reference to specific embodiments that are illustrated in the appended drawings.

INTEL has a several vision processing unit chips, including one that features a neural compute engine with <b>16</b> core processors each providing the ability to perform separate pipeline algorithms, sensor fusion and/or convolution neural networks all in a low power chip suitable for battery operation. The neural compute engine portion adds hardware accelerators designed to dramatically increase performance of deep neural networks without including the low power characteristics of the chip. Known software and algorithms will be applied to this chip or others to detect, recognize and analyze vehicles, vehicular incidence and/or accidents, vehicles in a traffic lane, as well as drone <b>600</b> position and orientation to provide flight controls to precisely dock a drone <b>600</b>. INTEL and GENERAL VISION both have low power chips that perform RBF (Radial Basis Function) neural networks in real time and can be considered fast learning (as opposed to deep learning) processors. GENERAL VISIONS's chips have 576 neurons with low power characteristics in a very small package, where each neuron consists of a processor and memory. Neurons can be configured in parallel or hierarchical and suitable for fast or real time learning and provides real time image or signal detection, classification and recognition. These processors (chips) are taught and not necessarily programmed, so programming is simplified and known by technologists in that field. Furthermore, GENERAL VISTON's NEUROMEM Technology can be implemented in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chips and has been previously implemented on INTEL chips and vision sensor die from OMNIVISTON as a single chip camera solution.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Sensor data that is processed on neural network architectures, designed specifically around the Radial Basis Function (RBF) or K Nearest Neighbor modes of operation, can be considered an expert system, which recognizes and classifies objects or situations and makes instantaneous decisions, based on accumulated knowledge. It accumulates its knowledge &#x2018;by example&#x2019; from data samples and corresponding categories. Its generalization capability allows it to react correctly to objects or situations that were not part of the learning examples. The learning capability of an RBF neural network model is not limited in time, as opposed to some other models. It is capable of additional learning while performing classification tasks. The RBF mode of operation allows for instant &#x201c;learning on the fly&#x201d;. As an example, tracking a vehicle, an operator can select an object to be tracked by placing a region of interest (ROI) around the object and selecting this region with a mouse click while neural network is in its learning mode, feature extraction algorithms may be applied (neural network can work with raw data or feature extracted data), data from the ROI will be loaded into the memory block automatically and sequentially (requiring from one to a multitude of neurons), thus training neural network from a single frame of imagery and in real time. Once learned, neural network will input the second frame of imagery, compare data from the entire frame with the neuron memory contents, find a match, classify the match, and provide an X-Y (coordinates) position or location output. This X-Y output will allow an associated pan and tilt mechanism to track the object of interest in real time. This process continues for each successive frame. In the event the vehicle turns or changes shape in relation to the camera location, the degraded quality of the neuron memory comparison will trigger the neural network learning mode to capture this changed data and commit more neurons for the new object shape. This neural network will simultaneously and continuously track the object, allowing itself the ability to track even as new patterns are learned.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions today typically require high performance computers and/or parallel processors running AI or neural network software performing &#x201c;Deep Learning&#x201d; on back propagation and other neural networks. These systems can be large, consume significant power and be very costly for both the hardware and software. The learning phase for Deep Learning neural networks is generally performed in data centers or the &#x201c;Cloud&#x201d; and takes huge computing resources that can take days to process depending on the data set and number of levels in the network. After the network has been generated it can be downloaded to relatively low power processing systems (Target Systems) in the field. However, these target systems are typically not capable of embedded learning, and generally consist of powerful PCs and GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) acceleration resulting in significant cost and power consumption. Additionally, as the training dataset grows during the learning phase, there is no guarantee that the target hardware will remain sufficient and users may have to upgrade their target systems to execute properly after a new network has been generated during the learning phase. The major limitation to this approach is that new training data cannot be incorporated directly and immediately in the executable knowledge. It often also requires a fair amount of hand coding and tuning to deliver useful performance on the target hardware and is therefore not easily portable. Unlike Deep Learning networks, the neural network based on RBF networks can be easily mapped on hardware because the structure of the network does not change with the learned data. This ability to map the complete network on specialized hardware allows RBF networks to reach unbeatable performances in terms of speed and power dissipation both for learning and recognition. Preferably, the neural network has a NeuroMem&#x2122; architecture.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">For traffic flow determination, low and constant latency is a very desirable feature as it guarantees high and predictable results. With Deep Learning, latency varies. Typically, the more the system learns, the slower it becomes. This is due to the Von Neumann architecture bottlenecks found in all computers which run sequential programs. Even the most modern multi-core architectures, even the best GPU or VPU architectures have limitations to their parallelism because some resources (cache, external memory access, bus access, etc.) are shared between the cores and therefore limit their true parallelism. The NeuroMem&#x2122; architecture goes beyond the Von Neumann paradigm and, thanks to its in-memory processing and fully parallel nature does not slow down when the training dataset grows. In fact, any environment which needs on-the-job learning, fast and predictable latency, easy auditing of decisions is likely to be better served by RBF neural networks, rather than by Deep Learning neural networks.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows a block logic diagram of DDP <b>500</b>, CM <b>515</b> The DDP <b>500</b> contains CM <b>515</b> that controls all aspects of the DDP <b>500</b> to include: DDP enclosure or CC <b>501</b> opening and closing, DDP battery pack <b>516</b> recharging, drone battery <b>618</b> recharging and communications capabilities from other traffic sensor systems, central monitoring stations, first responder personnel and to act as a relay communications device to the drone in flight and/or other drones in flight in the near vicinity.
