The cured coating is a product of crosslinking a coating composition including uncrosslinked polymers (e.g., a dispersion of uncrosslinked polymers in a carrier, wherein the uncrosslinked polymers are crosslinked to form the matrix of crosslinked polymers). The matrix of crosslinked polymers can be elastomeric. The one or more coated fiber(s) can be formed by applying (e.g., spraying) the coating composition onto the surface of the one or more fiber(s) and then curing it on the one or more fiber(s), bonding the crosslinked polymeric matrix to the surface of the one or more fiber(s) and forming one or more coated fiber(s).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the cured coating includes a colorant (e.g., when the coating composition includes a colorant), the cured coating can be used to give a desired color or appearance to the one or more fiber(s). When a colorant is included in the coating composition, the matrix of crosslinked polymers formed by curing the coating composition entraps the colorant and bonds the matrix including the colorant to the surface of the one or more fiber(s). It has been found the coating compositions and cured coatings disclosed herein bond particularly well to fibers formed of polymeric materials such as polyesters, polyethers, polyamides, polyolefins, and polyurethanes, including thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs). It has also been found that these coating compositions and cured coatings bond particularly well to man-made fibers formed of non-polymeric materials such as glass fibers and carbon fibers. The colorant can be a pigment such as metal and metal oxide pigments, carbon pigments, clay earth pigments, ultramarine pigments, and a combination thereof. The colorant can be a dye such as an acid dye, including acid dyes complexed with quaternary ammonium compounds. The dye can be dispersed or solubilized in the coating composition prior to disposing the coating composition onto the one or more fiber(s). The one or more coated fiber(s), as well as yarns and textiles including the one or more coated fiber(s), can be incorporated into an article, such as an article of footwear, a component of footwear, an article of apparel, a component of apparel, an article of sporting equipment, or a component of sporting equipment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The coating composition comprises uncrosslinked polymers and optionally a colorant, such as a mixture of uncrosslinked polymers with pigment particles or dye or both, in a carrier, for example water or an aqueous solution. In a particular example, the uncrosslinked polymers of the coating composition include a water-borne dispersion of uncrosslinked polymers, such as a water-borne dispersion of uncrosslinked polyurethanes. It has been found that these coating compositions comprising water-borne dispersions of uncrosslinked polymers in a carrier, and cured coatings formed from these coating compositions, bond particularly well to fibers such as those made of polymeric materials as well as carbon fibers and glass fibers. It has also been found that when the cured coatings form an elastomeric matrix, it is particularly well-suited to use on articles which may flex during use, such as yarns, cables, textiles, and other elements including fibers. When pigments are included in the coating, the polymeric matrix traps at least a portion of the pigments in the cured coating. When a dye is included in the coating composition (e.g., a dispersed or solublized dye) or cured coating, following the curing step, the dye remains present in the crosslinked polymeric matrix of the cured coating. The high bonding strength with the crosslinked polymeric matrix, particularly when the cured coating is elastomeric, results in a durable decorative coating which can be used on articles of footwear, apparel and sporting equipment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disclosure is also directed to a composite article, where the composite article comprises a solid resin material (e.g., a solid thermoplastic material or a solid thermoset material such as an epoxy resin material) consolidating the one or more coated fiber(s) as disclosed herein. The composite article can be incorporated into articles such as footwear, apparel and sporting equipment. When present, the optional colorants (e.g., pigments or dye or both) impart color or decorative effects to the fiber(s) and the articles, which can be realized by coating one or more fiber(s) with the coating composition and curing the coating composition prior to consolidating the one or more fiber(s) with the solid resin material. It has been found that the coatings of the present disclosure remain bonded to the fibers when exposed to many different types of resin materials commonly used to form composites, rather than dissolving or dispersing in the resin materials. When substantially transparent or translucent solid resin materials are used, the coated fiber(s) can be visible through the solid resin material surrounding and consolidating the coated fiber(s).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present disclosure, a method of making a composite article can comprise disposing a liquid resin material onto one or more coated fiber(s), wetting the one or more coated fiber(s) with the liquid resin material; and solidifying the liquid resin material, forming a solid resin material surrounding and consolidating the one or more coated fiber(s). The coating of the one or more coated fiber(s) can be an elastomeric coating, which can be beneficial when the composite article is configured to flex during use. The coating of the one or more coated fiber(s) can comprise a colorant such as a plurality of pigments entrapped in the crosslinked matrix. During the process of forming the composite element, the addition of the liquid resin material (e.g., a liquid uncured resin material or a molten thermoplastic resin material) to the coated fiber(s) does not substantially dissolve or disperse the crosslinked polymeric matrix of the cured coating, and so the cured coating, optionally including a colorant, remains bonded to the one or more coated fiber(s) in the composite article. The composite articles can be used in articles such as footwear, a component of footwear, apparel, a component of apparel, sporting equipment, or a component of sporting equipment, including in examples where the composite article is configured to flex, bend, twist, and the like during normal use.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The one or more coated fiber(s) of the present disclosure can include one or more natural fiber(s) or one or more man-made fiber(s) or both. The one or more man-made coated fiber(s) can include a thermoplastic polyurethane fiber, a thermoplastic polyamide fiber, a thermoplastic polyester fiber, a thermoplastic polyether fiber, and any combination thereof. The one or more man-made coated fiber(s) can include a glass fiber or a carbon fiber. The one or more natural or man-made coated fiber(s) can be present in a tow of fibers. The one or more natural or man-made coated fiber(s) can be present in the form of a yarn, including as such as a staple yarn including a spun staple yarn, or as a filament yarn, including a monofilament yarn. The plurality of fibers including the one or more coated fiber(s) in the article can be present in the form of a textile, such as a non-woven textile, a woven textile, a knit textile, a braided textile, or a crocheted textile.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present disclosure also provides for a method of making an article that comprises: attaching (e.g., affixing, bonding, coupling, etc.) a first article as described above and herein to a second article. For example, the first and second articles can be components of an article of footwear, apparel or sporting equipment, and attaching the first and second articles together can result in a finished article of footwear, apparel or sporting equipment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Now having described embodiments of the present disclosure generally, additional discussion regarding embodiments will be described in greater details.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">This disclosure is not limited to particular embodiments described, and as such may, of course, vary.

The upper and lower limits of these smaller ranges may independently be included in the smaller ranges and are also encompassed within the disclosure, subject to any specifically excluded limit in the stated range. Where the stated range includes one or both of the limits, ranges excluding either or both of those included limits are also included in the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading this disclosure, each of the individual embodiments described and illustrated herein has discrete components and features which may be readily separated from or combined with the features of any of the other several embodiments without departing from the scope or spirit of the present disclosure. Any recited method may be carried out in the order of events recited or in any other order that is logically possible.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of the present disclosure will employ, unless otherwise indicated, techniques of material science, chemistry, textiles, polymer chemistry, and the like, which are within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art of material science, chemistry, textiles, polymer chemistry, and the like. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure, suitable methods and materials are described herein.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; may include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to &#x201c;a support&#x201d; includes a plurality of supports. In this specification and in the claims that follow, reference will be made to a number of terms that shall be defined to have the following meanings unless a contrary intention is apparent.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the cured coating can be a crosslinked coating that optionally includes one or more colorants such as solid pigment particles or dye. The crosslinked coating can be a matrix of crosslinked polymers (e.g., a crosslinked polyurethane homopolymer or copolymer such as a crosslinked polyester polyurethane). The optional colorants can be entrapped in the coating, including entrapped in the matrix of crosslinked polymers. The pigment or dye can be physically entrapped in the crosslinked polymer matrix, can be chemically bonded (e.g., covalently bonded, ionically bonded, hydrogen bonded, and the like, with the coating including the polymeric matrix or with the material forming the surface of the fiber to which the coating is applied), or a combination of physically bonded and chemically bonded with the cured coating or fiber. The cured coating can have a thickness of about 0.01 micrometers to 1000 micrometers.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The cured coating can be a product (or also referred to as &#x201c;crosslinked product&#x201d;) of crosslinking a coating composition comprising uncrosslinked polymers. In the coating composition, the uncrosslinked polymers can be dispersed in a carrier, such as an organic solvent, water or an aqueous solution. The uncrosslinked polymers can be a dispersion of uncrosslinked polymers including a water-borne dispersion of uncrosslinked polymers such as, for example, a water-borne dispersion of uncrosslinked polyurethane polymers, including a water-borne dispersion of uncrosslinked polyester polyurethane copolymers). The coating composition can include one or more colorants (e.g., pigments and/or or dyes). The uncrosslinked polymers can be crosslinked to form a crosslinked polymeric matrix which entraps the colorants. The colorants can be physically entrapped in the crosslinked polymeric matrix, can be chemically bonded (e.g., covalently bonded, ionically bonded, hydrogen bonded, and the like, with the crosslinked polymeric matrix), or can be both physically bonded and chemically bonded with the crosslinked polymeric matrix. The cured coating can be formed by crosslinking the coating composition. The cured coating can have a thickness of about 0.01 micrometers to 1000 micrometers on the one or more fiber(s).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The term &#x201c;water-borne&#x201d; herein means the carrier of the dispersion includes about 50 weight percent to 100 weight percent water, about 60 weight percent to 100 weight percent water, about 70 weight percent to 100 weight percent water, or about 100 weight percent water. The term &#x201c;water-borne dispersion&#x201d; refers to a dispersion of a component (e.g., polymer, cross-linker, and the like) in water without co-solvents. A co-solvent can be used in the water-borne dispersion and the co-solvent can be an organic solvent.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The one or more coated fiber(s) can be incorporated into a composite article that includes the one or more coated fiber(s), wherein the one or more coated fiber(s) are surrounded by and consolidated by a solid resin material. The solid resin material can be a thermoset cured resin material such as a cured epoxy resin material, or can be a re-flowed and solidified thermoplastic material. The composite article can be incorporated into an article such as footwear (e.g., as a plate or part of a plate) or apparel or sporting equipment. In this regard, one or more portions of the composite article can be visible (e.g., exposed) in the finished article (e.g., not covered) so that the one or more coated fiber(s), optionally including a colorant, of the composite article can be seen by a person observing the article.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The composite article is made by disposing a liquid resin material onto one or more coated fiber(s), wetting the one or more coated fiber(s) with a liquid resin material; and solidifying the liquid resin material surrounding and consolidating the one or more coated fiber(s) with solid resin material, forming a composite component. The liquid resin material can be a molten thermoplastic material which is solidified by cooling the thermoplastic material to a temperature below its melting temperature. The liquid resin material can be a reactive resin material which is solidified by polymerizing monomers and/or oligomers present in the liquid resin, or by crosslinking polymers present in the liquid resin, or both.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The composite article can be used in the sole of a shoe, where one or more portions of the composite article are exposed or can otherwise be seen through openings in the sole, through a transparent or translucent material forming a portion of the sole, or another portion of the article of footwear, as described below and herein.

As used herein, a transparent material means that light passes through the material in straight lines and passes out of the material and one can see clearly through the material to observe the coated fiber(s). For an opaque material, light does not pass through the material and one cannot see through the material at all. Translucent material falls between a transparent material and an opaque material, in that light passes through a translucent material but some of the light is scattered so that one cannot see clearly through the material. The wavelength and amount of light passing through a material can be measured using a spectrophotometer, for example.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The coating composition and cured coating can include colorants such a pigment (e.g., a solid pigment particle) or a dye.

The solid pigment particles can be biological or organic pigments. The solid pigment particles can be of a type known in the art as an extender pigment, which include, but are not limited to, calcium carbonate, calcium silicate, mica, clay, silica, barium sulfate and the like. The amount of the solid pigment particles sufficient to achieve the desired color intensity, shade, and opacity, can be in amounts up to about 5 percent to 25 percent or more by weight of the coating.

The quaternary salt can be include four groups attached to the N atom, wherein the each can be selected independently from a hydrocarbon group R (e.g., R can be an alkyl group such as a C1 to C6 alkyl group) or non-hydrocarbon chains such as ether (&#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;R1 (e.g., R1 can be an alkyl group such as a C1 to C6 alkyl group)), ester (&#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;O&#x2014;R1 (e.g., R1 can be an alkyl group such as a C1 to C6 alkyl group)) and amide (&#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;NR1R2 (e.g., R1 and R2 can each independently be an alkyl group such as a C1 to C6 alkyl group)). The quaternary (tetraalkyl) ammonium salt can react with the dye (e.g., acid dye) to form a complexed dye that can be used in the coating. The &#x201c;alkyl&#x201d; group can include C1 to C10 alkyl groups. The quaternary (tetraalkyl) ammonium salt can be selected from soluble tetrabutylammonium compounds and tetrahexylammonium compounds. The counterion of the quaternary ammonium salt should be selected so that the quaternary ammonium salt forms a stable solution with the dye (e.g., anionic dye). The quaternary ammonium compound may be, for example, a halide (such as chloride, bromide or iodide), hydroxide, sulfate, sulfite, carbonate, perchlorate, chlorate, bromate, iodate, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, phosphite, hexfluorophosphite, borate, tetrafluoroborate, cyanide, isocyanide, azide, thiosulfate, thiocyanate, or carboxylate (such as acetate or oxalate).

The cross-linker can be a water-borne cross-linker. The cross-linker can include one or more of the following: a polycarboxylic acid crosslinking agent, an aldehyde crosslinking agent, a polyisocyanate crosslinking agent, or a combination thereof. The polycarboxylic acid crosslinking agent can be a polycarboxylic acid having from 2 to 9 carbon atoms. For example, the cross-linker can include a polyacrylic acid, a polymaleic acid, a copolymer of acid, a copolymer of maleic acid, fumaric acid, or 1, 2, 3, 4-butanetetracarboxylic acid.

The liquid resin material of the composite articles comprises uncrosslinked polymers and/or unpolymerized monomers and/or unpolymerized oligomers as described below. The solid resin material of the composite articles comprises polymers, optionally crosslinked polymers, as described below. Additionally, the fiber(s) of the present disclosure can be polymeric fibers formed from polymeric materials comprising polymers as described below. Additional components of the articles described herein can include polymeric materials comprising polymers as described below.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The polymer can be a thermoset polymer or a thermoplastic polymer. The polymer can be an elastomeric polymer, including an elastomeric thermoset polymer or an elastomeric thermoplastic polymer. The polymer can be selected from: polyurethanes (including elastomeric polyurethanes, thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs), and elastomeric TPUs), polyesters, polyethers, polyamides, vinyl polymers (e.g., copolymers of vinyl alcohol, vinyl esters, ethylene, acrylates, methacrylates, styrene, and so on), polyacrylonitriles, polyphenylene ethers, polycarbonates, polyureas, polystyrenes, co-polymers thereof (including polyester-polyurethanes, polyether-polyurethanes, polycarbonate-polyurethanes, polyether block polyamides (PEBAs), and styrene block copolymers), and any combination thereof, as described herein. The polymer can include one or more polymers selected from the group consisting of polyesters, polyethers, polyamides, polyurethanes, polyolefins copolymers of each, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The term &#x201c;polymer&#x201d; refers to a chemical compound formed of a plurality of repeating structural units referred to as monomers. Polymers often are formed by a polymerization reaction in which the plurality of structural units become covalently bonded together. When the monomer units forming the polymer all have the same chemical structure, the polymer is a homopolymer. When the polymer includes two or more monomer units having different chemical structures, the polymer is a copolymer. One example of a type of copolymer is a terpolymer, which includes three different types of monomer units. The co-polymer can include two or more different monomers randomly distributed in the polymer (e.g., a random co-polymer). Alternatively, one or more blocks containing a plurality of a first type of monomer can be bonded to one or more blocks containing a plurality of a second type of monomer, forming a block copolymer. A single monomer unit can include one or more different chemical functional groups.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Polymers having repeating units which include two or more types of chemical functional groups can be referred to as having two or more segments. For example, a polymer having repeating units of the same chemical structure can be referred to as having repeating segments. Segments are commonly described as being relatively harder or softer based on their chemical structures, and it is common for polymers to include relatively harder segments and relatively softer segments bonded to each other in a single monomeric unit or in different monomeric units. When the polymer includes repeating segments, physical interactions or chemical bonds can be present within the segments or between the segments or both within and between the segments. Examples of segments often referred to as hard segments include segments including a urethane linkage, which can be formed from reacting an isocyanate with a polyol to form a polyurethane. Examples of segments often referred to as soft segments include segments including an alkoxy functional group, such as segments including ether or ester functional groups, and polyester segments. Segments can be referred to based on the name of the functional group present in the segment (e.g., a polyether segment, a polyester segment), as well as based on the name of the chemical structure which was reacted in order to form the segment (e.g., a polyol-derived segment, an isocyanate-derived segment). When referring to segments of a particular functional group or of a particular chemical structure from which the segment was derived, it is understood that the polymer can contain up to 10 mole percent of segments of other functional groups or derived from other chemical structures. For example, as used herein, a polyether segment is understood to include up to 10 mole percent of non-polyether segments.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As previously described, the polymer can be a thermoplastic polymer. In general, a thermoplastic polymer softens or melts when heated and returns to a solid state when cooled. The thermoplastic polymer transitions from a solid state to a softened state when its temperature is increased to a temperature at or above its softening temperature, and a liquid state when its temperature is increased to a temperature at or above its melting temperature. When sufficiently cooled, the thermoplastic polymer transitions from the softened or liquid state to the solid state. As such, the thermoplastic polymer may be softened or melted, molded, cooled, re-softened or re-melted, re-molded, and cooled again through multiple cycles. For amorphous thermoplastic polymers, the solid state is understood to be the &#x201c;rubbery&#x201d; state above the glass transition temperature of the polymer. The thermoplastic polymer can have a melting temperature from about 90 degrees C. to about 190 degrees C. when determined in accordance with ASTM D3418-97 as described herein below, and includes all subranges therein in increments of 1 degree. The thermoplastic polymer can have a melting temperature from about 93 degrees C. to about 99 degrees C. when determined in accordance with ASTM D3418-97 as described herein below.

The thermoplastic polymer can have a glass transition temperature from about &#x2212;20 degrees C. to about 30 degrees C. when determined in accordance with ASTM D3418-97 as described herein below. The thermoplastic polymer can have a glass transition temperature (from about &#x2212;13 degree C. to about &#x2212;7 degrees C. when determined in accordance with ASTM D3418-97 as described herein below.

The thermoplastic polymer can have a modulus from about 20 MPa to about 80 MPa when determined on a thermoformed plaque in accordance with ASTM D412-98 Standard Test Methods for Vulcanized Rubber and Thermoplastic Rubbers and Thermoplastic Elastomers-Tension with modifications described herein below.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The polymer can be a thermoset polymer. As used herein, a &#x201c;thermoset polymer&#x201d; is understood to refer to a polymer which cannot be heated and melted, as its melting temperature is at or above its decomposition temperature. A &#x201c;thermoset material&#x201d; refers to a material which comprises at least one thermoset polymer. The thermoset polymer and/or thermoset material can be prepared from a precursor (e.g., an uncured or partially cured polymer or material) using thermal energy and/or actinic radiation (e.g., ultraviolet radiation, visible radiation, high energy radiation, infrared radiation) to form a partially cured or fully cured polymer or material which no longer remains fully thermoplastic. In some cases, the cured or partially cured polymer or material may remain thermoelastic properties, in that it is possible to partially soften and mold the polymer or material at elevated temperatures and/or pressures, but it is not possible to melt the polymer or material. The curing can be promoted, for example, with the use of high pressure and/or a catalyst. In many examples, the curing process is irreversible since it results in cross-linking and/or polymerization reactions of the precursors. The uncured or partially cured polymers or materials can be malleable or liquid prior to curing. In some cases, the uncured or partially cured polymers or materials can be molded into their final shape, or used as adhesives. Once hardened, a thermoset polymer or material cannot be re-melted in order to be reshaped. The textured surface can be formed by partially or fully curing an uncured precursor material to lock in the textured surface of the textured structure.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Polyurethane</heading><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The polymer can be a polyurethane, such as a thermoplastic polyurethane (also referred to as &#x201c;TPU&#x201d;). Alternatively, the polymer can be a thermoset polyurethane. Additionally, polyurethane can be an elastomeric polyurethane, including an elastomeric TPU or an elastomeric thermoset polyurethane. The elastomeric polyurethane can include hard and soft segments. The hard segments can comprise or consist of urethane segments (e.g., isocyanate-derived segments).

The polyamide blocks having dicarboxylic chain ends are derived from the condensation of polyamide precursors in the presence of a chain-stopper dicarboxylic acid. If the polyamide precursors are only lactams or &#x3b1;,&#x3c9;-aminocarboxylic acids, a dicarboxylic acid is added. If the precursors already comprise a dicarboxylic acid, this is used in excess with respect to the stoichiometry of the diamines. The reaction usually takes place from about 180 to about 300 degrees C., such as from about 200 degrees to about 290 degrees C., and the pressure in the reactor can be set from about 5 to about 30 bar and maintained for approximately 2 to 3 hours. The pressure in the reactor is slowly reduced to atmospheric pressure and then the excess water is distilled off, for example for one or two hours.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0109">Once the polyamide having carboxylic acid end groups has been prepared, the polyether, the polyol and a catalyst are then added. The total amount of polyether can be divided and added in one or more portions, as can the catalyst. The polyether is added first and the reaction of the OH end groups of the polyether and of the polyol with the COOH end groups of the polyamide starts, with the formation of ester linkages and the elimination of water. Water is removed as much as possible from the reaction mixture by distillation and then the catalyst is introduced in order to complete the linking of the polyamide blocks to the polyether blocks. This second step takes place with stirring, preferably under a vacuum of at least 50 millibar (5000 Pascals) at a temperature such that the reactants and the copolymers obtained are in the molten state. By way of example, this temperature can be from about 100 to about 400 degrees C., such as from about 200 to about 250 degrees C. The reaction is monitored by measuring the torque exerted by the polymer melt on the stirrer or by measuring the electric power consumed by the stirrer. The end of the reaction is determined by the value of the torque or of the target power. The catalyst is defined as being any product which promotes the linking of the polyamide blocks to the polyether blocks by esterification. The catalyst can be a derivative of a metal (M) chosen from the group formed by titanium, zirconium and hafnium. The derivative can be prepared from a tetraalkoxides consistent with the general formula M(OR)<sub>4</sub>, in which M represents titanium, zirconium or hafnium and R, which can be identical or different, represents linear or branched alkyl radicals having from 1 to 24 carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0110">The catalyst can comprise a salt of the metal (M), particularly the salt of (M) and of an organic acid and the complex salts of the oxide of (M) and/or the hydroxide of (M) and an organic acid. The organic acid can be formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, caproic acid, caprylic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, phenylacetic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, phthalic acid or crotonic acid. The organic acid can be an acetic acid or a propionic acid. M can be zirconium and such salts are called zirconyl salts, e.g., the commercially available product sold under the name zirconyl acetate.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0111">The weight proportion of catalyst can vary from about 0.01 to about 5 percent of the weight of the mixture of the dicarboxylic polyamide with the polyetherdiol and the polyol. The weight proportion of catalyst can vary from about 0.05 to about 2 percent of the weight of the mixture of the dicarboxylic polyamide with the polyetherdiol and the polyol.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0112">In the one-step process, the polyamide precursors, the chain stopper and the polyether are blended together; what is then obtained is a polymer having essentially polyether blocks and polyamide blocks of highly variable length, but also the various reactants that have reacted randomly, which are distributed randomly along the polymer chain. They are the same reactants and the same catalyst as in the two-step process described above. If the polyamide precursors are only lactams, it is advantageous to add a little water. The copolymer has essentially the same polyether blocks and the same polyamide blocks, but also a small portion of the various reactants that have reacted randomly, which are distributed randomly along the polymer chain. As in the first step of the two-step process described above, the reactor is closed and heated, with stirring. The pressure established is from about 5 to about 30 bar. When the pressure no longer changes, the reactor is put under reduced pressure while still maintaining vigorous stirring of the molten reactants. The reaction is monitored as previously in the case of the two-step process.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0113">The proper ratio of polyamide to polyether blocks can be found in a single poly(ether block amide), or a blend of two or more different composition poly(ether block amide)s can be used with the proper average composition. It can be useful to blend a block copolymer having a high level of polyamide groups with a block copolymer having a higher level of polyether blocks, to produce a blend having an average level of polyether blocks of about 20 to about 40 weight percent of the total blend of poly(amid-block-ether) copolymers, or about 30 to about 35 weight percent. The copolymer can comprise a blend of two different poly(ether-block-amide)s comprising at least one block copolymer having a level of polyether blocks below 35 weight percent, and a second poly(ether-block-amide) having at least 45 weight percent of polyether blocks.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0114">Exemplary commercially available copolymers include, but are not limited to, those available under the tradenames of &#x201c;VESTAMID&#x201d; (Evonik Industries, Essen, Germany); &#x201c;PLATAMID&#x201d; (Arkema, Colombes, France), e.g., product code H2694; &#x201c;PEBAX&#x201d; (Arkema), e.g., product code &#x201c;PEBAX MH1657&#x201d; and &#x201c;PEBAX MV1074&#x201d;; &#x201c;PEBAX RNEW&#x201d; (Arkema); &#x201c;GRILAMID&#x201d; (EMS-Chemie AG, Domat-Ems, Switzerland), or also to other similar materials produced by various other suppliers.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0115">The polyamide can be physically crosslinked through, e.g., nonpolar or polar interactions between the polyamide groups of the polymers. In examples where the polyamide is a copolyamide, the copolyamide can be physically crosslinked through interactions between the polyamide groups, and optionally by interactions between the copolymer groups. When the co-polyamide is physically crosslinked through interactions between the polyamide groups, the polyamide segments can form the portion of the polymer referred to as the hard segment, and copolymer segments can form the portion of the polymer referred to as the soft segment. For example, when the copolyamide is a poly(ether-block-amide), the polyamide segments form the hard segments of the polymer, and polyether segments form the soft segments of the polymer.

The co-polyester can be formed from the polycondensation of a polyester oligomer or prepolymer with a second oligomer prepolymer to form a block copolyester. Optionally, the second prepolymer can be a hydrophilic prepolymer. For example, the co-polyester can be formed from the polycondensation of terephthalic acid or naphthalene dicarboxylic acid with ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, or 1,3-propanediol. Examples of co-polyesters include polyethylene adipate, polybutylene succinate, poly(3-hydroxbutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polytrimethylene terephthalate, polyethylene napthalate, and combinations thereof.

The coating as described herein can be disposed onto a fiber to form the coated fiber. A &#x201c;textile&#x201d; may be defined as any material manufactured from fibers, filaments, or yarns characterized by flexibility, fineness, and a high ratio of length to thickness. Textiles generally fall into two categories. The first category includes textiles produced directly from webs of filaments or fibers by randomly interlocking to construct non-woven fabrics and felts. The second category includes textiles formed through a mechanical manipulation of yarn, thereby producing a woven fabric, a knitted fabric, a braided fabric, a crocheted fabric, and the like. A textile of the present disclosure can include at least one coated fiber.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0142">The fiber can include natural, man-made or synthetic fibers. The fibers may be produced by conventional techniques, such as extrusion, electrospinning, interfacial polymerization, pulling, and the like. The fibers can include carbon fibers, boron fibers, silicon carbide fibers, titania fibers, alumina fibers, quartz fibers, glass fibers, such as E, A, C, ECR, R, S, D, and NE glasses and quartz, or the like. The fibers can be fibers formed from synthetic polymers capable of forming fibers such as poly(ether ketone), polyimide, polybenzoxazole, poly(phenylene sulfide), polyesters, polyolefins (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene), aromatic polyamides (e.g., an aramid polymer such as para-aramid fibers and meta-aramid fibers), aromatic polyimides, polybenzimidazoles, polyetherimides, polytetrafluoroethylene, acrylic, modacrylic, poly(vinyl alcohol), polyamides, polyurethanes, and copolymers such as polyether-polyurea copolymers, polyester-polyurethanes, polyether block amide copolymers, or the like. The fibers can be natural fibers (e.g., silk, wool, cashmere, vicuna, cotton, flax, hemp, jute, sisal). The fibers can be man-made fibers from regenerated natural polymers, such as rayon, lyocell, acetate, triacetate, rubber, and poly(lactic acid).</p><p id="p-0159" num="0143">The fibers can have an indefinite length. For example, man-made and synthetic fibers are generally extruded in substantially continuous strands. Alternatively, the fibers can be staple fibers, such as, for example, cotton fibers or extruded synthetic polymer fibers can be cut to form staple fibers of relatively uniform length. The staple fiber can have a have a length of about 1 millimeter to 100 centimeters or more as well as any increment therein (e.g., 1 millimeter increments).</p><p id="p-0160" num="0144">The fiber can have any of a variety of cross-sectional shapes. Natural fibers can have a natural cross-section, or can have a modified cross-sectional shape (e.g., with processes such as mercerization). Man-made or synthetic fibers can be extruded to provide a strand having a predetermined cross-sectional shape. The cross-sectional shape of a fiber can affect its properties, such as its softness, luster, and wicking ability. The fibers can have round or essentially round cross sections. Alternatively, the fibers can have non-round cross sections, such as flat, oval, octagonal, rectangular, wedge-shaped, triangular, dog-bone, multi-lobal, multi-channel, hollow, core-shell, or other shapes.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0145">The fiber can be processed. For example, the properties of fibers can be affected, at least in part, by processes such as drawing (stretching) the fibers, annealing (hardening) the fibers, and/or crimping or texturizing the fibers.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0146">In some cases a fiber can be a multi-component fiber, such as one comprising two or more co-extruded polymeric materials. The two or more co-extruded polymeric materials can be extruded in a core-sheath, islands-in-the-sea, segmented-pie, striped, or side-by-side configuration. A multi-component fiber can be processed in order to form a plurality of smaller fibers (e.g., microfibers) from a single fiber, for example, by remove a sacrificial material.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0147">The fiber can be a carbon fiber such as TARIFYL produced by Formosa Plastics Corp. of Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, (e.g., 12,000, 24,000, and 48,000 fiber tows, specifically fiber types TC-35 and TC-35R), carbon fiber produced by SGL Group of Wiesbaden, Germany (e.g., 50,000 fiber tow), carbon fiber produced by Hyosung of Seoul, South Korea, carbon fiber produced by Toho Tenax of Tokyo, Japan, fiberglass produced by Jushi Group Co., LTD of Zhejiang, China (e.g., E6, 318, silane-based sizing, filament diameters 14, 15, 17, 21, and 24 micrometers), and polyester fibers produced by Amann Group of Bonningheim, Germany (e.g., SERAFILE 200/2 non-lubricated polyester filament and SERAFILE COMPHIL 200/2 lubricated polyester filament).</p><p id="p-0164" num="0148">A plurality of fibers includes 2 to hundreds or thousands or more fibers, where at least one of the fibers is coated while a majority or all of the fibers can be coated fibers. The plurality of fibers can be in the form of bundles of strands of fibers, referred to as tows, or in the form of relatively aligned staple fibers referred to as sliver and roving. A single type fiber can be used either alone or in combination with one or more different types of fibers by co-mingling two or more types of fibers. Examples of co-mingled fibers include polyester fibers with cotton fibers, glass fibers with carbon fibers, carbon fibers with aromatic polyimide (aramid) fibers, and aromatic polyimide fibers with glass fibers.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0149">As used herein, the term &#x201c;yarn&#x201d; refers to an assembly formed of one or more fibers (e.g., where at least one is a coated fiber), wherein the strand has a substantial length and a relatively small cross-section, and is suitable for use in the production of textiles by hand or by machine, including textiles made using weaving, knitting, crocheting, braiding, sewing, embroidery, or ropemaking techniques.

A yarn is a long continuous length of one or more fibers suitable for use in the production of textiles by hand or by machine, including textiles made using weaving, knitting, crocheting, braiding, sewing, embroidery, or ropemaking techniques. Thread is a type of yarn commonly used for sewing.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0151">Yarns can be made using fibers formed of natural, man-made and synthetic materials. Synthetic fibers are most commonly used to make spun yarns from staple fibers, and filament yarns. Spun yarn is made by arranging and twisting staple fibers together to make a cohesive strand. The process of forming a yarn from staple fibers typically includes carding and drawing the fibers to form sliver, drawing out and twisting the sliver to form roving, and spinning the roving to form a strand. Multiple strands can be plied (twisted together) to make a thicker yarn. The twist direction of the staple fibers and of the plies can affect the final properties of the yarn. A filament yarn can be formed of a single long, substantially continuous filament, which is conventionally referred to as a &#x201c;monofilament yarn,&#x201d; or a plurality of individual filaments grouped together. A filament yarn can also be formed of two or more long, substantially continuous filaments which are grouped together by grouping the filaments together by twisting them or entangling them or both. As with staple yarns, multiple strands can be plied together to form a thicker yarn.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0152">Once formed, the yarn can undergo further treatment such as texturizing, thermal or mechanical treating, or coating with a material such as a synthetic polymer. The fibers, yarns, or textiles, or any combination thereof, used in the disclosed articles can be sized. Sized fibers, yarns, and/or textiles are coated on at least part of their surface with a sizing composition selected to change the absorption or wear characteristics, or for compatibility with other materials. The sizing composition facilitates wet-out and wet-through of the coating or resin upon the surface and assists in attaining desired physical properties in the final article. An exemplary sizing composition can comprise, for example, epoxy polymers, urethane-modified epoxy polymers, polyester polymers, phenol polymers, polyamide polymers, polyurethane polymers, polycarbonate polymers, polyetherimide polymers, polyamideimide polymers, polystylylpyridine polymers, polyimide polymers bismaleimide polymers, polysulfone polymers, polyethersulfone polymers, epoxy-modified urethane polymers, polyvinyl alcohol polymers, polyvinyl pyrrolidone polymers, and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0153">Two or more yarns can be combined, for example, to form composite yarns such as single- or double-covered yarns, and corespun yarns. Accordingly, yarns may have a variety of configurations that generally conform to the descriptions provided herein.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0154">The yarn can comprise at least one thermoplastic material (e.g., one or more of the fibers can be made of thermoplastic material). The yarn can be made of a thermoplastic material. The yarn can be coated with a layer of a material such as a thermoplastic material.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0155">The linear mass density or weight per unit length of a yarn can be expressed using various units, including denier (D) and tex. Denier is the mass in grams of 9000 meters of yarn. The linear mass density of a single filament of a fiber can also be expressed using denier per filament (DPF). Tex is the mass in grams of a 1000 meters of yarn. Decitex is another measure of linear mass, and is the mass in grams for a 10,000 meters of yarn.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0156">As used herein, tenacity is understood to refer to the amount of force (expressed in units of weight, for example: pounds, grams, centinewtons or other units) needed to break a yarn (i.e., the breaking force or breaking point of the yarn), divided by the linear mass density of the yarn expressed, for example, in (unstrained) denier, decitex, or some other measure of weight per unit length. The breaking force of the yarn is determined by subjecting a sample of the yarn to a known amount of force, for example, using a strain gauge load cell such as an INSTRON brand testing system (Norwood, Mass., USA). Yarn tenacity and yarn breaking force are distinct from burst strength or bursting strength of a textile, which is a measure of how much pressure can be applied to the surface of a textile before the surface bursts.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0157">Generally, in order for a yarn to withstand the forces applied in an industrial knitting machine, the minimum tenacity required is approximately 1.5 grams per Denier. Most yarns formed from commodity polymeric materials generally have tenacities in the range of about 1.5 grams per Denier to about 4 grams per Denier. For example, polyester yarns commonly used in the manufacture of knit uppers for footwear have tenacities in the range of about 2.5 to about 4 grams per Denier. Yarns formed from commodity polymeric materials which are considered to have high tenacities generally have tenacities in the range of about 5 grams per Denier to about 10 grams per Denier. For example, commercially available package dyed polyethylene terephthalate yarn from National Spinning (Washington, N.C., USA) has a tenacity of about 6 grams per Denier, and commercially available solution dyed polyethylene terephthalate yarn from Far Eastern New Century (Taipei, Taiwan) has a tenacity of about 7 grams per Denier. Yarns formed from high performance polymeric materials generally have tenacities of about 11 grams per Denier or greater. For example, yarns formed of aramid fiber typically have tenacities of about 20 grams per Denier, and yarns formed of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) having tenacities greater than 30 grams per Denier are available from Dyneema (Stanley, N.C., USA) and Spectra (Honeywell-Spectra, Colonial Heights, Va., USA).</p><p id="p-0174" num="0158">Various techniques exist for mechanically manipulating yarns to form a textile. Such techniques include, for example, interweaving, intertwining and twisting, and interlooping. Interweaving is the intersection of two yarns that cross and interweave at right angles to each other. The yarns utilized in interweaving are conventionally referred to as &#x201c;warp&#x201d; and &#x201c;weft.&#x201d; A woven textile includes include a warp yarn and a weft yarn. The warp yarn extends in a first direction, and the weft strand extends in a second direction that is substantially perpendicular to the first direction. Intertwining and twisting encompasses various procedures, such as braiding and knotting, where yarns intertwine with each other to form a textile. Interlooping involves the formation of a plurality of columns of intermeshed loops, with knitting being the most common method of interlooping. The textile may be primarily formed from one or more yarns that are mechanically-manipulated, for example, through interweaving, intertwining and twisting, and/or interlooping processes, as mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0159">The textile can be a nonwoven textile. Generally, a nonwoven textile or fabric is a sheet or web structure made from fibers and/or yarns that are bonded together. The bond can be a chemical and/or mechanical bond, and can be formed using heat, solvent, adhesive or a combination thereof. Exemplary nonwoven fabrics are flat or tufted porous sheets that are made directly from separate fibers, molten plastic and/or plastic film. They are not made by weaving or knitting and do not necessarily require converting the fibers to yarn, although yarns can be used as a source of the fibers. Nonwoven textiles are typically manufactured by putting small fibers together in the form of a sheet or web (similar to paper on a paper machine), and then binding them either mechanically (as in the case of felt, by interlocking them with serrated or barbed needles, or hydro-entanglement such that the inter-fiber friction results in a stronger fabric), with an adhesive, or thermally (by applying binder (in the form of powder, paste, or polymer melt) and melting the binder onto the web by increasing temperature). A nonwoven textile can be made from staple fibers (e.g., from wetlaid, airlaid, carding/crosslapping processes), or extruded fibers (e.g., from meltblown or spunbond processes, or a combination thereof), or a combination thereof. Bonding of the fibers in the nonwoven textile can be achieved with thermal bonding (with or without calendering), hydro-entanglement, ultrasonic bonding, needlepunching (needlefelting), chemical bonding (e.g., using binders such as latex emulsions or solution polymers or binder fibers or powders), meltblown bonding (e.g., fiber is bonded as air attenuated fibers intertangle during simultaneous fiber and web formation).</p><p id="p-0176" num="0160">In regard to the resin material, the resin material is used to consolidate the coated fiber(s) by wetting fiber(s) with the resin material. After the fiber(s) are wetted with the resin material, the resin material is solidified (e.g., cured). The wetting process can be performed under vacuum and/or under increased temperature in order to remove any air trapped between the fibers or within the resin material, or to reduce the viscosity of the resin material that the resin material flows around and encapsulates the fiber(s). The resin material is a liquid when it is disposed onto the fiber(s), and is then solidified (e.g., cured, including polymerized and/or crosslinked) to form a sold resin material in the final article.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0161">The resin material can be a thermoplastic resin material comprising one or more thermoplastic polymers as described above. The thermoplastic resin material can be applied to the coated fiber(s) when molten, and then cooled to solidify the thermoplastic resin material in the final article.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0162">The resin material can be a reactive resin material comprising one or more monomers, oligomers, or uncrosslinked polymers as described above. The reactive resin material can be applied to the coated fiber(s) when liquid, and can then be cured to solidify the reactive resin material in the final article. For example, curing can comprise exposing the liquid resin material to actinic radiation (e.g., thermal energy, ultra violet (UV) radiation, etc.) in order to initiate a polymerization and/or crosslinking reaction which solidifies the reactive resin material. Alternatively or additionally, the components of the reactive resin material can include ingredients which react on contact with each other, and the reactive resin material can be compounded shortly before application to the coated fiber(s), before the reactive resin material has fully reacted and solidified.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0163">The resin material can be a single component or multicomponent polymeric system, such as, for example, an epoxy system. The resin material can be UV cured or thermally cured at temperatures below 100&#xb0; C. The resin material can be a two component system such as CR-157/DD3 (Applied Poleramic (API). Cal., USA). In general, the resin material can include a polymer and a curing agent or catalyst, where the components are stored separately and are mixed to form the resin material. In an aspect, the resin material can be a monofunctional epoxy such as C<sub>1 to 20 </sub>aliphatic epoxy resins, C<sub>3 to 20 </sub>cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, and C<sub>6 to 20 </sub>aromatic monofunctional epoxy resins. In addition, other resin materials can be used where the resin material is pre-reacted with the curing agent and can include difunctional polymeric resins, trifunctional polymeric resins, tetrafunctional polymeric resins, and higher functional polymeric resins. These types of polymeric resins can include diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A, diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol F, diglycidyl ether of bisphenol S, diglycidyl-p-aminophenol, triglycidyl aminocresol, triglycidyl-p-aminophenol, tetraglycidyl ethers of methylenedianiline, phenol novolac type epoxy resins, cresol novolac type epoxy resins, resorcinol type epoxy resins, epoxy resins with a naphthalene skeleton, biphenyl type epoxy resins, dicyclopentadiene type epoxy resins and diphenylfluorene type epoxy resins, and the like. Each of these resins can be used individually or in any appropriate combination. Additional details are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7,008,555.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0164">Curing agents for multicomponent polymeric resins are compounds that have a reactive moiety that can react with a functional group (e.g., the epoxy group of an epoxy resin).

The disposing can include spraying (e.g., using a spray gun), brushing, or dipping the coating composition onto a surface of the fiber. The fiber(s) can include a first polymeric material, and the disposing can comprise contacting the first polymeric material of the fiber with the coating composition. The coating composition comprises uncrosslinked polymers (e.g., a dispersion of polymers in a carrier). The uncrosslinked polymers can include uncrosslinked polyurethanes The curing can include heating the coating composition to about 50 degrees to 90 degrees C. or about 60 degrees to 80 degrees C. for about 1 or about 5 minutes or more.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0187">The method can include applying a dye to the fiber(s) prior to or following the disposing and curing the coating composition.

The method can include treating the fiber(s) prior to applying the coating composition in order to improve bonding of the cured coating to the fiber(s). For example, the treating can include applying a primer or tie layer to the fiber(s), washing the fiber(s) to remove dirt or spin finish, applying an oxidizing treatment such as a plasma or corona treatment, etc.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0188">The one or more fiber(s) can be thermally treated prior to or following disposing and curing the coating composition. For example, the fiber(s) can be heated and at least partially or fully fused to each other or to other fibers prior to or following disposing and curing the coating composition.

The plurality of fibers can be thermally processed to the point that each fiber loses its fiber configuration to form a molded resin material, while the at least one fiber retains its fiber configuration within the molded resin material, where the at least one fiber is coated prior to or following formation of the molded resin material. Partially or fully fusing fibers alters the conformation of the fibers. When the one or more fiber(s) are partially or fully fused prior to disposing and curing the coating composition, the one or more fiber(s) may form a skin or film-like structure, and the coating composition may be disposed onto and cured on the skin or film-like structure. Alternatively, the coating composition can be disposed onto and cured on the one or more fiber(s), and one or more second fiber(s) adjacent the one or more coated fiber(s) can be partially or fully fused, forming a skin or film-like structure in which the one or more coated fiber(s) are at least partially embedded.
