One possibility of this exact dosing are medical syringe pumps into which a syringe can be inserted in a defined manner. The syringe pump ensures that the syringe is actuated automatically and precisely to effect a defined temporal dosing of a medical substance. A prerequisite of an orderly actuation of the syringe is that both the syringe cylinder and the syringe piston are fixed and guided properly within the syringe pump.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A conventional medical syringe pump for dosing a liquid contained in a syringe at a defined rate is, for instance, known from DE 298 12 065 U1. Here, the syringe is pressed over a piston rod by means of a piston, and the syringe pump is designed such that it detects the size of the syringe inserted by means of a force sensor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, EP 1 374 932 A2 discloses a medical syringe pump with a housing comprising a syringe depression for a syringe to be inserted. In addition to the housing the syringe pump comprises a linearly movable drive head for actuating the syringe piston of the syringe.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventionally, medical syringe pumps comprise a drive rod/retention arm which projects from the housing of the syringe pump and by which a linear movement of the drive head and of the clamped syringe piston is enabled. The drive rod is mounted with an axially fixed portion of the syringe pump, especially a rod-shaped spindle. Twisting of this drive rod and hence of the drive head connected therewith can, however, not be prevented completely by such an axial bearing, so that a proper fixing of the syringe is not fully guaranteed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore an object of the present disclosure to avoid or at least mitigate the afore-described disadvantages. For this purpose, a syringe pump with a linearly movable retention arm which is protected from twisting about its own axis is to be provided.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The disclosure accordingly relates to a medical syringe pump with a housing and a drive head (corresponds to the part getting into contact with a syringe piston rod) movable linearly to the housing via a tube-shaped or rod-shaped retention arm for actuating a syringe inserted in the housing, for which purpose the retention arm is connected in an axially fixed manner with an advance carriage which is in turn in meshing engagement with an advance spindle. The medical syringe pump comprises a twist protection and/or twist protection component formed separately from the advance carriage and protecting the advance carriage from twisting about the axis of the retention arm.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In other words, a separately formed twist protection is connected with the advance carriage in a medical syringe pump such that it is mounted/retained in an anti-twist manner in the pump housing. The advance carriage is connected with the retention arm in an axially fixed manner, i.e. in a shift-proof manner along the retention arm axis, so that the retention arm is also protected from twisting by means of the twist protection. This retention arm is driven by means of the advance spindle (extending in parallel to the retention arm) with which the retention arm is in engagement via the advance carriage. Engagement takes place substantially via a threaded bearing (internal thread) integrated in the advance carriage, so that the retention arm is movable along the axis of the advance spindle in the case of a rotary motion of the advance spindle. The retention arm comprises, at an end portion thereof, a drive head contactable with a syringe piston rod, which actuates, by the linear movement of the retention arm, a syringe inserted in the syringe pump by means of pushing in and/or pulling out of the syringe piston.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Due to such a twist protection the linearly movable retention arm is protected from twisting relative to the pump housing, so that an additional (guiding) stability of the retention arm and the drive head connected therewith is ensured. Thus, a proper fixing and operation of a syringe is fully guaranteed. It is, for instance, possible to efficiently avoid canting of the syringe piston, for example, due to twisting of the retention arm and a resulting pivoting of the drive head.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with a further preferred aspect the twist protection of the medical syringe pump in accordance with the disclosure is of clamp-shaped design and comprises a gate-shaped or U-shaped lateral profile as well as a plurality of feet engaging the advance carriage in a form-fit manner.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In other words, a plurality of elongate, especially parallel, feet/legs/pins is formed as a part of the clamp-shaped twist protection, which is why the twist protection comprises a gate-shaped and/or U-shaped lateral profile. In the mounted state of the, preferably single-part, twist protection these feet engage/stick in a form-fitting manner in the advance carriage fixed to the retention arm.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with a further preferred aspect the twist protection comprises four feet which are, in the mounted state of the twist protection, oriented substantially perpendicular to the axis of the retention arm and encompass same.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In other words, the twist protection comprises four feet arranged in a rectangular shape and formed in parallel to each other and perpendicular with respect to the axis of the retention arm. Furthermore, the four feet are formed such that, in the mounted state of the twist protection, every two of the feet are arranged at one side of the retention arm axis and encompass the retention arm substantially transversely to the axis and/or circumferentially.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">This kind of design of the twist protection can be produced by a simple and cost-efficient manufacturing method and can be mounted easily and safely to the advance carriage by the form-fitting engagement of the feet.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with a further preferred aspect the retention arm of the medical syringe pump comprises circumferential grooves which are designed and arranged such that at least two feet of the twist protection engage therewith in the mounted state.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In other words, grooves extending circumferentially in a respective plane of the retention arm are arranged at the retention arm of the medical syringe pump, and receive at least two, especially parallel, feet of the mounted twist protection.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">These grooves at the retention arm serve for an additional stabilizing and/or guiding function of the feet of the twist protection in the mounting process and/or in the mounted state.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with a further preferred embodiment the advance carriage of the medical syringe pump comprises recesses which are formed and arranged to receive the feet of the twist protection.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In other words, recesses/slits/openings are provided at the advance carriage in which the feet of the twist protection engage and/or can be received. Preferably, the feet of the twist protection engage the recesses of the advance carriage in an undercutting manner.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with a further preferred aspect the feet of the twist protection are designed such that, in the mounted state of the twist protection, a clearance or a gap exists between the feet of the twist protection and the lower side of the housing of the syringe pump, so that an axial shifting of the retention arm, but no twisting of the retention arm about its axis is possible.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In other words, the feet of the twist protection have such a length and basis that they are, in the mounted state of the twist protection, movable axially, i.e. in the direction of the retention arm axis, along the inner lower side of the housing or possibly along the inner upper side of the housing of the syringe pump in a sliding/slipping manner without the advance carriage connected with the twist protection being able to be twisted.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">This precisely adapted clearance between the feet of the twist protection and the lower side of the housing of the syringe pump ensures a smooth axial shifting of the retention arm as well as a safe protection from twisting, so that a precise and stable as well as proper actuating of the syringe within the syringe pump is guaranteed.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In accordance with a further preferred aspect the twist protection comprises a through-hole oriented in parallel to the feet of the twist protection, which is formed at an arc portion of the clamp-shaped twist protection that connects the feet, and in which a locking screw is screwed which retains the twist protection at the advance carriage from unintended disengaging.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In other words, the twist protection comprises an arc portion which is substantially of cuboid design and from which the feet protrude/project in parallel, preferably at the corner points of the arc portion. At this arc portion, in parallel to the feet, preferably centrally, a through-hole is provided in which a locking screw can be received, and by which the twist protection is held together with the advance carriage which preferably also comprises a through-hole.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The subject matter disclosed will now be explained in detail by means of advantageous embodiments and with reference to the associated Figures.

The retention arm <b>2</b> is guided via a rod-shaped advance spindle <b>6</b> whose longitudinal axis concurs with the longitudinal axis of the tube-shaped retention arm <b>2</b>. The retention arm <b>2</b> is, substantially via an advance carriage <b>8</b>, mounted axially with the advance spindle <b>2</b> and/or guided by same. The advance carriage <b>8</b> is arranged at an end of the retention arm <b>2</b> which faces away from the drive head and encompasses same. The advance carriage <b>8</b> is connected in an axially fixed manner with the retention arm <b>2</b> and the retention arm <b>2</b> is, in this view, in a substantially extended state, i.e. in a position in which the advance spindle <b>6</b> projects from the retention arm <b>2</b>. Furthermore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the clamp-shaped twist protection <b>10</b> which comprises a substantially cuboid basis and four feet <b>12</b>. The four feet <b>12</b> of the twist protection <b>10</b> are each formed at the corners of the basis of the basic body and project perpendicularly to this basis. The feet <b>12</b> have a constant cross-section and a rectangular layout. Furthermore, the advance carriage <b>8</b> and the clamp-shaped twist protection <b>10</b> both comprise a vertical through-hole <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> which are arranged such that the advance carriage <b>8</b> and the twist protection <b>10</b> are connectable by a locking screw <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a sectional view through the advance carriage <b>8</b> and the twist protection <b>10</b> in a mounted state. The sectional plane extends in parallel along the longitudinal axis of the retention arm <b>2</b> of the syringe pump and intersects the advance carriage <b>8</b> and two feet <b>12</b> of the clamp-shaped twist protection <b>10</b>. In this view the retention arm <b>2</b> of the syringe pump is slid substantially completely over the advance spindle <b>6</b>, i.e. the retention arm <b>2</b> is in a retracted position. In this position of the retention arm <b>2</b> the advance carriage <b>8</b> and the twist protection <b>10</b> fastened thereto are arranged next to a perpendicular housing wall <b>17</b> of the syringe pump which comprises a gearing <b>18</b> for the advancing of the retention arm <b>2</b>. The basic body of the advance carriage <b>8</b> is of hollow cylinder-shaped design and encloses the retention arm <b>2</b> of the syringe pump. At the side facing the basis of the syringe pump, the advance carriage <b>8</b> comprises three parallel, substantially skid-shaped projections <b>20</b>. These projections <b>20</b> are of flat design at their underside, so that the advance carriage <b>8</b> slides at the inner side of the basis of the syringe pump when the retention arm <b>2</b> of the syringe pump performs a linear movement. The four feet <b>12</b> of the twist protection <b>10</b> extend, in the mounted state, in parallel along the perpendicular housing wall <b>17</b> of the syringe pump and engage in vertical recesses of the advance carriage <b>8</b> which are adapted to the dimensions of the feet <b>12</b> of the twist protection <b>10</b>. Every two of the feet <b>12</b> are arranged at one side of the longitudinal axis of the retention arm <b>2</b>, i.e. the feet <b>12</b> of the twist protection <b>10</b> encompass substantially the retention arm <b>2</b>.
