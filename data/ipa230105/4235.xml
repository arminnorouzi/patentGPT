Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention has its application within the sectors of motion tracking, and especially, in the industrial area engaged in providing tools for determining the correct realization or reproduction of a physical exercise.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATE OF THE ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Body-tracking technologies have focused a significant attention from the industrial and scientific communities, due to their potential applications, on diverse fields such as physical therapy, physical exercise monitoring, prosthetics, augmented reality and virtual reality, to name a few. Body-tracking enables to automatically determine a position of a user, either as a whole, or segmented by limbs, hence enabling automated position recognition and supervision.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, by determining the relative positions and orientations of a user's limbs and/or body segments (e.g. legs, arms, forearms, head, torso, etc), the correct realization or reproduction of a physical exercise entailing the carrying out of one or more movements can be automatically assessed. This enables the user, his/her fitness instructor or even his/her therapist to detect and possibly prevent harmful positions or movements that may result in injuries. Accurate, detailed and real-time posture and movement information is hence highly sought after in order to provide an efficient monitoring.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Body-tracking technologies can be roughly divided into two groups: those relying on wearable sensors attached to the user, and those relying on external information capture means, such as video cameras. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,165,844 B2 discloses a motion-tracking system providing 3D position and orientation information of a plurality of body segments. For this purpose the motion-tracking system comprises a plurality of wearable sensors that capture inertial information and, optionally, also magnetic field information. The information gathered from the plurality of wearable sensors is gathered at a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) or other form of programmable hardware, and processed through Kalman filters.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another wearable sensor example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,811,333 B2 discloses a technique that captures time-resolved signals associated with the movements of a device attached to a limb. The captured signals are processed through autoregressive filters, and compared to stored data sets that characterize limb-motion events and/or phases. Time-resolved signals may be captured, for example, through accelerometers measuring displacements in three orthogonal planes. The captured information, and its comparison with the stored data sets, is preferably applied to control prosthetics or orthotic joints.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Regarding solutions based on external data capture, U.S. Pat. No. 6,831,603 B2 discloses a motion tracking technique where beacon signals are periodically transmitted from a reference tag and from object tags attached to the user or user's limbs being tracked. Beacon signals are received at an array of sensors installed in several positions of the zone under analysis. By measuring and comparing an identification code, a code phase and a carrier phase in each beacon signal, the relative position between the emitting tag and each sensor is determined for each sampling instant.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,395,181 B2 discloses a motion tracking system where a first estimate of the position and/or orientation of the user is performed through inertial measurements. This first estimate is then updated through an auxiliary technique, such as acoustic ranging, in order to enhance the system accuracy.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Finally, U.S. Pat. No. 7,840,031 B2 discloses an example of body-tracking technique based on three-dimensional (3D) images captured by one or more cameras aimed at the body of a user. A first 3D movement captured by the camera is used to predict a movement baseline, which is later compared to a second 3D movement in order to track changes in a range of body movement.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Regardless of the particular technique used for position and/or orientation acquisition, it is then necessary to process the acquired data in order to determine the user's posture and the movements the user makes. When this posture and movement determination are to be used for gaining knowledge of how the user moves and is positioned, a particularly challenging problem is recognizing a plethora of incorrect positions that may result in injury. In some cases, these incorrect positions are caused by subtle changes or small movements, hampering their detection. In other cases, the limbs causing the incorrect positions are not the ones performing the main movement (e.g. a faulty leg position in an arm exercise), thereby increasing the difficulty of properly detecting a possible harmful position and/or movement. Furthermore, it would be desirable that once the realization or reproduction of movement is determined to be within or outside of a predetermined range, that such information regarding the realization or reproduction of movement is provided so that the user, the fitness instructor or the therapist may know and take a measure if necessary.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, there is still the need in the state of the art of a technique for assessing how physical movements are carried out in a real-time manner, with a high accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, it is desirable that said technique is straightforwardly scalable to a numerous set of exercises and/or movements. Finally, in case a wrong movement or position is detected, it is desirable that the technique makes possible to provide information indicating the same.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A first aspect of the invention relates to a method for determining a correct reproduction of a movement of a target based on a plurality of orientations thereof at different time instants, the different time instants at least including first and second time instants, the second time instant being posterior to the first time instant, the movement being defined by at least a first predetermined constraint, the first predetermined constraint being defined for first and second orientations of the plurality of orientations and defined by a start angle, an end angle and a first plane definition, the method comprising: providing a first plane and a second plane, each defined by the first plane definition, corresponding to the first and second time instants, respectively; providing a first pair of vectors by projecting the first orientation and the second orientation, corresponding to the first time instant, onto the first plane; providing a second pair of vectors by projecting the first orientation and the second orientation, corresponding to the second time instant, onto the second plane; computing first and second angles between the pair of vectors of the first and second pairs of vectors, respectively; and determining the correct reproduction of the movement if: the first angle is equal to or less than the start angle, and the second angle is equal to or greater than the end angle.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The method makes possible to evaluate and, thus, determine whether a movement is correctly reproduced by processing the plurality of orientations that represent the movement that something or someone may be carrying out. The movement is considered to be reproduced correctly if each predetermined constraint defining the movement is fulfilled by the movement carried out by the target as determined by the plurality of orientations at the different time instants.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Each orientation represents how a segment or part of a target (e.g. an object, a person, etc.) is oriented. With pairs of orientations it may be established how the segments or parts are angularly moving one relative to the other. Each orientation of the plurality of orientations uses or is referenced to a same global reference frame (i.e. the orientations use a same coordinate system with same reference points). Preferably, each orientation of the plurality of orientations is a three-dimensional vector. Preferably, both vectors of each pair of vectors are three-dimensional vectors or two-dimensional vectors.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first predetermined constraint and, possibly, additional or even each predetermined constraint has associated therewith a pair of orientations, a set of angles and a plane definition. The plane definition establishes what plane is provided, for each time instant, onto which the pairs of orientations are projected so as to determine whether the angular movement determined from the pair of orientations fulfills the condition(s) of the predetermined constraint. Accordingly, the set of angles of the first predetermined constraint comprises a start angle and an end angle that define the range of the movement, that is, from which angle (i.e. start angle) up to which angle (i.e. end angle) the movement is defined that the target has to carry out. The computed angles corresponding to different time instants are compared with said start and end angles in order to establish whether the movement has been correctly reproduced by the target.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the movements are defined by more than one predetermined constraint. Each predetermined constraint limits more the movement against which the movement (of the target) resulting from the plurality of orientations and, optionally, one or more accelerations (at the different time instants) is to be compared. Hence, further computed angles or acceleration measurements (the latter provided by motion tracking means) are to be compared so as to determine whether the predetermined constraints are fulfilled and, thus, the movement is correctly reproduced. Mainly, the first predetermined constraint defines the motion range of the movement, whereas additional predetermined constraints (e.g. second, third, fourth predetermined constraints, etc.) define further limitations that shall be complied with by the target when carrying out the entire motion range of the movement.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the movement is further defined by a second predetermined constraint, the second predetermined constraint being defined for third and fourth orientations of the plurality of orientations and defined by a first angular range and a second plane definition. In these embodiments, the method further comprises: providing a third plane, defined by the second plane definition, corresponding to the second time instant; providing a third pair of vectors by projecting the third orientation and fourth second orientation, corresponding to the second time instant, onto the third plane; and computing a third angle between the pair of vectors of the third pair of vectors. Further, determining the correct reproduction of the movement comprises that the third angle is within the first angular range. That is to say, that the third angle is equal to or greater than a lower threshold (i.e. lower angle) of the angular range and equal to or less than an upper threshold (i.e. upper angle) of the angular range.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The movement limitations resulting from the second predetermined constraint and/or additional predetermined constraints may relate to the movement of parts of the target different than those that should reproduce the movement as defined by the first predetermined constraint. Accordingly, said second and/or additional predetermined constraints are defined for orientations such that one or both of them are/is different from the first orientation and/or the second orientation.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the movement is further defined by a second predetermined constraint, the second predetermined constraint being defined for the first and second orientations and defined by a first angular range and a second plane definition. In these embodiments, the method further comprises: providing a third plane, defined by the second plane definition, corresponding to the second time instant; providing a third pair of vectors by projecting the first orientation and the second orientation, corresponding to the second time instant, onto the third plane; and computing a third angle between the pair of vectors of the third pair of vectors. Further, determining the correct reproduction of the movement comprises that the third angle is within the first angular range.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The movement limitations resulting from the second predetermined constraint and/or additional predetermined constraints may relate to the movement of parts of the target that are the same as those that should reproduce the movement as defined by the first predetermined constraint. Accordingly, said second and/or additional predetermined constraints are/is defined for the first orientation and/or the second orientation.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the method further comprises: providing a fourth plane, defined by the second plane definition, corresponding to the first time instant; providing a fourth pair of vectors by projecting each orientation for which the second predetermined constraint is defined (e.g. the first and second orientations, the third and fourth orientations, etc.), corresponding to the first time instant, onto the fourth plane; and computing a fourth angle between the pair of vectors of the fourth pair of vectors. In these embodiments, determining the correct reproduction of the movement further comprises that the fourth angle is within the first angular range.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Determining that a user has started to reproduce a movement may also depend on whether the second predetermined constraint and/or any additional predetermined constraints are/is fulfilled at the first time instant.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the movement is further defined by additional predetermined constraints (e.g. third predetermined constraint, fourth predetermined constraint, etc.).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">By way of example, the movement is further defined by a third predetermined constraint, the third predetermined constraint being defined for fifth and sixth orientations of the plurality of orientations and defined by a second angular range and a third plane definition. Further, the method comprises: providing a fourth plane, defined by the third plane definition, corresponding to the second time instant; providing a fourth pair of vectors by projecting the fifth orientation and the sixth orientation, corresponding to the second time instant, onto the fourth plane; and computing a fourth angle between the pair of vectors of the fourth pair of vectors. Further, determining the correct reproduction of the movement comprises that the fourth angle is within the second angular range. Additionally, the method may also comprise: providing a fifth plane, defined by the third plane definition, corresponding to the first time instant; providing a fifth pair of vectors by projecting the fifth orientation and the sixth orientation, corresponding to the first time instant, onto the fifth plane; computing a fifth angle between the pair of vectors of the fifth pair of vectors; and determining the correct reproduction of the movement comprises that the fifth angle is within the second angular range.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">By way of another example, the movement is further defined by a third or fourth predetermined constraint, the third or fourth predetermined constraint being defined for third and fourth orientations of the plurality of orientations and defined by a second angular range and a third plane definition. Further, the method comprises: providing a fourth plane, defined by the third plane definition, corresponding to the second time instant; providing a fourth pair of vectors by projecting the third orientation and the fourth orientation, corresponding to the second time instant, onto the fourth plane; and computing a fourth angle between the pair of vectors of the fourth pair of vectors. Further, determining the correct reproduction of the movement comprises that the fourth angle is within the second angular range. Additionally, the method may also comprise: providing a fifth plane, defined by the third plane definition, corresponding to the first time instant; providing a fifth pair of vectors by projecting the third orientation and the fourth orientation, corresponding to the first time instant, onto the fifth plane; computing a fifth angle between the pair of vectors of the fifth pair of vectors; and determining the correct reproduction of the movement comprises that the fifth angle is within the second angular range.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the different time instants further include a third time instant, the third time instant being posterior to the first time instant and anterior to the second time instant.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the method further comprises: providing a fourth plane, defined by the first plane definition, corresponding to the third time instant; providing a fourth pair of vectors by projecting the first orientation and the second orientation, corresponding to the third time instant, onto the fourth plane; computing a fourth angle between the pair of vectors of the fourth pair of vectors; and determining the correct reproduction of the movement further comprises that the fourth angle is greater than the start angle and less than the end angle. In some of these embodiments, the method further comprises: providing a fifth plane, defined by the second plane definition, corresponding to the third time instant; providing a fifth pair of vectors by projecting each orientation for which the second predetermined constraint is defined (e.g. the first and second orientations, or the third and fourth orientations, etc.), corresponding to the third time instant, onto the fifth plane; computing a fifth angle between the pair of vectors of the fifth pair of vectors; and determining the correct reproduction of the movement further comprises that the fifth angle is within the first angular range.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">When the plurality of orientations of the target is provided for more time instants, determining the correct reproduction of the movement involves comparing that the corresponding computed angles fall within the motion range of the movement as defined by the start and end angles, or that the computed angles fall within the corresponding angular ranges.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the different time instants further include time instants posterior to the first time instant and anterior to the second time instant. For example, the different time instants further include a fourth time instant, the fourth time instant being posterior to the first time instant and anterior to the second time instant, and the fourth time instant being anterior or posterior to the third time instant.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the method further comprises: providing a fifth plane, defined by the first plane definition, corresponding to the fourth time instant; providing a fifth pair of vectors by projecting the first orientation and the second orientation, corresponding to the fourth time instant, onto the fifth plane; and computing a fifth angle between the pair of vectors of the fifth pair of vectors; and determining the correct reproduction of the movement further comprises that the fifth angle is greater than the start angle and less than the end angle.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the plurality of orientations of the target is provided for more time instants (e.g. fourth, fifth, sixth time instants, etc.), determining the correct reproduction of the movement involves comparing that the corresponding computed angles (of the second, third, fourth, etc. predetermined constraints) corresponding to said time instants fall within the corresponding angular ranges.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the plane definition of each predetermined constraint (having a plane definition) of the movement comprises: an orientation of the plurality of orientations, said orientation defining a normal vector of the plane for each of the different time instants, and said orientation being different from the pair of orientations for which the predetermined constraint is defined; or a plane that is constant for the different time instants.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The plane definition may relate to an orientation of the plurality of orientations of the target. In this sense, determining whether the movement that the target carries out is reproduced correctly depends upon orientations of the target. Particularly, even though each predetermined constraint is defined for a pair of orientations that will be assessed in order to establish whether they fulfill the constraint (i.e. start and end angles, or angular range), an orientation of the target may influence said fulfillment. For example, when the target is a person and the pair of orientations of a predetermined constraint relate to the upper arm and the torso, respectively, the relative angular movement between the two may be based on a plane determined by the orientation of the upper arm or the torso.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As the target performs the movement, the orientation of the plane definition may change, thus the plane onto which the orientations corresponding to different time instants are projected may change as well.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The plane definition may also relate to a constant plane, for instance but without limitation, the horizontal or a vertical plane.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some examples, the plane definition of one or more predetermined constraints is an orientation of the target and the plane definition of remaining predetermined constraints is a plane that is constant for the different time instants.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples, one or more predetermined constraints are defined by a same plane definition.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the method determines the correct reproduction of the movement of the target further based on one or more accelerations thereof at the different time instants, the movement being further defined by a second (and/or further) predetermined constraint, the second predetermined constraint being defined for a first acceleration of the one or more accelerations and defined by a first acceleration interval, and a first direction. In these embodiments, the method further comprises: providing an acceleration value corresponding to each time instant (e.g. first and second acceleration values corresponding to the first and second time instants, first to sixth acceleration values corresponding to first to sixth time instants, etc.), based on both the first acceleration and the first direction. Further, determining the correct reproduction of the movement comprises that at least one of the acceleration values is within the first acceleration interval. That is to say, that one, some or all of the acceleration values provided is/are equal to or greater than a lower threshold (i.e. lower acceleration threshold) of the acceleration interval and equal to or less than an upper threshold (i.e. upper acceleration threshold) of the acceleration interval.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The movement limitations resulting from the second predetermined constraint and/or additional predetermined constraints may relate to the acceleration of one or more parts of the tracked target.

Therefore, if for example the target accelerates in one direction at the first time instant and stops at the second time instant, the first and second acceleration values will have opposite sign. The direction defined in the predetermined constraint may be, for example, an axis (e.g. a vertical axis, a horizontal axis, etc.), a three-dimensional vector, an angle, or a range of directions (in the form of axes, vectors or an angular range), any of which makes possible to establish in which direction the tracked target or part thereof is accelerating.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some of these embodiments, the second (and/or further) predetermined constraint is further defined by a percentage threshold and a window size. In these embodiments, the method further comprises providing a sliding window with size equal to the window size, and sliding the sliding window from the first time instant to the second time instant such that the sliding window includes the provided acceleration values without exceeding the window size. Further, determining the correct reproduction of the movement comprises that each time the sliding window includes as many acceleration values as the window size, at least a percentage of the acceleration values within the window size equal to the percentage threshold is within the first acceleration interval. That is to say, every time the sliding window is full of acceleration values, a percentage resulting from a number of acceleration values in the window falling within the first acceleration interval divided by the window size is equal to or greater than the percentage threshold.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">By applying the sliding window and the percentage threshold, the second (and/or further) predetermined constraint may limit in a greater or lesser degree the movement to be reproduced by the target since, in these cases, it may occur that at some time instants an acceleration value provided does not fall within the acceleration interval yet it is determined that the target correctly reproduced the movement.

In this exemplary method, the first predetermined constraint is considered to be the same of the example described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref>. Further, the second predetermined constraint is defined by an angular range (e.g. AR<sub>1</sub>, for instance from 30&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;) and a plane definition (e.g. P<sub>2</sub>) with which planes P<sub>2,1</sub>, P<sub>2,2</sub>, P<sub>2,3 </sub>and P<sub>2,4 </sub>are provided.

The angle &#x3b2;<sub>2 </sub>(corresponding to t<sub>2</sub>) is comprised in AR<sub>1</sub>, therefore the user (<b>20</b>) is complying with the second predetermined constraint while reproducing the movement. The angle &#x3b2;<sub>3 </sub>(corresponding to t<sub>3</sub>) is comprised in AR<sub>1</sub>, therefore the user (<b>20</b>) is complying with the second predetermined constraint while reproducing the movement. The angle &#x3b2;<sub>4 </sub>(corresponding to t<sub>4</sub>) is not comprised in AR<sub>1 </sub>(i.e. &#x3b2;<sub>4</sub>&#x2264;AR<sub>1,LOW </sub>or &#x3b2;<sub>4</sub>&#x2265;AR<sub>1,HIGH</sub>), therefore the user (<b>20</b>) is not complying with the second predetermined constraint while reproducing the movement.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0129">In this example, if only the orientations corresponding to time instants t<sub>1 </sub>and t<sub>2 </sub>were provided by motion tracking means, the method would determine that the user (<b>20</b>) correctly reproduced the movement since the first and second predetermined constraints are fulfilled (each of &#x3b1;<sub>1</sub>, &#x3b1;<sub>2</sub>, &#x3b2;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x3b2;<sub>2 </sub>complies with the conditions of the corresponding predetermined constraint). If the motion tracking means also provided the orientations of the user (<b>20</b>) corresponding to time instant t<sub>3</sub>, since the angle &#x3b2;<sub>3 </sub>is within AR<sub>1 </sub>(and SA<sub>1</sub>&#x3c;&#x3b1;<sub>3</sub>&#x3c;EA<sub>1</sub>), the method would also determine that the user (<b>20</b>) correctly reproduced the movement. In contrast, if the motion tracking means also provided the orientations of the user (<b>20</b>) corresponding to time instant t<sub>4</sub>, since the angle &#x3b2;<sub>4 </sub>is outside AR<sub>1 </sub>(and even though SA<sub>1</sub>&#x3c;&#x3b1;<sub>4</sub>&#x3c;EA<sub>1</sub>), the method would determine that the user (<b>20</b>) did not correctly reproduced the movement.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates determination of correct reproduction of a movement with a method according to an embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0131">The movement is defined by three predetermined constraints (i.e. PC<sub>1</sub>, PC<sub>2</sub>, PC<sub>3</sub>), each defined for a pair of orientations, and defined by a set of angles (SA<sub>1</sub>, EA<sub>1</sub>, AR<sub>1</sub>, AR<sub>2</sub>) and a plane definition. Motion tracking means provide orientations of a target in different time instants at least including time instants t<sub>1 </sub>to t<sub>5</sub>, each in a same global reference frame. Illustrated in the graph are the conditions that the computed angles (&#x3b1;, &#x3b2;, &#x3b3;) must fulfill for each of PC<sub>1 </sub>to PC<sub>3</sub>, for the different time instants, in order for the exemplary method to determine that the movement is correctly reproduced by the target.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0132">In this embodiment, if for example at one time instant taking place before t<sub>2 </sub>and after t<sub>1 </sub>one of the conditions of any predetermined constraint is not fulfilled, the method determines that the movement is not correctly reproduced and the method is restarted so as to evaluate a subsequent movement of the target. For example, if one of the conditions corresponding to t<sub>4 </sub>of PC<sub>1</sub>-PC<sub>3 </sub>is not fulfilled, the method does not further check whether the conditions corresponding to t<sub>5 </sub>and t<sub>2 </sub>of the predetermined constraints are fulfilled or not, but rather determines that the movement is not correctly reproduced and checks at a next time instant whether the condition of t<sub>1 </sub>is fulfilled or not for the subsequent movement to be reproduced by the target.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0133">In some examples, it may be determined that the target that was reproducing the movement did not carry out the entire motion of the movement as defined by the first predetermined constraint. Using for instance the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the computed angle(s) corresponding to the first predetermined constraint and to one or more consecutive time instants that are posterior to the first time instant t<sub>1 </sub>may be compared with the computed angle(s) corresponding to previous time instants so as to determine if the target stopped carrying out the movement halfway.
