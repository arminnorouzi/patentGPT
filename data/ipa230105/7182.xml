Application No. 10-2021-0085796 filed on Jun. 30, 2021 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to a method and system for providing intelligent control by using a radar security camera.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following information is presented as background information only to assist with an understanding of the present disclosure. No determination has been made, and no assertion is made, as to whether any of the above might be applicable as prior art with regard to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Over the past years, main roads or back road alleys have been increasingly monitored in real time by using closed-circuit television (CCTV) control systems, for the purpose of crime prevention or security maintenance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A CCTV control system includes a plurality of capturing units on roads or alleys, and a control server in a control center, which is connected to the capturing units and receives captured images from the capturing units in real time. An operator of the control center monitors images captured by each capturing unit or stores the images in the control server.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Each capturing unit includes a support and a CCTV camera provided on the support. The support is installed vertically on the ground, and the CCTV camera is installed on the support, facing downward and captures images of the surroundings downward from a high place.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The control server is connected to CCTV cameras by wired communication lines and loaded with a control program for managing images captured by the CCTV cameras and monitoring an abnormality in the capturing units. When a received image is abnormal or a captured image is not received due to a defect of a CCTV camera or a communication line, the control server determines that an abnormality has occurred in a capturing unit, that is, a support or a CCTV camera by using the control program, and outputs a warning to inform the operator that an abnormality has occurred.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Recently, video security systems have been used to improve the security and stability of monitoring and control systems used in various industrial fields such as power, gas, oil, and facility security.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Most video security systems are constructed and operated separately from monitoring and control systems, and operators mainly monitor the video security systems manually. Therefore, upon occurrence of an accident, it is difficult to immediately respond to the accident and manage and utilize the video security systems, thereby lowering their utilization.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For general security, security lights and CCTVs should be installed. Particularly, at least three CCTVs should be installed to shoot 360&#xb0; images. Alternatively, a security light and a 360&#xb0; camera may be installed. However, a short sensing distance inherent to the nature of the 360&#xb0; camera leads to a very narrow shooting range.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">When only a CCTV or a 360&#xb0; camera is installed, an image may be captured only within a predetermined range for the installation location. When an image processing apparatus is installed together with a CCTV or a 360&#xb0; camera, image processing requires high cost and a long processing time. Moreover, shooting at night is impossible and does not allow image processing.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">To cover a 360&#xb0; range with a conventional security camera for crime prevention, a total of five cameras including four fixed cameras and one speed dome camera should be used. The speed dome camera is operated in such a way that an operator manually pans, tilts, and zooms the camera to monitor an abnormal condition.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In other words, the conventional security camera for crime prevention causes budget waste and has limitations in controlling practically all images because about 500 cameras per person on average are controlled in the country. For example, in Goyang City, a service cost of one billion won is invested for control every year, and if the central government's policy of conversion of non-regular employment into regular employment is implemented under the premise that the current personnel are maintained, the budget should be increased by at least 1.5 times after <b>2018</b>. Therefore, the financial burden of local governments increases.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Provided are a method and system for providing intelligent control by using a radar security camera, which detect a target through 360&#xb0;
