The entire disclosure of the above application is incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to helmets (such as motorcycle helmets, bicycle helmets, snowboarding helmets and the like), and more particularly to impact absorbing components for helmets</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This section provides background information related to the present disclosure which is not necessarily prior art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Helmets are made from a tough outer shell, for example, carbon fiber, polycarbonate or fiberglass. Within the outer shell (i.e., inside a void defined by the generally spherical shape of the outer shell), a thick layer of an impact absorbing material is typically provided (often expanded polystyrene (EPS)). Normally provided with the impact absorbing layer is a fabric liner, which may include padding for comfort, and often this interchangeable or comprises adjustable parts to help ensure a good fit of the helmet on a range of sizes and shapes of a wearer's head.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A full-face helmet includes a face shield, below the visor, to protect the lower part of the wearer's face and chin. Not only does this provide protection in an accident, but also in normal riding conditions protects the wearer's face from, for example, wind, cold, rain and stone chips (which may be projected from a vehicle in front and may hit the rider at high speed).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In different helmet designs, the face shield may be integral with the rest of the helmet or may be a separate component. Where it is provided as a separate component it may be removable, in effect to provide the option of using the helmet as an &#x201c;open face&#x201d; helmet, without the face shield, or may be movable to temporarily move it out of the way, for example when stopped and talking to somebody. In this specification &#x201c;face shield&#x201d; refers to the part of the helmet which protects the lower part of the wearer's face as described, whether or not it is a separate and/or removable component. The face shield, like the rest of the helmet, includes a hard outer shell, an impact absorbing (typically EPS) layer and an inner liner.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Because of the shape of the human skull face, the impact absorbing layer is typically made from multiple&#x2014;usually at least three&#x2014;separate impact absorbing (e.g., EPS) parts. These parts have to be accurately assembled into the shell and then held in place while the helmet is fully assembled. To ensure high quality and reproducibility in this manufacturing step is one of the more difficult problems in helmet manufacturing.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided an impact absorbing component for a helmet, the impact absorbing component being shaped to provide protection for at least a portion of a human skull. The impact absorbing component comprises: a shaping layer of polymer-based material; and a plurality of impact absorbing parts attached to respective portions of a surface of the shaping layer such that the plurality of impact absorbing parts are held by the shaping layer in a predetermined relative arrangement.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Proposed is a concept of providing an impact absorbing component that may be easily installed/assembled in a rigid helmet shell. In this way, a plurality of impact absorbing parts may be held in a desired relative arrangement as a pre-fabricated sub-component of a helmet. Such a sub-component may therefore be pre-assembled or pre-fabricated so that the plurality of impact absorbing parts meet predetermined/desired shape, sizing and/or positioning requirements for a helmet. The sub-component may then be subsequently located, fixed, and assembled inside a rigid helmet shell whilst ensuring that a predetermined relative arrangement of impact absorbing parts is obtained.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Through the use of a proposed impact absorbing component, a process of manufacturing a helmet may be substantially simplified (e.g., because only the impact absorbing component needs to be correctly located, fixed, and assembled inside the rigid helmet shell). As a result, helmets may be manufactured more easily using one or more proposed impact absorbing components, whilst ensuring that the impact absorbing parts are correctly and accurately assembled.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The impact absorbing parts may, for example, be made of expanded polystyrene (EPS), or a similar material.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The polymer-based material may be flexible so as to permit bending of the shaping layer for moving the plurality of impact absorbing parts relative to each other. For example, the polymer-based material may comprise a flexible grade of polyurethane (PU).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the shaping layer may comprise a hinge portion adapted to permit folding of the shaping layer so as to move the impact absorbing parts to a second configuration different from the first configuration.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an exemplary proposal, the impact absorbing parts may be overmolded with the polymer-based material. The overmolding may include flexible sections/parts of the polymer-based material, positioned between the impact absorbing parts and connecting the impact absorbing parts together via the overmolding, which form live hinges. For instance, a thinned-down part of the overmolding between the impact absorbing parts may provide a hinge about which the overmolded impact absorbing component may be flexed.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The plurality of impact absorbing parts may comprise first, second and third impact absorbing parts. Further, the shaping layer may then comprise: a first hinge portion between the first and second impact absorbing parts and adapted to permit folding of the shaping layer so as to move the first and second impact absorbing parts relative to each other; and a second hinge portion between the second and third impact absorbing parts and adapted to permit folding of the shaping layer so as to move the second and third impact absorbing parts relative to each other. In this way, the impact absorbing component may be made in a relatively shallow mold tool as one part, and after the polymer-based material is set or cured, bent into the correct/desired shape for the impact absorbing component. The impact absorbing component may then be assembled into a helmet.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the predetermined relative arrangement, the impact absorbing parts may be spaced apart by a distance in the range of 5 mm to 100 mm, and preferably in the range of 5 mm to 25 mm.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">For example, the predetermined relative arrangement may be adapted so that the plurality of impact absorbing components are configured to substantially align with two separate portions of a human skull.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a helmet (e.g., bicycle helmet, motor helmet, snowboarding helmet, or the like) comprising: a rigid outer shell; and an impact absorbing component according to a proposed embodiment provided within the rigid outer shell.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing an impact absorbing component for a helmet, the impact absorbing component being shaped to provide protection for at least a portion of a human skull. The method comprises: obtaining a shaping layer of polymer-based material; and attaching a plurality of impact absorbing parts to respective portions of a surface of the shaping layer such that the plurality of impact absorbing parts are held by the shaping layer in a predetermined relative arrangement.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For example, attaching the plurality of impact absorbing parts to respective portions of a surface of the shaping layer may comprise: overmolding the plurality of impact absorbing parts with the shaping layer of polymer-based material to form a single impact absorbing component.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to one or more proposed concepts there may be provided a method of manufacturing an impact absorbing component for a helmet, such as a motorcycle or snowboarding helmet, comprising the steps of: providing a plurality of impact absorbing parts; overmolding the plurality of impact absorbing parts to create a single impact absorbing component. The impact absorbing component may then be assembled into a rigid outer shell.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thus, according to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a helmet comprising: manufacturing an impact absorbing component for a helmet according to a proposed embodiment; and fixing (i.e., assembling) the impact absorbing component within a rigid outer shell.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">By way of example, the impact absorbing component may be adapted to form a face shield component. This may then be assembled into a helmet to form the impact absorbing layer in the face shield part of the helmet. In different types of helmets, the face shield part of the helmet may be a distinct, possibly removable, face shield, or may be integral with the rest of the helmet.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For instance, the face shield component may be the whole of a lower front section of the helmet, curving around not only the front of the face but substantially around the sides of the face. As such, the face shield component may be substantially Li-shaped. Such a part, if molded in one part, would require a very large and expensive mold tool. Indeed, this not even be possible/practical to mold in one part in the finished form. Embodiments may therefore provide a component with flexibility and/or live hinges which provide a significant manufacturing advantage.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The impact absorbing parts may include a first distal impact absorbing part disposed at one extreme end of the impact absorbing component, and a second distal impact absorbing part. A tongue may be provided extending away from the component, on each of the distal impact absorbing parts.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Thus, an impact absorbing component according to a proposed embodiment may include interlocking formations for positioning and interlocking the component relative to other parts of a helmet. For instance, the interlocking formations may interlock with other parts of a helmet. For example, extreme ends of an impact absorbing face shield component, which when positioned in a helmet are disposed towards the back of the sides of the lower part of the helmet, may be provided with interlocking formations which interface with part of the impact absorbing layer of the helmet which protects the back and the back sides of the wearer's head.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For a better understanding of the present invention, and to show more clearly how it may be carried into effect, reference will now be made by way of example only to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an overmolded face shield component of a motorcycle helmet according to an embodiment, in a relatively flat condition as it would come out of an overmolding tool;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of the overmolded face shield component of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, repositioned into its operational shape for use as part of a motorcycle helmet;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of a motorcycle helmet, with certain parts shown translucent so that the face shield component within the outer shell is visible;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>is a perspective view of the impact absorbing layer of the motorcycle helmet of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>is a cross-section through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>, as indicated by line B-B on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an exploded view of the impact absorbing layer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref><i>a. </i></p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The invention will be described with reference to the Figures.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating exemplary embodiments of the apparatus, systems and methods, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

In this embodiment, the impact absorbing component is a face shield component for a helmet.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the overmolded face shield component is indicated generally at <b>10</b>. The face shield component <b>10</b> forms part of the impact absorbing layer, inside the rigid outer shell, of a helmet. In particular, the face shield component is part of the impact absorbing layer which protects the lower part of the wearer's face (below the eyes) and chin. The protection is provided around the front and sides of the wearer's lower face and chin.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this embodiment the helmet is a &#x201c;full face&#x201d; motorcycle helmet in which the face shield is entirely integral with the rest of the helmet&#x2014;i.e., the face shield is not removable or movable by the user. However, it will be understood that, in other embodiments, the full-face helmet may be another type of helmet, such as a snowboarding helmet for example.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The face shield component includes three impact absorbing parts <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. The impact absorbing parts are made from expanded polystyrene (EPS). A front impact absorbing part <b>12</b> protects the front of the lower face and chin, and two side impact absorbing parts <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> protect the sides of the wearer's jaw. As is seen more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the impact absorbing parts <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are positioned with small gaps between them. For example, the gap between the impact absorbing parts may be around 10 mm wide, or in the range 5 mm-15 mm, or 5 mm-20 mm, or 5 mm-25 mm.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">To manufacture the face shield component <b>10</b> (i.e., impact absorbing component), the impact absorbing parts are placed in an overmolding tool. The arrangement of the parts <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> in the tool is substantially as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The overmolding material, for example polyurethane, is then injected into the tool and allowed to cure.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The tool is designed to produce live hinges <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. There is a live hinge in the part of the overmolding material which forms the join between the impact absorbing parts. Live hinge <b>18</b> is formed in the overmolding material in the join between the front impact absorbing part <b>12</b> and the first side impact absorbing part <b>14</b>, and live hinge <b>20</b> is formed in the overmolding material in the join between the front impact absorbing part <b>12</b> and the second side impact absorbing part <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the overmolding material has cured, the face shield component is flexed at the live hinges <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, into its final in-use shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The flexing of the part into this shape may take place prior to, or as part of, the assembly of the component into the shell of a helmet.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the face shield component <b>10</b> forms part of a motorcycle helmet <b>100</b>. The face shield component forms an impact absorbing layer, inside a tough outer shell of the helmet. Because the impact absorbing parts are fixed together by the overmolding material, to form a single part, positioning the face shield component correctly inside the outer shell is substantially simplified.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The helmet as a whole comprises a tough outer shell, made for example of polycarbonate, and an impact absorbing layer made of expanded polystyrene. The impact absorbing layer follows the shape of the outer shell and may be for example around 20 mm thick in parts. The face shield as described above forms a part of that impact absorbing layer, to protect the lower part of the front and sides of the wearer's face. Other parts of the wearer's head are protected by an impact absorbing layer which may be made by conventional techniques.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The face shield component may be fixed to other parts of the helmet by glue, hook and loop fastener, and by other means. In this embodiment, a felt tape is provided on the inside of two distal surfaces, indicated at <b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The distal surfaces <b>22</b> form surfaces of tongues, which extend from the sides of the face shield component, in a direction facing substantially towards the back of the helmet when assembled. The tongues are provided to fit in a groove or space between another part of the impact absorbing layer and the outer shell of the helmet, as explained in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Apertures, some of which are indicated at <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, are provided to receive fixings which retain poppers, which in turn fix to parts of an inner padded liner. Hook and loop fasteners may also be fixed to the component in various places, to removably attach to removable and replaceable pads (which may be available in various sizes to achieve the best fit) and to removably attach accessories such as microphones and speakers for use with a communications/audio system.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>and <b>5</b> show in more detail how the face shield component <b>10</b> interlocks with other parts to form a complete and substantially continuous impact absorbing layer. The impact absorbing layer, which is inside the outer shell but outside the lining, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>. The impact absorbing layer is made from expanded polystyrene (EPS). The impact absorbing layer is made from three parts&#x2014;the face shield component <b>10</b>, a surrounding part <b>26</b> and a cap <b>28</b>. The surrounding part <b>26</b> surrounds the back and sides of the wearer's head, and the front of the head as well above the eyes, i.e., around the forehead. The cap <b>28</b> protects the top of the wearer's head.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">At each distal end, the face shield component has a tongue <b>22</b>, which extends from an end of face shield component <b>10</b> in a direction towards the back of the helmet. As seen in the cross-section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>, the tongues <b>22</b> of the face shield component <b>10</b> are received in a groove or space between the outer shell of the helmet and the surrounding part <b>26</b>. In other words, there is an interfacing section of the impact absorbing layer of the helmet, where the face shield component <b>10</b> overlaps with the surrounding part <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The surface of the tongue <b>22</b> of the face shield component <b>10</b> may directly abut a corresponding surface of the surrounding part <b>26</b>. Both parts may be made from EPS and friction between the parts may be sufficient to prevent the parts from moving during assembly. In some embodiments, a material may be placed between the EPS parts at the interface. For example, felt pads may be stuck onto the surface of one or both of the interfacing parts.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the cap <b>28</b> may fit on top of the surrounding part <b>26</b>, having location grooves <b>30</b> and corresponding protrusions <b>32</b> to correctly locate the parts together during assembly.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Although the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref> is described primarily in terms of a motorcycle helmet, the inventive concepts disclosed may also be applied to other types of helmets, for example, to snowsports helmets.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Also, in some embodiments, the impact absorbing parts may not be overmolded but may instead be attached to a polymer-based shaping layer so that the impact absorbing parts are held (by the shaping layer) in a predetermined relative arrangement. For instance, in some embodiments, the impact absorbing parts may be glued (or otherwise adhered) to the polymer-based shaping layer, and one or more hinges may be formed in the shaping layer to help/facilitate bending of the shaping layer (with the impact absorbing parts thereon). In other instances, the impact absorbing parts may be (releasably) attached to the polymer-based shaping layer (e.g., via a snap-fit mechanism, interference fit, hook and loop fastening, magnetic fit, or other attachment arrangement).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Also, in some polymer-based shaping layer preferably has impact absorbing properties of its own and may thus help to further enhance the protection provided by the helmet in use.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Purely by way of further example, in some embodiments, three impact absorbing parts may be provided. They may then be overmolded with an overmolding material to join the impact absorbing parts together and to form a single overmolded part (i.e., an impact absorbing component), wherein the overmolding material bonds to the impact absorbing parts, and thus connects the impact absorbing parts together. The impact absorbing component may include live hinges, of the overmolding material, between the impact absorbing parts. Thus, there may be two live hinges. In this way, the overmolding tool is relatively flat/shallow (in depth), and after the overmolding material has set or cured, the single overmolded part may be bent at the live hinges into a substantially curved or bent component. The impact absorbing component may then be bent prior to, or during, assembly into the shell of a helmet.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The impact absorbing component may include interlocking formations for positioning and interlocking to other parts of a helmet. In particular, the interlocking formations may interlock with other parts of the impact absorbing layer of a helmet. For example, extreme ends of the impact absorbing component may be provided with interlocking formations which interface with part of the impact absorbing layer of the helmet.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Preferably, the interlocking formations are in the form of tongues which interlock with grooves provided in other impact absorbing parts.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Alternatively, a groove may be provided between the other impact absorbing parts and the outer shell of the helmet. In other words, the other impact absorbing parts may have a thinned section, so that there is a space between the outer shell of the helmet and the impact absorbing part, at a periphery of the impact absorbing part. This space may receive the tongue of the impact absorbing component. Where the tongue of the impact absorbing component is received into that space, the two impact absorbing parts are essentially overlapping, together substantially filling the space between the outer shell of the helmet and the lining. In an overlapping section, one of the two impact absorbing parts (for example the impact absorbing component) is adjacent the outer shell, and the other impact absorbing part is adjacent the inner lining.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As an alternative, grooves may be provided in the impact absorbing component for interlocking with tongues extending from other impact absorbing parts.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The interlocking formations, for example, grooves and/or tongues, are preferably provided as part of the impact absorbing parts of the impact absorbing component. However, in some embodiments, some interlocking formations, or some parts of interlocking formations, may be made from the overmolding material.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Where the interlocking formations are provided on the impact absorbing parts, for example made from EPS, a covering may be provided on the tongues. For example, the tongues may be covered with felt. This provides for a tight fit between the EPS components, and ensures that they do not move with respect to each other in use.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">By providing interlocking formations as described, a more robust and unified impact absorbing layer is provided, providing enhanced protection to a wearer. By providing an impact absorbing component as a single part, and using interlocking formations to keep it in place in relation to other parts of the impact absorbing layer, a durable and safe helmet is produced. For instance, the impact absorbing component may be adapted to form an impact absorbing face shield component than can be releasably attached to the rest of a helmet. In other examples, the impact absorbing component may be adapted to form a top/upper component of a helmet that can be releasably attached to the bottom/lower and/or side component of the helmet.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The embodiments described above are provided by way of example only, and various changes and modifications will be apparent to persons skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
