level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the related art, a vibration actuator as a vibration generation source is mounted in electronic apparatuses having vibration functions. By driving the vibration actuator so as to transmit the vibration to the user to make the user feel it, the electronic apparatus can provide stimulation, provide notification of incoming call, and improve sense of operation and realism. The electronic apparatus is mainly hand-carry electrical devices, including controllers (gamepads) of game machines, portable communication terminals such as smartphones, and portable information terminals such as tablet PCs. The vibration actuator may also be implemented in wearable devices worn on clothes, arms, etc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a vibration actuator with a structure that can be miniaturized and mounted in a mobile apparatus, a vibration actuator used for a pager, for example, is known, as shown in PTL 1.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this vibration actuator, a pair of plate-shaped elastic bodies are arranged so that they face each other and are each supported by the opening edge of a cylindrical frame. In addition, the vibration actuator has a yoke with a magnet attached to the raised center portion of one of the spiral-shaped plate elastic bodies of the pair of plate elastic bodies, and the yoke is supported within the frame.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The yoke, together with a magnet, constitutes a circular magnetic field generator, and a coil is positioned within the magnetic field of this magnetic field generator with the coil attached to the other plate elastic body. When a current of different frequency is given to the coil through an oscillation circuit in a switched manner, the pair of plate elastic bodies are selectively resonated to generate vibration, and the yoke vibrates in the centerline direction of the frame body within the frame body.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="2">PTL 1</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Japanese Patent Publication No. 3748637</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">By the way, it is desired that vibration actuators as vibration generators be downsized while maintaining high output, as the products in which they are mounted become smaller and smaller. In PTL 1, inside the frame as the fixing body, the yoke as the movable body is supported from one side of the vibration direction through the plate-shaped elastic body, and the coil disposed on the other side is disposed in the recess of the yoke so as to face the magnet in the radial direction.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, when the actuator is miniaturized, the assembly work is complicated and time-consuming, and the vibration output of the vibration actuator is also a problem.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to obtain a suitable vibration output in a miniaturized vibration actuator, it is desired that the movable body be accurately formed to vibrate in a set vibration direction and its mass be easily adjusted to ensure the desired vibration output.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to provide a vibration actuator and an electric apparatus that can be manufactured with high dimensional accuracy and can be driven with a suitable vibration output while achieving downsizing.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">To achieve the above-mentioned object, a vibration actuator of an embodiment of the present invention includes: a movable body including a magnet having a circular plate shape, wherein a pair of annular yokes including an opening at a center and a pair of weight parts including a through hole that is contiguous with the opening in an axial direction are stacked on a front surface and a rear surface of the magnet in the axis direction, and another end portion of a connecting part that connects a pair of elastic support parts on one end portion side is disposed in the opening and the through hole that are contiguous with each other; and a fixing body including a cylindrical part configured to house the movable body, wherein with the pair of elastic support parts, the movable body is supported so as to be allowed to vibrate back and forth in the axial direction, and a pair of annular coils disposed radially outside the movable body is provided.
