The sealed systems generally include a compressor that generates compressed refrigerant during operation of the sealed system. The compressed refrigerant flows to an evaporator where heat exchange between the chilled chambers and the refrigerant cools the chilled chambers and food items located therein. Recently, certain refrigerator appliances have included reciprocating compressors, such as linear compressors, for compressing refrigerant. Linear compressors generally include a piston and a driving coil. The driving coil generates a force for sliding the piston forward and backward within a chamber. During motion of the piston within the chamber, the piston compresses refrigerant.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Reciprocating compressors typically include a one-way valve that permits a flow of gas into a compression chamber as the piston moves into a retracted position during an intake stroke and prevents the gas from escaping the compression chamber as the piston moves into an extended position during a compression stroke. For example, the valve may include a flapper valve mounted to a compression face of the piston. The flapper valve may be thin enough to bend under the force of gas pressure from an intake conduit. Notably, the constant opening and closing of the suction valve can generate significant noise. Conventional reciprocating compressors may include mufflers to reduce noise from suction valve pulsation, but these mufflers are complicated to install, may be ineffective at reducing noise, and can harm compressor efficiency.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, a reciprocating compressor with features for improved noise reduction would be desirable. More particularly, a reciprocating compressor with a suction muffler that is easy to install and effectively reduces compressor noise without harming compressor performance would be particularly beneficial.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be apparent from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one exemplary embodiment, a reciprocating compressor defining an axial direction and a radial direction is provided. The reciprocating compressor includes a cylindrical casing defining a compression chamber, a piston positioned within the compression chamber and being movable along the axial direction, the piston defining a suction port for receiving a flow of gas, a flex mount mechanically coupled to the piston, the flex mount having an inner surface that defines a suction cavity, and a suction muffler positioned at least partially within the suction cavity of the flex mount. The suction muffler includes an inlet tube extending along the axial direction within the suction cavity and defining an inlet passageway configured to receive the flow of gas and a plurality of chamber plates that extend along the radial direction from an outer surface of the inlet tube, the plurality of chamber plates and the flex mount defining a plurality of resonance chambers.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another exemplary embodiment, a suction muffler for a reciprocating compressor is provided. The reciprocating compressor defines an axial direction and a radial direction, the reciprocating compressor including a piston positioned within a compression chamber, a flex mount mechanically coupled to a piston and having an inner surface that defines a suction cavity and a locking flange that extends from the inner surface of the flex mount toward the suction muffler along the radial direction. The suction muffler includes an inlet tube extending along the axial direction within the suction cavity and defining an inlet passageway configured to receive a flow of gas, a plurality of chamber plates that extend along the radial direction from an outer surface of the inlet tube, the plurality of chamber plates and the flex mount defining a plurality of resonance chambers, and a latching feature that engages the locking flange to secure the suction muffler within the suction cavity.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims.

In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.

In at least some instances, the approximating language may correspond to the precision of an instrument for measuring the value. For example, the approximating language may refer to being within a 10 percent margin.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a refrigerator appliance <b>10</b> that incorporates a sealed refrigeration system <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). It should be appreciated that the term &#x201c;refrigerator appliance&#x201d; is used in a generic sense herein to encompass any manner of refrigeration appliance, such as a freezer, refrigerator/freezer combination, and any style or model of conventional refrigerator. In addition, it should be understood that the present subject matter is not limited to use in appliances. Thus, the present subject matter may be used for any other suitable purpose, such as vapor compression within air conditioning units or air compression within air compressors.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the illustrated example embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the refrigerator appliance <b>10</b> is depicted as an upright refrigerator having a cabinet or casing <b>12</b> that defines a number of internal chilled storage compartments. In particular, refrigerator appliance <b>10</b> includes upper fresh-food compartments <b>14</b> having doors <b>16</b> and lower freezer compartment <b>18</b> having upper drawer <b>20</b> and lower drawer <b>22</b>. The drawers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are &#x201c;pull-out&#x201d; drawers in that they can be manually moved into and out of the freezer compartment <b>18</b> on suitable slide mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic view of certain components of refrigerator appliance <b>10</b>, including a sealed refrigeration system <b>60</b> of refrigerator appliance <b>10</b>. A machinery compartment <b>62</b> contains components for executing a known vapor compression cycle for cooling air. The components include a compressor <b>64</b>, a condenser <b>66</b>, an expansion device <b>68</b>, and an evaporator <b>70</b> connected in series and charged with a refrigerant. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, refrigeration system <b>60</b> may include additional components, e.g., at least one additional evaporator, compressor, expansion device, and/or condenser. As an example, refrigeration system <b>60</b> may include two evaporators.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Within refrigeration system <b>60</b>, refrigerant flows into compressor <b>64</b>, which operates to increase the pressure of the refrigerant. This compression of the refrigerant raises its temperature, which is lowered by passing the refrigerant through condenser <b>66</b>. Within condenser <b>66</b>, heat exchange with ambient air takes place so as to cool the refrigerant. A fan <b>72</b> is used to pull air across condenser <b>66</b>, as illustrated by arrows A<sub>C</sub>, so as to provide forced convection for a more rapid and efficient heat exchange between the refrigerant within condenser <b>66</b> and the ambient air. Thus, as will be understood by those skilled in the art, increasing air flow across condenser <b>66</b> can, e.g., increase the efficiency of condenser <b>66</b> by improving cooling of the refrigerant contained therein.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">An expansion device <b>68</b> (e.g., a valve, capillary tube, or other restriction device) receives refrigerant from condenser <b>66</b>. From expansion device <b>68</b>, the refrigerant enters evaporator <b>70</b>. Upon exiting expansion device <b>68</b> and entering evaporator <b>70</b>, the refrigerant drops in pressure. Due to the pressure drop and/or phase change of the refrigerant, evaporator <b>70</b> is cool relative to compartments <b>14</b> and <b>18</b> of refrigerator appliance <b>10</b>. As such, cooled air is produced and refrigerates compartments <b>14</b> and <b>18</b> of refrigerator appliance <b>10</b>. Thus, evaporator <b>70</b> is a type of heat exchanger which transfers heat from air passing over evaporator <b>70</b> to refrigerant flowing through evaporator <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Collectively, the vapor compression cycle components in a refrigeration circuit, associated fans, and associated compartments are sometimes referred to as a sealed refrigeration system operable to force cold air through compartments <b>14</b>, <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The refrigeration system <b>60</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is provided by way of example only. Thus, it is within the scope of the present subject matter for other configurations of the refrigeration system to be used as well. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that terms such as &#x201c;refrigerant,&#x201d; &#x201c;gas,&#x201d; &#x201c;fluid,&#x201d; and the like are generally intended to refer to a motive fluid for facilitating the operation of refrigeration system <b>60</b>, and may include, fluid, liquid, gas, or any combination thereof in any state.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> through <b>7</b></figref>, a linear compressor <b>100</b> will be described according to exemplary embodiments of the present subject matter. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> provide perspective, section views of linear compressor <b>100</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> provides a perspective view of linear compressor <b>100</b> with a compressor shell or housing <b>102</b> removed for clarity, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> provide section views of linear compressor when a piston is in an extended and retracted position, respectively. It should be appreciated that linear compressor <b>100</b> is used herein only as an exemplary embodiment to facilitate the description of aspects of the present subject matter. Modifications and variations may be made to linear compressor <b>100</b> while remaining within the scope of the present subject matter. Indeed, aspects of the present subject matter are applicable to any suitable piston-actuated or reciprocating compressor.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As illustrated for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, housing <b>102</b> may include a lower portion or lower housing <b>104</b> and an upper portion or upper housing <b>106</b> which are joined together to form a substantially enclosed cavity <b>108</b> for housing various components of linear compressor <b>100</b>. Specifically, for example, cavity <b>108</b> may be a hermetic or air-tight shell that can house working components of linear compressor <b>100</b> and may hinder or prevent refrigerant from leaking or escaping from refrigeration system <b>60</b>. In addition, linear compressor <b>100</b> generally defines an axial direction A, a radial direction R, and a circumferential direction C. It should be appreciated that linear compressor <b>100</b> is described and illustrated herein only to describe aspects of the present subject matter. Variations and modifications to linear compressor <b>100</b> may be made while remaining within the scope of the present subject matter.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> through <b>7</b></figref>, various parts and working components of linear compressor <b>100</b> will be described according to an exemplary embodiment. As shown, linear compressor <b>100</b> includes a casing <b>110</b> that extends between a first end portion <b>112</b> and a second end portion <b>114</b>, e.g., along the axial direction A. Casing <b>110</b> includes a cylinder <b>117</b> that defines a chamber <b>118</b>. Cylinder <b>117</b> is positioned at or adjacent first end portion <b>112</b> of casing <b>110</b>. Chamber <b>118</b> extends longitudinally along the axial direction A. As discussed in greater detail below, linear compressor <b>100</b> is operable to increase a pressure of fluid within chamber <b>118</b> of linear compressor <b>100</b>. Linear compressor <b>100</b> may be used to compress any suitable fluid, such as refrigerant or air. In particular, linear compressor <b>100</b> may be used in a refrigerator appliance, such as refrigerator appliance <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in which linear compressor <b>100</b> may be used as compressor <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Linear compressor <b>100</b> includes a stator <b>120</b> of a motor that is mounted or secured to casing <b>110</b>. For example, stator <b>120</b> generally includes an outer back iron <b>122</b> and a driving coil <b>124</b> that extend about the circumferential direction C within casing <b>110</b>. Linear compressor <b>100</b> also includes one or more valves that permit refrigerant to enter and exit chamber <b>118</b> during operation of linear compressor <b>100</b>. For example, a discharge muffler <b>126</b> is positioned at an end of chamber <b>118</b> for regulating the flow of refrigerant out of chamber <b>118</b>, while a suction valve <b>128</b> (shown only in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>7</b></figref> for clarity) regulates flow of refrigerant into chamber <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A piston <b>130</b> with a piston head <b>132</b> is slidably received within chamber <b>118</b> of cylinder <b>117</b>. In particular, piston <b>130</b> is slidable along the axial direction A. During sliding of piston head <b>132</b> within chamber <b>118</b>, piston head <b>132</b> compresses refrigerant within chamber <b>118</b>. As an example, from a top dead center position (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), piston head <b>132</b> can slide within chamber <b>118</b> towards a bottom dead center position (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) along the axial direction A, i.e., an expansion stroke of piston head <b>132</b>. When piston head <b>132</b> reaches the bottom dead center position, piston head <b>132</b> changes directions and slides in chamber <b>118</b> back towards the top dead center position, i.e., a compression stroke of piston head <b>132</b>. It should be understood that linear compressor <b>100</b> may include an additional piston head and/or additional chambers at an opposite end of linear compressor <b>100</b>. Thus, linear compressor <b>100</b> may have multiple piston heads in alternative exemplary embodiments.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated, linear compressor <b>100</b> also includes a mover <b>140</b> which is generally driven by stator <b>120</b> for compressing refrigerant. Specifically, for example, mover <b>140</b> may include an inner back iron <b>142</b> positioned in stator <b>120</b> of the motor. In particular, outer back iron <b>122</b> and/or driving coil <b>124</b> may extend about inner back iron <b>142</b>, e.g., along the circumferential direction C. Inner back iron <b>142</b> also has an outer surface that faces towards outer back iron <b>122</b> and/or driving coil <b>124</b>. At least one driving magnet <b>144</b> is mounted to inner back iron <b>142</b>, e.g., at the outer surface of inner back iron <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Driving magnet <b>144</b> may face and/or be exposed to driving coil <b>124</b>. In particular, driving magnet <b>144</b> may be spaced apart from driving coil <b>124</b>, e.g., along the radial direction R by an air gap. Thus, the air gap may be defined between opposing surfaces of driving magnet <b>144</b> and driving coil <b>124</b>. Driving magnet <b>144</b> may also be mounted or fixed to inner back iron <b>142</b> such that an outer surface of driving magnet <b>144</b> is substantially flush with the outer surface of inner back iron <b>142</b>. Thus, driving magnet <b>144</b> may be inset within inner back iron <b>142</b>. In such a manner, the magnetic field from driving coil <b>124</b> may have to pass through only a single air gap between outer back iron <b>122</b> and inner back iron <b>142</b> during operation of linear compressor <b>100</b>, and linear compressor <b>100</b> may be more efficient relative to linear compressors with air gaps on both sides of a driving magnet.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, driving coil <b>124</b> extends about inner back iron <b>142</b>, e.g., along the circumferential direction C. In alternative example embodiments, inner back iron <b>142</b> may extend around driving coil <b>124</b> along the circumferential direction C. Driving coil <b>124</b> is operable to move the inner back iron <b>142</b> along the axial direction A during operation of driving coil <b>124</b>. As an example, a current may be induced within driving coil <b>124</b> by a current source (not shown) to generate a magnetic field that engages driving magnet <b>144</b> and urges piston <b>130</b> to move along the axial direction A in order to compress refrigerant within chamber <b>118</b> as described above and will be understood by those skilled in the art. In particular, the magnetic field of driving coil <b>124</b> may engage driving magnet <b>144</b> in order to move inner back iron <b>142</b> and piston head <b>132</b> along the axial direction A during operation of driving coil <b>124</b>. Thus, driving coil <b>124</b> may slide piston <b>130</b> between the top dead center position and the bottom dead center position, e.g., by moving inner back iron <b>142</b> along the axial direction A, during operation of driving coil <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Linear compressor <b>100</b> may include various components for permitting and/or regulating operation of linear compressor <b>100</b>. In particular, linear compressor <b>100</b> includes a controller (not shown) that is configured for regulating operation of linear compressor <b>100</b>. The controller is in, e.g., operative, communication with the motor, e.g., driving coil <b>124</b> of the motor. Thus, the controller may selectively activate driving coil <b>124</b>, e.g., by inducing current in driving coil <b>124</b>, in order to compress refrigerant with piston <b>130</b> as described above.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The controller includes memory and one or more processing devices such as microprocessors, CPUs or the like, such as general or special purpose microprocessors operable to execute programming instructions or micro-control code associated with operation of linear compressor <b>100</b>. The memory can represent random access memory such as DRAM, or read only memory such as ROM or FLASH. The processor executes programming instructions stored in the memory. The memory can be a separate component from the processor or can be included onboard within the processor. Alternatively, the controller may be constructed without using a microprocessor, e.g., using a combination of discrete analog and/or digital logic circuitry (such as switches, amplifiers, integrators, comparators, flip-flops, AND gates, and the like) to perform control functionality instead of relying upon software.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Inner back iron <b>142</b> further includes an outer cylinder <b>146</b> and an inner sleeve <b>148</b>. Outer cylinder <b>146</b> defines the outer surface of inner back iron <b>142</b> and also has an inner surface positioned opposite the outer surface of outer cylinder <b>146</b>. Inner sleeve <b>148</b> is positioned on or at inner surface of outer cylinder <b>146</b>. A first interference fit between outer cylinder <b>146</b> and inner sleeve <b>148</b> may couple or secure outer cylinder <b>146</b> and inner sleeve <b>148</b> together. In alternative exemplary embodiments, inner sleeve <b>148</b> may be welded, glued, fastened, or connected via any other suitable mechanism or method to outer cylinder <b>146</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Outer cylinder <b>146</b> may be constructed of or with any suitable material. For example, outer cylinder <b>146</b> may be constructed of or with a plurality of (e.g., ferromagnetic) laminations. The laminations are distributed along the circumferential direction C in order to form outer cylinder <b>146</b> and are mounted to one another or secured together, e.g., with rings pressed onto ends of the laminations. Outer cylinder <b>146</b> may define a recess that extends inwardly from the outer surface of outer cylinder <b>146</b>, e.g., along the radial direction R. Driving magnet <b>144</b> is positioned in the recess on outer cylinder <b>146</b>, e.g., such that driving magnet <b>144</b> is inset within outer cylinder <b>146</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Linear compressor <b>100</b> also includes a pair of planar springs <b>150</b>. Each planar spring <b>150</b> may be coupled to a respective end of inner back iron <b>142</b>, e.g., along the axial direction A. During operation of driving coil <b>124</b>, planar springs <b>150</b> support inner back iron <b>142</b>. In particular, inner back iron <b>142</b> is suspended by planar springs <b>150</b> within the stator or the motor of linear compressor <b>100</b> such that motion of inner back iron <b>142</b> along the radial direction R is hindered or limited while motion along the axial direction A is relatively unimpeded. Thus, planar springs <b>150</b> may be substantially stiffer along the radial direction R than along the axial direction A. In such a manner, planar springs <b>150</b> can assist with maintaining a uniformity of the air gap between driving magnet <b>144</b> and driving coil <b>124</b>, e.g., along the radial direction R, during operation of the motor and movement of inner back iron <b>142</b> on the axial direction A. Planar springs <b>150</b> can also assist with hindering side pull forces of the motor from transmitting to piston <b>130</b> and being reacted in cylinder <b>117</b> as a friction loss.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A flex mount <b>160</b> is mounted to and extends through inner back iron <b>142</b>. In particular, flex mount <b>160</b> is mounted to inner back iron <b>142</b> via inner sleeve <b>148</b>. Thus, flex mount <b>160</b> may be coupled (e.g., threaded) to inner sleeve <b>148</b> at the middle portion of inner sleeve <b>148</b> and/or flex mount <b>160</b> in order to mount or fix flex mount <b>160</b> to inner sleeve <b>148</b>. Flex mount <b>160</b> may assist with forming a coupling <b>162</b>. Coupling <b>162</b> connects inner back iron <b>142</b> and piston <b>130</b> such that motion of inner back iron <b>142</b>, e.g., along the axial direction A, is transferred to piston <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Coupling <b>162</b> may be a compliant coupling that is compliant or flexible along the radial direction R. In particular, coupling <b>162</b> may be sufficiently compliant along the radial direction R such that little or no motion of inner back iron <b>142</b> along the radial direction R is transferred to piston <b>130</b> by coupling <b>162</b>. In such a manner, side pull forces of the motor are decoupled from piston <b>130</b> and/or cylinder <b>117</b> and friction between piston <b>130</b> and cylinder <b>117</b> may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As may be seen in the figures, piston head <b>132</b> of piston <b>130</b> has a piston cylindrical side wall <b>170</b>. Cylindrical side wall <b>170</b> may extend along the axial direction A from piston head <b>132</b> towards inner back iron <b>142</b>. An outer surface of cylindrical side wall <b>170</b> may slide on cylinder <b>117</b> at chamber <b>118</b> and an inner surface of cylindrical side wall <b>170</b> may be positioned opposite the outer surface of cylindrical side wall <b>170</b>. Thus, the outer surface of cylindrical side wall <b>170</b> may face away from a center of cylindrical side wall <b>170</b> along the radial direction R, and the inner surface of cylindrical side wall <b>170</b> may face towards the center of cylindrical side wall <b>170</b> along the radial direction R.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Flex mount <b>160</b> extends between a first end portion <b>172</b> and a second end portion <b>174</b>, e.g., along the axial direction A. According to an exemplary embodiment, the inner surface of cylindrical side wall <b>170</b> defines a ball seat <b>176</b> proximate first end portion. In addition, coupling <b>162</b> also includes a ball nose <b>178</b>. Specifically, for example, ball nose <b>178</b> is positioned at first end portion <b>172</b> of flex mount <b>160</b>, and ball nose <b>178</b> may contact flex mount <b>160</b> at first end portion <b>172</b> of flex mount <b>160</b>. In addition, ball nose <b>178</b> may contact piston <b>130</b> at ball seat <b>176</b> of piston <b>130</b>. In particular, ball nose <b>178</b> may rest on ball seat <b>176</b> of piston <b>130</b> such that ball nose <b>178</b> is slidable and/or rotatable on ball seat <b>176</b> of piston <b>130</b>. For example, ball nose <b>178</b> may have a frusto-spherical surface positioned against ball seat <b>176</b> of piston <b>130</b>, and ball seat <b>176</b> may be shaped complementary to the frusto-spherical surface of ball nose <b>178</b>. The frusto-spherical surface of ball nose <b>178</b> may slide and/or rotate on ball seat <b>176</b> of piston <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Relative motion between flex mount <b>160</b> and piston <b>130</b> at the interface between ball nose <b>178</b> and ball seat <b>176</b> of piston <b>130</b> may provide reduced friction between piston <b>130</b> and cylinder <b>117</b>, e.g., compared to a fixed connection between flex mount <b>160</b> and piston <b>130</b>. For example, when an axis on which piston <b>130</b> slides within cylinder <b>117</b> is angled relative to the axis on which inner back iron <b>142</b> reciprocates, the frusto-spherical surface of ball nose <b>178</b> may slide on ball seat <b>176</b> of piston <b>130</b> to reduce friction between piston <b>130</b> and cylinder <b>117</b> relative to a rigid connection between inner back iron <b>142</b> and piston <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Flex mount <b>160</b> is connected to inner back iron <b>142</b> away from first end portion <b>172</b> of flex mount <b>160</b>. For example, flex mount <b>160</b> may be connected to inner back iron <b>142</b> at second end portion <b>174</b> of flex mount <b>160</b> or between first and second end portions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> of flex mount <b>160</b>. Conversely, flex mount <b>160</b> is positioned at or within piston <b>130</b> at first end portion <b>172</b> of flex mount <b>160</b>, as discussed in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> through <b>13</b></figref>, flex mount <b>160</b> and an internal muffler will be described in more detail according to exemplary embodiments of the present subject matter. In this regard, for example, flex mount <b>160</b> includes a tubular wall <b>200</b> that is positioned between and mechanically couples inner back iron <b>142</b> and piston <b>130</b>. In addition, tubular wall <b>200</b> has an inner surface <b>202</b> that defines a suction cavity <b>204</b> that is generally configured for receiving and directing compressible fluid, such as refrigerant or air (identified below and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> as flow of gas <b>238</b>), through flex mount <b>160</b> towards piston head <b>132</b> and/or piston <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Inner back iron <b>142</b> may be mounted to flex mount <b>160</b> such that inner back iron <b>142</b> extends around tubular wall <b>200</b>, e.g., at the middle portion of flex mount <b>160</b> between first and second end portions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> of flex mount <b>160</b>. Suction cavity <b>204</b> may extend between first and second end portions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> of flex mount <b>160</b> within tubular wall <b>200</b> such that the compressible fluid is flowable from second end portion <b>174</b> of flex mount <b>160</b> (e.g., a gas inlet) to first end portion <b>172</b> of flex mount <b>160</b> (e.g., a gas outlet) through suction cavity <b>204</b>. In such a manner, compressible fluid may flow through inner back iron <b>142</b> within flex mount <b>160</b> during operation of linear compressor <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Piston head <b>132</b> also defines at least one opening <b>206</b>. Opening <b>206</b> of piston head <b>132</b> extends, e.g., along the axial direction A, through piston head <b>132</b>. Thus, the flow of fluid may pass through piston head <b>132</b> via opening <b>206</b> of piston head <b>132</b> into chamber <b>118</b> during operation of linear compressor <b>100</b>. In such a manner, the flow of fluid (that is compressed by piston head <b>132</b> within chamber <b>118</b>) may flow within suction cavity <b>204</b> through flex mount <b>160</b> and inner back iron <b>142</b> to piston <b>130</b> during operation of linear compressor <b>100</b>. As explained above, suction valve <b>128</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>7</b></figref>) may be positioned on piston head <b>132</b> to regulate the flow of compressible fluid through opening <b>206</b> into chamber <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b> and <b>6</b>-<b>13</b></figref>, linear compressor <b>100</b> may further include a suction muffler <b>210</b> that is positioned at least partially within suction cavity <b>204</b> within tubular wall <b>200</b>, e.g., to reduce the noise generated during the operation of linear compressor <b>100</b>. In this regard, for example, suction valve <b>128</b> may generate a popping noise every time it is opened or closed. Suction muffler <b>210</b> may be designed for damping such compressor noise. In addition, or alternatively, suction muffler <b>210</b> generally be configured for reducing noise generated by compressible fluid flowing through suction cavity <b>204</b> or any other noises generated during operation of linear compressor <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As mentioned briefly above, suction muffler <b>210</b> may be generally positioned at least partially within suction cavity <b>204</b> of flex mount <b>160</b>. Suction muffler <b>210</b> may include an inlet tube <b>212</b> that extends substantially along the axial direction A within suction cavity <b>204</b>, e.g., in a manner coaxial with tubular wall <b>200</b> of flex mount <b>160</b>.

In this regard, at least one chamber port <b>240</b> provides fluid communication between the inlet passageway <b>214</b> and each of the plurality of resonance chambers <b>224</b>. Accordingly, pulsations within suction cavity <b>204</b> may propagate through inlet passageway <b>214</b> and over or into each resonance chamber <b>224</b>, each of which may be configured for damping noise at a particular frequency or range of frequencies.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Accordingly, resonance chambers <b>224</b> may generally operate as Helmholtz resonators. In this regard, as is known in the art, Helmholtz resonators or oscillators are generally a container or chamber of air with a hole or neck. A Helmholtz resonant frequency may be defined by the size and dimensions of the chamber and neck of a particular chamber such that the Helmholtz resonator serves to damp noise or vibrations at that particular frequency. In other words, suction muffler <b>210</b> may be designed such that chamber plates <b>220</b> defined resonance chambers <b>224</b> that act to absorb acoustic vibrations at particular frequencies.

In addition, each latching feature <b>262</b> may extend along the axial direction away from fourth chamber plate <b>236</b> and may have a springlike structure for deflecting and snapping into place as suction muffler <b>210</b> is rotated. In this regard, for example, latching feature <b>262</b> may define a ramped surface <b>264</b> that engages locking flange <b>260</b> as suction muffler <b>210</b> is rotated. Accordingly, latching feature <b>262</b> may be deflected as suction muffler <b>210</b> is rotated until the locking flange <b>260</b> may be seated within a locking recess <b>266</b> defined by latching feature <b>262</b>. Once locking flange <b>260</b> is seated within locking recess <b>266</b>, suction muffler <b>210</b> may be securely fixed along the axial direction A and may be prevented from further rotation along the circumferential direction C. It should be appreciated that other latching and/or locking mechanisms are possible and within scope the present subject matter.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Aspects of the present subject matter as described above relate to a linear compressor with an integrated suction muffler in a refrigeration system. Specifically, a multi-chamber suction muffler is integrated into a flex mount and piston ball joint assembly such that these structures may move in unison and provide for improved compressor performance and effective sound dampening. The muffler may be a single piece which is inserted into the tubular piston flex mount and may snap fit with a mating feature in the piston flex mount and to lock tightly. This snap fit may be spring loaded to prevent any rattling or loosening of the suction muffler insert during operation of the compressor.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The multi-cavity muffler design is accomplished with a primary resonance chamber, secondary resonance chamber, and third resonance chamber branched off the primary inlet tube to address typical harmonics in suction pulsations. The outer plates of the muffler design may define the three separate chambers once the muffler piece is inserted into the piston flex mount. The primary chamber may have a one-quarter wavelength Helmholtz resonator frequency tuned to the primary pulsation frequency of the suction valve, with internal volume maximized to fit into the piston flex mount. The suction gas inlet tube may be sized to avoid dynamic restriction of the incoming suction gas and the muffler insert may be made from relatively flexible and ductile nylon (PA6) or any other flexible material.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The written description uses examples to disclose the invention, including the best mode, and also to enable any person skilled in the art to practice the invention, including making and using any devices or systems and performing any incorporated methods.
