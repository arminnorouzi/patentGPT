There are many types of spinal column disorders including scoliosis (abnormal lateral curvature of the spine), kyphosis (abnormal forward curvature of the spine, usually in the thoracic spine), excess lordosis (abnormal backward curvature of the spine, usually in the lumbar spine), spondylolisthesis (forward displacement of one vertebra over another, usually in a lumbar or cervical spine) and other disorders caused by abnormalities, disease or trauma, such as ruptured or slipped discs, degenerative disc disease, fractured vertebra, and the like. Patients that suffer from such conditions usually experience extreme and debilitating pain, as well as diminished nerve function.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A technique commonly referred to as spinal fixation is employed for fusing together and/or mechanically immobilizing vertebrae of the spine. Spinal fixation may also be used to alter the alignment of adjacent vertebrae relative to one another so as to change the overall alignment of the spine. Such techniques have been used effectively to treat the above-described conditions and, in most cases, to relieve pain suffered by the patient. Spinal fixation often involves use of polyaxial pedicle screws fixed to the vertebrae. However, there are some disadvantages associated with current pedicle screws and polyaxial screwdrivers used to install them. There remains room for improvement in the manner of engaging the screw head, the complexity of use, the required manipulation of the many parts associated with some complex devices and improved screw loading during installation.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A screw having a head which includes a central projection on the upper portion, preferably a spherical underside and a plurality of projections extending from an upper surface of the head is disclosed. In one embodiment, the projections are arranged about the periphery of the head, preferably, the projections or at least a portion of them are connected by a web of material.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Formatting with a screw head of the type described above, a driver in accordance with the present invention may have an end which mates with the structure of the screw head. It need not match or mate precisely, but instead may have structure to mate with a portion of the structure of the screw head. The driver may include a transverse stabilization structure. The driver may include a structure for locking the driver to the screw or a polyaxial screw coupling element.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention may include a polyaxial screwdriver having a handle and a screw engaging end. The screw engaging end engages the head of a polyaxial screw such that when the screwdriver is rotated via the handle, the polyaxial screw is advanced or retracted in the vertebra. The polyaxial screwdriver has an internal shaft and an outside sleeve slidably inserted over the internal shaft. The screw engaging end has semi-cylindrical cutouts that are spaced at a distance from each other. Placed between the semi-cylindrical cutouts are cylindrical structures.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention may also include a polyaxial bone screw assembly having a bone screw. The polyaxial bone screw assembly also includes a coupling element. The coupling element has a bore for receiving the bone screw. The bone screw has a head that has a flat surface. A cylindrical wall is formed on the flat surface. Solid cylinders are formed on the outside surface of the cylindrical wall. The solid cylinders are located on the head such that they can align with the semi-cylindrical cutouts when the screw engaging end of the screwdriver is placed on top of the head. When the screw engaging end is lowered on the head, the semi-cylindrical cutouts would slide on top of the cylindrical structures and thereby self-align.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As the screw engaging end is lowered in the coupling element, threads formed on the shaft of the screw driver would align with threads in the coupling element. Rotation of sleeve would results in engagement of these two threads. The precise mating of the screw engaging end and head along with the engagement of these threads results in secure attachment of the screwdriver to the screw. A ratchet mechanism formed in the screwdriver provides progressive and automatic locking of the polyaxial screwdriver to the coupling element and prevents the accidental unthreading from the coupling element. When the screwdriver is used to unscrew, a button is pressed to disengage the ratchet from gear teeth and thereby allow the sleeve to be rotated in reverse direction to remove the screw.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment of the polyaxial screwdriver, the outer sleeve of the polyaxial screwdriver has a collet formed at the end that is near the screw engaging end. Projections are formed on the internal surface of the collet. The end of the sleeve that is closer to the handle has external threads formed on it. A nut is located above the external threads. The nut has internal threads that are adapted to threadably engage the external threads. When the polyaxial screwdriver is lowered on the head, collet slides over the outside surface of the upper end of the coupling element and locks on to the coupling element. Next, the nut is threaded on to the external threads to securely fasten the screwdriver to the polyaxial bone screw assembly.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another embodiment of a polyaxial screwdriver, the outer sleeve of the polyaxial screwdriver has a split end. The split end securely engages the coupling element. A short ring is located around the split end of outer sleeve. The short ring when pulled towards the handle would engage ramps formed on the external surfaces of the split end thereby moving split ends towards the center of the sleeve and allowing them to disengage from the coupling element.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention also resides in the ornamental appearance of the polyaxial screw as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>.

Any appropriate number of the semi-cylindrical cutouts <b>30</b> and the cylindrical structures <b>32</b> may be used. For example, there could be between two and twenty of each of the semi-cylindrical cutouts <b>30</b> and the cylindrical structures <b>32</b>. In alternative embodiments, the cutouts can be of spherical, conical, rectilinear or any other suitable shape. Similarly, the cylindrical structures <b>32</b> can alternatively be of spherical, conical, rectilinear or any other suitable shape. The external surface of the screw engaging end <b>24</b> has two lateral projections <b>34</b> located diametrically opposite each other. Alternative embodiments may not include the two lateral projections <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a polyaxial bone screw assembly <b>35</b> having a bone screw <b>36</b>. The polyaxial bone screw <b>36</b> has threads <b>38</b> and a head <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The threads <b>38</b> terminate at a neck <b>42</b> located between the threads <b>38</b> and the head <b>40</b>. The neck <b>42</b> has a concave surface having a diameter that is less than the diameter of the threads <b>38</b>. The reduced diameter neck <b>42</b> allows the screw <b>36</b> to pivot and rotate through a broader range of motion. The screw, including the external threads <b>38</b>, neck <b>42</b> and head <b>40</b>, is preferably made of a non-organic material that is durable and that can be implanted in a human body, such as titanium or stainless steel. Commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,488,681, and 6,554,834, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein, disclose polyaxial bone screw of various designs. Any of the bone screws described in the '681 patent or the '834 patent may be adapted for use with the screwdriver of the present invention that has been appropriately modified.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Polyaxial bone screw assembly <b>35</b> also includes a coupling element <b>50</b> (also known as a tulip; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) for coupling an orthopedic stabilizing rod with the polyaxial screw assembly <b>35</b>. Coupling element <b>50</b> is preferably made of an inert material such as titanium or stainless steel. Coupling element <b>50</b> has an upper end <b>52</b> and a lower end <b>54</b>. Coupling element <b>50</b> also preferably has an outer surface <b>56</b> including a convex surface at the lower end <b>54</b> thereof and a cylindrical surface at the upper end thereof. Outer surface <b>56</b> also preferably includes one or more grooves <b>58</b> formed therein so that coupling element <b>50</b> may be grasped using a tool.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The coupling element <b>50</b> has a bore for receiving the screw <b>36</b>. The bore defines an inner surface of coupling element <b>50</b> and has internal threads <b>60</b> at the inner surface of the upper end <b>52</b> of the coupling element <b>50</b>. The lower end of the bore preferably has a shape adapted to accommodate head <b>40</b>. In other embodiments, the threads on the coupling element may be external threads. The head <b>40</b> of the screw <b>36</b> sits at the bottom of the coupling element <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The head <b>40</b> includes a flat surface <b>44</b>. The head <b>40</b> has a spherical surface <b>45</b> that is located below the flat surface <b>44</b>. A cylindrical wall <b>46</b> is formed on the flat surface <b>44</b>. Solid cylinders <b>48</b> are formed on the outside surface of the cylindrical wall <b>46</b>. The solid cylinders <b>48</b> are equidistant from their neighboring solid cylinders <b>48</b>. The solid cylinders <b>48</b> are located on the head <b>40</b> such that they can align with the semi-cylindrical cutouts <b>30</b> when the screw engaging end <b>24</b> is placed on top of the head <b>40</b>. The solid cylinders are sized so that they will slide snugly in the semi-cylindrical cutouts <b>30</b> when the screw engaging end <b>24</b> is lowered on the head <b>40</b>. Additionally, when the screw engaging end <b>24</b> is lowered on the head <b>40</b>, the cylindrical structures <b>32</b> slide in the region between the solid cylinders <b>48</b>. When the screw engaging end <b>24</b> is lowered on the head <b>40</b>, it is possible that there is slight misalignment between the solid cylinders <b>48</b> and the semi-cylindrical cutouts <b>30</b>. However, when such misalignment exists, the edges of the semi-cylindrical cutouts <b>30</b> will touch the top of the solid cylinders <b>48</b>. Since the top of the solid cylinders <b>48</b> are sloping down the semi-cylindrical cutouts would slide on top of the solid cylinders <b>48</b> and thereby self-align. As is clear from the above description, the shape and size of the solid cylinders <b>48</b> and cylindrical wall <b>46</b> are complimentary to the shape and size of the semi-cylindrical cutouts <b>30</b> and cylindrical structures <b>32</b>, respectively. Thus, in an alternative embodiment, for example, in an embodiment where the cutouts are made spherical, the solid cylinders <b>48</b> will also be replaced by spherical structures that are complimentary with the shape and size of the spherical cutouts. As discussed previously, shapes other than the spherical may also be used.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the screwdriver <b>20</b> being inserted in the polyaxial bone screw assembly <b>35</b>. The screw engaging end <b>24</b> is shown inserted in the coupling element <b>50</b>. As the screw engaging end <b>24</b> is lowered further in the coupling element <b>50</b>, threads <b>70</b> would align with threads <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). Rotation of handle <b>22</b> would rotate shaft <b>21</b> along with threads <b>70</b>. Such rotation, when the screw engaging end <b>24</b> is engaged with the screw head <b>40</b>, results in advancing the screw <b>36</b> in the bone and engaging together threads <b>70</b> and <b>60</b>. The precise mating of the screw engaging end <b>24</b> and head <b>40</b> along with the engagement of threads <b>60</b> and <b>70</b> results in secure attachment of the screwdriver to the screw.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows an improved locking mechanism <b>72</b>. The locking mechanism <b>72</b> includes a ratchet <b>74</b> that is attached to the sleeve <b>23</b> via a key <b>76</b> that is inserted in the sleeve <b>23</b> and the ratchet <b>74</b>. The ratchet <b>74</b> has a button <b>75</b> that is integral with ratchet <b>74</b> and projects from the surface of the sleeve <b>23</b>. The ratchet <b>74</b> is in engagement with gear teeth <b>77</b> formed on the outside of internal shaft <b>21</b> in the region corresponding to the location of the ratchet <b>74</b>. A spring <b>78</b> applies a force to the ratchet to keep it in engagement with the gear teeth <b>77</b>. Therefore, in use, when the handle <b>22</b> is rotated to insert the screw <b>36</b> in a vertebra the threads <b>60</b> and <b>70</b> engage each other and at the same time the ratchet <b>74</b> is progressively engaged with the gear teeth <b>77</b>. This results in progressive and automatic locking of the polyaxial screwdriver and prevents the accidental unthreading from the coupling element <b>50</b> and loosening of the screwdriver. When the screwdriver is used to unthread the screw <b>36</b>, the button <b>75</b> is pressed to disengage the ratchet <b>74</b> from the gear teeth <b>77</b> and thereby allow the internal shaft <b>21</b> to be rotated in reverse direction to unthread screw <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>9</b></figref> show another embodiment of a polyaxial screwdriver <b>80</b> engaged with the polyaxial bone screw assembly <b>35</b>. The construction of the polyaxial screwdriver <b>80</b> is similar to the polyaxial screwdriver <b>20</b> in many respects. Therefore, only the features of the polyaxial screwdriver <b>80</b> that are different from the polyaxial screwdriver <b>20</b> are described hereafter. Same reference numeral denotes parts that are similar across various embodiments. The outer sleeve <b>82</b> of the polyaxial screwdriver <b>80</b> has a collet <b>84</b> formed at the end that is near the screw engaging end <b>24</b>. Projections (not seen in figures) are formed on the internal surface of the collet <b>84</b>. The end of the sleeve <b>82</b> that is closer to the handle <b>22</b> has external threads <b>86</b> formed on it. A nut <b>88</b> is next to the threads <b>86</b>. The nut <b>88</b> has internal threads that are adapted to threadably engage threads <b>86</b>. The nut <b>88</b> is in contact with a shoulder formed on shaft <b>21</b> such that it is prevented from sliding towards the collet <b>84</b>. When the polyaxial screwdriver is lowered on the head <b>40</b> collet <b>84</b> slides over the outside surface of the upper end <b>52</b> of the coupling element <b>50</b>. The projections on the internal surface of the collet <b>84</b> snap in the grooves <b>58</b> formed on the outer surface <b>56</b> of the coupling element <b>50</b>. Once the polyaxial screwdriver <b>80</b> is in engagement with screw <b>36</b>, and the collet is in place around the coupling element <b>50</b> the nut <b>88</b> is threaded on to the threads <b>86</b> to securely fasten the screwdriver <b>80</b> to the polyaxial bone screw assembly <b>35</b>. Since the nut <b>88</b> cannot slide towards the collet <b>84</b>, when the nut <b>88</b> is threaded on the sleeve <b>82</b>, sleeve <b>82</b> is pulled up towards the handle <b>22</b> to securely fasten the screwdriver <b>80</b> to the polyaxial bone screw assembly <b>35</b>.

Therefore, only the features of the polyaxial screwdriver <b>90</b> that are different from the polyaxial screwdriver <b>20</b> are described hereafter. Same reference numeral denotes parts that are similar across various embodiments. The outer sleeve <b>91</b> of the polyaxial screwdriver <b>90</b> has a split end. The end that engages the coupling element <b>92</b> is split to form two flexible arms <b>94</b>. The ends of the flexible arms <b>94</b> that engages the coupling element <b>92</b> have a step <b>96</b> formed thereon.
