For example, one such accessory unit is a steering wheel-shaped accessory unit operated by being rotated as a whole, with a game controller attached thereto.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">These accessory units, however, had room for improvement in terms of their usability when used with game controllers.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is therefore an object of at least one exemplary aspect to provide an accessory device having a better usability.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">At least one exemplary aspect may employ following configurations to attain the object set forth above. Note that in interpreting the claims, it is understood that the scope thereof should be interpreted based solely on the wording of the claims, and wherever the wording of the claims is inconsistent with the description hereinbelow, the wording of the claims precedes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first example of an accessory device according to at least one exemplary aspect is for use with a game controller that includes at least a first button and a second button. The accessory device includes a compartment, a grip portion, a first movable portion and a second movable portion. The compartment is configured to removably secure the game controller therein. The grip portion is configured to be held by a user with both hands. The first movable portion includes a first operation portion and a first button depression portion. The first operation portion is configured to be pressed by one hand of the user holding the grip portion. The first button depression portion is configured to move toward the first button of the game controller secured in the compartment, thereby pressing the first button of the game controller secured in the compartment, in response to the pressing operation on the first operation portion. The second movable portion includes a second operation portion and a second button depression portion.

An example information processing system includes a main unit (information processing device, serving as a game device main unit) <b>2</b>, a left controller <b>3</b>, a right controller <b>4</b>, and a steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b>. The left controller <b>3</b> and the right controller <b>4</b> can each be attached to and detached from the main unit <b>2</b>. The left controller <b>3</b> and the right controller <b>4</b> can be attached to, and used as an integral unit with, the main unit <b>2</b>, or the main unit <b>2</b> can be used as a separate unit from the left controller <b>3</b> and the right controller <b>4</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The information processing system can be used in a mode in which the image is displayed on the main unit <b>2</b>, and another mode in which the image is displayed on a different display device (e.g., a stationary monitor) such as a TV. In the former mode, the information processing system can be used as a portable device (e.g., a portable game device). In the latter mode, the information processing system can be used as a home-console device (e.g., a home-console game device). The steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b> of the information processing system can be used as an extension controller device with either the left controller <b>3</b> or the right controller <b>4</b> attached to a part of the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b>. Note that as will be clear from the description below, either the left controller <b>3</b> or the right controller <b>4</b> can be attached to and detached from the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b>. The term &#x201c;accessory device&#x201d; as used herein includes units such as so-called extension units and attachments.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a state in which the left controller <b>3</b> and the right controller <b>4</b> are attached to the main unit <b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the left controller <b>3</b> and the right controller <b>4</b> are attached to and combined with the main unit <b>2</b>. The main unit <b>2</b> is a unit for executing various processes (e.g., game processes) in the information processing system. The main unit <b>2</b> includes a display <b>12</b>. The left controller <b>3</b> and the right controller <b>4</b> each include an operation section allowing a user to provide an input.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example where the left controller <b>3</b> and the right controller <b>4</b> are detached from the main unit <b>2</b>.

In other exemplary aspects, some of the elements described above may be absent on the main unit <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a six-sided view showing an example of the left controller <b>3</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the left controller <b>3</b> includes a housing <b>31</b>. In at least one exemplary aspect, the housing <b>31</b> is generally plate-shaped. The primary surface (in other words, the front-side surface, i.e., the surface on the z-axis negative direction side shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the housing <b>31</b> has a generally rectangular shape. In at least one exemplary aspect, the housing <b>31</b> has a vertically-elongated shape, i.e., a shape that is elongated in the up-down direction (i.e., the y-axis direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Note that when detached from the main unit <b>2</b>, the left controller <b>3</b> may be held in a portrait position. The housing <b>31</b> is shaped and sized so that it can be held in one hand, particularly the left hand, when held in a portrait position. The left controller <b>3</b> may also be held in a landscape position. The left controller <b>3</b> may be held using both hands when held in a landscape position. Note that there is no particular limitation on the shape of the housing <b>31</b>, and the housing <b>31</b> does not need to be generally plate-shaped in other exemplary aspects. The housing <b>31</b> does not need to have a rectangular shape, but may have a semi-circular shape, or the like, for example. The housing <b>31</b> does not need to have a vertically-elongated shape.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The length of the housing <b>31</b> in the up-down direction is generally equal to the length of the housing <b>11</b> of the main unit <b>2</b> in the up-down direction. The thickness of the housing <b>31</b> (i.e., the length thereof in the front-rear direction; in other words, the length thereof in the z-axis direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is generally equal to the thickness of the housing <b>11</b> of the main unit <b>2</b>. Therefore, when the left controller <b>3</b> is attached to the main unit <b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), a user can hold the main unit <b>2</b> and the left controller <b>3</b> as if they were an integral unit.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the left-side corner portion of the primary surface of the housing <b>31</b> has a more rounded shape than the right-side corner portion thereof. That is, the connecting portion between the upper side surface and the left side surface of the housing <b>31</b> and the connecting portion between the lower side surface and the left side surface of the housing <b>31</b> are more rounded (in other words, round-cornered with a greater radius) than the connecting portion between the upper side surface and the right side surface and the connecting portion between the lower side surface and the right side surface. Therefore, when the left controller <b>3</b> is attached to the main unit <b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), the left side of the combined device will have a rounded shape, making it easier for a user to hold the device.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The left controller <b>3</b> includes an analog stick <b>32</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the analog stick <b>32</b> is provided on the primary surface of the housing <b>31</b>. The analog stick <b>32</b> is an example of a directional input section allowing a user to input a direction. The analog stick <b>32</b> includes a stick member that can be tilted in any direction (i.e., <b>360</b>&#xb0; directions including the upper, lower, left, right and diagonal directions) parallel to the primary surface of the housing <b>31</b>. A user can tilt the stick member to make a direction input based on the tilt direction (and a magnitude input based on the tilt angle).

Note that in other exemplary aspects, the pairing button <b>46</b> may only serve to instruct one of the setting process and the resetting process. For example, when a short-press operation is performed on the pairing button <b>46</b> (specifically, when the pairing button <b>46</b> is pressed down for a shorter period of time than a predetermined period of time), the left controller <b>3</b> executes the setting process. When a long-press operation is performed on the pairing button <b>46</b> (specifically, when the pairing button <b>46</b> is held down for the predetermined period of time or longer), the left controller <b>3</b> executes the resetting process. In at least one exemplary aspect, the pairing button <b>46</b> is provided on the engaging surface of the slider <b>40</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Thus, the pairing button <b>46</b> is arranged at such a position that the pairing button <b>46</b> cannot be seen when the left controller <b>3</b> is attached to the main unit <b>2</b>.

In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the grip portion <b>201</b> is provided with a ring-shaped rim portion. Note that the shape of the rim portion does not need to be a ring shape, but may be any shape that can be held and steered by a user, such as a shape obtained by cutting off a part of a ring shape, a shape obtained by deforming a part of a ring shape, an elliptical shape, drop handle shape, a shape with a plurality of projections along the outer circumference, etc. The cross-sectional shape of the rim portion does not need to be a circular shape, but may be any other shape such as an elliptical shape, an oval shape, a polygonal shape, a rounded polygonal shape, a deformed circular shape, etc. The grip portion <b>201</b> includes a compartment <b>201</b><i>a </i>having a recessed shape formed around the center of the rim portion (e.g., around the center of the generally circular shape). The compartment <b>201</b><i>a </i>is formed in a recessed shape that can engage with the left controller <b>3</b> or the right controller <b>4</b> being in a horizontal position, and a plurality of biasing portions <b>203</b> (three biasing portions <b>203</b><i>a, </i><b>203</b><i>b </i>and <b>203</b><i>c </i>in at least one exemplary aspect,) are provided on the upper and lower walls of the recessed shape.

As is the curvature R<b>1</b> described above, the curvature R<b>3</b> of the curved surface of one edge of the lower surface that is closest to the left shaft portion <b>202</b>Lp is greater than the curvature R<b>4</b> of the curved surface of another edge that is farthest away from the left shaft portion <b>202</b>Lp (e.g., R<b>3</b>=1.5R and R<b>4</b>=0.5R). By forming a larger rounded shape (a curved surface of the curvature R<b>3</b>) along an edge that is closest to the left shaft portion <b>202</b>Lp, it is more likely that the flat portion of the left button depression portion <b>202</b>Lw first contacts the second L button <b>43</b> or the second L button <b>65</b> when the left button depression portion <b>202</b>Lw protrudes into the compartment <b>201</b><i>a, </i>thus preventing the edge from first contacting the second L button <b>43</b> or the second L button <b>65</b> and deteriorating the controllability. Also, by forming a larger rounded shape along an edge that is closest to the left shaft portion <b>202</b>Lp, it is possible to reduce the excessive load to be applied by the left button depression portion <b>202</b>Lw to the second L button <b>43</b> or the second L button <b>65</b>.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">Note that the chamfered shape of each edge of the lower surface of the left button depression portion <b>202</b>Lw does not need to be a curved surface, but may be of any shape that is not right-angled. For example, the chamfer may be done by slantly cutting off the edge of the lower surface of the left button depression portion <b>202</b>Lw, or may be a rounded chamfer composed of a plurality of curvatures. With any chamfered shape, the edge of the lower surface of the left button depression portion <b>202</b>Lw that is closest to the left shaft portion <b>202</b>Lp is shaped with a greater amount of chamfer than the edge that is farthest away from the left shaft portion <b>202</b>Lp.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228">As is clear from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the right operation portion <b>202</b>Re and the right button depression portion <b>202</b>Rw of the right movable portion <b>202</b>R are provided at different positions from each other along the axial direction of the right shaft portion <b>202</b>Rp. For example, for the direction from the front surface toward the rear surface of the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b>, the frontmost portion of an area of the right operation portion <b>202</b>Re that can be contacted by a finger of a user is located rearward of the rearmost portion of the actuation surface of the right button depression portion <b>202</b>Rw to be in contact with the second R button <b>44</b> or the second R button <b>66</b>. Specifically, the right button depression portion <b>202</b>Rw is provided on the front surface of the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b> and the right operation portion <b>202</b>Re is provided on the rear surface of the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b>, and the right operation portion <b>202</b>Re and the right button depression portion <b>202</b>Rw are provided at positions that do not overlap with each other in the front-rear direction (in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the frontmost portion of an area of the right operation portion <b>202</b>Re that can be contacted by a finger of a user and the rearmost portion of the actuation surface of the right button depression portion <b>202</b>Rw to be in contact with the second R button <b>44</b> or the second R button <b>66</b> are separated from each other by the distance Y in the front-rear direction). That is, the axial direction of the right shaft portion <b>202</b>Rp lies in the front-rear direction of the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b>, and the right button depression portion <b>202</b>Rw is provided on the rear side of the right operation portion <b>202</b>Re. Thus, with a lever structure in which the point of effort and the point of load are provided at different positions in the axial direction, rather than providing the point of effort and the point of load along the same line in a direction perpendicular to the fulcrum axial direction, it is possible to freely arrange the right operation portion <b>202</b>Re without being limited by the position of the left controller <b>3</b> or the right controller <b>4</b> to be attached.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0229">Note that while the right operation portion <b>202</b>Re and the right button depression portion <b>202</b>Rw are provided at different positions in the axial direction of the right shaft portion <b>202</b>Rp, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, if the entirety of the right movable portion <b>202</b>R is integrally molded, for example, the right shaft portion <b>202</b>Rp can be regarded as being provided on one side of one arm, with the operation portion <b>202</b>Re and the right button depression portion <b>202</b>Rw being provided on the other side of the arm.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, operations performed using the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b> with the left controller <b>3</b> or the right controller <b>4</b> attached thereto will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> shows an example of how a user performs a game operation by holding the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b> with the left controller <b>3</b> or the right controller <b>4</b> attached thereto using both hands (i.e., the right hand and the left hand). In at least one exemplary aspect, the main unit <b>2</b> executes processes in response to operations performed with the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b> based on data transmitted from the left controller <b>3</b> or the right controller <b>4</b> attached to the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">For example, in at least one exemplary aspect, a user holds the rim portion of the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b> using both hands, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, to perform operations using the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b> by rotating the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b> as a whole or by pressing the left operation portion <b>202</b>Le or the right operation portion <b>202</b>Re. In other exemplary aspects, a user can perform operations using the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b> by moving the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b> as a whole in the up-down direction, the left-right direction, the front-rear direction, etc., changing the orientation of the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b>, or operating the operation sections of the left controller <b>3</b> or the right controller <b>4</b> exposed on the front side of the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">In response to such operations using the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b>, the main unit <b>2</b> performs an information process (e.g., a game process).

For example, the main unit <b>2</b> changes the direction of movement of the virtual object in response to rotating the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b>, and changes the speed of movement of the virtual object in response to the pressing operation on the left operation portion <b>202</b>Le or the right operation portion <b>202</b>Re.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">The left controller <b>3</b> or the right controller <b>4</b> attached to the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b> includes inertia sensors (the acceleration sensor <b>104</b> and the angular velocity sensor <b>105</b>, or the acceleration sensor <b>114</b> and the angular velocity sensor <b>115</b>), and data representing the detection results from the inertia sensors can be wirelessly transmitted from the left controller <b>3</b> or the right controller <b>4</b> to the main unit <b>2</b>.

Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is a vertical cross-sectional view showing an example structure of a movable portion <b>303</b> provided on steering wheel-shaped attachment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is an internal structure diagram showing an example structure of a movable portion <b>304</b> provided on a steering wheel-shaped attachment.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, the movable portion <b>302</b> is provided behind the controller attached to the steering wheel-shaped attachment so that the movable portion <b>302</b> can pivot about the fulcrum provided on the back of the steering wheel-shaped attachment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, the axial direction of the fulcrum of the movable portion <b>302</b> extends in the left-right direction of the steering wheel-shaped attachment. The fulcrum of the movable portion <b>302</b> is provided below and behind the operation button of the controller to be pressed by the movable portion <b>302</b>. Then, the operation portion (point of effort) of the movable portion <b>302</b> and the protruding portion (point of load) thereof are each provided in front of the fulcrum, and the operation portion is provided behind the protruding portion. Thus, when the operation portion of the movable portion <b>302</b> is pressed in the downward direction, the protruding portion thereof pivots also in the downward direction about the fulcrum. The amount of movement by which the protruding portion moves through the pressing is greater than the amount of movement by which the operation portion moves by being pressed. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the amount of operation of pressing the operation button of the left controller <b>3</b> or the right controller <b>4</b> attached to the steering wheel-shaped attachment. Thus, the movable portion <b>302</b> functions as a lever provided so as to extend in the front-rear direction on the back of the steering wheel-shaped attachment.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, the movable portion <b>303</b> is provided above the controller attached to the steering wheel-shaped attachment so that the movable portion <b>303</b> can pivot about the fulcrum provided in front of the steering wheel-shaped attachment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, the axial direction of the fulcrum of the movable portion <b>303</b> extends in the left-right direction of the steering wheel-shaped attachment.

Then, the operation portion (point of effort) of the movable portion <b>303</b> and the protruding portion (point of load) thereof are provided behind the fulcrum at different positions along the same line in a direction perpendicular to the fulcrum axial direction, and the operation portion is provided behind the protruding portion. Thus, when the operation portion of the movable portion <b>303</b> is pressed in the downward direction, the protruding portion thereof pivots also in the downward direction about the fulcrum. The amount of movement by which the protruding portion moves through the pressing is smaller than the amount of movement by which the operation portion moves by being pressed. Thus, the movable portion <b>303</b> functions as a lever provided so as to extend in the front-rear direction in an upper portion of the steering wheel-shaped attachment.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, the movable portion <b>304</b> is provided above the controller attached to the steering wheel-shaped attachment so that the movable portion <b>304</b> can pivot about the fulcrum provided in an upper portion of the steering wheel-shaped attachment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, the axial direction of the fulcrum of the movable portion <b>304</b> extends in the front-rear direction of the steering wheel-shaped attachment. The fulcrum of the movable portion <b>304</b> is provided above and on the left of the operation button of the controller to be pressed by the movable portion <b>304</b>. Then, the operation portion (point of effort) of the movable portion <b>304</b> and the protruding portion (point of load) thereof are both provided on the right of the fulcrum and directly above the operation button of the controller to be pressed by the movable portion <b>304</b>, and the operation portion is provided directly above the protruding portion. Thus, when the operation portion of the movable portion <b>304</b> is pressed in the downward direction, the protruding portion thereof, which is provided directly below the operation portion, pivots also in the downward direction about the fulcrum. The amount of movement by which the protruding portion moves through the pressing is equal to the amount of movement by which the operation portion moves by being pressed. Therefore, the operating force of pressing the operation portion is equal to the force by which the operation button of the left controller <b>3</b> or the right controller <b>4</b> is pressed, and there is no leverage effect, allowing a user to operate the operation portion of the movable portion <b>304</b> with the same feel of operation as that when pressing the operation button of the left controller <b>3</b> or the right controller <b>4</b> with no attachment attached thereto. As described above, the movable portion <b>304</b> is provided directly above the steering wheel-shaped attachment and functions as an operation portion with no leverage effect.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">Thus, in at least one exemplary aspect, both of the left controller <b>3</b> and the right controller <b>4</b> can be attached to and detached from the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b>, which is an example accessory device, one at a time, and with one of the controllers attached thereto, processes can be performed in response to operations performed while holding the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b>.

For example, the motion or attitude may be calculated based only on the acceleration of the left controller <b>3</b> or the right controller <b>4</b>, may be calculated based only on the angular velocity of the left controller <b>3</b> or the right controller <b>4</b>, or may be calculated based on the combination of the angular velocity and the acceleration of the left controller <b>3</b> or the right controller <b>4</b>. It is understood that even when only the acceleration of the left controller <b>3</b> or the right controller <b>4</b> is detected, it is possible to calculate the direction of the gravitational acceleration of the left controller <b>3</b> or the right controller <b>4</b>, and the motion or attitude can be calculated by successively calculating the x-, y- and z-axis directions based on the gravitational acceleration.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">The main unit <b>2</b>, the left controller <b>3</b> and the right controller <b>4</b> may each be any device, such as a portable game device or any other portable electronic device (a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant), a mobile telephone, a personal computer, a camera, a tablet, etc.). The device which is attached to the steering wheel-shaped attachment <b>200</b> and which transmits operation data to the main unit <b>2</b> does not need to be a game controller.
