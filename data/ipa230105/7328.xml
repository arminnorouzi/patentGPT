Recently, these video content providers have overlaid adaptive bitrate (ABR) systems to satisfy their subscribers' demands for IP-based over-the-top services as well as linear video or video-on-demand (VOD) streams.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Consumers of linear and VOD content have an ever-growing number of content sources available to them, and they want to receive that content easily on a wide variety of devices. For instance, service providers often provide hundreds of different channels for viewers to choose from. Additionally, a vast array of Internet-based sources of content are also available to consumers, including video, still images and graphics. To assist consumers in selecting and receiving the video content that they are most interested in, subscription-based video content service providers would like to offer personalized channels targeted or personalized for individual consumers or groups of consumers that have one or more attributes or characteristics in common. For instance, personalized channels may be targeted to groups of consumers who are physically located in common regional markets.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows one example of an operating environment in which the techniques, systems and devices described herein may operate.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows one example of the personalized channel generation system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>7</b></figref> show examples of prompts that may be presented to allow a user to establish personalized channels.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> shows a representation of an illustrative base linear stream that is paced out in accordance with the real-world clock time; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> shows one example of a personalized linear stream after the manifest delivery controller has resolved the decisions required by the content replacement markers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of one example of a computing apparatus that may be configured to implement or execute one or more of the processes performed by any of the various devices shown herein, including but not limited to the personalized experience controller (PEC) and the base liner stream controller (BLSC).</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As explained in more detail below, the present disclosure generally relates to providing personalized video content and personalized advertisements to client devices. Each client device may have one or more personalized channels that can be provided in addition to or instead of a set of standard channels. For example, suppose the client device is a television or a set top box. The television or the set top box has a set of standard channels, e.g., CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, etc., for traditional television programs. In addition, the television or set top box may also have a set of personalized channels tailored to individual users of the client device or a demographic group of users (e.g., users residing in a common geographic area, users interested in similar content such as sports or certain genres of movies). Thus, while these users within the same locale may have a similar set of available standard channels, the personalized channels may vary from user to user or from a demographic group of users to another demographic group of users. The personalized channels may contain a combination of video content selected by the individual users and video content recommended by the system for the individual users or groups of users.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one implementation, the personalized channels may be delivered to consumers as adaptive bitrate (ABR) streams. The ABR streams may be obtained using VOD manifest files that function as live manifest files, but which are able to provide the consumer with VOD content as well as linear content. In this way the consumer is able to experience a customized selection of VOD content as live content just as if it were available on conventional channels.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Adaptive bit rate streaming is a technique for streaming multimedia where the source content is encoded at multiple bit rates. It is based on a series of short progressive content files applicable to the delivery of both live and on demand content. Adaptive bit rate streaming works by breaking the overall media stream into a sequence of small file downloads, each download loading one short segment, or chunk, of an overall potentially unbounded content stream.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As used herein, a chunk is a small file containing a short video segment (typically 2 to 10 seconds but can be as short as a single frame in some implementations) along with associated audio and other data. Sometimes, the associated audio and other data are in their own small files, separate from the video files and requested and processed by the ABR client(s) where they are reassembled into a rendition of the original content. Adaptive streaming may use, for instance, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) as the transport protocol for these video chunks. For example, &#x2018; chunks&#x2019; or &#x2018; chunk files&#x2019; may be short sections of media retrieved in an HTTP request by an ABR client. In some cases these chunks may be standalone files, or may be sections (i.e. byte ranges) of one much larger file. For simplicity the term &#x2018; chunk&#x2019; is used to refer to both of these cases (many small files or fewer large files).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Adaptive bit rate streaming methods have been implemented in proprietary formats including HTTP Live Streaming (&#x201c;HLS&#x201d;) by Apple, Inc., and HTTP Smooth Streaming by Microsoft, Inc. adaptive bit rate streaming has been standardized as ISO/IEC 23009-1, Information Technology-Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (&#x201c;DASH&#x201d;): Part 1: Media presentation description and segment formats. Although references are made herein to these example adaptive bit rate protocols, it will be recognized by a person having ordinary skill in the art that other standards, protocols, and techniques for adaptive streaming may be used.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows one example of an operating environment in which the techniques, systems and devices described herein may operate. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a high-level functional block diagram of a representative adaptive bit rate system <b>100</b> that delivers content to adaptive bit rate client devices <b>102</b>. An adaptive bit rate client device <b>102</b> is a client device capable of providing streaming playback by requesting an appropriate series of segments from an adaptive bit rate system. The ABR client devices <b>102</b> associated with users or subscribers may include a wide range of devices, including, without limitation, digital televisions, set top boxes (STBs), digital media players, mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones) video gaming devices, video game consoles, video teleconferencing devices, and the like.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The content made available to the adaptive bit rate system <b>100</b> may originate from various content sources represented by content source <b>104</b>, which may provide content such as live or linear content, VOD content and Internet-based or over-the-top (OTT) content such as data, images, video, graphics, text and the like. The content is provided to a data center <b>110</b> that includes an ABR video processing system <b>115</b> and a personalized channel delivery system <b>120</b>. ABR video processing system <b>115</b> is responsible for ingesting the content in its native format (e.g., MPEG, HTML5, JPEG, etc.) and processing it as necessary so that it can be transcoded and packaged. The ABR video processing system <b>115</b> also includes the transcoders and packagers that are responsible for preparing individual adaptive bit rate streams. A transcoder/packager is designed to encode, then fragment the media files into chunks or segments and to encapsulate those files in a container expected by the particular type of adaptive bit rate client. The adaptive bit rate segments are available at different bit rates, where the segment boundaries are aligned across the different bit rates so that clients can switch between bit rates seamlessly at the segment boundaries.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Along with the delivery of media, the packagers create the manifest files for each type of adaptive bit rate streaming protocol that is employed. In adaptive bit rate protocols, the manifest files generated may include a main or variant manifest and a profile or playlist manifest. The main manifest describes the various formats (resolution, bit rate, codec, etc.) that are available for a given asset or content stream. For each format, a corresponding profile manifest may be provided. The profile manifest identifies the media file chunks/segments that are available to the client. The ABR client determines which format the client desires, as listed in the main manifest, finds the corresponding profile manifest and location, and then retrieves media segments referenced in the profile manifest.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The individual adaptive bit rate streams are typically posted to an HTTP origin server (not shown) or the like so that they can be accessed by the client devices <b>102</b> over a suitable content delivery network (CDN) <b>125</b>, which may be in communication with various edge caches <b>130</b>. In some cases the edge caches <b>130</b> are in turn in communication with one or more client devices <b>102</b> in one or more regions through one or more access networks <b>140</b> that each serve a designated region. By way of a non-limiting example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an example of the data center <b>110</b> in communication with three regions A, B and C. However, the central data center <b>110</b> can be in communication with any desired number of regions. CDN <b>125</b> and access networks <b>140</b> may comprise any suitable network or combination of networks including, without limitation, IP networks, hybrid fiber-coax (HFC) networks, and the like.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It should be noted that the various systems and components of the adaptive bit rate system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be in any suitable location or locations. To the extent they are not co-located, they may communicate over one or more networks such as an IP CDN.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The various manifests that have been generated by the ABR video processing system <b>115</b> are provided to personalized channel generation system <b>120</b>, which creates the personalized channels based on such factors as individual profiles of subscribers' interests, preferences and specific content selections, subscriber geographical locations, and/or genres of content. For instance, by way of example, personalized channels may be created for all subscribers in particular cities or other market regions, other personalized channels may be created for individual subscribers, and yet other personalized channels may be created for subscribers who, by way of example, are fans of certain genres (e.g., science fiction, westerns) of movies or who are located in a particular region and are interested in local sports events occurring that region.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The personalized channel generation system <b>120</b> selects the content assets and events that are to be included in the video stream for each personalized channel and obtains, for each content asset and event, its corresponding manifest. The personalized channel generation system <b>120</b> then assembles the manifest for each channel into a rolling manifest that can be delivered to the ABR client device(s) that are to receive that personalized channel.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows one example of the personalized channel generation system <b>120</b>. The personalized channel generation system <b>120</b> includes a personalized experience controller (PEC) <b>210</b>, a base linear stream creator (BLSC) <b>220</b>, a video manifest manipulator, referred to herein as manifest delivery controller (MDC) <b>230</b>, an ad decision system <b>240</b> and a database <b>250</b>. The PEC <b>210</b> serves as a decisioning engine that is responsible for selecting the content assets and live events that are to be included in the video stream for each personalized channel. The BLSC <b>220</b> is responsible for generating a manifest for each base linear stream. The base linear stream serves as a template for each video stream provided by each personalized channel.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The PEC <b>210</b> enables the creation, updating, and removal of the personalized channels. Personalized channels can be defined, by way of example, for individual Multichannel Video Programming Distributors (MVPDs), geographic areas, demographic groups, and/or specific customer/subscribers. The PEC operator can editorially define the structure of the personalized channels and establish priorities concerning particular video content that will be shown to some or all users. This structure may specify, for example, live/linear program play times, times at which advertisements should be inserted, times at which VOD content should be inserted, and so on.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The PEC <b>210</b> identifies and selects content that is available from a wide variety of different sources and which may be incorporated into the personalized channels. This can be accomplished by obtaining metadata for the available content. The metadata may be obtained in many different ways. For instance, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the PEC <b>210</b> can ingest Live/Linear programming schedules <b>212</b> and map the available content to the user's subscriptions for inclusion into their personalized channel. The PEC <b>210</b> can also ingest metadata <b>214</b> for content assets from VOD rendering pools that are used to generate VOD assets from web-based and other online content, VOD workflow systems that generate VOD assets from live/linear content, live/linear scheduling systems and video library systems. For instance, cable companies supply program guides that contain program descriptions or information, and the appropriate attribute data or keywords from these program guides may be extracted. There are many databases available that have information regarding individual pieces of video content. The content information may be downloaded from the appropriate databases, such as databases of movie and television studios, publishers, online merchants, aggregators (e.g., Gracenote, Tivo), etc.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The PEC <b>210</b> also enables the end user to select content, define criteria, express preferences, likes/dislikes and change the priority and sequencing of content assets that are to delivered on their personalized channel(s). A user profile system <b>218</b> may construct profile(s) for the user(s) of the client device <b>102</b>. Information regarding the users may be obtained from a variety of different sources. For example, a user may input his or her information, such as demographical information, e.g., age, gender, education level, geographical location, etc., or preferences, directly into the client device <b>102</b> via an appropriate user interface. In addition or alternatively, user preferences may be automatically determined based on the types of video content that have been previously presented on the client device, and more specifically from the device usage information monitored and collected. If a user often watches videos relating to basketball games, for example, it may be an indication that the user likes sports and sports-related video content. Such information may be used to automatically determine user preferences. In some cases the PEC <b>210</b> may use the user profiles and possibly other information to obtain recommendations for content from one or more recommendation systems <b>216</b>, which are well-known systems that use a variety of different techniques for matching users to content that may be of interest to them. For instance, in one particular case the PEC <b>210</b> may query the recommendation system <b>216</b> when it needs content to fill one or more particular time slots that do not otherwise have content specified for them.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>7</b></figref> show illustrative examples of on-screen prompts that allow users to create one or more personal profiles for establishing personalized channels. The manner in which the user interacts with the user interface will depend in part on the nature of the client device. For instance, users may make selections and provide the requested information using a touch-screen display, remote control unit, a pointer device such as a mouse, and so on. The personal profiles may be obtained directly by the PEC <b>210</b> itself and stored in the user profile system <b>218</b> or, alternatively, the user profile system <b>218</b> may acquire the information from the users and make the resulting profiles accessible to the PEC <b>210</b> when selecting content for inclusion in the personalized channels.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a series of prompts that may be presented to allow a parent or other adult to establish a personalized channel. The prompts may include questions querying, for instance, if the user would like a personalized channel that includes video streams with news, weather and sports content, video streams with certain genres of movies or television shows or specific sports teams. If the user is interested in movies or television shows, for example, then <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may be presented, which allows the user to select the genres of content they are interested in. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a series of prompts that may be presented to allow a personalized channel to be established on behalf of children. The prompts may include questions querying, for instance, whether educational content and/or cartoons should be included. Yet another sequence of prompts shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> query whether a personalized channel should include local updates (e.g., weather, sports, news, traffic) for specified geographic regions and, if so, the intervals at which such updates should be presented.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Once users have specified the type of content they are interested in viewing on their personalized channels, the user may select specific content by navigating conventional VOD content catalogues, electronic program guides (EPGs) and the like. The users also may be provided with additional prompts or the like to configure the time(s) at which the content should be presented and the frequency at which it should be presented on their personalized channels. For content that regularly updates, such as news, sports weather and traffic, the user may specify when and how often the content should be updated. For instance, a user may specify that traffic and weather updates should be presented at 7 am Monday through Friday.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Based in part on the information obtained directly from individual users as described above, or, if the personalized channel is designated for more than one user belonging to a certain demographic category, the PEC <b>210</b> may select the appropriate content to be presented on the personalized channel. Likewise, this same information may be used to provide advertisement targeting parameters to the ad decision system <b>240</b> so that it may select advertisements that may be of particular interest to the users who view the personalized channel.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Once personalized channels with the appropriate content have been established, the PEC <b>210</b> can generate and make available a personalized timeline of programming (e.g., an electronic program guide) for each channel, which can be accessed for viewing and editing by the end user.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The PEC <b>210</b> may also interact with the product rendering controller (PRC) <b>211</b>, which in some cases is a part of the ABR processing system <b>115</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The PRC <b>211</b> is generally responsible for managing the overall process of creating VOD assets or products from content assets that are obtained from a wide variety of different content sources and which are in a wide variety of different native media formats. Additional details concerning one example of the PRC <b>211</b> may be found in U.S. Appl. Serial No. [Docket No. ARR017671], which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Among other things, the PEC <b>210</b> may initiate requests to the PRC <b>211</b> for creating incidental content that may be needed such as personalized introductory segments to other content assets and live events, interstitial content and information updates if an expected content asset is not available. The PEC <b>210</b> may also interact with other systems and components of the ABR processing system <b>115</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, as represented by the content creation, preparation and publications systems <b>250</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The PEC <b>210</b> also provides a base linear stream creator (BLSC) <b>220</b> with a list of available VOD asset, live events and advertisements that have been scheduled for insertion into the video stream. The BLSC <b>220</b> is largely responsible for generating base linear stream manifests and serving them to the MDC <b>230</b> when requested. The BLSC <b>220</b> also will poll the PEC <b>210</b> on a regular basis to refresh the list of assets and events that have been scheduled for insertion into the video stream.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The interactions between the PEC <b>210</b>, the BLSC <b>220</b>, as well as the MDC <b>230</b> will be further explained below.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As explained in more detail below, the base linear stream manifest produced by the BLSC <b>220</b> includes a series of content replacement markers that serve as decision points at which different content assets can be inserted for different personalized channels. The content to be inserted is selected by one or more decisioning engines. Interspersed among the content replacement markers may be other markers, such as those defining times as which live content is to be presented and times at which advertisements are to be inserted. The MDC <b>230</b> obtains the base linear stream manifests for the personalized channels from the BLSC <b>220</b> and requests from an appropriate decisioning engine, which may be the PEC <b>210</b> itself, an ad decision system <b>240</b> or some other system, a resolution to the decisions presented by the content replacement markers. Once the content assets have been specified for each content replacement marker in the base linear stream of a particular personalized channel, the MDC <b>230</b> obtains the manifests for each content asset and each scheduled live event and advertisement that is to be presented on the personalized channel and assembles them into a personalized channel manifest that can be provided to ABR client device(s) requesting that personalized channel as a rolling manifest that can deliver a linear video stream.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> shows a representation of an illustrative base linear stream <b>300</b> that is paced out in accordance with the real-world clock time, where time proceeds from left to right. As shown, the base linear stream <b>300</b> includes a continuous series of markers that represent one chunk of content That is, the time between adjacent markers corresponds to the duration of one chunk.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The in-band markers may be either content replacement markers <b>310</b> or alternative content markers <b>320</b>. Each marker includes an annotation that specifies the decisioning engine that determines the content asset (e.g., a VOD asset, a live event) to be inserted at that time. The in-band signaling markers may be based on any suitable standard such as Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers (SCTE) 35, for example. Alternatively, proprietary in-band signaling markers may be employed instead.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the illustrative base linear stream <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, a first portion <b>350</b> of finite duration spanning multiple segments contains a continuous sequence of content replacement markers <b>310</b>. Since the content replacement markers <b>310</b> each have a duration of one segment and are spaced one segment apart, they collectively ensure that the entire duration of the first portion <b>350</b> can be replaced with content assets that have not yet been specified without any gap in time. A second portion <b>360</b> of the base linear stream <b>300</b> begins and ends with alternative content markers <b>320</b>, indicating that a live event is to be presented during this second portion <b>360</b>. The first alternative content marker <b>320</b> may include an annotation specifying the location of the manifest for a previously provisioned pre-roll introduction to the live event and an annotation specifying the location of the manifest for the live event itself. A similar alternative content marker <b>320</b> that includes a previously provisioned post-roll out of the live event denotes the end of the second portion <b>360</b> of the base linear stream. The process of generating a manifest for a live base linear stream may continue in this manner so that the personalized channel can be presented as a linear channel. For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref>, after conclusion of the live event, the live base linear stream presents another continuous sequence of content replacement markers <b>310</b> during a third portion <b>370</b> in which replacement content may be inserted without a gap in time. The entire process may continue endlessly or for a finite period of time (e.g., 8 hours a day) so that the personalized channel are available in the same way that conventional channels are available. That is, in some cases the ABR stream delivered on the personalized channel may be a never-ending ABR video stream unless and until an external event causes termination of the ABR video stream.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> shows one example of a personalized linear stream after the MDC <b>230</b> has resolved the decisions required by the content replacement markers. As shown, the linear stream includes VOD assets such as sports scores, a sci-fi program, a movie, and so on, as well as a pre-scheduled live event and a local advertisement tailored to the particular market region to which the personalized linear stream is being delivered. If, for instance, this particular personalized channel has been established for one particular subscriber, then the content assets and live events have been preselected by the subscriber or have otherwise been determined to be of interest to the subscriber.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the flow of communications between the various components and systems shown therein that are used to deliver a personalized channel to the client device <b>102</b> will now be described. As indicated at 1, the PEC <b>210</b> provides the BLSC <b>220</b>, via suitable APIs exposed by the BLSC <b>220</b>, with basic information to define the structure of the base linear stream for the particular personalized channel being developed. For example, the PEC <b>210</b> will provide a base URL for specifying the network location of the source(s) from which manifest URLs may be obtained, a schedule of live events and advertisements that are to be inserted into the video stream, and so on. Given this information from the PEC <b>220</b>, the BLMS <b>220</b> in the BLSC <b>220</b> is able to create the manifest for the base linear stream.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">At 2 the ABR client device <b>102</b> requests the manifest for the personalized channel in order to begin playing the personalized channel. The MDC <b>230</b> in turn, requests the base linear stream manifest from the BLMS <b>222</b> at 3. In one embodiment, the requests may be sent using HTTP Get requests. As further indicated at 3, the BLSC <b>220</b> sends the base linear manifest with the various markers to the MDC <b>230</b>. The MDC <b>230</b> continuously looks ahead through the base linear manifest for markers indicating when content such as upcoming VOD assets, live events or advertisements are scheduled for presentation. The MDC <b>230</b> obtains from the marker annotations the URLs for the sources that are to provide the URLs for VOD content assets, live events and advertisements.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For instance, the MDC <b>230</b> may determine from a content replacement marker in a base linear stream for a particular personalized channel that it is to obtain a resolution to a VOD asset decision from the PEC <b>210</b>. Accordingly, at 4a the MDC <b>230</b> sends a request to the PEC <b>210</b> to get the URL for the VOD asset manifest for the VOD asset that is to be inserted into the video stream on the personalized channel. The PEC <b>210</b> selects the appropriate asset for the particular personalized channel, possibly in consultation with the live/linear programming schedules <b>212</b>, the metadata <b>214</b>, the recommendation system(s) <b>216</b> and/or the user profiles <b>218</b>. The PEC <b>210</b> then returns the appropriate URL for the selected VOD asset. Likewise, at 4b, the MDC <b>230</b> may identify an advertisement marker in the manifest for the base linear stream and in response obtains a URL from the ad decision system <b>240</b> for the URL for an advertisement that is to be inserted at some particular time in the video stream. Finally, the MDC <b>230</b> may determine from an alternative content marker that an upcoming live event is scheduled at a certain time and requests and receives the URL for this live event from the BLSC <b>220</b> at 4c. In this case the BLSC <b>220</b> is acting as an alternative content decision service that provides the URL for the live event. Of course, in other implementations, the MDC <b>230</b> may be directed to a different alternative content decision service to get the URL for the live event.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Once the MDC <b>230</b> has obtained the URLs for the various assets and events, it sends an HTTP GET request or the like over, e.g., the CDN <b>125</b>, to obtain their manifests at 5. The MDC <b>230</b> receives the manifests at 6 and assembles them into a rolling manifest that may be delivered as a rolling manifest to the requesting ABR client device(s) <b>102</b> at 7, thereby appearing to the ABR client device(s) <b>102</b> as a linear stream. The ABR client device(s) <b>102</b> is thus able to use the rolling manifest to obtain the media over the CDN <b>125</b> in a conventional manner at 8.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some cases the PEC <b>210</b> may instruct the BLSC <b>220</b> to update the base linear stream so that the client devices receiving the personalized channel are presented with a particular live/linear event instead of the content asset currently being presented or soon to be presented on the personalized channel. The PEC may also be responsible for tracking the content that is scheduled for presentation on the personalized channels to ensure their availability. If, for instance, access to the content is to expire before the time it is scheduled for presentation (due, for example, due to the expiration of a limited rights period to the content), the PEC may trigger a request to record the content on a network digital video recorder (DVR) or the like so that it remains accessible for presentation on the personalized channel. Such a recording may also be triggered if the user indicates that they wish to keep the content for subsequent viewing after the content is no longer available. In any case, once the content is no longer to be made available to users the PEC <b>210</b> will take the content out of the decisioning flows to remove it from any of the personalized channels on which it may be scheduled. The PEC <b>210</b> may also trigger the presentation of a notice to user that the content is no longer available.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">While in the example described above, the PEC <b>210</b> receives a request at 4a from the MDC <b>230</b> for the resolution to decision point in the ABR manifest, this request alternatively may be received from other systems and devices as well. For example, the request may be received directly from an application residing on a client device such as set top box or smartphone, or from a playout system such as a legacy TV network or satellite system.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of one example of a computing apparatus <b>400</b> that may be configured to implement or execute one or more of the processes performed by any of the various devices shown herein, including but not limited to the PEC <b>210</b> and BLSC <b>220</b>.
