num="0000">An implantable pump system is provided, suitable for use as a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) system, having an implantable pump, a battery, a controller, and a programmer. The implantable pump includes a flexible membrane coupled to an actuator assembly via a skirt that extends toward the inlet of the pump and curves to guide blood toward the outlet. The actuator assembly is magnetically engageable with electromagnetic coils, so that when the electromagnetic coils are energized, the actuator assembly causes wavelike undulations to propagate along the flexible membrane to propel blood from the inlet, across the skirt, and through the outlet of the implantable pump. The controller may be programmed by a programmer to operate at frequencies and duty cycles that mimic physiologic flow rates and pulsatility while operating in an efficient manner that avoids thrombus formation, hemolysis and/or platelet activation.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="228.09mm" wi="155.96mm"

Generally, the right-side heart receives oxygen-poor blood from the body into the right atrium and pumps it via the right ventricle to the lungs. The left-side heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs into the left atrium and pumps it via the left ventricle to the aorta for distribution throughout the body. Due to any of a number of illnesses, including coronary artery disease, high blood pressure (hypertension), valvular regurgitation and calcification, damage to the heart muscle as a result of infarction or ischemia, myocarditis, congenital heart defects, abnormal heart rhythms or various infectious diseases, the left ventricle may be rendered less effective and thus unable to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that about 5.1 million people in the United States suffer from some form of heart failure. Heart failure is generally categorized into four different stages with the most severe being end stage heart failure. End stage heart failure may be diagnosed where a patient has heart failure symptoms at rest in spite of medical treatment. Patients at this stage may have systolic heart failure, characterized by decreasing ejection fraction. In patients with systolic heart failure, the walls of the ventricle, which are typically thick in a healthy patient, become thin and weak. Consequently, during systole a reduced volume of oxygenated blood is ejected into circulation, a situation that continues in a downward spiral until death. A patient diagnosed with end stage heart failure has a one-year mortality rate of approximately 50%.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For patients that have reached end stage heart failure, treatment options are limited. In addition to continued use of drug therapy commonly prescribed during earlier stages of heart failure, the typical recommend is cardiac transplantation and implantation of a mechanical assist device. While a cardiac transplant may significantly prolong the patient's life beyond the one year mortality rate, patients frequently expire while on a waitlist for months and sometimes years awaiting a suitable donor heart. Presently, the only alternative to a cardiac transplant is a mechanical implant. While in recent years mechanical implants have improved in design, typically such implants will prolong a patient's life by a few years at most, and include a number of co-morbidities.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One type of mechanical implant often used for patients with end stage heart failure is a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). The LVAD is a surgically implanted pump that draws oxygenated blood from the left ventricle and pumps it directly to the aorta, thereby off-loading (reducing) the pumping work of the left ventricle. LVADs typically are used either as &#x201c;bridge-to-transplant therapy&#x201d; or &#x201c;destination therapy.&#x201d; When used for bridge-to-transplant therapy, the LVAD is used to prolong the life of a patient who is waiting for a heart transplant. When a patient is not suitable for a heart transplant, the LVAD may be used as a destination therapy to prolong the life, or improve the quality of life, of the patient, but generally such prolongation is for only a couple years.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Generally, a LVAD includes an inlet cannula, a pump, and an outlet cannula, and is coupled to an extracorporeal battery and control unit. The inlet cannula typically directly connected to the left ventricle, e.g., at the apex, and delivers blood from the left ventricle to the pump. The outlet cannula typically connected to the aorta distal to the aortic valve, delivers blood from the pump to the aorta. Typically, the outlet cannula of the pump is extended using a hose-type structure, such as a Dacron graft, to reach a proper delivery location on the aorta. Early LVAD designs were of the reciprocating type but more recently rotary and centrifugal pumps have been used.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 4,277,706 to Isaacson, entitled &#x201c;Actuator for Heart Pump,&#x201d; describes a LVAD having a reciprocating pump. The pump described in the Isaacson patent includes a housing having an inlet and an outlet, a cavity in the interior of the pump connected to the inlet and the outlet, a flexible diaphragm that extends across the cavity, a plate secured to the diaphragm, and a ball screw that is configured to be reciprocated to drive the plate and connected diaphragm from one end of the cavity to the other end to simulate systole and diastole. The ball screw is actuated by a direct current motor. The Isaacson patent also describes a controller configured to manage the revolutions of the ball screw to control the starting, stopping and reversal of directions to control blood flow in and out of the pump.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Previously-known reciprocating pump LVADs have a number of drawbacks. Such pumps often are bulky, heavy and may require removal of bones and tissue in the chest for implantation. They also require a significant amount of energy to displace the blood by compressing the cavity. Moreover, the pump subjects the blood to significant pressure fluctuations as it passes through the pump, resulting in high shear forces and risk of hemolysis. These pressure fluctuations may be exaggerated at higher blood flow rates. Further, depending on the geometry of the pump, areas of little or no flow may result in flow stagnation, which can lead to thrombus formation and potentially fatal medical conditions, such as stroke. Finally, the positive displacement pumps like the one described in the Isaacson patent are incapable of achieving pulsatility similar to that of the natural heart, e.g., roughly 60 to 100 beats per minute, while maintaining physiological pressure gradients.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">LVADs utilizing rotary and centrifugal configurations also are known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,608,088 to Reich, entitled &#x201c;Implantable Blood Pump,&#x201d; describes a centrifugal pump to assist a failing heart. The Reich patent describes a centrifugal pump having an inlet connected to a rigid cannula that is coupled to the left ventricular cavity and a Dacron graft extending from the pump diffuser to the aorta. A pump includes an impeller that is rotated at high speeds to accelerate blood, and simulated pulsations of the natural heart by changing rotation speeds or introducing a fluid oscillator.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">U.S. Pat. No. 5,370,509 to Golding, entitled &#x201c;Sealless Rotodynamic Pump with Fluid Bearing,&#x201d; describes an axial blood pump capable for use as a heart pump. One embodiment described involves an axial flow blood pump with impeller blades that are aligned with the axes of the blood inlet and blood outlet. U.S. Pat. No. 5,588,812 to Taylor, entitled &#x201c;Implantable Electrical Axial-Flow Blood Pump,&#x201d; describes an axial flow blood pump similar to that of the Golding patent. The pump described in the Taylor patent has a pump housing that defines a cylindrical blood conduit through which blood is pumped from the inlet to the outlet, and rotor blades that rotate along the axis of the pump to accelerate blood flowing through the blood conduit.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">While previously-known LVAD devices have improved, those pump designs are not without problems. Like reciprocating pumps, rotary and centrifugal pumps are often bulky and difficult to implant. Rotary pumps, while mechanically different from positive displacement pumps, also exhibit undesirable characteristics. Like positive displacement pumps, rotary pumps apply significant shear forces to the blood, thereby posing a risk of hemolysis and platelet activation. The very nature of a disk or blade rotating about an axis results in areas of high velocity and low velocity as well as vibration and heat generation. Specifically, the area near the edge of the disk or blade furthest from the axis of rotation experiences higher angular velocity and thus flow rate than the area closest to the axis of rotation. The resulting radial velocity profile along the rotating blade results in high shear forces being applied to the blood. In addition, stagnation or low flow rates near the axis of rotation may result in thrombus formation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">While centrifugal pumps may be capable generating pulsatile flow by varying the speed of rotation of the associated disk or blades, this only exacerbates the problems resulting from steep radial velocity profiles and high shear force. In common practice, the output of currently available rotary pumps, measured as flow rate against a given head pressure, is controlled by changing the rotational speed of the pump. Given the mass of the rotating member, the angular velocity of the rotating member, and the resulting inertia, a change in rotational speed cannot be instantaneous but instead must be gradual. Accordingly, while centrifugal pumps can mimic a pulsatile flow with gradual speed changes, the resulting pulse is not &#x201c;on-demand&#x201d; and does not resemble a typical physiological pulse.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, rotary pumps typically result in the application of non-physiologic pressures on the blood. Such high operating pressures have the unwanted effect of overextending blood vessels, which in the presence of continuous flow can cause the blood vessels to fibrose and become inelastic. This in turn can lead to loss of resilience in the circulatory system, promoting calcification and plaque formation. Further, if the rotational speed of a pump is varied to simulate pulsatile flow or increase flow rate, the rotary pump is less likely to be operated at its optimal operating point, reducing efficiency and increasing energy losses and heat generation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">LVADs may also be configured to increase blood flow to match the demand of the patient. Numerous publications and patents describe methods for adjusting LVAD pump flow to match that demanded by the patient. For example U.S. Pat. No. 7,520,850 to Brockway, entitled &#x201c;Feedback control and ventricular assist devices,&#x201d; describes systems and methods for employing pressure feedback to control a ventricular assist device. The system described in the Brockway patent attempts to maintain a constant filling of the ventricle by measuring ventricular pressure and/or ventricular volume. While such systems can achieve flow rates as high as 8 or 9 liters per minute, these flow rates generally are outside of the efficient range of operation for current rotary pumps, which are typically tuned to operate in a range of 4 to 6 liters per minute. Thus, increasing the flow rate in rotary pumps to match patient demanded results in non-optimal pump performance.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Pumps other than of the rotary and positive displacement types are known in the art for displacing fluid. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,361,284 and 6,659,740, both to Drevet, entitled &#x201c;Vibrating Membrane Fluid Circulator,&#x201d; describe pumps in which a deformable membrane is vibrated to propel fluid through a pump housing. In these patents, vibratory motion applied to the deformable membrane causes wave-like undulations in the membrane that propel the fluid along a channel. Different flow rates may be achieved by controlling the excitation applied to the membrane.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">U.S. Pat. No. 7,323,961 to Drevet, entitled &#x201c;Electromagnetic Machine with a Deformable Membrane,&#x201d; describes a device in which a membrane is coupled in tension along its outer edge to an electromagnetic device arranged to rotate around the membrane. As the electromagnetic device rotates, the outer edge of the membrane is deflected slightly in a direction normal to the plane of the membrane. These deflections induce a wave-like undulation in the membrane that may be used to move a fluid in contact with the membrane.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">U.S. Pat. No. 9,080,564 to Drevet, entitled &#x201c;Diaphragm Circulator,&#x201d; describes a tensioned deformable membrane in which undulations are created by electromechanically moving a magnetized ring, attached to an outer edge of a deformable membrane, over a coil. Axial displacement of magnetized ring causes undulations of membrane. Like in the '961 patent, the membrane undulations can be controlled by manipulating the magnetic attraction. U.S. Pat. No. 8,714,944 to Drevet, entitled &#x201c;Diaphragm pump with a Crinkle Diaphragm of Improved Efficiency&#x201d; and U.S. Pat. No. 8,834,136 to Drevet, entitled &#x201c;Crinkle Diaphragm Pump&#x201d; teach similar types of vibrating membrane pumps.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">None of the foregoing patents to Drevet describe a vibratory membrane pump suitable for use in a biological setting, or capable of pumping blood over extended periods that present a low risk of flow stagnation leading to thrombus formation.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2017/0290966 and 2017/0290967 to Botterbusch, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference, describe implantable cardiovascular blood pumps having a flexible membrane coupled to an electromagnetic actuator assembly that causes wavelike undulations to propagate along the flexible membrane to propel blood through the pump while avoiding thrombus formation, hemolysis and/or platelet activation. The Botterbusch pumps generate hydraulic power&#x2014;flow and pressure&#x2014;by translating the linear motion of the electromagnetic actuator, to the flexible membrane, which deforms through its interaction with the blood, translating energy to the blood. The flexible membrane is oriented at a 90&#xb0; angle to the motion of the linear actuator such that the outer edge of the membrane is the first element to engage the blood. As a result, there is a risk of energy loss at the inlet to the membrane, which affects the hydraulic power generation by the pump.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">What is needed is an energy efficient implantable pump having light weight, small size, and fast start and stop response that can operate efficiently and with improved hydraulic performance and minimal blood damage over a wide range of flow rates.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention overcomes the drawbacks of previously-known LVAD systems and methods by providing an implantable pump system having an undulating membrane capable of producing a wide range of physiological flow rates while applying low shear forces to the blood, thereby reducing hemolysis and platelet activation relative to previously-known systems.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the implantable blood pump system includes a housing having an inlet and an outlet for implantation at a patient's heart, a membrane disposed within the housing, a skirt disposed within the housing and coupled to the membrane, the skirt sized and shaped to extend toward the inlet and to curve toward the outlet, and an actuator disposed within the housing, wherein the actuator causes the membrane to reciprocate and deform in a wave-like manner. During operation of the pump system, blood enters the inlet, flows toward the skirt which guides the blood towards the membrane, and is propelled across the membrane to the outlet. For example, the skirt may have a J-shaped cross-section.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The bottom surface of the actuator and an interior portion of the housing adjacent the outlet may form a flow channel within which the membrane is suspended. In addition, the actuator and an interior surface of the housing adjacent the inlet may form a delivery channel extending from the inlet to the flow channel. Accordingly, the skirt may be disposed within the delivery channel such that during operation the skirt guides blood from the delivery channel to the flow channel while reducing recirculation of the blood. For example, during operation the skirt guides blood from the delivery channel to the flow channel such that blood is propelled evenly across the membrane.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the implantable blood pump system further includes a rigid ring fixed concentrically around the actuator, wherein the rigid ring is disposed within the delivery channel such that during operation the rigid ring guides blood from the delivery channel across the skirt to the flow channel while reducing recirculation of the blood. In addition, the skirt may include a plurality of bellows between the rigid ring and the curved portion of the skirt. The plurality of bellows expand and contract such that during operation the rigid ring guides blood from the delivery channel across the plurality of bellows and the skirt to the flow channel while reducing recirculation of the blood.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The actuator may include an electromagnet assembly that selectively generates a magnetic field. The implantable blood pump system further may include a magnetic ring coupled to the skirt, such that the magnetic ring is concentrically suspended around the actuator and reciprocates responsive to the magnetic field. For example, the electromagnet assembly may include first and second electromagnetic coils such that the magnetic ring is caused to move when at least one of the first or second electromagnetic coils is energized.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The implantable blood pump system also may include one or more suspension rings concentrically disposed around and coupled to the actuator and the magnetic ring to permit the magnetic ring to reciprocate over the actuator, wherein the magnetic ring is coupled to each of the skirt and the one or more suspension rings by a plurality of posts. The one or more suspension rings exert a spring force on the magnetic ring when the magnetic ring reciprocates over the actuator. In addition, the implantable blood pump system may include a fixation ring concentrically coupled to the actuator, such that the fixation ring anchors the actuator within the housing.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the inlet of the housing is coupled to an inflow cannula, and the outlet of the housing is coupled to an outflow cannula, wherein the outflow cannula is disposed coaxially within the inflow cannula.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The implantable blood pump system also may include a rechargeable battery for energizing the implantable blood pump, and an extracorporeal controller operatively coupled in electrical communication with the actuator via a transcutaneous cable, the extracorporeal controller comprising a power connector that may be operatively coupled in electrical communication with the rechargeable battery. In addition, the implantable blood pump system may include an extension cable having a first end that is operatively coupled in electrical communication with the power connector of the extracorporeal controller, and a second end that is operatively coupled in electrical communication with the rechargeable battery. Accordingly, the power connector of the extracorporeal controller may be operatively coupled in electrical communication with the rechargeable battery remotely via the extension cable. The extracorporeal controller may be programmed to operate the actuator to cause the membrane to reciprocate and deform in a wave-like manner to propel blood from the inlet across the skirt to the outlet with a pulsatile flow. The implantable blood pump system also may include a programmer that communicates with the controller to set and change operating parameters of the actuator.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a blood pump for use in a patient is provided. The blood pump may include an implantable housing having an inlet, an outlet, and a longitudinal axis, the implantable housing defining a delivery channel parallel to the longitudinal axis and a flow channel perpendicular to the longitudinal axis, an actuator system disposed within the implantable housing comprising a stationary component and a moving component, the moving component concentrically suspended around the stationary component, a membrane disposed within the implantable housing, and a skirt coupled to the moving component and the membrane, the skirt sized and shaped to extend in the delivery channel toward the inlet and to curve into the flow channel toward the outlet. The actuator system selectively generates a magnetic field that causes the moving component to reciprocate at a predetermined frequency and amplitude relative to the stationary component, thereby causing blood flow to enter the implantable housing via the inlet, divide in the delivery channel around the skirt, and curve toward the flow channel across the membrane to the outlet. For example, the actuator system may include first and second electromagnetic coils such that the moving component, e.g., a magnetic ring, is caused to move when at least one of the first or second electromagnetic coils is energized.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

ventricular assist device (LVAD), and includes an undulating membrane pump suitable for long-term implantation in a patient having end term heart failure. An implantable pump system constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention includes an implantable pump and an extracorporeal battery, controller and programmer. The implantable pump includes a housing having an inlet, and outlet, a flexible membrane, and an actuator assembly. When configured as an LVAD, the housing includes an inlet cannula that is inserted into a patient's left ventricle near the apex and an outlet cannula that is surgically placed in fluid communication with the patient's aorta. By activating the actuator assembly within the implantable pump, membrane is induced to undulate, thereby causing blood to be drawn into the pump through the inlet cannula and expelled through the outlet cannula into the aorta. Flow rate and pulsatility may be manipulated by changing one or more of the frequency, amplitude and duty cycle of the actuator assembly.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">For improved hydraulic performance, the implantable pump may include a skirt disposed within the housing to guide blood flow from the inlet of the pump towards the outlet. The skirt may be positioned within the housing such that blood flows across opposing sides of the skirt and towards the undulating membrane upon activation of the pump.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, pump system <b>10</b> constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention is described.

Magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> may be rigidly coupled to the suspension rings by more than one post <b>81</b> spaced evenly around actuator assembly <b>95</b> and configured to extend parallel to a central axis of pump assembly <b>70</b>.

The direction of the current in electromagnetic coil <b>77</b> and the polarity of magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> nearest electromagnetic coil <b>77</b> may be configured such that the first electromagnetic coil magnetically attracts or repeals magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> as desired. Similarly, a magnetic field may be created in second electromagnetic coil <b>78</b> by introducing a current in the second electromagnetic coil. The direction of the current in second electromagnetic coil <b>78</b> and the polarity of magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> nearest the second electromagnetic coil also may be similarly configured so that first electromagnetic coil <b>77</b> magnetically attracts or repels magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> when an appropriate current is induced in second electromagnetic coil <b>78</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Because magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> may be rigidly affixed to posts <b>81</b>, which in turn may be rigidly affixed to first suspension ring <b>79</b> and second suspension ring <b>80</b>, the elastic properties of the suspension rings permit magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> to move up towards first electromagnetic coil <b>77</b> or downward toward second electromagnetic coil <b>78</b>, depending upon the polarity of magnetic fields generated by the electromagnetic rings. In this manner, when magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> experiences an upward magnetic force, magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> deflects upward towards first electromagnetic coil <b>77</b>. As posts <b>81</b> move upward with magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b>, posts <b>81</b> cause the suspensions rings <b>79</b> and <b>80</b> to elastically deform, which creates a spring force opposite to the direction of movement. When the magnetic field generated by the first electromagnetic coil collapses, when the electrical current ceases, this downward spring force causes the magnetic ring assembly to return to its neutral position. Similarly, when magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> is magnetically attracted downward, magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> deflects downward towards second electromagnetic ring <b>78</b>. As posts <b>81</b> move downward with magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b>, posts <b>81</b> impose an elastic deformation of the first and second suspension rings, thus generating a spring force in the opposite direction. When the magnetic field generated by the second electromagnetic ring collapses, when the electrical current ceases, this upward spring force causes the magnetic ring assembly to again return to its neutral position.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Electromagnetic coils <b>77</b> and <b>78</b> may be energized separately, or alternatively, may be connected in series to cause the electromagnetic coils to be activated simultaneously. In this configuration, first magnetic coil may be configured to experience a current flow direction opposite that of the second electromagnetic coil. Accordingly, when current is induced to first electromagnetic coil <b>77</b> to attract magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b>, the same current is applied to second electromagnetic coil <b>78</b> to induce a current that causes second electromagnetic coil <b>78</b> to repel magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b>. Similarly, when current is induced to second electromagnetic coil <b>78</b> to attract magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b>, the current applied to first electromagnetic coil <b>77</b> causes the first electromagnetic coil to repel magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b>. In this manner, electromagnetic coils <b>77</b> and <b>78</b> work together to cause deflection of magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">By manipulating the timing and intensity of the electrical signals applied to the electromagnetic coils, the frequency at which magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> deflects towards the first and second electromagnetic coils may be altered. For example, by alternating the current induced in the electromagnetic coils more frequently, the magnetic ring assembly may be caused to cycle up and down more times in a given period. By increasing the amount of current, the magnetic ring assembly may be deflected at a faster rate and caused to travel longer distances.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Alternatively, first electromagnetic coil <b>77</b> and second electromagnetic coil <b>78</b> may be energized independently. For example, first electromagnetic coil <b>77</b> and second electromagnetic coil <b>78</b> may be energized at varying intensities; one may be coordinated to decrease intensity as the other increases intensity. In this manner, intensity of the signal applied to second electromagnetic coil <b>78</b> to cause downward magnetic attraction may simultaneously be increased as the intensity of the signal applied to first electromagnetic coil <b>77</b> causes an upward magnetic attraction that decreases.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, movements of magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> may be translated to membrane assembly <b>82</b> which may be disposed concentrically below stator assembly <b>72</b>. Membrane assembly <b>82</b> preferably is rigidly attached to magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> by posts <b>81</b>. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, posts <b>81</b> may extend beyond second suspension ring <b>80</b> and coupled to membrane assembly <b>82</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, one embodiment of membrane assembly <b>82</b> is described in greater detail. Membrane assembly <b>82</b> may comprise rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> and membrane <b>97</b>. Rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> exhibits rigid properties under typical forces experienced during the full range of operation of the present invention. Post reception sites <b>98</b> may be formed into rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> to engage membrane assembly <b>82</b> with posts <b>81</b>. Alternatively, posts <b>81</b> may be attached to rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> in any other way which directly translates the motion of magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> to rigid membrane ring <b>96</b>. Rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> may be affixed to membrane <b>97</b> and hold the membrane in tension. Membrane <b>97</b> may be molded directly onto rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> or may be affixed to rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> in any way that holds membrane <b>97</b> uniformly in tension along its circumference. Membrane <b>97</b> alternatively may include a flexible pleated structure where it attaches to rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> to increase the ability of the membrane to move where the membrane is affixed to rigid membrane ring <b>96</b>. Membrane <b>97</b> may further include circular aperture <b>99</b> disposed in the center of the membrane.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In a preferred embodiment, membrane <b>97</b> has a thin, planar shape and is made of an elastomer having elastic properties and good durability. Alternatively, membrane <b>97</b> may have a uniform thickness from the membrane ring to the circular aperture. As a yet further alternative, membrane <b>97</b> may vary in thickness and exhibit more complex geometries. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, membrane <b>97</b> may have a reduced thickness as the membrane extends from rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> to circular aperture <b>99</b>. Alternatively, or in addition to, membrane <b>97</b> may incorporate metallic elements such as a spiral spring to enhance the spring force of the membrane in a direction normal to plane of the membrane, and this spring force may vary radially along the membrane. In yet another embodiment, membrane <b>97</b> may be pre-formed with an undulating shape.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> depicts moving portions of the embodiment of pump assembly <b>70</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>9</b></figref> as non-grayed out elements. Non-moving portions of the pump assembly, including actuator assembly <b>95</b> and electromagnet assembly <b>91</b> (partially shown) may be fixed to pump housing <b>27</b> by fixation ring <b>71</b>. Moving portions of pump assembly <b>70</b> may include posts <b>81</b>, first suspension spring <b>79</b>, magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b>, second suspension spring <b>80</b> and membrane assembly <b>82</b>. As magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> moves up and down, the movement is rigidly translated by posts <b>81</b> to membrane assembly <b>82</b>. Given the rigidity of the posts, when magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> travels a certain distance upward or downward, membrane assembly <b>82</b> may travel the same distance. For example, when magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> travels 2 mm from a position near first electromagnetic coil <b>77</b> to a position near second electromagnetic coil <b>78</b>, membrane assembly <b>82</b> may also travel 2 mm in the same direction. Similarly, the frequency at which magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> traverses the space between the first and second electromagnetic coils may be the same frequency at which membrane assembly <b>82</b> travels the same distance.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, in the embodiment of implantable pump <b>20</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, blood may enter implantable pump <b>20</b> from the left ventricle through inlet cannula <b>21</b> and flow downward along pump assembly <b>70</b> into delivery channel <b>100</b>, defined by the interior surface of pump housing <b>27</b> and exterior of pump assembly <b>70</b>. Delivery channel <b>100</b> begins at the top of stator assembly <b>72</b> and extends between tapered section <b>83</b> and the interior of pump housing <b>27</b>. As the blood moves down tapered section <b>83</b>, it is directed through gap <b>74</b> and into a vertical portion of delivery channel <b>100</b> in the area between pump housing <b>27</b> and actuator assembly <b>95</b>, and including in the gap between magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> and electromagnet assembly <b>91</b>. Delivery channel <b>100</b> extends down to flanged portion <b>87</b> of stator assembly <b>72</b>, which routes blood into flow channel <b>101</b>, within which membrane assembly <b>82</b> is suspended. By directing blood from inlet cannula <b>21</b> through delivery channel <b>100</b> to flow channel <b>101</b>, delivery channel <b>100</b> delivers blood to membrane assembly <b>82</b>. By actuating electromagnetic coils <b>77</b> and <b>78</b>, membrane <b>97</b> may be undulated within flow channel <b>101</b> to induce wavelike formations in membrane <b>97</b> that move from the edge of the membrane towards circular aperture <b>99</b>. Accordingly, when blood is delivered to membrane assembly <b>82</b> from delivery channel <b>100</b>, it may be propelled radially along both the top and bottom of membrane <b>97</b> towards circular aperture <b>99</b>, and from there out of outlet <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the undulating membrane pump described herein avoids thrombus formation by placing all moving parts directly within the primary flow path, thereby reducing the risk of flow stagnation.

Flow stagnation may further be avoided by eliminating secondary flow paths that may experience significantly slower flow rates.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref>, a lower portion of implantable pump <b>20</b>, including flanged portion <b>87</b>, membrane assembly <b>82</b> and lower housing portion <b>23</b> is shown.

The interior surface of lower housing portion <b>25</b> may also slope upward as it extends radially inward. The combination of the upward slope of the interior surface of lower housing portion <b>25</b> and the bottom surface of flanged portion <b>87</b> moving downward narrows flow channel <b>101</b> as the channel moves radially inwards from delivery channel <b>100</b> to circular aperture <b>99</b> of membrane <b>97</b>, which is disposed about pump outlet <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">As explained above, membrane assembly <b>82</b> may be suspended by posts <b>81</b> within flow channel <b>101</b> below the bottom surface of flanged portion <b>87</b> and above the interior surface of lower housing portion <b>25</b>. Membrane assembly <b>82</b> may be free to move up and down in the vertical direction within flow channel <b>101</b>, which movement is constrained only by suspension rings <b>79</b> and <b>80</b>. Membrane assembly <b>82</b> may be constrained from twisting, tilting or moving in any direction in flow channel <b>101</b> other than up and down by rigid posts <b>81</b> and by the suspension rings.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Flow channel <b>101</b> is divided by membrane <b>97</b> into an upper flow channel and a lower flow channel by membrane <b>97</b>.

Alternatively, membrane <b>97</b> may be sized and shaped such that when membrane assembly <b>82</b> is at rest, the upper and lower flow channels narrow as they move radially inward from delivery channel <b>100</b> to circular aperture <b>99</b> in membrane <b>97</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Referring now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, as rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> is caused by posts <b>81</b> to move up and down in flow channel <b>101</b>, the outermost portion of membrane <b>97</b> nearest rigid membrane ring <b>96</b>, moves up and down with rigid membrane ring <b>96</b>. Membrane <b>97</b>, being flexible and having elastic properties, gradually translates the up and down movement of the membrane portion nearest rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> along membrane <b>97</b> towards circular aperture <b>99</b>. This movement across flexible membrane <b>97</b> causes wavelike deformations in the membrane which may propagate inwards from rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> towards aperture <b>99</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The waves formed in the undulating membrane may be manipulated by changing the speed at which rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> moves up and down as well as the distance rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> moves up and down. As explained above, the amplitude and frequency at which rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> moves up and down is determined by the amplitude and frequency at which magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> reciprocates over electromagnet assembly <b>91</b> Accordingly, the waves formed in the undulating membrane may be adjusted by changing the frequency and amplitude at which magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> is reciprocated.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">When blood is introduced into flow channel <b>101</b> from delivery channel <b>100</b>, the undulations in membrane <b>97</b> cause blood to be propelled toward circular aperture <b>99</b> and out of pump housing <b>27</b> via outlet <b>23</b>. The transfer of energy from the membrane to the blood is directed radially inward along the length of the membrane towards aperture <b>99</b>, and propels the blood along the flow channel towards outlet <b>23</b> along both sides of membrane <b>97</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">For example, when rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> moves downward in unison with magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b>, the upper portion of flow channel <b>101</b> near delivery channel <b>100</b> expands, causing blood from delivery channel <b>100</b> to fill the upper portion of the flow channel near the outer region of membrane <b>97</b>. As rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> moves upward, the upper portion of flow channel <b>101</b> begins to narrow near rigid membrane ring <b>96</b>, causing wave-like deformations to translate across the membrane. As the wave propagates across membrane <b>97</b>, blood in the upper portion of flow channel <b>101</b> is propelled towards circular aperture and ultimately out of pump housing <b>27</b> through outlet <b>23</b>. Simultaneously, as rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> moves upwards, the lower portion of flow channel <b>101</b> nearest the outer portion of membrane <b>97</b> begins to enlarge, allowing blood from delivery channel <b>100</b> to flow into this region. Subsequently, when rigid membrane ring <b>96</b> is again thrust downwards, the region of lower portion of flow channel <b>101</b> nearest outer portion of membrane <b>97</b> begins to narrow, causing wave-like deformations to translate across the membrane that propel blood towards outlet <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">By manipulating the waves formed in the undulating membrane by changing the frequency and amplitude at which magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> moves up and down, the pressure gradient within flow channel <b>101</b> and ultimately the flow rate of the blood moving through flow channel <b>101</b> may be adjusted. Appropriately controlling the movement of magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> permits oxygen-rich blood to be effectively and safely pumped from the left ventricle to the aorta and throughout the body as needed.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In addition to merely pumping blood from the left ventricle to the aorta, implantable pump <b>20</b> of the present invention may be operated to closely mimic physiologic pulsatility, without loss of pump efficiency. In the embodiment detailed above, pulsatility may be achieved nearly instantaneously by changing the frequency and amplitude at which magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b> moves, to create a desired flow output, or by ceasing movement of the magnetic ring assembly for a period time to create a period of low or no flow output. Unlike typical rotary pumps, which require a certain period of time to attain a set number of rotations per minute to achieve a desired fluid displacement and pulsatility, implantable pump <b>20</b> may achieve a desired flow output nearly instantaneously and similarly may cease output nearly instantaneously due to the very low inertia generated by the small moving mass of the moving components of the pump assembly. The ability to start and stop on-demand permits rapid changes in pressure and flow. Along with the frequency and amplitude, the duty cycle, defined by the percentage of time membrane <b>97</b> is excited over a set period of time, may be adjusted to achieve a desired flow output and pulsatility, without loss of pump efficiency. Even holding frequency and amplitude constant, flow rate may be altered by manipulating the duty cycle between 0 and 100%.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, controller <b>30</b> may be programmed by programmer <b>50</b> to operate at selected frequencies, amplitudes and duty cycles to achieve a wide range of physiologic flow rates and with physiologic pulsatilities. For example, programmer <b>50</b> may direct controller <b>30</b> to operate implantable pump <b>20</b> at a given frequency, amplitude and/or duty cycle during a period of time when a patient is typically sleeping and may direct controller <b>30</b> to operate implantable pump <b>20</b> at a different frequency, amplitude and or duty cycle during time periods when the patient is typically awake. Controller <b>30</b> or implantable pump also may include an accelerometer or position indicator to determine whether the patient is supine or ambulatory, the output of which may be used to move from one set of pump operating parameters to another. When the patient experiences certain discomfort or a physician determines that the parameters are not optimized, physician may alter one or more of at least frequency, amplitude and duty cycle to achieve the desired functionality. Alternatively, controller <b>30</b> or mobile device <b>60</b> may be configured to alter one or more of frequency, amplitude and duty cycle to suit the patient's needs.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Implantable pump <b>20</b> further may comprise one or more additional sensors for adjusting flow output and pulsatility according to the demand of the patient. Sensors may be incorporated into implantable pump <b>20</b> or alternatively or in addition to may be implanted elsewhere in or on the patient. The sensors preferably are in electrical communication with controller <b>30</b>, and may monitor operational parameters that measure the performance of implantable pump <b>20</b> or physiological sensors that measure physiological parameters of the patients such as heart rate or blood pressure. By using one or more physiological sensors, pulsatile flow may be synchronized with a cardiac cycle of the patient by monitoring blood pressure or muscle contractions, for example, and synchronizing the duty cycle according to the sensed output.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Controller <b>30</b> may compare physiological sensor measurements to current implantable pump output. If it is determined by analyzing sensor measurements that demand exceeds current output, frequency, amplitude and/or duty cycle may be automatically adjusted to meet current demand. Similarly, the controller may determine that current output exceeds demand and thus alter output by changing frequency, amplitude and/or duty cycle. Alternatively, or in addition to, when it is determined that demand exceeds current output, an alarm may sound from controller <b>30</b>. Similarly, operational measurements from operational sensors may be compared against predetermined thresholds and where measurements exceed predetermined thresholds or a malfunction is detected, an alarm may sound from controller <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Implantable pump <b>20</b> is sized and shaped to produce physiological flow rates, pressure gradients and pulsatility at an operating point at which maximum efficiency is achieved. Specially, implantable pump <b>20</b> may be sized and shaped to produce physiological flow rates ranging from 4 to 6 liters per minute at pressure gradients lower than a threshold value associated with hemolysis. Also, to mimic a typical physiological pulse of 60 beats per minute, implantable pump <b>20</b> may pulse about once per second. To achieve such pulsatility, a duty cycle of 50% may be utilized with an &#x201c;on&#x201d; period of 0.5 seconds and an &#x201c;off&#x201d; period of 0.5 seconds. For a given system, maximum efficiency at a specific operating frequency, amplitude and voltage may be achieved while producing a flow rate of 4 to 6 liters per minute at a duty cycle of 50% by manipulating one or more of the shape and size of blood flow channels, elastic properties of the suspension rings, mass of the moving parts, membrane geometries, and elastic properties and friction properties of the membrane. In this manner, implantable pump <b>20</b> may be designed to produce desirable physiological outputs while continuing to function at optimum operating parameters.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">By adjusting the duty cycle, implantable pump <b>20</b> may be configured to generate a wide range of output flows at physiological pressure gradients. For example, for an exemplary LVAD system configured to produce 4 to 6 liters per minute at a duty cycle of 50%, optimal operating frequency may be 120 Hz. For this system, flow output may be increased to 10 liters per minute or decreased to 4 liters per minute, for example, by changing only the duty cycle. As duty cycle and frequency operate independent of one another, duty cycle may be manipulated between 0 and 100% while leaving the frequency of 120 Hz unaffected.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The implantable pump system described herein, tuned to achieve physiological flow rates, pressure gradients and pulsatility, also avoids hemolysis and platelet activation by applying low to moderate shear forces on the blood, similar to those exerted by a healthy heart. The moving components are rigidly affixed to one another and do not incorporate any parts that would induce friction, such as mechanical bearings or gears. In the embodiment detailed above, delivery channel <b>100</b> may be sized and configured to also avoid friction between moving magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b>, suspension rings <b>79</b> and <b>80</b>, posts <b>81</b> and lower housing portion <b>25</b> by sizing the channel such that clearances of at least 0.5 mm are maintained between all moving components. Similarly, magnetic ring assembly <b>76</b>, suspension rings <b>79</b> and <b>80</b>, and posts <b>81</b> all may be offset from stator assembly <b>72</b> by at least 0.5 mm to avoid friction between the stator assembly and the moving parts.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B</figref>, an alternative exemplary embodiment of the pump assembly of the present invention is described.

As the height of the vertical portion of the skirt increases, the maximum hydraulic power of the pump increases at a non-linear rate. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, operation of a pump having a planar rigid membrane ring at 60 Hz results in a maximum of 0.15 W of hydraulic power, at 90 Hz results in a maximum of 0.47 W of hydraulic power, and at 120 Hz results in a maximum of 1.42 W of hydraulic power. Operation of a pump having a skirt with an extension height of 2 mm, measured from the top surface of the membrane ring to the top of the J-shaped skirt, at 60 Hz results in a maximum of 0.16 W of hydraulic power, at 90 Hz results in a maximum of 0.85 W of hydraulic power, and at 120 Hz results in a maximum of 1.54 W of hydraulic power. Operation of a pump having a skirt with an extension height of 4 mm at 60 Hz results in a maximum of 0.43 W of hydraulic power, at 90 Hz results in a maximum of 1.06 W of hydraulic power, and at 120 Hz results in a maximum of 2.44 W of hydraulic power. Operation of a pump having a skirt with an extension height of 10 mm at 60 Hz results in a maximum of 0.75 W of hydraulic power, at 90 Hz results in a maximum of 1.89 W of hydraulic power, and at 120 Hz results in a maximum of 4.03 W of hydraulic power. Operation of a pump having a skirt with an extension height of 18 mm at 60 Hz results in a maximum of 1.16 W of hydraulic power, at 90 Hz results in a maximum of 3.08 W of hydraulic power, and at 120 Hz results in a maximum of 9.13 W of hydraulic power.
