It is a Block P, Period 2, nonmetallic element. The well-known forms of carbon are diamond, graphite and amorphous carbon. Modeling of new carbon allotropes is known and the SACADA (Samara Carbon Allotrope Database) has registered more than 500 hypothetical allotropes.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Carbon-based nanostructures are a group of promising materials for various technologies, biotechnologies, and medicine. Carbon-based nanostructures are used for coating biomaterials designed for hard tissue implantation, biosensors and drug delivery systems. The most famous allotropes used in nanotechnology are nanodiamonds (NDs), graphite and various crystallographic structures of fullerene.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Carbon-based nanomaterials can be toxic and their toxicity is particle size-dependent. Cytotoxicity is enhanced when the surface of the particles is functionalized after an acidic treatment. The mechanisms of toxicity include oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, malignant cell transformation, DNA damage and mutation, formation of granulomas, and interstitial fibrosis.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As nanoparticles of graphite, graphene, and fullerenes are well known, NDs give rise to more and more publications each year, for very diverse purposes. As suggested by their name, NDs are Nano-scaled diamonds, i.e. diamonds with a size smaller than 100 nm.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Despite their chemical identity, there are differences between a diamond and a Nano-diamond.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A diamond is an assembly of sp3 hybridized carbon atoms, ordered in a very stable face-centered cubic crystal structure. Diamonds are famous for their physical qualities, most of which originate from the strong covalent bonding between its carbon atoms. Due to their thermodynamic stability, diamonds are inert towards any chemical reaction.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In contrast, NDs are more prone to react with other materials for two main reasons. The first reason is that being small particles (4-10 nm), NDs have a very large surface area. The second reason is that NDs are covered by a shell of reactive impurities: mostly non-sp3 carbons, but also diverse functional groups. The nature and the quantity of these functional groups depend on the fabrication method, and on the confinement conditions of the product.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">There are several techniques for turning carbon into its allotropic diamond and tons of artificial diamonds are fabricated every year. Some of the techniques are: plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD), autoclave synthesis from supercritical fluids, and electron irradiation of carbon &#x2018;onions&#x2019;. In the artificial diamond industry, the three main methods used are detonation, laser ablation, and high-pressure high-temperature.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Synthesis of NDs by detonation is used to produce the majority of the synthetic NDs in the world. NDs produced by detonation are referred to as dNDs. In the detonation method, explosives are detonated in a closed metallic chamber under N<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>O atmosphere. After detonation, diamond-containing soot is collected from the bottom and the walls of the chamber and purified by oxidation to remove non-diamond carbons, followed by an HCl treatment to remove non-carbon impurities. The detonation process relies on the fact that graphite is the most stable phase of carbon at low pressures, and diamond&#x2014;at high pressures. Both phases melt when the temperature reaches 4,500 K. For Nano-scaled carbon, the liquid-solid transition can be reached at lower temperatures. During detonation, the pressure and temperature rise instantaneously, reaching the region of liquid carbon and clusters of 1-2 nm are formed. The nanoclusters further coalesce into larger liquid droplets and crystallize to nanoparticles. As long as the reaction stays above the diamond&#x2014;graphite equilibrium line, only diamond particles are formed.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">NDs share some important properties with diamonds including chemical stability, superior hardness (Young's modulus of 1050-1210 GPa), specific optical properties and fluorescence, high thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity, chemical stability, and resistance to extreme contact conditions.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">NDs have been studied both in vitro and in vivo. NDs have low pulmonary toxicity and intravenously administered Nanodiamond complexes at high dosages do not change serum indicators of liver and systemic toxicity. In general, NDs are biocompatible.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Unlike diamonds, NDs tend to bind together into stable aggregates. NDs aggregate into clusters of diamond nanoparticles surrounded by impurities, such as graphene and soot, perhaps due to the high hydrophobicity of dNDs surface.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">NDs are commonly used as abrasives, binders for tools, lubricants, metal-ND coating agents, bulk composites, and polymer film coatings. Known surface treatments of NDS include homogenization by treatment with strong acids and/or by hydrogenation, carboxylation (often as an intermediate step in further modification).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">NDs have a truncated Octahedron Structure which makes them promising candidates for drug delivery. Molecules of different characters can be attached to different facets of the ND, making it ideal for delivery of multifunctional drugs, or as solubility agents of non-soluble molecules. Sustained release of a drug can be achieved by binding its molecules to the surface through linkers with different affinities. Out of all carbon allotropes, NDs have the highest cell uptake efficiency. Moreover, cell uptake efficiency is tunable by altering the size and charge of the particle. NDs are also used as bioanalytical tools for chromatography, solid phase sorbents for detoxification and separation [26], biochips and sensors.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">One aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to creating stable dispersions of NDs.

For example, the experimental examples herein below demonstrate that pretreatment of NDs with an inorganic surface agent such as CAN contributes at an ability of the NDs to bind organic compounds (e.g. PEI and/or HA). NDs surface treated with CAN are expected to find utility in a wide variety of biotechnology and/or medical applications. For example, the CAN treated NDs can be used for coating biomaterials designed for hard tissue implantation, biosensors and drug delivery system.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some exemplary embodiments of the invention, molecules of different types attached to different facets of the ND as a way to deliver multifunctional drugs, or as solubility agents for non-soluble molecules. Alternatively or additionally, in some embodiments sustained release of a drug is achieved by binding drug molecules to the ND surface using linkers with different affinities. Out of all carbon allotropes, NDs have the highest cell uptake efficiency. Moreover, cell uptake efficiency is tunable by altering the size and charge of the ND particles.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some exemplary embodiments of the invention, multiple chemical moieties are attached to an ND. For example, the experimental examples hereinbebolow demonstrate attachment of CAN to NDs followed by attachment of PEI.

In order to make the individual ND surfaces available for coating an initial disaggregation step was implemented. Four disaggregation methods were tested.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">Disaggregation by Ultrasonication: 5 mg of detonation NDs (dNDs) were dispersed in 10 ml ddH2O in a three-neck probe-ultrasonication vessel and placed in an ultrasonicator under a nitrogen atmosphere (to avoid air oxidation) for 1 hour/30% Amplitude.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">Disaggregation by Oxidation: It has been reported that oxidation by heat decreased dND aggregates size to approximately 50 nm diameter.

Oxidation should lead to the formation of hydrophilic groups on the surface of dNDs, improving their dispensability in water. Yet, oxidation can also have a side effect in the form of hydrogen bonds, causing a secondary aggregation. Samples of all disaggregation treatments were characterized by DLS. The oxidized ones were additionally characterized by FTIR, Raman, and potential (zeta potential).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows FTIR spectra of dNDs (SA-dNDs,), Graphitized-oxidized dNDs (GrOx-dNDs,), and Oxidized dND (Ox-dNDs). FTIR absorbance spectra (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the pristine dNDs (SA-dNDs) and the two oxidized samples (Ox-dNDs and GrOx-dNDs) look similar, having peaks at the same positions but with different intensities. The spectra suggest the presence of primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols having their O&#x2014;H stretch peaks 3600 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, their C&#x2014;O stretch peaks at 780-800 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 1050-1150 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and their O&#x2014;H bending peaks at &#x2dc;1350 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. These results suggest some level of surface oxidation, even prior to the treatments (as evidenced by SA-dNDs plot). Nonetheless, there are a few noteworthy differences between the spectra. The ratio between the peak at approximately 1100 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and the rest of the spectrum is noticeably higher for the oxidized samples. This peak is assigned to alcoholic and etheric C&#x2014;O stretches. In all spectra, there are two overlapping peaks at the C&#x2014;H stretching zone (2750-3000 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). One of which, at approximately 2800 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>may be assigned to the C&#x2014;H stretch in &#x2014;O&#x2014;C&#x2014;H groups. The other, at approximately 3000 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, may be assigned to aliphatic C&#x2014;H stretches. The latter is slightly higher for the spectrum of the Graphitization-Oxidation sample (GrOx-dNDs), which make sense, as graphitization is a reductive process.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0101">The oxidation of the dNDs surface is confirmed by Raman (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows Raman spectra of pristine dNDs (SA-dNDs), Graphitization-Oxidation dNDs (GrOx-dNDs), and Oxidation dNDs (Ox-dNDs).

While the absolute value of the &#x3b6;-potential is usually used as an indicator for stability of colloidal solutions, a change of sign after treatment can result from a chemical change in the surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows &#x3b6;-potential data for samples Ox-dNDs, GrOx-dNDs, and SA-dNDs. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> demonstrates such a change of sign: pristine dNDs have a &#x3b6;-potential of +26.4 mV and after oxidation the value becomes negative (&#x2212;15.2 mV and &#x2212;16.7mV for Ox-dNDs and GrOx-dNDs, respectively). The &#x3b6;-potential of dNDs is reportedly about +20 eV. Positive &#x3b6;-potential values in dNDs can be attributed to the presence of graphitic planes impurities at the surface, which leave oxygen-free Lewis sites, thus promoting the suppression of acidic functional groups. This explains why, although the FTIR spectra show the presence of oxygen-containing groups on the pristine dNDs, the &#x3b6;-potential is significantly positive. After treatment, the quantity of surface oxygens increases dramatically, making the net charge of the dNDs negative.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows DLS particle size data for pristine NDs and for deagglomerated NDs. DLS measurements describe the evolution of the aggregate size following different treatments. All the treatments resulted in size reduction with a maximum of 80% for Ultrasonication. Still, the size of dNDs clusters remained above the nanometric domain (1-100 nm). This obstacle was circumvented by the Ultrasonication-Centrifugation treatment, which resulted in a transparent solution of ultradispersed 10-20 nm (HR-SEM, not shown) 200-300 nm (DLS, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) sized NPs. The difference between the size in DLS and in HR-SEM is due to the fact that the DLS measures the hydrodynamic diameter of NPs in solution while HR-SEM measures the real size of the dry NPs.

This weight loss can be attributed to surface impurities, some of which are embedded in the dNDs aggregates. The CAN-modified f-dNDs show a 16% weight loss. Since the samples were heated up to 800&#xb0; C., and that the diamond core of the ND does not melt below 3550&#xb0; C., the 7% weight loss difference must originate from the outer shell; it indicates the presence of CAN molecules or residues.

Bending vibrations of amine groups contribute in the region around 1450-1650 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and are especially intense in the case of PEI (1456 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). The absorptions at 1040-1070 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>are associated with C&#x2014;N stretch. From the spectra it seems that PEI is attached to both dNDs samples. However, as their spectra look similar, there is no clear indication that CAN has a role in this attachment.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> shows a thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) curve, PEI attachment to dNDs with and without CAN. The TGA data shows a gradual 6.9% weight loss for the non CAN-modified, PEI-dNDs, over a wide range of temperatures. This weight loss can be attributed to surface impurities, and to some of which are embedded in the dNDs aggregates. The CAN-modified dNDs show a 16% weight loss. Since the samples were heated up to 800&#xb0; C., and that the diamond core of the ND does not melt below 3550&#xb0; C., the 7% weight loss difference must originate from the outer shell; it indicates the presence of CAN molecules or residues. Moreover, in the graph of the CAN-modified dNDs (f-dNDs), the main weight decrease occurs at around 200&#xb0; C., as in the graph of pure CAN (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0125">The same observation can be drawn from a comparative TGA of the PEI-modified dNDs samples (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>). TGA of dNDs-bPEI25 shows a weight loss of about 13%, in a temperature interval of 250-550&#xb0; C. The plot shows three drops while the plot of UC-dNDs-PEI25 shows two. The difference between TGA behavior of f-dNDs-bPEI25 and dNDs-PEI25 can be explained by the composition of the particles. dNDs do not decompose below 800&#xb0; C., so the three weight drops for f-dNDs-bPEI25 can be explained as follows:</p><p id="p-0131" num="0126">the first is for the water (below 150&#xb0; C.),</p><p id="p-0132" num="0127">the second is for CAN and</p><p id="p-0133" num="0128">the third is for PEI.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0129">The two drops for dNDs-bPEI25 can be attributed to water and PEI.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0130">The weight loss difference between dNDs-bPEI25 and f-dNDs-bPEI25 is only 1%, so once again the analysis does not suggest that PEI binds preferentially to the CAN functionalized dNDs.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> shows a TGA curve for HA attachment to dNDs with and without CAN.

Adding a step of size-excluding centrifugation to the Ultrasonication method (UC) further improved disaggregation.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0134">CAN modification of the dNDs also had a disaggregating effect on the dNDs. A combination of the UC method with CAN modifications gave the desired result of nanometric dNDs.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0135">Preliminary CAN-modification experiments subjected to a DoE matrix suggest the optimal protocol for CAN attachment to dNDs is CAN dissolved in water, 1 h ultrasonication, and a CAN:dNDs ratio of 10.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0136">Implementation of the above protocol produced CAN-dNDs particles with a size of 10-20 nm that formed clear and stable dispersions in water (+35 to +45 mV by &#x3b6;-potential).</p><p id="p-0143" num="0137">CAN treatment of dNDs had a positive effect on subsequent PEI and/or HA attachment.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0138">Results for Additional Experiments with Naturally Occurring NDs</p><p id="p-0145" num="0139">Treatment of natural NDs with CAN oxidant was conducted on samples in both micrometric and nanometric size ranges (from 250 nm to more than 30 microns) in order to confirm that protocols suitable for dNDs are suitable also for natural NDs.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0140">Ultrasonication was performed as described hereinabove and proved to be an effective methodology.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0141">Initially, natural diamonds with a maximum size of 250 nm were tested. After the first sonication treatment, a transparent solution of ultradispersed particles of about 170 nm for hydrodynamic diameter, according to the DLS measurement was produced. This treatment resulted in size reduction of approximately 60% for the ultrasonication step (initial size was 417 nm by DLS). The stability of the surface-engineered diamonds solution is proved by the &#x3b6;-potential measurement that doubles in absolute value (from &#x2212;11.1 mV to &#x2212;22.1 mV). The next step was binding of cerium cations/complexes onto the surface with the use of CAN oxidant during the second ultrasonication treatment of 1 hour. All CAN-modified NDs showed higher &#x3b6;-potentials with a maximum of +47.3 mV and diameter size of 185 nm according to DLS measurements.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0142">In a subsequent experiment, natural diamonds in the micrometric range (maximum size of 30 microns) were sonicated using the same protocol. With these larger diamonds a grey solution was obtained after the first sonication process, probably due to the presence of bigger particles. Still, the size of the natural diamonds remained above the nanometric domain (&#x2265;100 nm). Only after the second ultrasonication procedure, when Cerium was attached to the nanodiamond particles, the solution became transparent. Clarification of the solution indicates that the size was reduced to nanometric range. The diameter size and &#x3b6;-potentials of the NDs obtained was 150 nm and 48.8 mV, respectively. The results for samples prepared by sonication shown NDs with a very high stability in water solution and size reduction of more than 50% (by DLS) relative to the natural diamonds particles before treatment.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0143">For all cases, individual 7-9 nm sized particles are observed in TEM images (not shown). These experiments demonstrate that can be concluded that CAN-mediated modification has a disaggregating effect on natural NDs as well as on dNDs.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
