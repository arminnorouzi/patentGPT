Embroidery may also incorporate other materials such as pearls, beads, quills, and sequins. In modern days, embroidery is usually seen on caps, hats, coats, blankets, dress shirts, denim, dresses, stockings, and golf shirts. Embroidery is available with a wide variety of thread or yarn color and can include 3D designs which have exaggerated thicknesses.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embroidery often requires a stabilizer (also called a backing) to provide support for the thread so that the design does not pucker or bunch up. A stabilizer is often used when embroidery is performed on soft, pliable fabrics such as cotton, wool, lace, polyester, and the like. Typically, a sheet of stabilizer and the fabric are hooped together (e.g., using a hooping frame) while embroidery is performed to create a design (e.g., text, picture, logo, etc.) on the exterior surface of the garment. The portion of the stabilizer, which is disposed on an interior side of the garment and not directly behind the embroidery, can be cut off. The stabilizer or backing material is typically made of non-woven material of varying thickness or other type of non-woven fabric which provides structural support for fabric and the corresponding embroidered design based on the type and thickness of the fabric being embroidered, the embroidery design including the number of stitches per inch required to create the embroidery and the properties of stabilizer material. But since the stabilizer comes in direct contact with the skin of the person wearing the garment it can be an irritant. Moreover, the stabilizer itself is expensive and the excess portion must typically be removed by a human, further driving up costs of embroidery. Lastly, removing excess stabilizer backing must be performed manually by a labor intensive and therefore expensive process.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One embodiment described herein is an article that includes fabric, a stabilizer coating disposed on the fabric, and an embroidery design disposed on the fabric and within an area defined by the stabilizer coating.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another embodiment described herein is a method that includes providing an article, applying a stabilizer coating onto the article, tensioning the article, and performing embroidery on the tensioned article in an area of the stabilizer coating.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another embodiment described herein is a method that includes applying a stabilizer coating onto an article by changing a viscosity of the stabilizer coating and performing embroidery on the article in an area of the stabilizer coating.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">So that the manner in which the above recited aspects are attained and can be understood in detail, a more particular description of embodiments described herein, briefly summarized above, may be had by reference to the appended drawings.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is to be noted, however, that the appended drawings illustrate typical embodiments and are therefore not to be considered limiting; other equally effective embodiments are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an embroidery process, according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a stabilizer coating used in an embroidery process, according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart for an embroidery process, according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart for applying a stabilizer coating for an embroidery process, according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart for applying a stabilizer coating for an embroidery process, according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart for a 3D embroidery process, according to one embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The embodiments herein describe using a stabilizer coating rather than a typical paper or fabric backing for an embroidery process. Advantageously, the stabilizer coating can be applied on either an exterior or interior side of the garment, unlike typical backing material that for aesthetic reasons is always disposed on an interior side of the garment. The stabilizer coating can be applied using a variety of different techniques such as being sprayed, rolled, printed, brushed, or melted onto the garment. The stabilizer coating is any coating that can provide sufficient structural backing for embroidery where a viscosity of the coating was changed during its application to the garment. For example, the stabilizer coating (e.g., a pre-polymer) may be applied in a liquid state to the garment but then polymerized and dried before the embroidery is performed. In another example, a thin film thermoplastic polymer material may be placed on the garment and then heated such that the polymer material melts, adheres to the garment, and then solidifies to form the stabilizer coating.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the area or boundary of the stabilizer coating matches (or is slightly larger) than the area or boundary of the embroidery design. Although the coating may be clear, because the design covers the stabilizer coating, the coating can have a color and still be disposed on an exterior surface of the garment without being noticed (i.e., without having a negative impact on the aesthetics of the garment). Further, disposing the stabilizer coating on the exterior surface ensures the coating does not irritate the skin of the person wearing the garment due to jagged or rough edges. In addition, placing the coating on the same side of the garment as the embroidery can simplify the manufacturing process since backing does not need to be placed on a first side of the garment (e.g., the interior side) while the embroidery is formed on the second, opposite side of the garment (e.g., the exterior side).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">While the discussion below describes providing a stabilizer coating on a garment (e.g., a piece of clothing), the embodiments herein can be performed using various &#x201c;articles&#x201d; which can include, but are not limited to, a piece of clothing (e.g. shirts, pants, socks, shoes, shorts, coats, jackets, skirts, dresses, underwear, hats, headbands, etc.), accessories (e.g. wallet, purse, etc.), and homewares (e.g. towels, pillow cases, blankets, mats, etc.).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an embroidery process <b>100</b>, according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The embroidery process <b>100</b> includes an application stage <b>105</b>, curing stage <b>110</b>, and embroidery stage <b>115</b>. The application stage <b>105</b> includes a stabilizer dispenser <b>120</b> that places the material of the stabilizer coating onto a designated area <b>130</b> of the garment <b>125</b>. In one embodiment, although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the stabilizer coating is applied while the garment <b>125</b> is under tension. However, in another embodiment the stabilizer coating is applied when the garment <b>125</b> is not tensioned. Once applied, the garment <b>125</b> can be tensioned before embroidery is performed. For example, an area <b>130</b> of the garment <b>125</b> on which the stabilizer component is to be applied may be stretched using a hoop (e.g., a hooping frame). In another embodiment, the garment <b>125</b> is placed on a platen. For example, the garment may be placed on, and stretched by, a surface of the platen, or the platen may be placed within the garment and then stretched.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The stabilizer dispenser <b>120</b> is not limited to any particular technique for applying the stabilizer coating to the garment <b>125</b>. In one embodiment, the stabilizer coating is applied in a liquid state (with a relatively low viscosity). In that case, the stabilizer dispenser <b>120</b> can spray, roll, brush, or otherwise apply the material of the stabilizer coating onto the garment <b>125</b>. For example, the stabilizer coating may be a pre-polymer such as silicone or elastomeric polyurethane, polyester, or polyethylene. In one embodiment, the stabilizer coating polymerizes into a silicone elastomer film with physical characteristics similar to that of, e.g., DOWSIL&#x2122; 734 self-leveling sealant. The stabilizer coating may also polymerize into a foam with the help of blowing agents such as expandable hollow spheres (e.g. Nouryon Expancel&#xae;) or isocyanate and water after being applied to the garment <b>125</b>. In one embodiment, the stabilizer dispenser <b>120</b> may apply a hot melt polymer such as a molten fibrous material (e.g., polypropylene, polyester, or polyethylene) that is ejected at high speed onto the area <b>130</b> to form the stabilizer coating. In some embodiments, the stabilizer may be 3D printed, on demand, localized to the area and shape, over printed graphics to create varying thickness layers for a high-fidelity embroidery embellishment that is capable of creating very high quality artwork that cannot be recreated using existing technology.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another embodiment, the stabilizer dispenser <b>120</b> applies the material of the stabilizer coating in a solid state. For example, for a large-scale embroidery process where the same design is applied to many garments (e.g., a large order of 100 or more of the same design), it may be more efficient to cutout portions of material from a large sheet of the material of the stabilizer coating that have the same dimensions of the area <b>130</b>. The cutout portions can then be placed at the areas <b>130</b> of the garment. A heating process can then be used to melt the material (and reduce its viscosity) and form the stabilizer coating on the garment <b>125</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some cases, the stabilizer coating is selected according to its elasticity. In one embodiment, the stabilizer coating has a Young's modulus between 0.5 to 2000 MPa to provide stability during embroidering and provide durability when the garment is worn and goes through wash cycles. In some embodiments, the stabilizer coating can be stretched or elongated by more than 200% before breaking or losing its structural integrity.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, the stabilizer coating may include an adhesive that helps the stabilizer stick or adhere to the garment when in a state with low viscosity. The stabilizer coating can then be dried or cured to adhere to the garment.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The material of the stabilizer coating may be selected based on the garment <b>125</b> on which it is to be applied. For example, one type of stabilizer coating may be used on organic fabrics (e.g., cotton) and a different type of stabilizer coating may be used on synthetic fabrics (e.g., polyester, nylon, spandex, etc.). For example, stabilizer coatings applied as a hot melt may lead to poor results when applied on organic fabrics while providing good results when applied on synthetic fabrics. Instead, materials that rely on reactive chemistry (e.g., polyurethane) to form the stabilizer coatings may be better for organic fabrics.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The curing stage <b>110</b> can be used to change the phase or the viscosity and elasticity of the stabilizer coating <b>140</b> so that it adheres to the garment <b>125</b>. For example, if the stabilizer coating <b>140</b> is applied in a liquid state (or relatively high viscosity and low elasticity), a heater <b>135</b> can dry or cure the coating <b>140</b> into a solid state (or relatively low viscosity and high elasticity). In another embodiment, the heater <b>135</b> can be replaced by a fan or air circulation device for curing the stabilizer coating <b>140</b>. In any case, this change in phase or viscosity can be a physical process or a chemical reaction. In some embodiments, radiation or light of a certain wavelength may be used to cure the stabilizer.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another embodiment, the stabilizer is applied to the article and humidity cured at room temperature over a specific time. In another embodiment, the heater <b>135</b> may melt, rather than cure, the stabilizer coating <b>140</b> so its viscosity changes and adheres to the garment <b>125</b>. In that case, the curing stage <b>110</b> can be used as a both a heating and drying stage to melt the stabilizer coating <b>140</b> before then drying the coating <b>140</b> so it adheres to the garment <b>125</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">During the embroidery stage <b>115</b>, an embroidery apparatus <b>145</b> uses a head <b>150</b> (e.g., a sewing head) to form an embroidery design <b>155</b> (e.g., text, logo, image, etc.) in the area <b>130</b> on which the stabilizer coating <b>140</b> was formed. The embroidery apparatus <b>145</b> can include any number of heads <b>150</b> and use any different colors of thread or yarn in order to generate the design <b>155</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, the garment <b>125</b> is held in a fixed position while the head <b>150</b> moves in X and Y directions to form the design <b>155</b>. In another embodiment, the head <b>150</b> remains stationary while the garment <b>125</b> is moved in the X and Y directions. In yet another embodiment, both the head <b>150</b> and the garment moves. For example, the garment <b>125</b> may be moved in the X direction while the head <b>150</b> moves in the Y direction when performing the embroidery.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the design <b>155</b> is a 3D embroidery where the stabilizer coating <b>140</b> provides a defined height or height profile across the design <b>155</b>. For example, a 3D embroidery process may use a thicker stabilizer coating <b>140</b> to provide a desired height for the design <b>155</b> relative a 2D embroidery process where the thickness of the stabilizer coating <b>140</b> may have a de minimis effect on the thickness or height of the design <b>155</b>. In another example, the stabilizer coating surface is non-flat and renders a 3D topology. The flexibility provided by the application of the types of stabilizer coatings described herein enables the creation of more complex and previously difficult to achieve 3D embroidery designs.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a stabilizer coating <b>210</b> used in an embroidery process, according to one embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a portion of a garment <b>200</b> that is stretched by a hoop <b>205</b> (e.g., a hooping frame) that tensions the garment <b>200</b> within the hoop <b>205</b>. While a hoop <b>205</b> is used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in other embodiments the tension may be applied by a platen or some other tensioning apparatus.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Applying tension helps to ensure the stabilizer coating <b>210</b> and the design <b>215</b> are applied on a flat surface without any wrinkles or sagging. In this example, the coating <b>210</b> and the design <b>215</b> are applied on the same surface of the garment <b>200</b>. This may help with manufacturing since the stabilizer dispenser <b>120</b> and the embroidery apparatus <b>145</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> can operate on the same side of the garment <b>200</b> which avoids having to flip over the garment during the embroidery process.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown, the stabilizer coating <b>210</b> has a boundary (shown by the dotted lines) that substantially matches a shape of the design <b>215</b>. As such, the area occupied by the design <b>215</b> may substantially match the area occupied by the stabilizer coating <b>210</b> on the garment <b>200</b>. As used herein, substantially match means the boundaries of the stabilizer coating and the design <b>215</b> may be less than a few (e.g., five) millimeters apart at corresponding locations. In one embodiment, it may be desired to ensure that the boundary or area of the stabilizer coating <b>210</b> is slightly expanded or larger (e.g., 1-7 millimeters) than the boundary or area of the design <b>215</b> which may provide extra support to the design <b>215</b>. Although the stabilizer coating <b>210</b> may not be completely covered by the thread of the design <b>215</b>, the coating <b>210</b> may still not be viewable (or easily viewable) on the surface of the garment <b>200</b>. In one embodiment, the stabilizer coating <b>210</b> is selected to have the same color as the garment <b>200</b> so it is less visible. Alternatively, the stabilizer coating <b>210</b> is selected to have a different color from the garment <b>200</b> or the thread for contrast enhancement to the garment color or the embroidery threads for rich, artistic, embroidery artworks. However, in one embodiment, the stabilizer coating <b>210</b> may be disposed on the opposite side of the garment <b>200</b> than the design <b>215</b> so there are no restrictions on the area of the stabilizer coating <b>210</b>. Doing so may make the manufacturing process slightly more complicated, but the stabilizer coating <b>210</b> can be made to size without affecting the person wearing the garment <b>200</b>. The stabilizer coating <b>210</b> can also be applied with one or more holes (i.e., an absence of the stabilizer material) within the boundary of the coating <b>210</b> to match the design of the embroidered art (if it does not have thread at that area of the design). With a traditional stabilizer, it's impractical to trim or tear away stabilizer material behind unembroidered areas that are inside the perimeter of the embroidered art when there are holes in the art design.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method <b>300</b> for an embroidery process, according to one embodiment. At block <b>305</b>, a tensioning apparatus tensions the garment. In one embodiment, the tensioning apparatus can be a hoop, hooping frame, platen, or wire frame. Further, the tensioning apparatus can tension the entire garment, or just a portion of the garment on which the stabilizer coating and the embroidery design are to be applied.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">At block <b>310</b>, a stabilizer dispenser applies a stabilizer coating onto the garment. As mentioned above, there are various different techniques for applying the stabilizer coating. Different techniques are described in detail in the flowcharts in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, applying the stabilizer coating includes changing the viscosity of the material of the stabilizer coating. For example, the stabilizer coating may be changed from having a low viscosity to a high viscosity, which can result in the stabilizer coating having a liquid (or molten) state to having a solid state. Changing the viscosity of the stabilizer coating can permit it to adhere or attach to the garment. That is, when changing from low to high viscosity, the stabilizer coating may adhere to the garment to form a solid film that provides the necessary support for performing the embroidery process. In some embodiments, the stabilizer may be aerosolized and may be applied in the form of a spray. In some embodiments, the stabilizer is applied on the front side garment in such conditions to allow the stabilizer material to flow, diffuse around the fibers to encapsulate the fibers, diffuse into the fabric layer, with controlled thickness, and once properly cured, structurally adheres to the fibers of the fabric(s) forming the garment without chemically bonding to the fibers.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the stabilizer coating is applied to the garment before applying any tension to the garment. That is, the stabilizer coating is applied while the garment is not under tension. In one embodiment, the stabilizer coating is applied and cured before the garment is tensioned in preparation of the embroidery process. In another embodiment, the stabilizer coating is applied but then tensioned before being cured. However, in some embodiments such as method <b>300</b>, the stabilizer coating is applied to the garment and is cured after placing the garment under some tension. In some embodiments, the amount of tension applied to the garment may be adjusted based on a variety of factors, including the fabric thickness or weight, the type of fabric, the embroidery design including the design requirements as to the number of stitches per inch, etc.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">At block <b>315</b>, an embroidery apparatus performs embroidery in the area of the stabilizer coating. In one embodiment, block <b>315</b> is performed after the stabilizer coating has been cured or dried such that it is in a solid state (e.g., a high viscosity). The embodiments herein are not limited to any particular type of embroidery apparatus or type of embroidery. That is, the stabilizer coating can be used in a variety of different embroidery processes and with a variety of different embroidery apparatuses.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The embroidery design can be 2D or 3D, where the stabilizer component can set the thickness, height, or height profile of the design. Further, the application of the stabilizer coating and the embroidery may be performed on the same side of the garment or on opposite sides. When performed on the same side, the shape and size of the stabilizer coating may be controlled to be substantially the same (or slightly larger) than the design so the coating (which may have a shiny appearance depending on the material chosen) is not readily visible. When performed on opposite sides of the garment, the area of the stabilizer coating may be less of a concern, but a non-irritant material may be selected to ensure the coating does not irritate the wearer's skin, which may not be a concern when the coating is applied on the exterior surface of the garment.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method <b>400</b> for applying a stabilizer coating for an embroidery process, according to one embodiment. The method <b>400</b> is one example of applying a stabilizer coating onto a garment as described at block <b>310</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the garment has already been tensioned, but this is not a requirement.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">At block <b>405</b>, the stabilizer dispenser applies the stabilizer coating onto the garment in a liquid state. The liquid state has a lower viscosity than a solid state obtained after the stabilizer coating has been dried or cured. The stabilizer coating can be applied by spraying, printing, brushing, or ejecting the coating material onto the garment. Further, the liquid may be applied as a foam or applied in a liquid and expands into a foam.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">At block <b>410</b>, the heater cures the stabilizer coating to convert it into a solid state. Further, curing the stabilizer can cause the material of the stabilizer coating to adhere to the garment to provide suitable support for the embroidery design. In one embodiment, curing the stabilizer changes the viscosity of the material so that the stabilizer coating is in a solid state.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The curing can be performed by applying heat, increased airflow, light (e.g., ultraviolet light), combining two reactive components of a reactive chemistry, and the like. That is, curing can be performed by any process that changes the stabilizer coating from a liquid to a solid state. Curing can be a chemical or a physical process.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Once cured (e.g., the stabilizer coating is changed to a solid state), the method <b>400</b> can proceed to block <b>315</b> where the embroidery design is applied in the same area of the stabilizer coating. However, in some embodiments, the stabilizer may need not be cured or may be partially cured before the embroidery operation is performed</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method <b>500</b> for applying a stabilizer coating for an embroidery process, according to one embodiment. The method <b>500</b> is another example of applying a stabilizer coating onto a garment as described at block <b>310</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the garment has already been tensioned, but this is not a requirement</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">At block <b>505</b>, a cutting apparatus provides a thin film having a shape of a desired embroidery design. In one embodiment, the thin film may be provided in a rolled up sheet of material for the stabilizer component. The sheet can be unrolled so that the cutting apparatus can cutout portions from the sheet that have shapes that substantially match (or are slightly larger) than the embroidery design. This may be especially useful in a high-volume embroidery process where the same embroidery design (e.g., the same text, logo, or image) is being formed on a large number of garments. In some embodiments, in high-volume embroidery operations, the stabilizer may be directly pre-applied and cured onto the garment to be embroidered to increase processing speed by pre-applying and pre-curing the stabilizer.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, if the design contains text, the cutouts can have substantially the same boundary and size as the boundary and size of the text as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> above. In this manner, a large sheet of stabilizer material can be cut up into smaller portions that substantially match the shape and size of the desired embroidery design.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">At block <b>510</b>, the stabilizer dispenser places the thin film (e.g., the cutout portions) on the garments. In one embodiment, the thin film may be held on the garments by gravity (e.g., simply placed on top of the garment where the embroidery is to take place), or the stabilizer dispenser may attach the thin film using a temporary attachment technique. For example, the thin film may have an adhesive on one side so that the film sticks to the garment. Or the stabilizer dispenser may use pins to hold the thin film in place on the garment. In this manner, unlike in method <b>400</b>, the material of the stabilizer component is initially placed on the garment in a solid state, rather than a liquid state.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">At block <b>515</b>, the heater heats the thin film to form a stabilizer coating adhered to the garment. Stated differently, the heater lowers the viscosity of the thin film so it is permanently adhered to the garment. This can include changing the thin film from a solid state to a liquid or molten state. Further, the heating process can cause a physical change or a chemical reaction in the thin film.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">At block <b>520</b>, the stabilizer coating is cooled so the viscosity increases again. For example, the stabilizer coating may have a solid state once cooled. Now, rather than being temporally attached to the garment, the stabilizer coating is permanently adhered to the garment and forms a suitable substrate for forming the embroidery design on the garment.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Once cooled (e.g., the stabilizer coating is changed to a solid state), the method <b>500</b> can proceed to block <b>315</b> where the embroidery design is applied in the same area of the stabilizer coating.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method <b>600</b> for a 3D embroidery process, according to one embodiment. Typically, a 3D embroidery process is performed by using a mold or substrate that is placed on the same surface on which the embroidery is performed. A backing material may still be placed on the opposite side of the surface to provide additional support. The embroidery design is then formed on the mold or substrate whose thickness gives the embroidery design its depth or height. However, in embodiments according to the present disclosure, instead of using a separate mold or substrate, in the method <b>600</b> the stabilizer coating can be used to perform both functions&#x2014;i.e., to provide thickness so the design becomes 3D, as well as provide sufficient support for the design.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">At block <b>605</b>, a designer determines a desired height of the 3D embroidery design. That is, in addition to selecting the color of the thread, the size of the design, etc., the designer can also indicate the thickness or height of the design on the garment (e.g., how far the design sticks out from the exterior surface of the garment).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">At block <b>610</b>, the stabilizer dispenser determines the appropriate thickness of the stabilizer coating to achieve the desired height of the 3D design. That is, the stabilizer dispenser determines how thick the stabilizer coating should be in order to result in a 3D design with the desired height. In some embodiments, by closely adjusting the amount of stabilizer dispensed in any given location, thereby producing a 3D height profile as the foundation for the embroidered art, complex 3D designs may be formed that are not possible with traditional 3D methods.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">At block <b>615</b>, the stabilizer dispenser applies a stabilizer coating with the desired thickness at the location for the 3D design. In one embodiment, the stabilizer dispenser may perform multiple coats of the stabilizer coating (curing each coat) to build up a stabilizer coating with the desired thickness. In another embodiment, the stabilizer dispenser applies just one, thick coat of the stabilizer material (e.g., as a foam or gel) which has a sufficient thickness.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Once the extra thick stabilizer coating is solidified, the method <b>600</b> can proceed to block <b>315</b> where the embroidery design is applied in the same area of the stabilizer coating.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the current disclosure, reference is made to various embodiments.
