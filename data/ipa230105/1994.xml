More particularly, the disclosed subject matter relates to a transport having features to transport a vehicle body at a manufacturing plant.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Current production of vehicles requires a movement of white body units (frame and closures only) from one location to another location to complete paint, assembly and finishing processes. Transportation is accomplished using enclosed semi-trailers and ratchet straps to hold the white body units in place. However, each white body unit has to be carefully guided into the trailer to avoid any bumping of white body unit to the sides of the trailer. Additionally, the white body unit is attached to the trailer by using a plurality of straps, which is a time-consuming process. Further, transportation of the white body unit to the trailer and attachment of the white body unit to the trailer requires at least two persons, and hence is a labour-intensive task.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It would therefore be desirable to provide a transport system that enables transportation of the white body units inside the trailer that prevents a damage to the white body units. It would also be desirable to provide a transport system that reduces the time needed to transfer and attach white body units with the trailer and is labor intensive.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, a transport system for transporting a vehicle body at a manufacturing plant is provided.

The at least one guide pin guides a movement of the carriage along the guide rail. Moreover, the transport system includes a first stopper adapted to be removably coupled with the guide rail and configured to engage with the carriage to restrict the movement of the carriage in a first direction along the length of the guide rail. The first stopper is adapted to be partially arranged inside the elongated passage. The transport system furthermore includes a second stopper adapted to be removably coupled with the guide rail and configured to engage with the carriage to restrict the movement of the carriage in a second direction, opposite to the first direction, along the length of the guide rail.

The connecting member <b>182</b> extends vertically from the base rod <b>174</b> to the second bracket <b>180</b>. Further, the second longitudinal end <b>178</b> of the base rod <b>174</b> is arranged proximate to the catch portion <b>160</b> of the guide rail <b>104</b> when the second stopper <b>172</b> is engaged with the carriage <b>102</b> and the guide rail <b>104</b> to prevent the rearward motion of the carriage <b>102</b>. Further, the base rod <b>174</b> is engaged/locked with the elongated channels <b>150</b>, <b>152</b> via a lock pin <b>186</b> that extends through the base rod <b>174</b> and the elongated channels <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>. Also, the second stopper <b>172</b> may include a handle <b>190</b> arranged proximate to the second longitudinal end <b>178</b> of the base rod <b>174</b> and may be coupled with the base rod <b>174</b>. The handle <b>190</b> facilitates an easy engagement of the second stopper <b>172</b> with the guide rail <b>104</b> and the carriage <b>102</b> as well as an easy removal of the second stopper <b>172</b> (i.e., the base rod <b>174</b>) from the guide rail <b>104</b> (i.e., the elongated passage <b>154</b>).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A method for transporting the vehicle body <b>200</b> from one location to another location at the manufacturing plant is now explained. The method includes providing the trailer <b>108</b> having the guide rail <b>104</b> arranged on the base surface <b>106</b> of the trailer <b>108</b> and positioning the trailer <b>108</b> at an appropriate location at the manufacturing plant. The method also includes arranging the vehicle body <b>200</b> on the carriage <b>102</b> such that the vehicle body <b>200</b> is supported on the support structures <b>130</b> of the carriage <b>102</b>. The vehicle body <b>200</b> is coupled with the carriage <b>102</b> by connecting the support structures <b>130</b> with the vehicle body <b>200</b> using suitable fasteners or any other suitable means known in the art. Thereafter, the method includes moving the carriage <b>102</b> to arrange the carriage <b>102</b> with the vehicle body <b>200</b> inside the trailer <b>108</b>. The carriage <b>102</b> is moved inside the trailer <b>108</b> such that the first guide pin <b>140</b> moves inside the catch portion <b>160</b> and then moves inside the elongated passage <b>154</b> of the guide rail <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As the carriage <b>102</b> is further moved inside the trailer <b>108</b>, the first guide pin <b>140</b> moves along the elongated passage <b>154</b> and the second guide pin <b>142</b> enters the elongated passage <b>154</b>. In this manner, the carriage <b>102</b> is guided long the guide rail <b>104</b> and is positioned at an appropriate location inside the trailer <b>108</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Before moving the carriage <b>102</b> inside the trailer <b>108</b>, the first stopper <b>162</b> is engaged with the guide rail <b>104</b>. Accordingly, as the carriage <b>102</b> is moved along the guide rail <b>104</b>, the first lateral member <b>120</b> of the base frame <b>112</b> of the carriage <b>102</b> contacts and abuts the first bracket <b>164</b> of the first stopper <b>162</b>. Accordingly, any additional forward movement of the carriage <b>102</b> inside the trailer <b>108</b> is prevented. Subsequently, the second stopper <b>172</b> is engaged and locked with the guide rail <b>104</b> and the second lateral member <b>122</b> of the carriage <b>102</b> to prevent any rearward movement of the carriage <b>102</b> inside the trailer <b>108</b>. In this manner, the vehicle body <b>200</b> is arranged inside the trailer <b>108</b> for transportation and does not require any additional adjustment by the operator. Also, as the vehicle body <b>200</b> is attached to the carriage <b>102</b>, a strapping of the vehicle body <b>200</b> with the trailer <b>108</b> is not needed.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
