Generally, there are two main approaches frequently used to digitalize the 3D human model: (1) Scan3D method and (2) Machine Learning method.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the Scan3D method, 3D scanning systems adopt technologies such as (1) Photogrammetry, (2) Laser Triangulation, (3) Structured Light to create a 3D version of the human body. In particular: (1) Photogrammetry uses a multi-camera system to take overlapping photos of an object from different angles to capture every aspect of the object. These photos are then imported to photogrammetry software and reconstructed into 3D models by computational algorithms. (2) Laser Triangulation is the second 3D scan method, projecting a laser beam onto the surface of an object, measuring the deformation of the laser light and the distance from the object to the scanner. When collecting enough distances, the object's surface will be mapped to recreate its 3D version. (3) Structured light applies a similar principle as (2) but does not rely on the laser beam, instead it employs projected light patterns and a multiple-camera system to capture images of an object. After that, 3D scanning software is used to calculate the object's depth and surface information, resulting in a 3D model of the object.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the Machine Learning method, RGB images of the digitized person are taken and then processed by image processing techniques in machine learning to simulate the human body model. There are several approaches to this method as follows: (1) an RGB image of the digitized person is taken to estimate the 3D pose and shape of the human body with a parametric human model whose joint locations are detected. A Convolutional Neutral Network is used to predict 2D joint locations, then an objective function is applied to penalizes the error between detected 2D joint locations and projected 3D model joints, (2) still applies the Convolutional Neutral Network to predict regressed shape parameters but combines with an optimization-based method to initialize an iterative optimization, producing a higher accuracy in pose estimation, (3) uses an image and adds a model called &#x201c;skin-cloth&#x201d;, which defines skin contours and clothed contours to provide information for the optimization process.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An overview of the traditional methods model is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although having reached several outcomes such as accuracy, traditional methods also come with many drawbacks. Firstly, in the Scan3D methods, the lighting source pointing onto the human body could be harmful to human health. Secondly, 3D scanners using Laser or Structured Light incur an extremely high initial cost (the machinery can cost $5,000 to $100,000), which is not affordable for daily usage. Thirdly, Photogrammetry, while costing less than the above technologies but often involves more in-office processing time, which can be 8-12 hours. Similarly, when applying Laser Triangulation technology, point clouds obtained after scanning need to be processed by specialized software to create the 3D model. Finally yet importantly, to reconstruct an accurate human body model, both Scan3D method and Machine Learning method often require the digitized person to take off or wear tight clothes. This, firstly, is sensitive in terms of the rights of an individual concerning his/her image, causing discomfort for the digitized person; secondly, a preparation process of taking off/wearing standard clothes to capture images is time-consuming and mainly suitable in the laboratory environment. Applying optimization methods combining with machine learning techniques could address the above problems and receive considerable benefits: speed up model processing time, reduce implementation costs and protect human health. Moreover, a 3D reconstruction method using only the user's anthropometric measurements without any requirements of clothes is necessary for practical applications.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The first purpose of the invention is to propose a system for digitalizing the human body shape using anthropometric measurements.

The Data Clustering Block separates the randomly generated values into anthropometrically identical clusters, used as input anthropometric measurements to the Optimization Module.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The Optimization Module, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>, uses the Genetic Algorithm to transform the parametric model into a users's model, the Optimization Module includes two main components: a Calculating Block aims to calculate measurements of the parametric model and an Optimization Block aims to optimize those measurements. In which, the former determines measurements of the 3D model, the latter transforms the parametric model into a model that is approximately identical to the digitized human body based on optimizing parameters controlling shape such that they satisfy both information of anthropometric measurements entered by the user and estimated measurements of the 3D human model.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>, a possible solution set for a problem is initialized. Each solution would be assigned a quantitative value based on its capacity on satisfying the objective function. The most suitable individuals are determined by natural selection and reproduction to create new individuals. To find out an optimal solution, the natural selection and reproduction process are implemented iteratively in the optimization block, including four steps: (1) Selection: This process uses the Diversity Control Oriented Genetic Algorithm to select the fittest individuals from the initial population to be parents based on quantitative value; (2) Crossover: This process uses Laplace Crossover to generate a random number u following a uniform distribution and a random number v based on the Laplace distribution, these two individuals are then combined to generate an offspring which selects desirable characteristics from two old individuals; (3) Mutation: this is a process using power mutation, individuals produced after crossover step are selected according to a defined probability to perform the mutation, (4) Stop Condition: this process produces a threshold and evaluate errors resulted from implementing the three above processes, if the result is within the acceptable threshold, the 3D human model is returned and displayed on the Output Block, otherwise the Calculating Block will receive signals and continue performing the loop.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, besides the above modules, the 3D human reconstruction system using anthropometric measurements also employs two supplementary blocks, including:</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Input Block:</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The Input Block has a task for acquiring the body's measurements that are actively entered by the user.
