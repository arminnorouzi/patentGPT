For example, PDT or PD may be used for treatment or diagnosis of actinic keratosis of the scalp or facial areas of a patient. In addition, PDT and PD may be used for treatment and diagnosis of other indications (e.g., acne, warts, psoriasis, photo-damaged skin, cancer) and other areas of the patient (e.g., arms, legs).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">During one form of PDT or PD, a patient is first administered a photoactivatable agent or a precursor of a photoactivatable agent that accumulates in the tissue to be treated or diagnosed. The area in which the photoactivatable agent is administered is then exposed to visible light, which causes chemical and/or biological changes in the agent. These changes allow the agent to then selectively locate, destroy, or alter the target tissue while, at the same time, causing only mild and reversible damage to other tissues in the treatment area. One example of a precursor of a photoactivatable agent is 5-aminolevulinic acid (&#x201c;ALA&#x201d;), which is commonly used in PDT of actinic keratosis. As they are used here, the terms ALA or 5-aminolevulinic acid refer to ALA itself, precursors thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the same.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For effective treatment, it is desirable to have a power output that is uniform in intensity and color. Illuminators, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,758,418; 8,216,289; 8,030,836; 7,723,910; 7,190,109; 6,709,446; 6,223,071, which are incorporated by reference in their entireties for the techniques, methods, compositions, and devices related to PDT and PD, are typically used to provide the proper uniformity of light for treatment purposes. These devices generally include a light source (e.g., a fluorescent tube), coupling elements that direct, filter or otherwise conduct emitted light so that it arrives at its intended target in a usable form, and a control system that starts and stops the production of light when necessary.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Because PDT can be used to treat a variety of treatment areas, some illuminators utilize two or more panels, each panel having a light source to emit light at the intended target area. These panels are coupled together so as to be rotatable relative to each other. By incorporating multiple, rotatable panels, the overall size and shape of the area that is illuminated can be changed according to the intended treatment area.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In conventional adjustable illuminators, the panels are equally sized by width and length and are typically driven at the same power level. The panels are further joined at their edges by hinges so as to be rotatable to achieve a desired configuration. However, due to the edges of the panels and the presence of the hinges, the light source(s) of one panel does not immediately adjoin the light source(s) of an adjacent panel. As a result, light is not emitted from a &#x201c;gap&#x201d; between the light sources. The lack of light emitting from such areas, together with the uniform supply of power to the panels, can cause optical &#x201c;dead space&#x201d; in certain portions of the target treatment area. These portions, in turn, receive less overall light, resulting in a lower dose of treatment in those portions. In some instances, the dose of treatment can be lowered by as much as a factor of five when compared with those areas receiving an optimal amount of light.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Generally, these conventional illuminators are used for phototherapy of acne, which typically does not require the administration of a photoactivatable agent for effective treatment. Thus, exposure to the light alone is generally sufficient treatment. Moreover, because multiple treatment sessions can be utilized to effectively treat the condition, uniformity of light across the target area during a given treatment is less of a concern in some situations. However, some forms of treatment involving PDT, such as the use of ALA to treat actinic keratosis, require specific and highly uniform intensity and color of light to achieve effectiveness. In these instances, successful PDT relies on the targeted delivery of both the correct quantity of the photoactivatable agent and the correct quantity (i.e., power and wavelength) of light to produce the desired photochemical reactions in the target cells. Thus, to achieve this, the light source must provide illumination to the target area and this illumination must be uniform with respect to both wavelength and power. The optical dead space that can occur at or near the hinges of conventional adjustable illuminators reduces the uniformity of the light along the treatment area, thereby reducing the effectiveness of PDT for these specific treatments. Moreover, these illuminators are also configured to adjust within a limited range, such that only a limited amount of surfaces on a patient's body may be treated, such as a patient's face and scalp. In addition, due to the various contours of a patient's body, the uniformity of light delivered by these conventional illuminators may vary substantially depending on the treatment area of the patient.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, it is an object of some embodiments of the present invention to reduce or eliminate these dead spaces and provide for a more uniform light distribution in an adjustable illuminator designed for PDT or PD of a variety of targeted areas. In addition, it is an object of some embodiments of the present invention to provide an infinitely adjustable illuminator that can effectively deliver a uniformity of light across various areas of a patient's body, such as a patient's extremities (e.g., arms and legs) or torso, in addition to a patient's face and scalp. Thus, a uniform light may be delivered to a targeted treatment area regardless of the shape and location of the contoured surface of the patient's body.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">One embodiment of the present invention uses a plurality of panels, wherein at least one panel is of a different width than the other panels. This panel is positioned between two other panels and, in a way, acts as a &#x201c;lighted hinge&#x201d; to provide enough &#x201c;fill-in&#x201d; light to reduce or eliminate the optical dead spaces when the panels are bent into a certain configuration. Preferably, five panels in total are used to provide for an optimal increase in the total size of possible treatment areas. Two of the panels are preferably of a smaller width than the other three larger panels. These panels are positioned in an alternating manner such that each of the smaller-width panels is situated in between two of the three larger panels to allow for both adjustability and increased uniformity. Furthermore, to further reduce or eliminate optical dead spaces, the panels are preferably coupled together using nested hinges, thereby reducing the area in which no light source is present on the illuminator. In order to even further reduce or eliminate optical dead spaces, it is preferable that the light sources on each of the panels are individually configurable to provide specific power output to certain areas of the light sources on the panels to compensate for decreased uniformity. For example, the power outputted to each individual diode in an array of light emitting diodes (LED) may be individually adjusted.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description and the accompanying exemplary embodiments shown in the drawings, which are briefly described below.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> show top views of a main body of an illuminator according to an exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref> show perspective views of the main body of the illuminator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref> show detailed views of the nested hinges of the main body of the illuminator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a perspective view of the illuminator having the main body of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> mounted to a stand.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a schematic view illustrating an addressable configuration of LEDs mounted on the main body of the illuminator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a schematic view illustrating widths and lengths of individual panels of the main body of the illuminator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a graph illustrating light dosage across a treatment area according to a conventional paneled illuminator.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a graph illustrating light dosage across the same treatment area as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> using an illuminator according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref> illustrate one embodiment of a configurable illuminator according to the present invention.

The tabs <b>23</b> are configured such that a side of an adjacent panel may be received between the tabs <b>23</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. Thus, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B and <b>6</b></figref>, the height of the adjacent panel (e.g., panel <b>10</b><i>a</i>) is slightly smaller than the height of the tabbed panel (e.g., panel <b>10</b><i>b</i>) into which the adjacent panel is received.

A flange <b>51</b> of the hinge <b>50</b> is mounted to the inner side surface of a panel via bolts <b>53</b>. The inner side surface of a panel may include a recess in which the flange <b>51</b> may be placed. The inner side surface of the panel may also include an additional recess to accommodate the joint of the hinge <b>50</b> such that the joint of the hinge <b>50</b> becomes substantially flush with an outer front surface of the panel. Such configurations may allow for the outside vertical edges of adjoining panels to be positioned closer to one another. By spacing the vertical edges of adjoining panels closer, optical dead spaces may be further reduced or eliminated. In addition, the hinges <b>50</b> together with the tabs <b>23</b> may reduce the number of pinch points present in the system.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>, the main body <b>100</b> of the illuminator may include a mounting head <b>40</b>. The mounting head <b>40</b> may allow for the main body <b>100</b> to be mounted to a movable stand <b>80</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, to allow a user to easily move the main body <b>100</b> to the appropriate treatment position. The stand <b>80</b> includes a base <b>81</b> and a vertical pillar <b>82</b>. The base <b>81</b> may further include wheels <b>87</b> at its bottom in order to allow the user to horizontally move the illuminator to an appropriate position. The wheels <b>87</b> may include locks, such that the stand <b>80</b> is prevented from further horizontal movement once positioned. In addition, the vertical pillar <b>82</b> may be attached to the base <b>81</b> at a pivot point <b>83</b>. The pivot point <b>83</b> allows the vertical pillar <b>82</b> to be rotated to increase the range of positioning for the illuminator. At a top end, the vertical pillar <b>82</b> includes a connecting arm <b>85</b>, which may serve as a mounting structure for the main body <b>100</b>. The connecting arm <b>85</b> includes a hinge point <b>86</b> such that the main body <b>100</b> can be moved vertically relative to the stand <b>80</b>. The vertical pillar <b>82</b> may also be configured as a telescopic structure, such that the user can change the height of the vertical pillar <b>82</b>. This allows for an increased range of vertical movement for the main body <b>100</b>, which can allow the user to position the main body <b>100</b> at lower portions of a treatment area, such as a patient's legs or feet. The stand <b>80</b> may also include a stabilization arm <b>84</b>. Once the stand <b>80</b> and main body <b>100</b> is positioned, the stabilization arm <b>84</b> may be attached to the main body <b>100</b> to prevent unwanted movement of the main body <b>100</b> during treatment. As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a controller and power supply <b>90</b> is mounted to the stand <b>80</b> in order to supply electrical power to the main body <b>100</b> and allow the user to control the main body <b>100</b> for treatment purposes. Alternatively, the controller and power supply <b>90</b> may be directly mounted to the main body <b>100</b>. In order to provide a cooling system for the LED arrays <b>60</b>, one or more fans <b>70</b> may be mounted onto each of the panels, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">At least one control unit is also connected to the panels to regulate power to the lights to achieve the required uniformity and intensity for the target treatment. The control unit may be implemented as hardware, software, or a combination of both, such as a memory device storing a computer program and a processor to execute the program. Alternatively, each panel may have a dedicated control unit to regulate power to the individual LED array on a given panel to allow for more particular fine-tuning of the illuminator, which may further enhance uniformity and increase efficiency. For example, under Lambert's cosine law, light intensity at a given point on a &#x201c;Lambertian&#x201d; surface (such as skin) is directly proportional to the cosine of the angle between the incoming ray of light and the normal to the surface. Thus, a ray of light that is directed to the front of a curved surface (e.g., a head of a patient) will arrive in a substantially perpendicular manner to that area and will result in 100% absorbance. However, a ray of light that arrives at a side edge of the curved surface will arrive in a substantially parallel manner. According to Lambert's cosine law, the intensity, and thus absorption, of the light at the side edge will approach zero, making treatment at that area ineffective. Thus, a &#x201c;fall off&#x201d; of light exposure tends to occur at the edges of a curved surface. In addition, &#x201c;fall off&#x201d; increases as the distance between the light source and the point on the surface increases.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Configuring an illuminator to conform to the curved surface (e.g., a U-shaped configuration designed to &#x201c;wrap around&#x201d; the curvature of the surface) aids in reducing this effect and increases overall uniformity. However, to sufficiently increase uniformity, the light source should be larger relative to the target treatment area in order to fully encompass the body part to be treated and also provide light from all angles to any target point on the treatment area. In order to increase the uniformity of light exposure to the treatment area while maintaining a practical size of the illuminator, the LED arrays <b>60</b> may be individually configured to increase the intensity of light emitting from certain diodes to compensate for this fall-off effect.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">An example in which the LED arrays <b>60</b> may be individually configured is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Here, the LED arrays <b>60</b> are divided into three general areas, which may be described as &#x201c;addressable strings.&#x201d; Areas <b>1</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>5</b> correspond to an addressable string configuration that may be included in the wider panels <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>c</i>, and <b>10</b><i>e</i>, while areas <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>6</b> correspond to an addressable string configuration that may be included in the narrower panels <b>10</b><i>b </i>and <b>10</b><i>d</i>. The current to each area is adjusted in order to adjust the intensity of light emitting from each of the areas. For example, a higher current may be supplied to areas <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> than the current supplied to areas <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> such that areas <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> emit a higher intensity of light than areas <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. Similarly, a higher current may be supplied to areas <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> than the current supplied to areas <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. Thus, a higher intensity of light is emitted overall from the edges, which may allow for a reduction in any fall-off effect. Alternatively, the illuminator may be configured to adjust each individual diode present in a given LED array <b>60</b>, allowing for an even greater fine-tuning effect. Furthermore, by using either pre-programmed settings or sensors to detect the curvature of the surface to be treated, the LED arrays <b>60</b> can be individually configured to emit more intense light to only those areas that require it. This allows for an increase in uniformity of light exposure in an efficient manner as power output and/or light intensity is increased to only certain diodes, in accordance with need.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The addressable strings of the LED arrays <b>60</b> may also include varying amounts of individual diodes mounted within the particular area. For example, for the wider panels <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>c</i>, and <b>10</b><i>e</i>, <b>12</b> diodes may be mounted in each of areas <b>1</b>, while 9 diodes may be mounted in each of areas <b>3</b> and <b>41</b> diodes may be mounted in area <b>5</b>, resulting in a total of 83 individual diodes included within each of the wider panels <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>c</i>, and <b>10</b><i>e</i>. For the narrower panels <b>10</b><i>b </i>and <b>10</b><i>d</i>, <b>8</b> diodes may be mounted in each of areas <b>2</b>, while 9 diodes may be mounted in each of areas <b>4</b>, and <b>23</b> diodes may be mounted in area <b>6</b>, resulting in a total of 57 individual diodes included within each of the narrower panels <b>10</b><i>b </i>and <b>10</b><i>d</i>. However, the number and arrangement of diodes included within each of the LED arrays <b>60</b> is not particularly limited. For example, the wider panels <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>c</i>, and <b>10</b><i>e </i>may each contain a total amount of diodes that ranges from about 80 diodes to about 350 diodes. Similarly, the narrower panels <b>10</b><i>b </i>and <b>10</b><i>d </i>may each contain a total amount of diodes that ranges from about 50 diodes to about 250 diodes. By varying the arrangement of the diodes within each of the addressable strings of the LED arrays <b>60</b>, power output and/or the intensity of light emitted from a given array may be better controlled and fine-tuned.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition, individually regulating power to the LED arrays <b>60</b> can also contribute to the reduction or elimination of the optical dead spaces that may otherwise occur at the hinge points. Specifically, power output and/or the emitted light intensity may be increased close to the edges of the array that are closest to the nested hinges to compensate for the lack of light emitting from the meeting point of panels. The narrower panels <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>10</b><i>d </i>are also preferably operated at a higher power level and/or at a higher emitted light intensity compared to the wider panels <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>c</i>, <b>10</b><i>e </i>in order to provide additional fill-in light. Furthermore, individual power regulation may aid in compensating for manufacturing variance that can occur in individual diodes. Finally, by fine-tuning each array <b>60</b>, the panels can be easily deployed for other applications as each array is specifically configurable to address the lighting needs of the specific application.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The illuminator may further include a timer, which can indicate to the user the appropriate length of exposure time for the particular treatment. The illuminator may also be programmed with pre-stored light dosing parameters to allow the user to select a desired treatment type. The pre-stored parameters may include, for example, pre-stored settings for exposure time, light intensity, and outputted wavelength. Based on the selected treatment, the illuminator is automatically configured to provide the correct lighting dosage by being supplied with the appropriate power output to achieve the required uniformity for the treatment. Alternatively, the illuminator can be provided with sensors that detect the size of the treatment area positioned in front of the illuminator. The sensors then determine the correct light dosing parameters based on the sensed treatment area. The illuminator may also further include actuators and may be programmed to be moved automatically depending on the selected treatment. Once a treatment is selected, the illuminator may be automatically positioned into the proper configuration by the actuators without requiring the user to move the system by hand. Alternatively, the sensors may detect the adjusted position of the illuminator manually set by the user. The detected position of the illuminator may then be used to indicate the intended treatment area. Correct light dosing parameters for the specific treatment area may then be provided based on the detected position set by the user.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The adjustable illuminator of the present invention allows for an infinite amount of configurations that can be adapted for the targeted treatment area. The configurations may range from a flat-plane emitter (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>2</b>B</figref>) to a substantially U-shaped configuration (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>2</b>A</figref>). The adjustable illuminator may also be configured such that the two end panels <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>e </i>can be pulled back relative to the three middle panels <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>10</b><i>c</i>, <b>10</b><i>d</i>, such that a smaller U-shaped configuration may be created by the middle panels. Thus, the adjustable illuminator allows for the treatment of additional areas of a patient's body. In other words, not only can the adjustable illuminator effectively deliver a uniform light intensity to traditional surfaces such as the face or scalp, but the adjustable illuminator can also provide a device that can easily be configured to treat other portions of a patient's body, in particular, those having smaller curved surfaces, such as the arms and legs. Moreover, the adjustable illuminator may also be easily positioned to deliver a uniform light intensity to larger treatment areas, such as the back or chest.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As described above, the narrower panels <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>10</b><i>d </i>are dimensioned such that the panels act as &#x201c;lighted hinges.&#x201d; Thus, when the wider panels <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>c</i>, <b>10</b><i>e </i>are adjusted into the desired form, the illuminator &#x201c;bends&#x201d; at the narrower panels <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>10</b><i>d</i>, where traditionally the &#x201c;bend&#x201d; would occur substantially at the hinge itself. Thus, instead of an unlighted &#x201c;bent&#x201d; portion as would occur in the conventional illuminator, the present illuminator provides a &#x201c;bent&#x201d; portion that is also configured to emit light, thereby helping to reduce optical dead space without requiring large amounts of power differentiation among the light sources of each panel to provide the required fill-in light. The effects of this configuration can be best seen in a comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates the light uniformity produced by a conventional illuminator, measured with a cosine response detector, which mimics the response of a patient's skin to the incident of light as described above, at a distance of two inches. Total light dose, in terms of J/cm<sup>2</sup>, was measured based on emitted irradiance (W/cm<sup>2</sup>) over time (in seconds). The targeted treatment area shown is a patient's head, where height is shown as the y-axis and rotation angle from the center of the emitting surface is shown as the x-axis. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, higher light doses of about 10 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>occur at the center of the face (for example, at region A), near the patient's nose, where the patient is facing closest to, and substantially perpendicular to, the middle-most panel. Total light dose then begins to drop as movement away from the center of the face occurs where the effects of cosine &#x201c;fall-off&#x201d; and optical dead spaces are more prevalent. For example, light dose is reduced by about 20% at the patient's cheek areas (for example, at region B), and by about 80% toward the outer boundaries of the patient's face (for example, at region E), such as the ears and forehead. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, conventional adjustable illuminators utilizing equally-sized panels operating at the same power output level produce a varying field of light uniformity, making it undesirable and ineffective for those treatments requiring highly specific light uniformity.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, on the other hand, illustrates the light uniformity produced by an embodiment of the present invention. The targeted treatment area is the same as that measured in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. However, compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the light output uniformity produced by the illuminator is greatly enhanced across the patient's face and exhibits little to no deviation from the light output measured in the center of the patient's face to the light output measured at the edges of the patient's face. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, total light doses of about 10 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>(for example, at region A&#x2032;) occur across all regions of the face, including the center of the face (for example, the patient's nose), the patient's check areas, and the outer boundaries of the patient's cheek areas, such as the ears and forehead. Moreover, total light dose drops off minimally (for example, at region B&#x2032;) at the extreme outer boundaries of the patient's face. In one embodiment, the measured output over the active emitting area (over the entire active emitting area) is within 60% of the measured maximum (over the entire active emitting area) measured with a cosine response detector over all operation distances. More preferably, the measured output over the emitting area is within 70% of the measured maximum over a distance of two and four inches. Even more preferably, the measured output over the emitting area is within 80% of the measured maximum over a distance of two and four inches.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">One example of a treatment method for precancerous lesions, such as actinic keratosis, by PDT utilizing an adjustable illuminator described above in conjunction with ALA will now be described.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Essentially anhydrous ALA is admixed with a liquid diluent just prior to its use. The ALA admixture is topically applied to the lesions using a point applicator to control dispersion of the ALA admixture. After the initial application of the ALA admixture has dried, one or more subsequent applications may be similarly applied. Approximately 2 mg/cm&#x2032; of ALA is administered. Formation of photosensitive porphyrin and photosensitization of the treated lesions occurs over the next 14-18 hours, during which time exposure to direct sunlight or other bright light sources should be minimized. Between 14 and 18 hours after administration of the ALA, the lesions are irradiated by the adjustable illuminator according to the present invention. The illuminator irradiates the lesions with a uniform blue light for a prescribed period. According to a preferred treatment, the visible light has a nominal wavelength of 417 nm. The illuminator may irradiate the lesions with a uniform red light for a prescribed period. In certain embodiments, the illuminator irradiates the lesions with a uniform blue light for a first prescribed period and then irradiates the lesions with a uniform red light for a second prescribed period. For example, in some embodiments, the illuminator is configured to irradiate the lesions with a uniform blue light (e.g., 417 nm) at a low intensity (e.g., about 0.1 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 2 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) to photobleach, for example, protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) present at the surface of the patient's skin, and irradiate the lesions with a uniform red light (e.g., 635 nm) at a high intensity (e.g., about 30 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 150 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) to activate PpIX present at deeper layers of the patient's skin, thus avoiding potential damage to the upper layers of the patient's skin. The illuminator may be configured to simultaneously irradiate the patient's skin with the low intensity blue light and the high intensity red light or sequentially irradiate the patient's skin with the low intensity blue light and the high intensity red light. In certain embodiments, the illuminator is configured to irradiate the patient's skin with the low intensity blue light for about one hour to about three hours and irradiate the patient's skin with the high intensity red light for about 20 minutes to about 30 or 40 minutes, either at the same time the patient's skin is irradiated with the low intensity blue light or after the patient's skin has been irradiated with the low intensity blue light.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The invention thus provides a method for photodynamically diagnosing or treating a contoured surface of a patient, which includes providing the adjustable illuminator described above, placing the patient in the illuminator, and illuminating the patient to diagnose or treat the patient. The patient may be illuminated to treat actinic keratosis, acne, photo-damaged skin, cancer, warts, psoriasis, or other dermatological conditions. The method may also be used to remove hair and diagnose cancer.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Since the total light dose (J/cm<sup>2</sup>) is equal to irradiance (W/cm<sup>2</sup>) multiplied by time (sec), the only additional parameter that needs to be controlled for delivery of the correct treatment light dose is exposure time. This may be accomplished by the timer described above, which can control the electrical power supplied to the LED arrays <b>60</b> appropriately, and which can be set by the physician. Data has shown that 10 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>delivered from a source with an irradiance density of 10 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, or an irradiance density of about 9.3 to about 10.7 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, produces clinically acceptable results for desired treatment areas (e.g., face, scalp, extremities). From the equation above, this light dose will require an exposure time of 1000 seconds (16 min. 40 sec). In addition, due to the addressable nature of the adjustable illuminator, the illuminator may be used to treat a patient at higher power such that less time is required for effective treatment. For example, the adjustable illuminator may deliver an irradiance density of 20 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>for an exposure time of 500 seconds (8 min. 20 sec) to deliver a clinically acceptable light dose of 10 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. Alternatively, the adjustable illuminator may include higher power ranges, such as 30 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, over an exposure time resulting in a light dose of 10 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. A selected light dose may also be administered by additionally or alternatively varying the irradiance density over treatment time.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art.
