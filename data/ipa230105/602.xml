When an individual eats certain food, bacteria in the oral cavity break down the food and produce acids that have the ability to seriously damage hard tissues of a tooth in the oral cavity. The result may be the formation of dental caries. In current clinical dentistry practice, interproximal caries are extremely difficult to treat due to the location of the dental caries between teeth. Accordingly, there is a need for improved systems and methods for effectively treating dental caries and, in particular, hard to reach interproximal caries.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It would be advantageous to achieve systems and methods that would improve upon existing limitations in functionality with respect to treatment of dental caries and, in particular, interproximal caries. It would also be desirable to enable a mechanical-based and chemical-based medical solution that would provide simplified and accelerated treatment of interproximal caries. It would be further advantageous to enable a form factor-based solution that would provide for accurate delivery of substances for treating dental caries and, in particular, interproximal caries.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To better address one or more of these concerns, a dental medicament applicator is disclosed. In one embodiment of the dental medicament applicator, a placement device is sized for insertion at a dental site, such as an interproximal site. The placement device includes a central body and at least one matrix secured to the central body containing a topical substance, such as a fluoride-containing chemical agent, silver diamine fluoride, or a peptide-based chemical agent, for example. One or more wings extend from the central body to provide subterminal opposition surfaces to hold the placement device during placement. The one or more wings are non-active; that is, free of the topical substance. The active matrix, in response to being physically affixed to the dental site, delivers the topical substance at a controlled rate to the dental site while the placement device dissolves at a quicker controlled rate. These and other aspects of the invention will be apparent from and elucidated with reference to the embodiments described hereinafter.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

inventive concepts, which can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention, and do not delimit the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, therein is depicted one embodiment of a dental medicament applicator that may be utilized to treat dental caries and interproximal caries, for example, which is schematically illustrated and designated <b>10</b>. A placement device <b>12</b> is sized for insertion at a dental site, such as an interproximal site. As shown, the placement device <b>12</b> includes a central body <b>14</b>, a wing <b>16</b>, and a wing <b>18</b>. The central body <b>14</b> may include a front <b>20</b>, a rear <b>22</b>, an upper end <b>24</b>, a lower end <b>26</b>, a lateral end <b>28</b>, and a lateral end <b>30</b>.

In some embodiments, the transverse length L<sub>W1 </sub>of the transverse axis <b>36</b> may be greater than twice the mean width for a human tooth, which may be less than 10 mm. In some embodiments, the transverse length L<sub>W1 </sub>may be greater than 18 mm and in some other embodiments, the transverse length L<sub>W1 </sub>of the transverse axis <b>36</b> may be about 25 mm to about 30 mm. The wing <b>16</b> may also have a thickness T of about 100 microns to about 130 microns in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The wing <b>18</b> may include a structure similar to the structure of the wing <b>16</b>. More particularly, the wing <b>18</b> includes a front <b>82</b>, a rear <b>84</b>, an upper end <b>86</b>, a lower end <b>88</b>, a proximal end <b>90</b>, and a distal end <b>92</b>. The wing <b>18</b> has a rectangular form, like a strip, in this embodiment, but it should be appreciated that the wing <b>18</b> may have other forms as well. Further, the wing <b>18</b> may be at least partially integrated with the central body <b>14</b> or the wing <b>18</b> may be integral with the central body <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in the illustrated embodiment, the wing <b>18</b> may include the transverse axis <b>38</b> from the distal end <b>92</b> of the wing <b>18</b> through the proximal end <b>90</b> of the wing <b>18</b>.

Further, the transverse axis <b>38</b> provides a proximal viewing area <b>102</b> interposed between the central body <b>14</b> and the subterminal opposition surfaces <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the transverse length L<sub>W2 </sub>of the transverse axis <b>38</b> may be greater than twice the mean width for a human tooth. In some embodiments, the transverse length L<sub>W2 </sub>may be greater than 18 mm and in some other embodiments, the transverse length L<sub>W2 </sub>of the transverse axis <b>38</b> may be about 25 mm to about 30 mm. The wing <b>18</b> may also have a thickness T of about 100 microns to about 130 microns in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The placement device <b>12</b>, which, as previously discussed, includes the central body <b>14</b> and the wings <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, may include biodegradable materials, bioresorbable materials, or resorbable materials, for example. The placement device <b>12</b> may be a polymeric membrane or strip. By way of example and not by way of limitation, the placement device <b>12</b> may comprise a synthetic polymer or a natural polymer which may be at least one of polysacaccharides, lipids, polyisoprene, gum and proteins, or any mixture thereof. The natural polymer may be a protein selected from collagen and gelatin, for example. Preferably, the polymer is cross-linked, typically by at least one of glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, glycol dimethacrylate, tannic acid, and allyl methacrylate. With respect to collagen, by way of example, collagen utilized in the placement device <b>12</b> may be untreated or treated with fixing agents to prolong its resistance to digestion. By way of further example, denatured collagen can be impregnated with chromium salts to enhance its tensile strength and retard its absorption. With respect to cross-linking a polymer, a polymeric matrices, such as gelatin matrices, have efficacy when texture is taken into consideration.

The topical substance may be a fluoride-containing chemical agent. By way of example, and not by way of limitation, the topical substance within the active matrix <b>120</b> may be any one of inorganic or organic fluoride-containing chemical agents, including sodium fluoride, stannous fluoride, stannous hexafluorozirconate, calcium fluoride, difluorosilane, hydrogen fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate, ytterbium trifluoride, sodium hexafluorosilicate, ammonium fluoride, amine fluoride, and fluoroaluminosilicate glass, as well as any mixture thereof. The period of fluoridation required by the chemical agent is dependent on the type of fluoride, concentration, and period of delivery. It should be appreciated that other chemical or physical interventions and the type of surface or lesion being treated may also impact the period of fluoridation. Further, chronic toxicity due to fluoride (F) may be reached at 0.1 mg F/Kg of body weight. Thus, the weight of the patient impacts fluoride concentration as well. By way of example, and not by way of limitation, in applications where sodium fluoride is selected, the applicable concentration will be 1%-4%. By way of further example, and not by way of limitation, the sodium fluoride will have a concentration of about 1% to 9% or, in further examples, the concentration may be 3% to 7%.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">That is, with respect to fluoride, the active matrix <b>120</b> may have a topical substance having about 0.2 mg to about 1.5 mg of fluoride with some embodiments having about 0.2 mg to about 0.3 mg.

Silver diamine fluoride (SDF), a clear liquid that combines the antibacterial effects of silver and the remineralizing effects of fluoride, is a promising therapeutic agent for managing caries lesions in young children and those with special care needs. SDF has only recently become available in the United States. SDF may also have the name &#x201c;silver-diamine fluoride&#x201d; or &#x201c;silver hydrazine fluoride.&#x201d; SDF is frequently utilized as an aqueous SDF, 34% to 42% weight/volume, with 38% weight volume being preferred in many cases, with a presentation as a light-sensitive liquid with ammonia odor and blue coloring having a specific gravity of about 1.25. When the silver in SDF is applied to a dental site on a tooth, it oxidizes and leaves a black stain on the damaged cavity portion of the tooth and may cause staining in other areas of the oral cavity. Therefore, SDF must be delivered at a controlled rate to the desired dental site. The dental medicament applicator <b>10</b> accomplishes this goal as will be discussed in further detail hereinbelow.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As mentioned, the body <b>14</b>, in response to being physically affixed to the dental site, delivers the topical substance at a controlled rate to the dental site.

By way of further example, and not by way of limitation, the topical substance may be at least one of amelogenin, an inorganic or organic fluoride-containing chemical agent, an inorganic or organic calcium-containing chemical agent, and an inorganic or organic phosphate-containing chemical agent.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Amelogenins are a group of protein isoforms produced by alternative splicing or proteolysis from the AMELX gene, on the X chromosome, and also the AMELY gene in males, on the Y chromosome.
