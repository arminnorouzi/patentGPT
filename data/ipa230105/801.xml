In fact, over 25% of antibiotic prescription is for treating AOM. Recurrent AOM can develop into chronic otitis media, which requires further intervention such as the surgical placement of tympanostomy tubes for ventilation and drainage.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Oral antibiotics remain the standard of care, although such treatment is recognized as impractical due to the risks of systemic side effects and antibiotic resistance. Though less frequently prescribed for AOM, topical ear drops are also problematic, with less than 10% of the applied drug reaching the middle ear. For example, Cetraxal (0.2% ciprofloxacin), is delivered in quantities of 1-2 mg/day (Cetraxal product insert). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin is 2 &#x3bc;g/mL (Jacobs et al., Susceptibilities of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae </i>and <i>Haemophilus influenzae </i>to 10 Oral Antimicrobial Agents Based on Pharmacodynamic Parameters: 1997 U.S. Surveillance Study Susceptibilities of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae </i>and <i>Haemophilus influenzae </i>to 10 Ora. Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy. 1999; 43(8):1901-8) with middle ear space of approximately 2004, yielding 0.4 &#x3bc;g/day necessary to clear infection. Thus, the current treatment delivers 500-1000 times excess drug, which can contribute to side effects and antibiotic resistance much like their oral counterparts. An ideal controlled release system would deliver an amount closer to the MIC of antibiotic to the middle ear.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, research has focused on expanding and improving topical antibiotic treatment to address the aforementioned shortcomings. Studies by Otonomy, Inc. have shown success in releasing drugs from hydrogel vehicles placed either via intratympanic injection or during tympanostomy surgery (Mair et al., Randomized Clinical Trial of a Sustained-Exposure Ciprofloxacin for Intratympanic Injection During Tympanostomy Tube Surgery. Annals of Otology, Rhinology &#x26; Laryngology. 2015. doi: 10.1177/0003489415599001; PMCID: PMC4707869; Wang et al., OTO-201: nonclinical assessment of a sustained-release ciprofloxacin hydrogel for the treatment of otitis media. Otology &#x26; neurotology: official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology. 2014; 35(3):459-69; and Piu et al, OTO-104: a sustained-release dexamethasone hydrogel for the treatment of otic disorders. Otology &#x26; neurotology: official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology. 2011; 32(1):171-9). Some studies have included the use of degradable microspheres (MS) to further control drug release. While sustained release and efficacy in clearing infection and inflammation were observed from 2 weeks to 3 months, these systems require invasive procedures. Further, the gel cannot be retrieved from the middle ear and degradation products may cause long-term adverse effects.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Topical controlled release systems have also been investigated to improve AOM treatment, including ciprofloxacin-loaded hydrogels augmented by combinations of 3 different chemical permeation enhancers (CPEs), which resulted in transtympanic permeation (Khoo et al., Formulations for trans-tympanic antibiotic delivery. Biomaterials. 2013; 34(4):1281-8; and Yang et al, Treatment of otitis media by transtympanic delivery of antibiotics. Science translational medicine. 2016; 8(356):356ra120-356ra120). However, CPEs carry a risk of toxic side effects and have been shown to be cytotoxic during the preclinical validation of this system, with only 20% keratinocyte viability after 3 days. Further, recent studies suggest that outcomes may be improved when antibiotic treatment lasts 10 or more days, currently unachievable by these hydrogel-only systems. Achieving this duration of drug release typically requires a secondary controlled release vehicle such as hydrolytically degraded polymer microspheres (Hoare et al., Hydrogels in drug delivery: Progress and challenges.

For example, a &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; may be a level or amount of agent needed to treat otitis media without causing significant negative or adverse side effects to the ear.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">&#x201c;Treatment&#x201d; refers to a therapeutic intervention that ameliorates a sign or symptom of an abnormal physical condition caused by trauma, a disease, or a pathological condition, after it has begun to develop, or administering a compound or composition to a subject who does not exhibit signs of a disease or exhibits only early signs for the purpose of decreasing the risk of developing a pathology or condition, or diminishing the severity of a pathology or condition. As used herein, the term &#x201c;ameliorating,&#x201d; with reference to an abnormal physical condition caused by trauma, a disease or a pathological condition, refers to any observable beneficial effect of the treatment. The beneficial effect can be evidenced, for example, by a delayed onset of clinical symptoms of the disease in a susceptible subject, a reduction in severity of some or all clinical symptoms of the disease, a slower progression of the disease, an improvement in the overall health or well-being of the subject, improved physical condition, or by other parameters well known in the art that are specific to the particular disease. The phrase &#x201c;treating a disease&#x201d; refers to inhibiting the full development of a disease. &#x201c;Preventing&#x201d; a disease or condition refers to prophylactic administering a composition to a subject who does not exhibit signs of a disease or exhibits only early signs for the purpose of decreasing the risk of developing a pathology or condition, or diminishing the severity of a pathology or condition.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">Disclosed herein is a drug delivery system that includes agent-loaded polymer microparticles distributed (e.g., suspended) within a thermoresponsive hydrogel. Degradable polymer microparticles (e.g., microspheres) offer the ability to sustain delivery of a drug for an extended period of time from a single, localized dose, tunability for various drugs and dosing ranges, and consistent daily release of therapeutic concentrations. The system is a liquid drop uses a liquid drop that becomes a solid gel at body temperature, enabling it to be retained in the affected area in a way that traditional liquid drops cannot. For example, the drug delivery system may be instilled similar to standard ear drops. The liquid precursor will form a pliable, non-degradable gel on the tympanic membrane (TM). Additionally, the slow and steady release of an agent drug afforded by the polymer microparticles allows for penetration to the middle ear and therapeutic effect at lower concentrations than systemically administered agent (e.g., antibiotics). The methods disclosed herein provide for transporting a therapeutically effective agent (e.g., an antibiotic) across the tympanic membrane (TM). All of this can be achieved without the use of harmful chemical permeation enhancers. Additionally, the drops could be administered in the clinic by a physician and removed upon routine follow-up so that patients never need to fill a prescription or administer any drops&#x2014;thus essentially eliminating patient compliance concerns.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">In certain embodiments, the hydrogel may also include a second agent (i.e., a therapeutic or diagnostic agent) that is different than the agent loaded in the polymer microparticles. The second agent may, or may not, also be encapsulated in a microparticle. In certain embodiments, the second agent is not encapsulated in a microparticle, but rather is freely dispersed within the hydrogel. Thus, the system disclosed herein can simultaneously deliver multiple drugs.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">In particular embodiments, the system enable co-delivery of anesthesia to treat pain associated with otitis media while avoiding direct delivery of high levels of anesthesia to the middle ear that can result in nausea and dizziness. Controlled anesthetic delivery could also help with the primary goal of minimizing the administered dose of antibiotic, as lidocaine and benzocaine, common otic anesthetics, have both been shown to have antimicrobial effects. Synergism between anesthetic and an anti-infective agent (e.g., an antibiotic) being delivered could theoretically provide pain relief and long-lasting treatment of infection using significantly lower drug concentrations.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">In certain embodiments, the drug delivery system will require only a single drop for the duration of treatment and will provide therapeutic levels of an anti-infective agent (e.g., an antibiotic) and anesthetic to the target area in a controlled and safe manner. The topical controlled release system for otitis media that is disclosed herein may provide continuous drug presentation at the tympanic membrane (TM), and simultaneous pain relief. Patient compliance may be dramatically improved, as only a single, clinician-administered drop will be needed for treatment. Side effects may be mitigated due to treatment localization to the middle ear and minimization of applied drug. Simple removal of the non-degradable hydrogel via irrigation may further reduce long-term adverse side effects due to lingering material or degradation products.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">The systems disclosed herein provide at least one, and preferably all, of the following advantages:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0031">Longer and more consistent duration of release than simple gel+drug systems;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0032">Eliminate need for cytotoxic CPEs while providing dual pain relief and infection control; and/or.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0033">Simple, non-invasive administration and removal, leaving no material or byproducts behind.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0033" num="0034">In certain embodiments, there is disclosed a dual drug delivery system to the middle ear for the treatment of acute otitis media through antibiotic-loaded biodegradable polymer microspheres (MS) delivered via a non-degradable thermoresponsive hydrogel matrix impregnated with lidocaine. The drug delivery composition may be instilled similar to standard ear. The liquid precursor will form a pliable, non-degradable gel on the TM that provides an immediate release of lidocaine, with prolonged release of ciprofloxacin at a near-constant rate as the MS degrade (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The gel drop can then be flushed out with saline at the end of the dosing period, unlike degradable materials that remain well beyond the treatment window.

In certain embodiments, the thermoresponsive hydrogel has a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) below body temperature. The thermoresponsive hydrogel remains fluid below physiological temperature (e.g., 37&#xb0; C. for humans) or at or below room temperature (e.g., 25&#xb0; C.), solidify (into a hydrogel) at physiological temperature, and are biocompatible. For example, the thermoresponsive hydrogel may be a clear liquid at a temperature below 33-35&#xb0; C., particularly 34&#xb0; C., which reversibly solidifies into a gelled composition at a temperature above 33-35&#xb0; C., particularly 34&#xb0; C. Generally, the LCST-based phase transition occurs upon warming in situ as a result of entropically-driven dehydration of polymer components, leading to polymer collapse. Various naturally derived and synthetic polymers exhibiting this behavior may be utilized.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0037">Natural polymers include elastin-like peptides and polysaccharides derivatives, while notable synthetic polymers include those based on poly(n-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAAm), poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide-co-N-phenylacrylamide), poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-N-isopropylacrylamide), poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(propylene oxide)-b-poly(ethylene oxide), poly(ethylene glycol)-polyester copolymer, and amphiphilic block copolymers. The structure of PNIPAAm, containing both hydrophilic amide bonds and hydrophobic isopropyl groups, leads to a sharp phase transition at the LCST. Studies suggest that the average number of hydrating water molecules per NIPAAm group falls from 11 to about 2 upon the hydrophobic collapse above the LCST (32-34&#xb0; C.).

The gel precursor is refrigerated overnight and then washed 5 times in DI water at &#x2dc;40&#xb0; C.

Detection will be performed using a previously reported HPLC method validated for the range 20-1000 ng/ml. Each gel formulation will also undergo testing for degradation rate, swelling ratio, and lower critical solution temperature (LCST, the temperature at which gelation occurs), which have been well-characterized for the drug-free gel material. LCST will be determined via absorbance at 415 nm over incrementally increasing temperatures. Degradation rate will be determined by comparing mass of liquid gel at baseline and up to 14 days in the gel phase. Swelling ratio will be determined by comparing the dry and swollen weight of gel for multiple samples.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) will be used to examine shape and morphology of both blank and drug-loaded MS (JEOL JSM 6335F, Peabody, Mass.). MS diameter will be determined by volume impedance measurements (Multisizer, Beckman Coulter, Brea, Calif.). To determine drug loading, 10 mg of blank and drug-loaded MS will be weighed out and rotated in an incubator at 37&#xb0; C. for 1 hour after addition of 1 mL DMSO.
