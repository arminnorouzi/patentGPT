More particularly, the present disclosure relates to redundant actuator systems used for flight control components in aviation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Primary flight control components are used to control the lift and direction of an aircraft while secondary flight control components are used to improve performance characteristics of the aircraft. Actuator systems can be used to supply mechanical power necessary to move one or more of the primary and/or the secondary flight control components in an aircraft. For example, each actuator system may move a flight control component relative to a support surface of the aircraft. Example actuator systems include an actuator, a motor, and optionally a gear box. The actuator system receives an input power at the motor, transfer the power along an actuator transmission path, and generates an output power using the actuator.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Inefficiencies within the actuator transmission path cause an overall loss between the input power delivered to the motor and output mechanical power transmitted by the actuator. The efficiency may change throughout the life of the actuator as normal operation changes interfaces within the component parts. The overall change in efficiency of the actuator transmission path may be caused by variable efficiencies within the motor, gear train, screw drive or other actuator, or other factors. Decreased efficiency can lead to reduced performance or even loss of functionality of the flight control component while increases in efficiency can generate excessive output forces.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In certain systems, redundancy is provided by including a primary actuator system and a secondary actuator system for one or more of the flight components. Each actuator system includes a respective actuator (e.g., an electromechanical actuator), motor, and optionally a gear box. The secondary actuator system takes over upon failure of the primary actuator system. Upon landing, the primary actuator system is then serviced, which may include replacing a faulty actuator or other component.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When designing flight control component systems, it may be necessary to determine theoretical lowest and highest efficiency values of the actuator system. Aircraft regulations may require components to be designed to withstand a maximum operating load applied by the actuator system when the system is running at peak efficiency and the input power to the actuator system is set at a predetermined maximum amount. This represents a maximum output power that could be applied by the actuator system. Designing flight control components to withstand the maximum output power requires the components to be overbuilt for standard operating conditions, resulting in heavier and more expensive components and corresponding supports then typically necessary during operation.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Aspects of the disclosure relate to actuator systems and methods that provide for real-time health and performance monitoring. In certain implementations, the health and performance of an actuator system can be determined based on an overall efficiency value of the actuator determined by using force data generated by a force sensor. In certain examples, the force sensor is integrated along a transmission path of the actuator system. In certain examples, the system generates an alert (e.g., a replacement alert) if the overall efficiency value deviates from a reference efficiency value by a predetermined amount. In certain examples, the alert occurs prior to failure of the actuator system.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another aspect of the present disclosure relates to an actuator system including an electric motor coupled to an actuator with an integrated force sensor. The force sensor is configured to sense the force generated by the actuator. The force sensor is connected to a controller, which controls operation of the electric motor to ensure that the force applied by the actuator is within nominal conditions. The controller also interfaces with the force sensor and is configured to use force data from the force sensor to determine an overall efficiency value for the actuator system.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an example linear actuator system in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an example rotary actuator system in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to the figures in general, an actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> includes an actuator <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> coupled to an electric motor <b>106</b>, <b>206</b>.

The actuator <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> applies a force to the flight control component <b>116</b>, <b>216</b> to move the flight control component <b>116</b>, <b>216</b> relative to the aircraft support surface <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>. In some examples, the actuator <b>110</b> includes a linear actuator that translates the flight control component <b>116</b> relative to the aircraft support surface <b>120</b> (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).

In certain examples, the processors can include a programmable logic controller, one or more microprocessors, or like structures.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with aspects of the disclosure, an overall efficiency of the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> can be monitored to determine the health of the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. In particular, a ratio between the output power of the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> and the input power of the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> is monitored over time. Degradation of the efficiency of the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> (as indicated by a reduction in the ratio) may be observed and corrective action taken before failure of the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In certain implementations, the input power and output power of the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> are each calculated from measurements taken at the input and output of the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. For example, various sensors can be disposed throughout the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> to obtain measurements used in the calculations. In certain examples, the one or more sensors are operationally coupled to the controller <b>104</b>, <b>204</b> (e.g., to the processors of the controller <b>104</b>, <b>204</b>).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In certain examples, one or more of the sensors is integrated within the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. As used herein, a sensor being &#x201c;integrated&#x201d; means that the sensor is incorporated as part of the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> and is carried with and used within the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> while the system is deployed and used for its intended purpose in the field. An integrated sensor is capable of providing real time data after the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> has been installed and is being used.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In certain implementations, the input power of the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> is calculated based on the input current and voltage applied to the electric motor <b>106</b>, <b>206</b>. In certain examples, a voltage and current sensor arrangement <b>124</b>, <b>224</b> is integrated within the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. The voltage and current sensor arrangement <b>124</b>, <b>224</b> is configured to sense the input voltage and input current applied to the motor <b>106</b>, <b>206</b>. In some examples, the voltage and current sensor arrangement <b>124</b>, <b>224</b> includes a voltage sensor and a separate current sensor that are both operationally coupled to the controller <b>104</b>, <b>204</b>. In other examples, the voltage and current sensor arrangement <b>124</b>, <b>224</b> includes a single sensor that measures both voltage and current.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In certain implementations, the output power of the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> is calculated based on the force applied by the actuator <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> and the output speed of the actuator <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>. In certain examples, a force sensor <b>114</b>, <b>214</b> is integrated within the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> and is configured to measure the forces applied by the actuator <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> (e.g., to the flight control component <b>116</b>, <b>216</b> and aircraft support <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>). The force sensor <b>114</b>, <b>214</b> may include any device used to measure mechanical load directly or indirectly through material displacement or other methods.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In certain examples, a speed sensor <b>122</b>, <b>222</b> is integrated to provide information on the speed of a movable component (e.g., the actuator <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>) within the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. The speed sensor <b>122</b>, <b>222</b> may include any device used to measure the speed of a component directly or indirectly. In some examples, the speed sensor <b>122</b> measures linear speed of a component. In other examples, the speed sensor <b>222</b> measures rotational speed of a component. In some examples, the speed sensor is applied to the flight control component <b>116</b>, <b>216</b> and tracks the position of the flight control component <b>116</b>, <b>216</b> over time. In other examples, the speed sensor <b>122</b>, <b>222</b> is configured to sense the speed (i.e., the revolutions per minute) of the electric motor <b>106</b>, <b>206</b>. The output speed of the actuator <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may be determined by multiplying the measured speed of the electric motor <b>106</b>, <b>206</b> by a known gear ratio.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Efficiency data may be gathered in real time and plotted. Correlations between overall actuator efficiency and actuator system failures may be observed. Real time data may be compared to historical data to determine whether the actuator health is acceptable. The comparison also may be used to predict when failure of the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> is expected to occur. Predicting actuator system failure allows for the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> to be serviced before such failure occurs. Pre-empting failure of the primary actuator systems in an aircraft places less reliance on the secondary actuator systems within the redundant system.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Based on historical observations of actuator efficiency and failure, a reference base-line efficiency value may be stored within the controller <b>104</b>, <b>204</b>. When the calculated efficiency of the actuator <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> falls below this reference base-line efficiency value, the controller <b>104</b>, <b>204</b> may generate an alert to the operator so that the actuator <b>110</b>, <b>210</b> may be serviced upon landing. Suitable alerts include visual indicators (e.g., lights), auditory indicators (e.g., audible alarms), notations in system reports, alert messages (e.g., emails, texts, or other such transmissions), and the like. The base-line value may also be factory-set into the controller <b>104</b>, <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In certain implementations, as the efficiency of the system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> decreases, it may be necessary to apply more input power to the electric motor <b>106</b>, <b>206</b> to ensure that the output power remains at an acceptable level and is capable of supporting a minimum operating load. To increase the input power, the controller <b>104</b>, <b>204</b> may apply a higher current to the electric motor <b>106</b>, <b>206</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">By integrating a force sensor <b>114</b>, <b>214</b> into the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, input current (and hence input power) to the motor <b>106</b>, <b>206</b> may be regulated by the controller <b>104</b>, <b>204</b> to ensure that the output power levels of the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> do not exceed a maximum operating load (or a tolerance surrounding this operation load). The controller <b>104</b>, <b>204</b> also may ensure that the output power levels of the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> do not drop below a required minimum operating load (or a tolerance surrounding this operating load). Inhibiting the actuator system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> from operating outside the minimum and maximum operating loads or other predetermined thresholds may reduce the need to overbuild the flight control components (or other surrounding structure). Accordingly, the components can be manufactured less robustly, leading to decreases in weight and/or expense of the component.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a linear actuator system <b>100</b> configured in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure is shown.

As the electric motor <b>206</b> provides power to turn the gear train within the gearbox <b>208</b> and hence the rotary shaft <b>202</b>, the rotary actuator <b>210</b> transmits the power from the electric motor <b>206</b> to drive the flight control component <b>216</b> in a predetermined direction.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In certain implementations, output power of the rotary actuator <b>210</b> may be determined by multiplying the output torque by the angular speed of the rotary shaft <b>202</b>. In certain examples, output torque applied by the rotary actuator <b>210</b> may be measured with the force sensor <b>214</b> disposed at or integrated on the connection arm <b>218</b>. The force sensor <b>214</b> is configured to detect forces applied perpendicular to the connection arm <b>218</b> at a predetermined length from the rotary shaft <b>202</b>. In this example, the torque could be determined by multiplying the detected force and the distance at which the force sensor <b>214</b> is positioned from the rotary shaft <b>202</b>. Alternatively, or in addition to the force sensor <b>214</b>, a torque sensor <b>226</b> may be integrated at the rotary shaft <b>202</b> and configured to measure the torque applied directly. The torque sensor <b>226</b> may include any device used to measure mechanical torque directly or indirectly though material displacement or other methods. In certain examples, the torque sensor <b>226</b> may consist of transducers, strain gauges, SAW devices, or torque meters.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In certain examples, a speed sensor <b>222</b> is configured to sense the rotation speed (e.g., in RPMs) of the electric motor <b>206</b>. In such examples, the output angular speed of the rotary actuator <b>210</b> may be determined by multiplying the measured motor speed by a known gear ratio. The speed sensor <b>222</b> may include any device used to measure the speed of a component directly or indirectly. In certain examples, a speed sensor may include a Hall Effect sensor or one or more position sensors used to measure a time between a component reaching different positions.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Having described the preferred aspects and implementations of the present disclosure, modifications and equivalents of the disclosed concepts may readily occur to one skilled in the art.
