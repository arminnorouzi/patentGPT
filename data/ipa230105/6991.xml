Rather, the examples described herein have been provided merely to illustrate some of the many possible ways of implementing the methods, apparatuses, and/or systems described herein that will be apparent after an understanding of the disclosure of this application. Herein, it is noted that use of the term &#x201c;may&#x201d; with respect to an example or embodiment, e.g., as to what an example or embodiment may include or implement, means that at least one example or embodiment exists where such a feature is included or implemented while all examples and embodiments are not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Typical transaction sites (or websites) that are operated by transaction entities and operate in the context of selling products for a first entity, which has its own first entity site (or website), may be somewhat limited in that transactions must be paid for by credit cards, and there may be caps on transaction amounts such as because of a difference in a level of trust between the user and the transaction site and a level of trust between the user and the first entity site, as well as the lack of trust between the user authenticated by the transaction site and that transaction site's access to information of the user available to the first entity. For example, this typical transaction site is hosted using a separate domain from that of the first entity, a separate authentication including authentication credentials, for example, username and password, and so on, are also utilized uniquely for the transaction site, in that the transaction site has no way to exploit or utilize data that is available based on the fact that a user may have already been authenticated by the first entity site or the dedicated mobile app or PC application, and the first entity may have specialized information because of a preexisting relationship with the user.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus, typical approaches may be limited in that while a first entity may have access to several kinds of customer information, a typical transaction management apparatus (or transaction apparatus) may have a limited ability to communicate with the provider apparatus for the first entity in a way that would let the transaction management apparatus take maximum advantage of the customer information and/or other account information of an existing trusted customer of the first entity.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a typical transaction management system.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">At present, a typical transaction management system <b>100</b> may provide an existing precious metals transaction infrastructure that provides certain capabilities. A user <b>110</b> may interact with the existing precious metals infrastructure to purchase precious metals online, such as through a client device <b>102</b>&#x2032;, using a web browser <b>102</b>A&#x2032;. A content delivery provider <b>150</b>&#x2032; connects the customer to a transaction management apparatus <b>106</b>&#x2032;, which hosts a transaction site, such as a transaction site dedicated to the purchase of precious metals.

The examples are, however, not limited to such enumerated examples, and further examples include the client device <b>102</b> being configured in any additional or alternate manner to provide communication and data exchange with transaction management apparatus <b>106</b>, which may be across network <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> may be a computing system configured to perform one or more methods, operations, and examples described below, or examples consistent therewith, through execution of the instructions, as discussed in greater detail, below. In one or more examples, transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> may be associated with a first entity, for example, a financial institution or a bank that provides financial accounts, financial services transactions, and investment services for one or more users, for example, customers of the first entity. For example, the first entity may be a financial institution or a bank that sells precious metals products, such as coins or bars of gold, silver, and so on. While the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may be representative of an apparatus that is implemented by a single computer, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is also representative of the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> being a distributed system that may include computing components distributed across one or more networks, such as network <b>104</b>, or other networks, such as the Internet or a local area network (LAN).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Thus, in one or more examples, transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> may include computing components configured to store, maintain, and generate data and instructions. For example, transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> may include one or more servers, for example, transaction server <b>106</b>A, and tangible, non-transitory memory devices, for example, transaction data repository <b>1068</b>. Transaction server <b>106</b>A may include one or more computing devices that may be configured, based on execution of instructions, to perform one or more methods or operations consistent with the disclosed examples. In one or more examples, transaction server <b>106</b>A may be a computing device that executes instructions that perform operations that provide information to one or more other components of the example transaction management system <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one or more examples, transaction server <b>106</b>A may include a computer, for example, a server, personal computer, network computer, or mainframe computer, having one or more processors that may be selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program. In one or more examples, transaction server <b>106</b>A, or other computing components of transaction management apparatus <b>106</b>, may be configured to provide one or more sites, digital portals, transaction interfaces, and so on, that provide services consistent for the first entity, such as a digital banking or investment portal, and services consistent with disclosed examples, such as the purchase of precious metals products. For instance, transaction server <b>106</b>A may be configured to provide information associated with a requested web page over network <b>104</b> to client device <b>102</b>, such that client device <b>102</b> may render the received information and present content from the web page on a display device, for example, a touchscreen display unit of a smartphone, where the client device <b>102</b> is a smartphone, as a non-limiting example. For example, client device <b>102</b> may use web browser <b>102</b>A to display such a web page. Alternatively, as another non-limiting example, information form the transaction server <b>106</b>A may be provided in a mobile app <b>1028</b> for user access by client device <b>102</b>, rather than a web browser <b>102</b>A.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one or more examples, transaction server <b>106</b>A, or other computing components of transaction management apparatus <b>106</b>, may be configured to provide information to one or more application programs executed by client device <b>102</b>, such as through a corresponding application programming interface (API). For example, client device <b>102</b> may execute an application program associated with and provided by the first entity, such as a mobile banking and/or investment application, to provide services to user <b>110</b> consistent with the examples. As discussed in greater detail, below, such an application may be able to cause the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> to interact with the provider apparatus <b>108</b> to facilitate the performance of the services, such as by retrieving customer information or transferring funds as payment for transactions.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one or more examples, transaction server <b>106</b>A may provide information to client device <b>102</b>, for example, through the API associated with the executed application program, and client device <b>102</b> may be configured by the executed application program to present portions of the information to user <b>110</b> through a corresponding graphical user interface (GUI).

For example, client device <b>102</b> may receive the transmitted information, and store portions of the information in locally accessible storage device(s) and/or network-accessible storage devices and data repositories, for example, cloud-based storage or the transaction data repository <b>106</b>B. Additionally, transaction server <b>106</b>A may be incorporated as a corresponding node in a distributed network, and additionally or alternatively, as a corresponding networked server in a cloud-computing environment, though it is not required that transaction server <b>106</b>A have a distributed nature. Furthermore, transaction server <b>106</b>A may communicate using network <b>104</b> with one or more additional servers, where such additional servers may facilitate the distribution of processes and computation for parallel execution by the additional servers, which may lower the processing burden on server <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Provider data repository <b>120</b> may include one or more memories that are configured to store and provide access to data and/or instructions as described above. Such memories may include tangible non-transitory computer-readable media that store such instructions that, when executed by one or more processors, for example, of provider apparatus <b>108</b>, configure the one or more processors to perform one or more methods or operations consistent with examples described herein. Provider data repository <b>120</b> may also be configured to store information relating to the first entity, such as a financial institution. For example, provider data repository <b>120</b> may be configured to store data identifying customers of the financial institution, financial account data associated with the customers, investment portfolio data associated with the customers, and data indicative of social-networking activity of the customers, as non-limiting examples. However, provider data repository <b>120</b> may also be configured to store other information associated with the customers, in other examples. Example aspects of storing and accessing such information are discussed in greater detail, below.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one or more examples, provider data repository <b>120</b> may store customer data that uniquely identifies customers of a financial institution associated with provider apparatus <b>108</b>.

In one or more examples, the portfolio data may include information identifying one or more &#x201c;virtual&#x201d; investment portfolios composed of &#x201c;simulated&#x201d; positions held by user <b>110</b> in various securities. In one or more examples, provider data repository <b>120</b> may also store portfolio data identifying one or more &#x201c;watch lists&#x201d; that specify various securities monitored by user <b>110</b> and corresponding simulated positions held by user <b>110</b> in these various securities.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In one or more examples, the securities associated with user <b>110</b>'s actual investment portfolio, virtual investment portfolio, and watch list may represent various equity and debt securities. In one or more examples, equity and debt securities may include, but are not limited to, shares of common stock, corporate or governmental bonds, mutual funds, bond funds, preferred stock, debentures, warrants, options, exchange traded funds (ETFs), and any additional or alternate equity or debt security associated with a recognized and/or registered security identifier.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, portfolio data stored at provider data repository <b>120</b> may include information identifying the simulated or actual positions held by user <b>110</b> in these securities, as well as information identifying a schedule for providing electronic updates to user <b>110</b> regarding a performance of these securities. By way of example, the electronic updates may be provided by provider apparatus <b>108</b> to client device <b>102</b> in real-time or in near-real time. For instance, one or more of the near-real-time updates provided by provider apparatus <b>108</b> may include frequent and/or cached updates of real-time prices of the securities, which may be stale by a predefined time (every second, every 30 seconds, every minute, etc.). In other instances, provider apparatus <b>108</b> may be configured to provide one or more of the electronic updates to client device <b>102</b> at predetermined intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.) and/or in response to customer-specific events. Further, in one or more examples, provider apparatus <b>108</b> may delay the provision of one or more of the electronic updates to client device <b>102</b> by a predetermined time period (e.g., by fifteen or twenty minutes), and additionally or alternatively, provider apparatus <b>108</b> may provide one or more of the electronic updates to client device <b>102</b> at an end of a trading day on a corresponding market.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Provider data repository <b>120</b> may also store social networking data indicative of an interaction of customers of the financial institution with one or more social networks, such as TWITTER, FACEBOOK, FOURSQUARE, INSTAGRAM, TUMBLR, LINKEDIN, SNAPCHAT, and so on. For example, user <b>110</b> may be a regular user of TWITTER, and upon registration for digital banking services, user <b>110</b> may provide transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> with a corresponding TWITTER handle. Further, through a web page or other interface presented by client device <b>102</b>, user <b>110</b> may grant transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> access to information associated with user <b>110</b>'s FACEBOOK and/or TWITTER accounts, which may include, but is not limited to providing transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> with corresponding authentication credentials, which include, but are not limited to user names and/or handles, and passwords.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In one or more examples, provider apparatus <b>108</b> may establish customer profile data for one of more of the customers of a first entity, for example, a financial institution, which provider apparatus <b>108</b> may store in provider data repository <b>120</b> and additionally or alternatively, in an external data repository accessible to provider apparatus <b>108</b> across network <b>104</b>, for example, cloud-based storage. For example, provider apparatus <b>108</b> may establish a customer profile data file for user <b>110</b> that includes all or a portion of user <b>110</b>'s stored customer data, account data, portfolio data, and/or social networking data. In one or more examples, user <b>110</b> may access, update, and/or modify portions of the stored customer profile data through a web page or other graphical user interface (GUI) provided by provider apparatus <b>108</b> and rendered for presentation by client device <b>102</b>, such as through web browser <b>102</b>A or mobile app <b>102</b>B. In one or more examples, provider apparatus <b>108</b> may execute software instruction that dynamically modify and/or update user <b>110</b>'s customer profile data based financial services transactions and other financial services initiated and/or executed by provider apparatus <b>108</b> on user <b>110</b>'s behalf.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one or more examples, user <b>110</b>'s customer profile data may include information identifying one or more digital banking and investment services and programs associated with user <b>110</b> and/or user <b>110</b>'s accounts, for example, as held by the financial institution associated with provider apparatus <b>108</b>. For example, user <b>110</b> may elect to authorize and/or consent to the examples of processes for automated execution of purchase of precious metals orders as described below, for example, based on input provided to a web page or other GUI presented by client device <b>102</b>. In one or more examples, and in response to user <b>110</b>'s choice, provider apparatus <b>108</b> may update user <b>110</b>'s customer profile to include information indicative of user <b>110</b>'s decision to participate in the automated precious metals transaction processes.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In one or more examples, user <b>110</b>'s customer profile may also include information identifying one or more preferences and/or settings specified by user <b>110</b> for the digital banking and investment services and programs in which user <b>110</b> participates. By way of example, provider apparatus <b>108</b> may provide, to client device <b>102</b> for presentation for user <b>110</b>, one or more selectable preferences and settings associated with the precious metals transaction processes. For example, provider apparatus <b>108</b> may enable user <b>110</b> to select, for example, through a web page or GUI provided by provider apparatus <b>108</b> and presented by client device <b>102</b> one or more user accounts that may be accessible to the automated precious metals transaction processes described in greater detail, below.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Further, through a web page or GUI provided by transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> and presented by client device <b>102</b>, user <b>110</b> may specify that transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> should initiate execution of precious metals transactions. For example, user <b>110</b> may provide, as input to the web page or GUI presented by client device <b>102</b>, information identifying one or more accounts that fund precious metals orders held by user <b>110</b>. In one or more examples, transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> may store the user established default values, favorites, and mappings as preference data within transaction data repository <b>106</b>B or may access such information by accessing provider data repository <b>120</b> at provider apparatus <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Thus, it may be possible to increase the flexibility and ease of use for a transaction management apparatus, such as a transaction management apparatus designed to interact with a provider apparatus for a financial entity, as a non-limiting example, by using customer information already held by the example financial entity, to establish the identity of the customer. The identity of the customer may be used to determine how much to trust the customer, which would then establish the customer's approval to have a right to buy, e.g., to buy metals. Identifying the customer could also give access to retrieving and/or modifying customer information, as needed to pay for such precious metals transactions. As a result, it would be safer to approve larger dollar or weight transactions and pay for the precious metals using various accounts managed by the example financial entity, because there would be an assurance of the user's identity and ability to safely pay for the precious metals transactions.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In order to implement various features, the examples designed to facilitate the interaction between the transaction management apparatus and the provider apparatus may provide different levels of access, where users gain additional privileges with respect to purchasing the precious metals as they establish their identities and the system associates them with an appropriate level of access. For example, the approach used by the client device to interact with the main provider platform, whether it be a banking site or a mobile app, may receive login credentials from a user, and then use these login credentials to derive a &#x201c;Valet Ticket,&#x201d; which acts as a Single Sign-On (SSO) token that identifies the user in a unified, preapproved manner. The Valet Ticket may then be provided to the provider apparatus's information infrastructure so that the provider apparatus can perform a number of security transactions to provide certain authorizations to the transaction management apparatus, and then share information, either directly or through a VPN, as discussed in greater detail, below, in a manner that provides the transaction management apparatus with leverage information already held by the provider apparatus.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">One or more examples include a system architecture with an transaction management apparatus and a related provider apparatus that lets a user establish his or her identity and then use that established identity to discover customer information from the provider apparatus that helps the transaction management apparatus provide an appropriate level of access and appropriate purchasing options for the user. The system architecture according to examples may also provide the transaction management apparatus interaction with the provider apparatus to exploit information held by the provider apparatus to facilitate tasks such as obtaining customer consent, establishing transaction eligibility, and transferring funds held in accounts under the management and/or control of the provider apparatus, such as funds used in payment for precious metals transactions.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The system architecture may use a number of secure protocols to facilitate interaction between the user, the transaction management apparatus, and the provider apparatus to improve the user's experience in a number of ways. The technology may also help avoid other problems, such as the possibility of money laundering and/or fraud. Money laundering is a particularly large concern for precious metals transactions, in that precious metals such as gold, silver, and so on, are physical objects that have an intrinsic value and once they are purchased, can be used to fund illegal activities without the controls that may be placed on electronic transactions or standard currency, due to the ability to freely redistribute the precious metals once a user has physical possession of the precious metals.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Initially, the user logs in and establishes and authenticates his or her identity with the financial institution, through a client device. For example, the user may use a mobile app, a dedicated PC application, or a banking site. A financial institution may host a separate site specifically dedicated to a particular type of financial transactions, such as precious metals transactions, such as by using the transaction management apparatus. Once the user has identified himself or herself and authenticated his or her identity for the financial institution successfully, the user may then interact with the transaction management apparatus, which provides an interface that is specifically focused on providing the customer the capability to purchase precious metals appropriately.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In one or more examples, the user's experience may be enhanced in a number of ways. For example, once the provider authenticates the user, because the user is known or trusted, it may become an acceptable risk to increase the user's spending limit when the user would like to buy a large quantity of precious metals. Additionally, once the provider authenticates the user, because the system has access to additional information held by the financial institution, information may be gathered from the financial institution to provide statements and additional information that provide the user with additional information about how precious metals transactions affect their other accounts and provide detailed statements that provide enhanced information about other information associated with transactions.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method authenticating a user and allowing the user to perform a transaction in a system according to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in operation <b>310</b>, user <b>110</b> uses client device <b>102</b> to authenticate his or her identity, over the network <b>104</b>, with transaction management apparatus <b>106</b>, such as though main provider platform <b>180</b>, thereby generating an SSO token at the main provider platform <b>180</b>. Thus, authentication provides the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> with the ability to obtain information and otherwise interact with the provider apparatus <b>108</b> on behalf of the user <b>110</b>, obtaining information and initiating transactions for the user, such as in support of precious metals transactions. Such an SSO token may also be referred to as a &#x201c;Valet Key&#x201d; or &#x201c;Valet Ticket,&#x201d; and may be associated with a Valet Ticket ID. The SSO token provides a single sign-on process to identify and authenticate a user of transaction management apparatus <b>106</b>. Once such an authentication has occurred, the SSO token acts to provide information to transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> that transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> may use to gain access to provider apparatus <b>108</b>. The SSO token may include information about the user's identity, the user's access privileges, and authenticating information establishing such identity and access privilege information.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">SSO involves the client device <b>102</b> by creating a SAML assertion identifying the user <b>110</b>, and including a signature so the SAML cannot be tampered with or changed. Then, that SAML is sent into a web browser redirect to the destination site.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In one or more examples, because a transaction store, such as for precious metals, is hosted externally at the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b>, the process puts the SAML assertion into a Valet Service, which stores the SAML for us, and returns a Valet Key. The client device <b>102</b> then puts the Valet Key into the web browser redirect to the destination site, the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b>. This approach may help ensure that if the browser request is intercepted online, or in the middle, the attacker would only have a Valet Key, which would not be useful or identifiable. Only the provider site with access to the Valet API can retrieve it. The Valet Service storage may be short-lived, such as 60 seconds, as a non-limiting example, and cannot be accessed more than once. Once a Valet Key has been used, it and its contents may be deleted.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Operation <b>310</b> can occur in a variety of ways. The management apparatus <b>106</b> may use a content delivery provider <b>150</b>, such as a portal provided by AKAMAI to implement operation <b>310</b>. In one or more examples, discussed in greater detail below, the SSO token is validated in conjunction with SAML, a CSSP, and a Valet API. In yet another approach, the user may login and be authenticated by using a social network such as FACEBOOK, such that FACEBOOK, as a non-limiting example, provides an SSO token for access authorization. However, these are only non-limiting examples, and the SSO token may be generated in other ways in other examples that provide an authenticated SSO token that securely identifies the user <b>110</b> and determines the access privileges allocated to the user <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In operation <b>320</b>, the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> retrieves customer information using the SSO token. As discussed above, the SSO token identifies the user and establishes a way to access related information at the provider apparatus. For example, the customer information may be derived as a portion of a customer information file (CIF) associated with the user <b>110</b>. Because the SSO token identifies the user <b>110</b>, the SSO token may be used in operation <b>320</b> to access the provider data repository <b>120</b> as a source of customer information.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In operation <b>330</b>, the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> may receive transaction information from the user <b>110</b> via the network <b>104</b> from client device <b>102</b>. For example, the client device <b>102</b> may provide access to the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b>, such as by an application, the web browser <b>102</b>A, or the mobile app <b>102</b>B, and may interact with the user <b>110</b> via the network <b>104</b> from client device <b>102</b>, to establish which products the user <b>110</b> would like to purchase, ascertain how much payment is necessary, and what the source of the payment is.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In operation <b>340</b>, the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> uses the transaction information in combination with the customer information to establish that the purchase is an eligible purchase. Once it has been established that the purchase is an eligible purchase, the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> takes action to instruct the provider apparatus <b>108</b> to authorize payment and/or to provide the purchased item or items to the user. Such payment authorization and provision of purchased items are discussed in greater detail, below.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> are flowcharts illustrating a method authenticating a user to generate an SSO token, according to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In operation <b>410</b>, user <b>110</b> may take an action to navigate to the Precious Metals store at client device <b>102</b>. For example, the user <b>110</b> may click a link in the financial institution's site using the web browser <b>102</b>A, or may activate a control, such as a button, in the mobile app <b>102</b>B, indicating that the user <b>110</b> would like to access the Precious Metals store. Thus, such an initial interaction may be from the main provider platform <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In operation <b>412</b>, the financial institution's site or the mobile app may redirect the user to a Customer Single Sign-on Provider (CSSP), passing parameters identifying the destination as the Precious Metals site. The CSSP may be hosted by the provider apparatus <b>108</b>, or may be a separate entity.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In operation <b>414</b>, the CSSP may check the received information for validity. For example, the input information may be the user's session information, which may be a Session ID in the browser's session cookies. Other, related information may be passed to the CSSP if the login attempt occurs through a mobile app instead of through a financial institution's main site.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In operation <b>416</b>, the CSSP loads the SSO configuration used for enabling a transition from accessing the main provider platform <b>180</b> for a financial institution to a site for Precious Metals, hosted by transaction management apparatus <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In operation <b>418</b>, the CSSP gets the user access token, such as from the server-side cache, and may call an enterprise federation server that enables user authentication and single sign-on to exchange it for an SAML Assertion. For example, a suitable platform for this operation is PINGFEDERATE.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In operation <b>420</b>, the CSSP then calls the Valet API to store the SAML assertion, and gets back a Valet Key.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In operation <b>422</b>, the CSSP then sends a response to the user's browser&#x2014;a FORM with a redirect URL, which includes the Valet Key in the form input parameters.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In operation <b>424</b>, the browser <b>102</b>A may POST to a specific Precious Metals URI, which then handles the SSO intake process.

Further information, such as race and gender, may also be included if the information is available. Other information may also be stored in the CIF to improve security, such as security questions and answers and information related to multi-factor authentication, for use in one or more examples. The CIF may be a partial CIF at the discretion of the financial institution, e.g., including only information that is believed to be necessary for a particular transaction, such as a particular order or purchase.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In operation <b>510</b>, the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> may send the SSO token which it previously received to provider apparatus <b>108</b>, requesting access to information associated with the user <b>110</b>, such as the CIF associated with the user <b>110</b>. As noted above, the SSO token may be an OAuth token. For example, such an OAuth token may be an access token that can be used to gain direct access to services on the behalf of the user <b>110</b>. For example, the OAuth token may be used in conjunction with a policy language such as XACML to provide an access control architecture, a policy language to specify policies associated with the OAuth token, and a request/response scheme to send and receive authorization requests.

For example, the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> may ascertain if certain conditions are true that would cause the purchase to be ineligible. For example, the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> may check that the user is legally permitted to purchase products included in the transaction, that the user has sufficient funds to purchase products of the transaction, that the user is located at a suitable location to receive products of the transaction, that the user has consented to suitable terms to receive products of the transaction, that sufficient quantities of product are available to fulfill the products of the transaction, and/or that there is no flag or indicator associated with the user providing that it is not appropriate to fulfill the products of the transaction.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In operation <b>620</b>, results of the check performed in operation <b>620</b> may be used to determine that operation <b>640</b> may be performed, when the check indicates eligibility, and that operation <b>630</b> may be performed, when the check indicates ineligibility.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In particular, operation <b>640</b> includes processing the purchase, as explained in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In particular, operation <b>630</b> includes alerting the user <b>110</b> that there is an error in the purchase.

For example, if the user asks to buy a quantity of gold coins whose total price exceeds the amount of funds available to pay for the transaction, the user may be guided through various ways to resolve this issue, such as reducing the quantity of gold coins being purchased, changing the item being purchased, and changing how the transaction is to be paid for, according to non-limiting examples. The transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> may use a variety of techniques to cure errors identified in operation <b>620</b> to provide ways to have a transaction be successfully processed in operation <b>630</b>.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a context diagram illustrating data flow, according to one or more embodiments. In one or more examples, the online precious metals store may be a transaction site. For example, the transaction site may be a transaction site that provides JAVA-based tools that provide for the creation and management of sophisticated Internet web sites. For example, a financial institution may provide access to a proprietary site for a user <b>110</b> through one or more of the main provider site <b>702</b> for the financial institution), an API gateway <b>704</b> that provides a dedicated application to communicate with the transaction site <b>700</b>, a mobile app <b>706</b> that interacts with the transaction site <b>700</b>, and alternatively through other protocols for financial institution customers <b>708</b> and internal financial institution back office users <b>710</b>. An example aspect that all or some of these types of entities share is that they have a preexisting trust relationship with the financial institution itself that provides the financial institution the capability to verify and/or authenticate the user <b>110</b>, and then provide for access to improve secure access to the transaction site and provide the transaction site with additional flexibility.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">The transaction site also interacts with third party information sources and parties. For example, the transaction Store provides for actual delivery of the precious metals to branches by using a delivery service <b>712</b>, such as the GARDAWORLD corporation, which is a private security firm that offers secure delivery of the precious metals to the branch offices where purchasers can receive them. The transaction site <b>700</b> also coordinates credit card payments for the precious metals by using a credit card payment service <b>714</b>, such as BAMBORA, which is a Swedish provider of credit card transaction processing services. The transaction site <b>700</b> may also interact with a shipping and address validation service <b>716</b>, such as CANADA POST to coordinate shipping tasks, as well as using information supplied by CANADA POST to perform address validation. The transaction site <b>700</b> also interacts with a precious metals rates service <b>718</b>, such as THOMPSON REUTERS to access precious metals rates information. Finally, the transaction site <b>700</b> is able to provide limited transaction access for non-financial institution customers <b>720</b>, but because the financial institution does not have information for these customers, but it may still be appropriate to provide non-financial institution customers <b>720</b> the capability to perform some transactions. However, it is to be noted that because non-financial institution customers <b>720</b> may not be authenticated in the same manner as financial institution customers <b>708</b>, there may be limitations on what non-financial institution customers <b>720</b> are allowed to do. For example, non-financial institution customers <b>720</b> may be restricted to credit card payments, there may be caps on how much the non-financial institution customers <b>720</b> are allowed to spend, which products the non-financial institution customers <b>720</b> are allowed to purchase, where the products may be delivered, and so on, as non-limiting examples, and there may be other limitations placed on non-financial institution customers <b>720</b>, in other examples, and these enumerated limitations are not enforced in all examples.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating specific interactions between elements included in a transaction system, according to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an example system related to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, where some aspects have merely not been illustrated in order to facilitate illustrating interactions between the relevant portions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">An approach, as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, is to use a main provider platform <b>180</b>, such as a provider site or a mobile app, as non-limiting examples, which establishes, as an SSO for the user, a Valet Ticket ID.

By way of further explanation, the SSO process is also discussed in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">As noted above, the authorization is initiated when the user <b>110</b> performs an action at the client device <b>102</b> instructing main provider platform <b>180</b> to navigate to the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> hosting the transaction site. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates the data interactions between main provider platform <b>180</b>, transaction management apparatus <b>106</b>, provider apparatus <b>108</b>, and VPN <b>130</b>. Provider apparatus <b>108</b> also includes a customer single-sign on provider (CSSP) <b>108</b>A, valet API <b>108</b>B, unified authenticating platform (UAP) <b>108</b>C, enterprise foundation server <b>108</b>D, customer information manager <b>108</b>E, eConsent Manager <b>108</b>F, and direct-access storage (DAS) <b>108</b>G. When interacting with CSSP <b>108</b>A, valet API <b>108</b>B, UAP <b>108</b>C, enterprise foundation server <b>108</b>D, customer information manager <b>108</b>E, eConsent Manager <b>108</b>F, and direct-access storage (DAS) <b>108</b>G, VPN <b>130</b> may be provided as an intermediary element between transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> and these elements of provider apparatus <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">As a result of this initiating action, the main provider platform <b>180</b> provides a Valet Ticket ID for use in an SSO process.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">For example, the main provider platform <b>180</b> may interact with the CSSP <b>108</b>A, and the valet API <b>1088</b> may interact with transaction management apparatus <b>106</b>. Additionally, transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> may interact with UAP <b>108</b>C and enterprise foundation server <b>108</b>D to initially establish the SSO and provide a token to the user for use in access information.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">For example, main provider platform <b>180</b> may send an SAML assertion with a ConnectID to CSSP <b>108</b>A. CSSP <b>108</b>A may interact with Valet API <b>108</b>B, and main provider platform <b>180</b> may also send a Valet Ticket generated with an Enterprise Valet Service, which takes the SAML and returns a Valet Key associated with a Valet Ticket ID. The transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> may send the Valet Ticket ID to the Valet API <b>108</b>B, and return the SAML assertion for use in authenticating the user.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Once the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> has the SAML assertion, it interacts with UAP <b>108</b>C and Enterprise Foundation Server <b>108</b>D that provide an access token, such as an OAuth token with a ConnectID. As discussed above, through the use of the Valet Key, it becomes possible get the OAuth token without exposing user credentials unnecessarily.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">As part of the authentication pathway, the Transaction Store may use a VPN to pass the Valet Ticket ID to the Valet API, which then responds with the SAML assertion with the ConnectID that can be used for final authentication.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Once the user is identified and the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> has access to an access token, such as an OAuth token including the ConnectID, new ways of utilizing that identity by transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> to interact with the provider apparatus <b>108</b> are available and exploited.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">For example, transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> may communicate with customer information manager <b>108</b>E, such as through VPN <b>130</b> and Parties API <b>112</b>A. Here, the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> sends a ConnectID and receives a CIF Party Key, then sends the CIF Party Key and receives Customer information in return. Access to such a CIF party key provides many kinds of information stored by the financial institution at the customer information manager that can be used to improve the user's experience over previous approaches. For example, the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> supplies information discussed above, with customer information such as identifying information and account information that may be used to verify transaction eligibility, to pay for a transaction once eligibility has been established, and to facilitate delivery of the purchased goods, after they are paid for. However, this ordering is only a non-limiting example, and delivery of the purchased goods may be carried out prior to their being paid for, in another example.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Also, transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> may communicate with eConsent manager <b>108</b>F, such as through VPN <b>130</b> and Consent Events API <b>112</b>B and Consent Disclosure API <b>112</b>C. Consent Events API <b>112</b>B facilitates exchange of terms and conditions documents (T &#x26; Cs Document), and Consent Disclosure API <b>112</b>C facilitates the receipt of a CIF Party Key and a Consent document.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Such a CIF Party Key may then be used in tandem with a consent module, which may be hosted by the provider apparatus <b>108</b> or may be hosted separately that provides use of a consent events/disclosure APIs that can provide eConsent and send terms and conditions documents tailored to a particular user's circumstances. In one or more examples, the eConsent may be a one-time consent process, in which the user <b>110</b> consents to conditions for performing precious metals transactions. For example, the user <b>110</b> may agree to assume responsibility for various risks, such as if there is a delivery problem, as a non-limiting example. As noted, this eConsent may be a one-time consent, but it is also possible to perform the eConsent each time the user <b>110</b> performs a transaction, or have the user <b>110</b> use a control such as a checkbox or another GUI control at client device <b>102</b> to indicate whether the user <b>110</b> would like to perform a separate eConsent step for each transaction, or desires to skip eConsent subsequently, and assume that there is consent. In another example, the user <b>110</b> may opt to perform an eConsent process only if certain conditions are fulfilled, such as by only performing an eConsent process for transactions greater than a certain amount. For example, an eConsent process may involve electronically agreeing to certain with an e-signature, and/or verifying certain credentials to confirm and/or establish that the user <b>110</b> performing the eConsent is actually the user <b>110</b> that the provider apparatus <b>108</b> believes to be performing the transaction.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">The transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> may then interact with provider apparatus <b>108</b> to use a Direct-Attached Storage (DAS) <b>108</b>G that stores information for provider apparatus <b>108</b>, which may be implemented as provider data repository <b>120</b>, to store information to establish eligibility and perform the necessary transactions to purchase the precious metals under consideration. However, a DAS <b>108</b>G is only a non-limiting example of how the provider apparatus <b>108</b> may store information, and in other examples, the provider apparatus <b>108</b> uses other storage approaches. Importantly, other accounts may be used for payment, and payment is not limited to a credit card. The ability to track transactions also provides for higher transaction limits and may help avoid concerns about money laundering.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">For example, transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> may communicate with DAS <b>108</b>G, such as through VPN <b>130</b> and Eligibility API <b>112</b>D and Transfer API <b>112</b>E. Eligibility API <b>112</b>D may receive the ConnectID in the OAuth Token, and may return information about eligible accounts. Transfer API <b>112</b>E may also receive the ConnectID in the OAuth Token, and may return a transfer money response.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating ways of implementing transactions, according to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In operation <b>910</b>, the transaction management apparatus <b>106</b> checks that the user's transaction is eligible.
