patent application claims priority from Italian patent application no. 102021000017258 filed on Jun. 30, 2021, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method to control a burner for an exhaust system of an internal combustion engine.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As is known, an internal combustion engine is typically provided with a number of cylinders, each of which is connected to an intake manifold and an exhaust manifold, to which an exhaust duct is connected which feeds the exhaust gases produced by combustion to an exhaust system, which emits the gases produced by combustion into the atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An exhaust gas after-treatment system usually comprises a precatalytic converter arranged along the exhaust duct; a particulate filter also arranged along the exhaust duct, downstream of the precatalytic converter; and a catalytic converter arranged along the exhaust duct, upstream of the particulate filter.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also provided along the exhaust duct are a first lambda sensor housed along the exhaust duct and arranged upstream of the precatalytic converter to detect the air/fuel ratio (or titer) of the exhaust gases entering the precatalytic converter; a second lambda sensor housed along the exhaust duct and interposed between the precatalytic converter and the assembly defined by the catalytic converter and by the particulate filter to detect the oxygen concentration inside the exhaust gases downstream of the precatalytic converter; and lastly, a third lambda sensor housed along the exhaust duct and arranged downstream of the assembly defined by the catalytic converter and by the particulate filter to detect the oxygen concentration inside the exhaust gases downstream of the assembly defined by the catalytic converter and by the particulate filter.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Lastly, the exhaust gas after-treatment system also comprises a burner suited to introduce the exhaust gases (and consequently heat) into the exhaust duct so as to speed up heating of the catalytic converter and so as to facilitate the regeneration of the particulate filter.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A combustion chamber is defined inside the burner, the chamber receives fresh air and receives fuel from an injector, which is designed to cyclically inject fuel inside the combustion chamber. In addition, a spark plug is coupled to the burner to determine the ignition of the mixture present inside the combustion chamber.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is of utmost importance to be able to control the combustion that occurs inside the burner so as to ensure that the optimal thermal power and the desired/objective value of the air/fuel ratio of the exhaust gases exiting the burner are achieved.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For this reason, it has been proposed to house a further lambda sensor along a duct adapted to discharge the exhaust gases exiting the burner into the exhaust duct; said further lambda sensor is dedicated exclusively to detecting the air/fuel ratio of the exhaust gases exiting the burner. However, this solution is economically disadvantageous as it involves the use of a further lambda sensor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">To overcome this problem, it has been proposed to arrange the burner so as to introduce the exhaust gases into the exhaust duct between the first lambda sensor (so that the first lambda sensor is exclusively hit by the exhaust gases produced by the internal combustion engine) and the second lambda sensor (so that the second lambda sensor is hit by both the exhaust gases produced by the internal combustion engine and the exhaust gases produced by the burner); and use the signals coming from the first lambda sensor and from the second lambda sensor to control the burner and operate the air flow rate and fuel fed to the burner.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The document US2003221425 relates to a method to control an exhaust system of an internal combustion engine provided with a burner.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The aim of the present invention is to provide a method to control a burner for an exhaust system of an internal combustion engine which is free of the drawbacks described above and, in particular, is easy and inexpensive to implement.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the present invention, a method to control a burner for an exhaust system of an internal combustion engine is provided according to what is claimed in the appended claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention will now be described with reference to the appended drawings, which illustrate a non-limiting embodiment thereof, wherein:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows an internal combustion engine provided with a first variant of an exhaust gas after-treatment system having an electronic control unit that implements the control method obtained in accordance with the present invention;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a second variant of the exhaust gas after-treatment system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> schematically illustrates a detail of the exhaust gas after-treatment system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>6</b></figref> are block diagrams that schematically illustrate a first variant of the method to control the air flow rate object of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram that schematically illustrates the method to control the fuel flow rate object of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref> are block diagrams that schematically illustrate a second variant of the method to control the air flow rate object of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> are block diagrams that schematically illustrate a third variant of the method to control the air flow rate object of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref> are block diagrams that schematically illustrate a fourth variant of the method to control the air flow object of the present invention;
