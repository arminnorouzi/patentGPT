For control of the crystal orientations, the phenomenon of catastrophic grain growth called secondary recrystallization is utilized.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The method for manufacturing grain-oriented electrical steel sheet is as follows: A slab is heated and hot rolled to produce hot rolled steel sheet. The hot rolled steel sheet is annealed according to need. The hot rolled steel sheet is pickled. The pickled hot rolled steel sheet is cold rolled by a cold rolling rate of 80% or more to produce cold rolled steel sheet. The cold rolled steel sheet is decarburization annealed to cause primary recrystallization. The decarburization annealed cold rolled steel sheet is finish annealed to cause secondary recrystallization. Due to the above process, grain-oriented electrical steel sheet is produced.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">After the above-mentioned decarburization annealing and before the finish annealing, an annealing separator having MgO as a main constituent is deposited on the surface of the cold rolled steel sheet. Usually, the method is to coat an aqueous slurry comprising the annealing separator components on the cold rolled steel sheet and make it dry. The cold rolled steel sheet with the annealing separator deposited on it is taken up into a coil, then is finish annealed. At the time of finish annealing, the MgO in the annealing separator and the SiO<sub>2 </sub>in the internal oxide layer formed on the surface of the cold rolled steel sheet at the time of decarburization annealing react whereby a primary coating having forsterite (Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>) as a main constituent is formed on the steel sheet surface. After forming the primary coating, the primary coating is, for example, formed with an insulating coating (also referred to as a &#x201c;secondary coating&#x201d;) comprised of colloidal silica and a phosphate. The primary coating and insulating coating are smaller in heat expansion coefficient than the base steel sheet. For this reason, the primary coating, together with the insulating coating, imparts tension to the base steel sheet to reduce the iron loss. The primary coating, furthermore, raises the adhesion of the insulating coating on the base steel sheet. Therefore, the adhesion of the primary coating on the base steel sheet is preferably higher.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, raising the magnetic flux density and lowering the hysteresis loss are effective for lowering the iron loss of grain-oriented electrical steel sheet.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To raise the magnetic flux density of grain-oriented electrical steel sheet, it is effective to control the crystal orientations of the base steel sheet to the Goss orientation. Art for improving integration to the Goss orientation is proposed in PTLs 1 to 3. In these patent literature, elements improving the magnetic properties which strengthen the action of the inhibitors (precipitates suppressing normal crystal grain growth) (Cu, Sn, Sb, Bi, Te, Pb, Se, etc.) are comprised in the base steel sheet. Due to this, integration of the crystal orientations to the Goss orientation rises and the magnetic flux density of the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet can be raised.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the interface of a base steel sheet and primary coating is formed so that the interfacial energy becomes as low as possible by making the interface of the base steel sheet and the primary coating flat. In particular, if the base steel sheet comprises elements for improving the magnetic properties, it is easier to make the interface flat. If the interface of the base steel sheet and the primary coating becomes flatter, the anchoring structures of the primary coating causing physical bonding strength between the primary coating and the base steel sheet are lost, so adhesion of the primary coating to the base steel sheet falls.

The behaviors in peeling due to shearing and bending differ, so to secure the adhesion of a primary coating to a base steel sheet in electrical steel sheet used for the method of manufacturing iron cores with high bendability in recent years, adhesion whereby the primary coating will not peel off when bending under tougher conditions than the past is necessary. Even in a material with no problem in resistance to peeling of the sheared end faces, sometimes resistance to tough bending operations cannot necessarily be obtained.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, in the process of purification of the constituents of the steel sheet in the latter stage of the finish annealing, nitrogen and other gases contained in the steel sheet is released. At this time, the primary coating slows the passage of the gas. At this time, if the speed of passage of gas through the primary coating becomes too slow, the gas pressure at the interface of the primary coating and the base iron becomes high and the primary coating will sometimes be blown off and destroyed. Due to this, exposed parts of the base material of point shapes of a size able to be discerned by the naked eye appear at the surface of the steel sheet. If these point shaped exposed parts of the base material appear at a number density of a certain high extent across a broad range of the surface of the steel sheet, serious defects occur in the insulation and quality of appearance. The techniques for improving the adhesion of the primary coating mentioned above do not necessarily suppress point defects, so art for controlling the form of the primary coating not giving rise to point defects has been sought.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Regarding the adhesion of the primary coating, various studies have been conducted on peeling of the end faces in shearing operations and peeling of the surface in bending operations, but it cannot be said that optimal steel sheet and manufacturing methods have been proposed strictly differentiating between these. The behavior and mechanism of peeling due to shearing and bending and the generation of high pressure gas differ, so if used for a method for manufacturing iron cores, which requires bending operations, adhesion whereby the primary coating will not peel off when performing bending operations severer than the past and suppression of defects in the primary coating caused by the generation of gas from the steel sheet become necessary. If including Y, La, Ce, Sr, Ca, and Ba in the annealing separator to form a primary coating comprising Y, La, Ce, Sr, Ca, and Ba, there are technical issues such as the case where there might be no problem with adhesion of the primary coating with respect to shearing operations, but the adhesion of the primary coating with respect to bending operations would be insufficient or the case where gas generated from the steel sheet during the finish annealing would cause destruction of the primary coating of the base steel sheet and the occurrence of defects where the surface of the steel sheet is exposed in point shapes. For this reason, as electrical steel sheet free from problems in insulation and appearance and high in reliability, a material with adhesion of the primary coating with respect to bending operations (below, referred to simply as the &#x201c;coating adhesion&#x201d;) and with few defects where the base metal is exposed in point shapes has been desired.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">An object of the present invention is to provide grain-oriented electrical steel sheet excellent in magnetic properties and adhesion of a primary coating to a base steel sheet, having few defects where the base metal is exposed in point shapes and finish annealing-use steel sheet, an annealing separator, a method for manufacturing grain-oriented electrical steel sheet, and a method for manufacturing finish annealing-use steel sheet.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention is characterized by controlling and defining the structure of the interface of a primary coating and a base steel sheet of grain-oriented electrical steel sheet to specify the structure of the primary coating.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the present invention, based on the shape features shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the primary coating is divided into two regions in the thickness direction and the structures at the respective regions are prescribed. In the following explanation, to express the two regions, the surface side will be referred to using the term the &#x201c;surface oxide layer (<b>1</b>)&#x201d; and the base steel sheet side will be referred to using the term the &#x201c;anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>)&#x201d;. The surface oxide layer (<b>1</b>) is the region in the thickness direction in which the part of the primary coating covering the surface of the base steel sheet relatively evenly (below, this will sometimes be described as the &#x201c;surface oxides&#x201d;) is present. The anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>) is the region in the thickness direction in which parts of the primary coating penetrating into the base steel sheet (below, this will sometimes be described as the &#x201c;anchoring oxides&#x201d;) are present. The reference value H0 of the depth dividing the two will be explained later.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this Description, the structure of the interface will be prescribed by morphological features observing the primary coating from the base steel sheet side. Details will be explained later together with the measurement methods.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Such structures of the interface of the primary coating and the base steel sheet, in particular the characteristic shapes, in general are sometimes expressed using the term &#x201c;roots&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The interface between the primary coating and base steel sheet of the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet forms uneven shapes in which the anchoring oxides penetrate to the inside of the base steel sheet. If the depth of penetration of the anchoring oxides becomes deeper and the number density of the number of oxide particles (/&#x3bc;m<sup>3</sup>) increases, the adhesion of the primary coating to the base steel sheet rises due to the so-called &#x201c;anchor effect&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">On the other hand, if anchoring oxides penetrate inside of the base steel sheet too much, they will become factors obstructing the crystal grain growth of the steel sheet at the time of secondary recrystallization or the domain wall movement at the time of magnetization and the magnetic properties will deteriorate.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Further, the primary coating has the effect of imparting tension to the steel sheet and lowering the iron loss. To increase the tension, the surface oxide layer (<b>1</b>) in the primary coating is preferably high in content of Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>with the small coefficient of linear expansion, while the surface oxide layer (<b>1</b>) is preferably thick.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The inventors investigated and studied the magnetic properties of grain-oriented electrical steel sheet comprising elements for improving the magnetic properties and the adhesion of a primary coating formed using an annealing separator comprising Y, La, and Ce and Ca, Sr, and Ba based on the above general assumptions. As a result, the inventors obtained the following findings.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Here, in the following explanation, one or more elements selected from a group comprising Y, La, and Ce will sometimes be described together as &#x201c;Y group elements&#x201d; and one or more elements selected from a group comprising Ca, Sr, and Ba will sometimes be described together as &#x201c;Ca group elements&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">If making the annealing separator comprise Y group elements and Ca group elements to form the primary coating, even if the coating adhesion with respect to shearing is sufficient, sometimes the coating adhesion with respect to bending will not be sufficiently obtained. Further, if simultaneously adding the Y group elements and Ca group elements simultaneously in large amounts to improve the coating adhesion with respect to bending, the iron loss and the magnetic flux density sometimes fall.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Further, below, even if increasing the area of the surface of the anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>) so as to control the form of the primary coating to raise the coating adhesion, sometimes the primary coating is blown off by the gas produced from the steel sheet during the finish annealing and defects arise where the base metal is exposed in point shapes.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">After this, if simply describing &#x201c;adhesion&#x201d; other than at locations clearly differentiating between the coating adhesion with respect to shearing and the coating adhesion with respect to bending, it will sometimes be used with the intension of inclusion of coating adhesion with respect to shearing and coating adhesion with respect to bending.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, below, when simply referring to &#x201c;point defects&#x201d;, this is sometimes used intending defects where the primary coating is blown off by the gas produced from the steel sheet during the finish annealing and the base steel sheet being exposed in point shapes.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The inventors further studied the effects of the Y group elements and Ca group elements in the annealing separator and as a result obtained the following findings.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">If the annealing separator comprises Y group elements, the anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>) becomes thicker. Due to this, the coating adhesion with respect to shearing is improved.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further, if the annealing separator comprises Ca group elements, the number density of the anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>) of the primary coating formed increases and the coating adhesion with respect to shearing is improved. Furthermore, if, as the total content of the Ca group elements prescribed below in the primary coating, making the total content of the Ca group elements comprised as impurities in the raw material powder of MgO and the content derived from compounds of the Ca group elements comprised outside the raw material powder of Mg suitable ratios, the coating adhesion with respect to bending becomes higher, deterioration of the magnetic properties is suppressed, and further point defects are also suppressed. At this time, in the primary coating, the surface oxide layer (<b>1</b>) becomes uniform in thickness and the Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>phases increase and, further, the anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>) becomes longer in longitudinal width direction in addition to the thickness direction. The improvement of the coating adhesion with respect to bending is believed to be caused by the thickness of the surface oxide layer (<b>1</b>) becoming uniform and concentration of local stress at regions of the surface oxide layer (<b>1</b>) which are thin in thickness being avoided at the time of bending operations. Further, the improvement of the magnetic properties is believed to be due to the higher tension acting on the steel sheet due to the increase in the amount of Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>phases in the surface oxide layer (<b>1</b>).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further, by suppressing point defects, not only does the area of the interface of the anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>) responsible for the adhesion increase, but also the oxides become intertwined in form resulting in a structure with many routes for diffusion of gas. The cause is believed to be the improvement in gas permeability of the anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Furthermore, it was clarified that a primary coating having such excellent properties is characterized not only simply by the shapes of the interfacial uneven shapes, but also the form of presence of Al near the interface of the primary coating. Further, the features of the annealing separator used for forming such a primary coating were clarified.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The interface of a base steel sheet and primary coating becomes a complicated three-dimensional shape having uneven shapes such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, so the inventors experimented with prescribing structural features of the interface of the three-dimensional shape. The provisions should inherently quantize the &#x201c;three-dimensional structures&#x201d;, but this was difficult since they are three-dimensional and complicated structures. For this reason, the inventors experimented with projecting information relating to the interfacial structures on a plane parallel to the surface of the steel sheet such as explained later and prescribing features of the interface at the &#x201c;plane&#x201d;. Further, it was confirmed that the effect of the present invention can be evaluated and explained by quantitative provisions based on the &#x201c;features on the projection plane&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The characterizing feature of the present invention obtained by these findings are as follows:</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">That is, if using an annealing separator having MgO as its main constituent and in which Y group elements and Ca group elements are comprised to form a primary coating having Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>as its main constituent and comprising Y group elements and Ca group elements, if the primary coating and the interface of the primary coating and base steel sheet satisfy the features shown in the following (1) to (8), the anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>) and the surface oxide layer (<b>1</b>) become suitable in form and achievement of both adhesion of the primary coating against shearing and bending and the iron loss characteristic becomes possible.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">(1) Number density D3 of number of Al concentrated regions: 0.015 to 0.150/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>,</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">(2) (Area S5 of regions comprised of anchoring oxide layer regions and Al concentrated regions)/(area S3 of Al concentrated regions)&#x2265;0.30,</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">(3) Distance H5 of mean value of heights in thickness direction of regions of comprised of anchoring oxide layer regions and Al concentrated regions minus H0: 0.4 to 4.0 &#x3bc;m,</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">(4) (Total perimeter L5 of regions comprised of anchoring oxide layer regions and Al concentrated regions)/(observed area S0): 0.020 to 0.500 &#x3bc;m/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>,</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">(5) (Area S1 of anchoring oxide layer regions)/(observed area S0)&#x2265;0.15</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">(6) Total content of Y group elements: 0.1 to 6.0 mass %,</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">(7) Total content of Ca group elements: 0.1 to 6.0 mass %,</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">(8) Number density D4 of Ca group element concentrated regions: 0.005 to 2.000/&#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup></p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, the finish annealing-use steel sheet for manufacturing the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet satisfies the following condition (9):</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">(9) Number density D42 of Ca group elements in Ca group element concentrated regions of annealing separator layer: 0.005 to 1.400/&#x3bc;m<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, the primary coating and the annealing separator able to form the annealing separator layer satisfy the conditions of the following (10) to (17).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">(10) (0.00562[Y]+0.00360[La]+0.00712[Ce])/0.0412[Mg]&#xd7;100(%): 0.20 to 1.60%, (11) (1.40[Ca]+1.18Sr+1.12Ba)/1.66[Mg]&#xd7;100: 0.20 to 1.80%,</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">(12) (0.0249[Ca&#x2032;]+0.0114[Sr&#x2032;]+0.0073[Ba&#x2032;])/0.0412[Mg&#x2032;]&#xd7;100: 0.010 to 0.080%,</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">(13) (12) (10)/(11): 0.020 to 0.200,</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">(14) Mean particle size R1 of MgO: 0.1 to 2.8 &#x3bc;m,</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">(15) Mean particle size R2 of particles comprising Ca group elements in the Ca group</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">element concentrated regions: 0.2 to 3.0 m,</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">(16) (Mean particle size R2)/(mean particle size R1): 0.5 to 3.0.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The gist of the present invention obtained by these findings is as follows:</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The grain-oriented electrical steel sheet according to the present invention comprises a base steel sheet having a chemical composition comprising, by mass %, C: 0.0050% or less, Si: 2.5 to 4.5%, Mn: 0.02 to 0.20%, one or more elements selected from the group comprised of S and Se: total of 0.005% or less, sol.

This observed surface is analyzed by a scan type confocal laser microscope to obtain the distribution of uneven shapes at the interface (information of interface in depth direction). Further, the observed surface was analyzed using an SEM-EDS. The distributions of concentration of the various elements present in the primary coating were obtained from the characteristic X-ray intensities. The observations of these equipment are performed in the direction vertical to the surface of the steel sheet peeled from, so the obtained information is information on the primary coating having a three-dimensional structure (uneven shapes and characteristic X-ray intensity) projected on a plane parallel to the surface of the steel sheet.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the explanation regarding the interface in the Description from here on, it should be noted in advance that the explanation uses the &#x201c;features on the projection plane&#x201d;. For example, the &#x201c;area&#x201d; relating to the structures of the interface is the area obtained on the projection plane. The regions of presence of elements are identified based on the characteristic X-ray intensities of the elements obtained on the projection plane.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">However it is confirmed that these features obtained on the projection plane can prescribe well the characterizing features of the present invention. Using the information of the primary coating on the projection plane to explain the present invention needless to say does not cause any loss of significance of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Further, in this Description, unless otherwise indicated, further, regarding the numerical values A and B, the expression &#x201c;A to B&#x201d; shall mean &#x201c;A or more and B or less&#x201d;.

Further, in this Description, the &#x201c;main constituent&#x201d; means the constituent comprised in 50 mass % or more in a certain substance and preferably means 70 mass % or more, more preferably 90 mass % or more.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Below, the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet according to the present invention and the method for manufacturing grain-oriented electrical steel sheet, the annealing separator used for manufacture of grain-oriented electrical steel sheet, the finish annealing-use steel sheet for manufacturing the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet, and the method for manufacturing the finish annealing-use steel sheet will be explained in detail. In this Description, the &#x201c;%&#x201d; regarding the contents of elements will mean &#x201c;mass %&#x201d; unless otherwise indicated.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The grain-oriented electrical steel sheet according to one aspect of the present invention is provided with a base steel sheet and a primary coating formed on the surface of the base steel sheet.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Base Steel Sheet</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The chemical composition of the base steel sheet forming the above-mentioned grain-oriented electrical steel sheet comprises the following elements. Provided, however, that the characterizing feature of the present invention lies in the primary coating. The base steel sheet does not have to be a special one. Note that, as explained in the following method for manufacture, a base steel sheet is manufactured by cold rolling using hot rolled steel sheet having the later explained chemical composition. Further, there are constituents lost during the finish annealing, so the chemical composition of the base steel sheet forming the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet and the chemical composition of the hot rolled steel sheet greatly differ.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">C: 0.0050% or Less</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Carbon (C) is an element effective for the microstructure control up to completion of the decarburization annealing in the manufacturing process, but if the content of C is over 0.0050%, the magnetic properties of the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet of the final product sheet fall. Therefore, the content of C is 0.0050% or less. The content of C is preferably as low as possible. However, even if reducing the content of C to less than 0.0001%, the manufacturing costs just build up. The above effect does not change much at all. Therefore, the preferable lower limit of the content of C is 0.0001%.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Si 2.5 to 4.5%</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Silicon (S) raises the electrical resistance of steel to reduce the eddy current loss. If the content of Si is less than 2.5%, the above effect is not sufficiently obtained. On the other hand, if the content of Si is over 4.5%, the cold workability of the steel falls. Therefore, the content of Si is 2.5 to 4.5%. The preferable lower limit of the content of Si is 2.6%, more preferably 2.8%. The preferable upper limit of the content of Si is 4.0%, more preferably 3.8%.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Mn: 0.02 to 0.20%</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Manganese (Mn) bonds with the later explained S and Se in the manufacturing process to form MnS and MnSe. These precipitates function as inhibitors (inhibitors of normal crystal grain growth) and in steel cause secondary recrystallization. Mn further raises the hot workability of steel. If the content of Mn is less than 0.02%, the above effect is not sufficiently obtained. On the other hand, if the Mn content is over 0.20%, secondary recrystallization does not occur and the magnetic properties of the steel are liable to fall. Therefore, the content of Mn is 0.02 to 0.20%. The preferable lower limit of the content of Mn is 0.03%, more preferably 0.04%. The preferable upper limit of the content of Mn is 0.13%, more preferably 0.1%.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">One or More Elements Selected from the Group Comprised of S and Se: Total of 0.005% or Less</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The sulfur (S) content and selenium (Se) bond with Mn in the manufacturing process to form MnS and MnSe functioning as inhibitors. However, if the contents of these elements are over a total of 0.005%, due to the remaining inhibitors, the magnetic properties fall. Furthermore, due to segregation of S and Se, in grain-oriented electrical steel sheet, sometimes surface defects are caused. Therefore, in grain-oriented electrical steel sheet, the total content of the one or more elements selected from the group comprised of S and Se is 0.005% or less. The total of the contents of S and Se in the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet is preferably as low as possible. However, even if reducing the content of S and the content of Se in the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet to less than 0.0001%, the manufacturing costs just build up. The above effect does not change much at all. Therefore, the preferable lower limit of the total content of the one or more elements selected from the group comprised of S and Se in the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet is 0.0001%.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Sol. Al: 0.010% or Less</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Aluminum (Al) bonds with N in the manufacturing process of the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet to form AlN functioning as an inhibitor. However, if the content of sol. Al in the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet is over 0.010%, the above inhibitor excessively remains in the base steel sheet, so the magnetic properties fall. Therefore the content of sol. Al is 0.010% or less. The preferable upper limit of the content of sol. Al is 0.004%, more preferably 0.003%. The content of sol. Al is preferably as low as possible. However, even if reducing the content of sol. Al in the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet to less than 0.0001%, the manufacturing costs just build up. The above effect does not change much at all. Therefore, the preferable lower limit of the content of sol. Al in the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet is 0.0001%. Note that, in this Description, sol. Al means &#x201c;acid soluble Al&#x201d;. Therefore the content of sol. Al is the content of acid soluble Al.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">What to take note of is that, as explained later, the Al of the characterizing feature of the primary coating of the present invention is derived from the base steel sheet. For this reason, at first glance, the fact that the Al content of the base steel sheet is zero would seem to be contradictory to the presence of Al in the primary coating, but what concentrates at the primary coating is the &#x201c;Al which had been comprised in the base steel sheet in the middle of manufacture&#x201d;. In the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet of the present invention, after concentration of the Al of the characterizing feature of the present invention occurs, the Al of the base steel sheet is discharged to outside the system by the high temperature heat treatment also called &#x201c;purification annealing&#x201d; of one process of finish annealing. For this reason, the final base steel sheet not comprising Al and the final primary coating having Al derived from the base steel sheet present are not contradictory.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">N: 0.010% or Less</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Nitrogen (N) bonds with Al in the manufacturing process of grain-oriented electrical steel sheet to form AlN which functions as an inhibitor. However, if the content of N in the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet is over 0.010%, the above inhibitor excessively remains in the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet, so the magnetic properties fall. Therefore, the content of N is 0.010% or less. The preferable upper limit of the content of N is 0.004%, more preferably 0.003%. The content of N is preferably as low as possible. However, even if reducing the total of the content of N in the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet to less than 0.0001%, the manufacturing costs just build up. The above effect does not change much at all. Therefore, the preferable lower limit of the content of N in the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet is 0.0001%.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The balance of the chemical composition of the base steel sheet of the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet according to the present invention is comprised of Fe and impurities. Here, &#x201c;impurities&#x201d; mean the following elements which enter from the ore used as the raw material, the scrap, or the manufacturing environment etc. when industrially manufacturing the base steel sheet or remain in the steel without being completely removed in the purification annealing and which are allowed to be comprised in a content not having a detrimental effect on the action of the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Regarding Impurities</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Regarding copper (Cu), tin (Sn), antimony (Sb), bismuth (Bi), tellurium (Te), and lead (Pb), part of the Cu, Sn, and Sb, Bi, Te, and Pb in the base steel sheet is discharged outside of the system by high temperature heat treatment also known as &#x201c;purification annealing&#x201d; of one process of the finish annealing. These elements raise the selectivity of orientation of the secondary recrystallization in the finish annealing to exhibit the action of improvement of the magnetic flux density, but if remaining in the base steel sheet after completion of the finish annealing, cause the deterioration of the iron loss as simple impurities. Therefore, the total content of the one or more elements selected from the group comprising Cu, Sn, and Sb, Bi, Te, and Pb is 0.30% or less. As explained above these elements are impurities, so the total content of these elements is preferably as low as possible.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Primary Coating</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The characterizing feature of the structure of the primary coating is most important in the present invention. This characterizing feature, as explained before, also includes limitation of the measurement method. In the present invention, information of the interface of the primary coating and base steel sheet is projected on a plane parallel to the surface of the steel sheet and is prescribed on that plane (from here on, sometimes simply described as the &#x201c;projection plane&#x201d;). To obtain a grasp of the characterizing feature of the primary coating, understanding the measurement method is considered important, so first the measurement method will be explained.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Method of Measurement of Primary Coating, in Particular Interfacial Structures</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Grain-oriented electrical steel sheet with a primary coating formed on its surface is electrolyzed by a constant potential in an electrolytic solution so that only the base steel sheet begins to be dissolved, then the primary coating is separated from the base steel sheet and used as the sample for observation. Note that, in the electrolysis for obtaining the sample, the base steel sheet of the interface is selectively electrolyzed, so there is no need to electrolyze the entire base steel sheet. A suitable amount of electrolysis may be set. The amount of electrolysis is for example 80C per 1 cm<sup>2 </sup>of the steel sheet area (80 C/cm<sup>2</sup>). In separation of the primary coating, there is the method of attaching the primary coating on the adhesive surface of a commercially available metal tape etc., then removing the base steel sheet and observing what remains at the tape side, the method of using paraffin to envelop it, then removing the paraffin, etc.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">After this, this separated primary coating will sometimes be referred to as the &#x201c;interface observation sample&#x201d; and the surface of the primary coating to be observed at the side adhered to the base steel sheet will sometimes be referred to as the &#x201c;observed surface&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Next, the interface observation sample is observed by various types of observation equipment from a direction vertical to the surface of the steel sheet peeled from (thickness direction of grain-oriented electrical steel sheet). Accordingly, the data obtained from the equipment becomes information of the interface observation sample laid out on a projection plane. The following explanation is given predicated on this data on the projection plane. That is, for example, the description &#x201c;at the interface&#x201d; is an explanation of the state of the data on the projection plane. Here, the direction in the thickness direction from the primary coating side to the base steel sheet side is defined as positive. The term &#x201c;height&#x201d; used below expresses the direction from the primary coating side toward the base steel sheet side as high.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Regarding the above observed surface of the sample for observation of the interface, a region of 20 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;15 &#x3bc;m or more is analyzed by a scan type confocal laser microscope (Model No. VK9710, made by Keyence) to obtain uneven shape data of the interface on the projection plane. At this time, the scan steps are made 0.1 &#x3bc;m or less. The obtained 30000 pixels (200 pixels&#xd7;150 pixels) or more uneven shape data is smoothed once by a size 3&#xd7;3 Gaussian filter (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) one time. Furthermore, the uneven shape data after smoothing was processed by automatic quadric surface correction based on the centerline in the width direction and the centerline in the height direction to lay out the data on the projection plane and obtain the final 200&#xd7;150 uneven shape distribution chart.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic view showing the three-dimensional structure of the back surface of the peeled off primary coating and the anchoring parts.

At this time, the scan steps are made 0.1 &#x3bc;m or less and a 200&#xd7;150 pixel characteristic X-ray intensity distribution chart is obtained on the projection plane. At this time, based on the resolution of the characteristic X-ray intensity distribution chart, a 200&#xd7;150 pixel or more region is overlaid on a uneven shape distribution chart. That is, it is made to make each pixel of a 200&#xd7;150 pixel or more region of a digital image of the characteristic X-ray intensity distribution chart correspond to one or more points of the height data of the uneven shape distribution chart of the corresponding region (preferably all of the points). Below, this will be called the characteristic X-ray intensity and uneven shape correlation distribution chart.

The number densities of the regions of A<b>3</b> and A<b>4</b> are respectively made D3 and D4. In identification of the number densities of the numbers of regions, a region where pixels continue up and down or left and right in pixel units is deemed a single region. Further, regions comprised of four or more pixels are identified and the number counted. Note that, the area of one pixel is, as explained above, the scan step 0.1 &#x3bc;m at the time of measurement (more specifically, 0.092 m), so the area of the region becomes 0.1 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;0.1 &#x3bc;m (more specifically, 0.092 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;0.092 &#x3bc;m)&#xd7;number of regions.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">It goes without saying, but for example D3 is, for the regions A<b>3</b>, the value of the total number of regions measured while deeming regions where pixels continue in pixel units as single regions divided by the area of the observed region A<b>0</b> (that is, the entire observed area S0).

The primary coating of the present invention has Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>as its main constituent, but there is a major characterizing feature in the Al distribution near the interface of the primary coating and the base steel sheet. This feature mainly can be identified in the &#x201c;anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>)&#x201d;, so first the feature relating to the anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>) and then the feature of the primary coating as a whole will be explained.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Regarding the above D3 of the number density of Al concentrated regions A<b>3</b> near the interface, the present invention is characterized in that D3: 0.015 to 0.150/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>. If D3 is outside this range, the effect of improvement of the coating adhesion with respect to bending cannot be obtained.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Further, the ratio of the perimeter L5 of the regions comprised of the anchoring oxide layer region in the Al concentrated regions, that is, the regions comprised of the anchoring oxide layer region A<b>1</b> and Al (aluminum) concentrated regions A<b>3</b> (anchoring Al regions A<b>5</b>), to the observed area, L5/S0, is characterized by being in the range of 0.020 to 0.500 m/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>. If this ratio becomes less than 0.02 &#x3bc;m &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, the effect of improvement of the coating adhesion with respect to bending cannot be obtained. Further, if over 0.500 &#x3bc;m/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, the iron loss property deteriorates. Here, the perimeter L5 is the total of the perimeters of the anchoring Al regions A<b>5</b> while the perimeter of the anchoring Al region A<b>5</b> is the perimeter of the consecutive pixels forming one anchoring Al region A<b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Furthermore, regarding the position H5 in the thickness direction of the anchoring Al regions A<b>5</b>, H5 is characterized by being 0.4 to 4.0 &#x3bc;m. If this value becomes less than 0.4 &#x3bc;m, it is not possible to obtain the effect of improvement of the coating adhesion with respect to bending. Further, if over 4.0 &#x3bc;m, the anchoring oxides are stretched too more in the thickness direction, so the perimeter is reduced and gas release property is no longer improved and point defects are formed.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The reason why the above Al distribution affects the bendability is not clear, but is believed to be as follows:</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Al is an element with a strong tendency to form oxides, so during finish annealing, at the surface of the steel sheet, Al is selectively oxidized and Al diffuses from the inside of the base steel sheet toward the surface. At this time, at the surface oxides formed by the reaction of the annealing separator, if part is replaced with MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>is reduced formed, the amount falls, the linear expansion coefficient rises, and the magnetic properties are degraded. Also, the surface oxide layer (<b>1</b>) mainly comprised of Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>becomes uneven in thickness. To avoid this, Al may be made to oxidize inside of the steel sheet to prevent it from reaching the surface oxide layer (<b>1</b>). That is, the present invention is considered to achieve both improvement of the magnetic properties and improvement of the coating adhesion with respect to bending by making the structure one in which Al oxides are formed at the front end positions of the anchoring oxides deeply penetrating into the base steel sheet.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">The prescribed value expressing this state is H5. In the present invention, H5 is 0.4 &#x3bc;m or more. That is, it is considered that the above structure is achieved by forming anchoring Al regions at positions inside of the steel sheet separated from H0 by 0.4 &#x3bc;m or more (front end sides of anchoring oxides) and making the perimeters L5 of the anchoring Al regions per observed area 0.02 &#x3bc;m or more.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Further, saying that such anchoring Al regions A<b>5</b> are present at the front ends of the anchoring oxides means consequently that D3 becomes a suitable range of values. That is, if the number density of the anchoring Al regions A<b>5</b> is small, D3 becomes low. Further, even if a situation temporarily arises where the anchoring Al regions become excessively high in density, since the distance between the adjacent anchoring Al regions A<b>5</b> becomes shorter, these will end up merging along with growth of the primary coating and finally it will become hard for D3 to become an excessively high value.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Further, if the above-mentioned suitable anchoring Al regions A<b>5</b> are formed, the Al diffusing from the inside of the steel sheet no longer reaches the surface oxide layer (<b>1</b>), so S5/S3 inevitably becomes a high value.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Note that, in the present invention, the state of Al in the Al concentrated regions A<b>3</b> is not prescribed at all, but if considering the fact that the main constituent of the primary coating is Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, it is appropriate to think that the Al in A<b>3</b> is present as an oxide.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Characterizing Feature of Primary Coating/Existence of Anchoring Oxide Layer Regions</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In the primary coating of the present invention, it cannot be said that the shape of the anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>) has remarkable characterizing features in terms of external shape, but the above-mentioned characterizing Al distribution utilizes phenomena at the front end regions of the anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>), so if the anchoring oxides themselves are not present, formation of the characterizing Al distribution also becomes difficult.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">For this reason, the presence of anchoring oxides is prescribed and the ratio of the areas of anchoring oxide layer regions on the projection plane is prescribed. Note that, the numerical range itself of this provision is one of an extent observed even in grain-oriented electrical steel sheet excellent in coating adhesion in a general shearing operation, but can also be said to be important as an essential condition for obtaining the characterizing Al distribution.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">In the present invention, it is necessary that (the area S1 of anchoring oxide layer regions)/(observed area S0)&#x2265;0.15. This value becoming less than 0.15 means that even if each single anchoring oxide is formed over a considerable area, the number density of the number of anchoring oxides is extremely low or even if the number density is a certain extent of value, the area of each single anchoring oxide is small. In either case, it expresses the state where the interval between the anchoring oxides becomes relatively broad. Details will be explained later, but under such a situation, it becomes difficult to form the above-mentioned characterizing Al distribution.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">Characterizing Feature of Primary coating/Composition of Primary coating and Distribution of Ca Group Elements</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">The primary coating of the present invention has forsterite (Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>) as a main constituent. More specifically, the primary coating comprises 50 to 95 mass % of Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>. The remaining part is mainly the generally known MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>and other oxides or MnS or alkali earth metal sulfides.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">Furthermore, the primary coating of the present invention comprises Y group elements in a total of 0.1 to 6.00 mass % and Ca group elements in a total of 0.1 to 6.00 mass % with respect to the content of Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>in the primary coating.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">Details will be explained later, but to realize the above-mentioned distribution of oxides of Al, it is preferable to use an annealing separator comprising Y group elements. In this case, Y group elements remain in the primary coating after the finish annealing as well. If the total content of the Y group elements in the primary coating is less than 0.1 mass %, it cannot be said that the content of Y group elements at the annealing separator is sufficient and the coating adhesion with respect to bending is not improved. If over 6.0 mass %, the anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>) becomes too great in thickness and the oxides obstruct domain wall movement at the time of magnetization, so the detrimental effects on the magnetic properties become remarkable.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">In the same way, to realize the above-mentioned distribution of oxides of Al, it is preferable to use an annealing separator comprising Ca group elements. In this case, Ca group elements also remain in the primary coating after the finish annealing. With a total content of Ca group elements in the primary coating of less than 0.1 mass %, it cannot be said that the content of Ca group elements at the annealing separator is sufficient. It is not possible to raise the coating adhesion in a bending operation. With over 6.0 mass %, the number density of the anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>) becomes too high and the adjacent anchoring oxides join and form integral particles, so as a result the number density of the anchoring oxide particles fall. Not only that, the characterizing Al distribution cannot be obtained and the coating adhesion in a bending operation cannot be raised.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">The content of Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>in the primary coating is obtained by using the primary coating separated from the electrical steel sheet by the above method as a sample and quantitatively analyzing the Mg in the sample by the induction coupling plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The product of the obtained quantized value (mass %) and the molecular weight of the Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>divided by two times the atomic weight of Mg is made the content of Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">Further, in the same way, Ca, Ba, and Sr and La, Y, and Ce are quantitatively analyzed by a method similar to the above. The obtained contents (mass %) are calculated in the same way as the above to calculate the contents of these elements. The total of the obtained contents of Ca, Ba, and Sr is defined as the &#x201c;content of Ca group elements&#x201d; and the total of the obtained contents of La, Y, and Ce is defined as the &#x201c;content of Y group elements&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">Further, in the primary coating of the present invention, the &#x201c;number density of the Ca group element concentrated regions&#x201d; D4 on the projection plane is preferably 0.005/&#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>or more. Details will be explained later, but the Ca group elements which the annealing separator comprises are believed to play an important role in controlling the number density of anchoring oxides in the process of formation of the primary coating. The number density D4 of the Ca group element concentrated regions A<b>4</b> at the primary coating prescribed here is believed to express the mode when Ca group elements acting to form anchoring oxides in the process of formation of the primary coating remain in the primary coating. If D4 becomes high, the Ca group elements are evenly supplied to the anchoring oxides, so the number density D3 of the Al-based oxides becomes higher and penetration of the anchoring oxides to the inside of the base steel material is promoted.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">If D4 becomes less than 0.005/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, the number density of the anchoring oxide particles cannot be sufficiently obtained and the adhesion is not improved. Not only that, the above characterizing Al distribution cannot be obtained.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">The upper limit is not particularly set, but if D4 is too high, the frequency of formation of the anchoring oxide particles formed in relation to this also becomes excessively high and the adjacent anchoring oxides join and form integral particles, so formation of the characterizing Al distribution is impaired, as explained above. For this reason, D4 is preferably 2.000/&#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>or less.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Method of Manufacture</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">One example of the method for manufacturing grain-oriented electrical steel sheet according to the present invention will be explained.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">One example of the method for manufacturing grain-oriented electrical steel sheet is provided with a steelmaking process, hot rolling process, hot rolled sheet annealing process, cold rolling process, decarburization annealing process, finish annealing process, flattening annealing process, coating baking process, and domain wall control process.

Note that the elements of the chemical composition of the slab are removed to a certain extent from the steel constituents in the later explained finish annealing. In particular, the S, Al, N, etc. functioning as inhibitors are greatly removed. For this reason, the chemical composition of the slab described here differs from the chemical composition of the steel sheet of the final product.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">C: 0.1% Mass or Less,</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">If the content of C is over 0.1 mass %, the time required for the decarburization annealing becomes longer. In this case, the manufacturing costs rise and the productivity falls. Therefore, the content of C in the slab is 0.1 mass % or less. The preferable upper limit of the content of C in the slab is 0.092 mass %, more preferably 0.085 mass %. Further, if the content of C is lower than 0.005 mass %, the state of dispersion of the MnS, MnSe, AlN, and other precipitates and also the particle structure of the steel sheet after the decarburization annealing will not become uniform and the degree of integration to the Goss orientation after secondary recrystallization may be degraded. Therefore, the lower limit of the content of C in the slab is 0.005 mass %. The preferable lower limit of the content of C in the slab is 0.02 mass %, more preferably 0.04 mass %.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">Si: 2.5 to 4.5 Mass %, As explained in the section on the chemical composition of the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet of the finished product, Si raises the electrical resistance of steel, but if excessively present, the cold workability falls. If the content of S in the slab is 2.5 to 4.5 mass %, the content of Si of the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet after the finish annealing process becomes 2.5 to 4.5 mass %.

On the other hand, if the total content of the one or more elements selected from the group comprised of S and Se is over 0.070 mass %, secondary recrystallization does not occur in the manufacturing process and the magnetic properties of the steel fall.

If Cu, Sn, and Sb are comprised even a little, the above effect is obtained to a certain extent. However, if the contents of Cu, Sn, and Sb are over a total of 0.6%, it becomes difficult for an internal oxide layer to be formed at the time of decarburization annealing. In this case, at the time of the finish annealing, the formation of the primary coating, which proceeds with the reaction of MgO of the annealing separator and the SiO<sub>2 </sub>of the internal oxide layer, is delayed. As a result, the adhesion of the primary coating formed falls. Further, after purification annealing, Cu, Sn, and Sb easily remain as impurity elements.

The effect of the present invention becomes particularly effective when changing the structure of the anchoring oxides to improve the coating adhesion, so becomes particularly effective if applying the method of manufacture comprising these elements. In the case of application of the present invention, excellent coating adhesion becomes able to be secured even by these elements in 0.010 mass % or more, more preferably 0.015 mass % or more.

The decarburization annealing is performed in a known hydrogen-nitrogen wet atmosphere. Due to the decarburization annealing, the concentration of C of the grain-oriented electrical steel sheet is decreased to 50 ppm or less able to suppress magnetic aging deterioration. In the decarburization annealing process, primary recrystallization occurs in the structure of the steel sheet and the working strain introduced by the cold rolling is released. Furthermore, in the decarburization annealing process, the surface layer part of the base steel sheet is formed with an internal oxide layer having SiO<sub>2 </sub>as its main constituent. The SiO<sub>2 </sub>formed here reacts with the MgO in the aqueous slurry comprising the annealing separator to be coated later during the finish annealing to form a primary coating controlled in form in the present invention.

The aqueous slurry is prepared by adding to pure water the later explained elements forming the annealing separator etc. as compounds etc. and stirring. This slurry is coated on the surface of the above decarburization annealed sheet by a roll coater, spray, etc. The steel sheet on which the slurry is coated is inserted into a furnace held at 400 to 1000&#xb0; C. and held there for 10 to 90 seconds to thereby dry the slurry of the surface. Note that, at this time, the temperature of the steel sheet itself only rises to 400&#xb0; C. or so (no change in crystal structure such as recrystallization occurs). What remains at the surface of the steel sheet at this point of time is the annealing separator in the present invention.

The furnace atmosphere in the finish annealing is a known atmosphere. Note that, in the final process of the finish annealing process, in particular, parts of the S, Al, N, and other elements functioning as inhibitors are discharged to outside the system.

On the other hand, if CY is over 1.60%, the roots of the primary coating excessively develop and the magnetic properties fall. Therefore, CY is 0.20 to 1.60%. The preferable lower limit of CY is 0.40%, more preferably 0.50%. The preferable upper limit is 1.40%, more preferably 1.30%.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0218">The reason why controlling the content of Y group elements enables the adhesion to be improved is not completely clear, but is believed to be as follows: That is, Y group elements comprising oxygen release oxygen during the finish annealing, maintain the oxygen partial pressure between steel sheets of a coil during finish annealing, and make the anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>) of the primary coating grow. Below, the relationship between the release of oxygen and the development of the anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>) will be explained in detail.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0219">The anchoring oxide layer is comprised of the MgO in the annealing separator and the Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>formed by reaction with the SiO<sub>2 </sub>inside the base steel sheet. That is, to obtain an anchoring structure with prominent uneven shapes, it is necessary that the oxides inside the steel sheet, that is, the SiO<sub>2</sub>, inherently have prominent uneven shapes. SiO<sub>2 </sub>having such interfaces have high interfacial energy, so are unstable during the finish annealing performed at a high temperature. For this reason, during the finish annealing, the SiO<sub>2 </sub>formed at the inside of the base steel sheet breaks down and diffuses as Si and O in the base steel sheet thereby becoming flat. Furthermore, the finish annealing is performed in a hydrogen atmosphere, so the supply of oxygen to the inside of the base steel sheet is small. In addition, Al-based oxides, which are oxides stabler than SiO<sub>2</sub>, are formed, whereby the oxygen in the base steel sheet decreases and the SiO<sub>2 </sub>becomes increasingly unstable. As a result, the SiO<sub>2 </sub>present inside the base steel sheet at a depth deeper than where the Al-based oxides are formed remarkably breaks down. SiO<sub>2 </sub>becomes increasingly flat through the diffusion after break down and the anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>) of the primary coating also becomes flat.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0220">Here, the Y group elements comprising oxygen comprised in the annealing separator release oxygen, whereby the oxygen partial pressure between the steel sheets of the coil during finish annealing becomes higher. Due to the higher oxygen partial pressure between the steel sheets, oxygen is supplied into the base steel sheet and flattening of the internal SiO<sub>2 </sub>oxides is delayed. Delay of flattening of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>during the finish annealing means formation of Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>with prominent uneven shapes. Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>is stabler than SiO<sub>2</sub>. There is little change of form due to the subsequent finish annealing. As a result, the uneven shapes of the anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>) of the primary coating become prominent.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0221">Ca, Sr, and Ba</p><p id="p-0225" num="0222">In the present invention, the total content of the Ca group elements comprised in the annealing separator, the total content of the Ca group elements comprised as impurities in the MgO raw material powder comprised in the, annealing separator, and the ratio of these contents are prescribed.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0223">In the annealing separator, the ratios of the contents of Ca, Sr, Ba, and Mg with respect to the content of MgO in the annealing separator are expressed by % and designated as [Ca], [Sr], [Ba], and [Mg].

At the surface layer region, SiO<sub>2 </sub>is formed. Growth of the anchoring oxides, part of the primary coating mainly comprised of Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, to the inside of the base steel sheet, that is, the phenomenon of the increase of thickness of the anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>), is the phenomenon of the Mg comprised as a main element of the annealing separator diffusing toward the SiO<sub>2 </sub>at the inside of the base steel sheet and forming Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>. At the same time, the Al concentrated regions characterizing the present invention are believed to be formed by the Al diffusing from the inside of the steel sheet reacting with the Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>and concentrating at that region. That is, the more Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>is formed at the inside of the base steel sheet, the more Al concentrated regions are formed at the inside of the base steel sheet.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0236">Ca group elements have actions similar to Mg and form composite oxides of oxides of Ca group elements and oxides of Si. It is believed that if the composite oxides react with Al, Al is made to concentrate and the reaction regions. Further, if comparing the speeds of diffusion of the Mg and Ca group elements in the SiO<sub>2</sub>, Ca group elements are faster. If Ca group elements are present in the annealing separator, composite oxides of SiO<sub>2 </sub>and Ca group elements are formed in a region at the inside of the base metal sheet earlier than the Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4 </sub>of the composite oxide of SiO<sub>2 </sub>and Mg and the speed of anchoring oxides proceeding through the inside of the steel sheet is made to increase. By doing this, the annealing separator comprising the Ca group elements not only makes the anchoring oxide layer (<b>2</b>) increase in thickness, but also makes the positions of concentration of Al in it, that is, H5, increase. For this reason, the Ca group elements already become oxides or compounds comprising oxygen before preparing the aqueous slurry or after the drying process and have to diffuse in the annealing separator.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0237">Further, if Ca group elements are comprised in the MgO raw material powder as impurities, the reactivity of the raw material powder MgO with the SiO<sub>2 </sub>rises. Along with this, in the latter period of annealing as well, they function as relatively stable sources of Ca group elements. By supplying the sources of Ca group elements into the primary coating, the oxides of the primary coating can be stabilized. In this case, unstable SiO<sub>2 </sub>can be replaced with CaMgSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6 </sub>or another stable oxide coating at any early period. On top of this, CaMgSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6 </sub>is stabilized as the source of Ca group elements not restricting the paths of supply of Mg. As a result, CaMgSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6 </sub>can be maintained in form until being replaced by Mg<sub>2 </sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>. However, if the impurity Ca group elements in the MgO become excessively large, the amount of supply of Ca becomes excessive compared with the Mg, the supply of Mg group elements for forming the CaMgSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6 </sub>required for keeping the form of the primary coating complicated is decreased compared with the Ca group elements, and formation of more stable MgSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>becomes delayed, whereby due to the heat impact of annealing, the primary coating changes in form and it becomes no longer possible to maintain the complicatedly intertwined form of the primary coating preventing point defects. As a result, point defects increase. Further, even if the impurity Ca group elements in the MgO are excessively small, in the same way, even if additives comprising Ca group elements added to other than the MgO raw material powder supply sufficient Ca group elements, the supply of Mg decrease relatively whereby the formation of more stable MgSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>becomes slower and for a similar reason, point defects increase. As the total abundance ratio of the Ca group elements in the annealing separator balanced in the amounts of supply of Mg and Ca, there are CC=0.20 to 1.80 and CC&#x2032;=0.010 to 0.080.

On the other hand, if CC is over 1.80, the anchoring oxide layer becomes excessively thick and the magnetic properties sometimes fall.

Preferably, it is 0.6 or more, more preferably 0.8 or more.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0269">On the other hand, even if R2/R1 is over 3.0, the area ratio (S1/S0) of the anchoring oxides of the primary coating formed falls and the coating adhesion deteriorates. Preferably, it is 2.6 or less, more preferably 2.2 or less.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0270">The reason why the coating adhesion is improved by the above R1, R2, and R2/R1 is not clear, but is believed to be as follows:</p><p id="p-0277" num="0271">In general, the smaller the powder, the easier it becomes for it to aggregate. If mixing powder compounds with greatly different particle sizes, the fine compounds aggregate. If considering the mixed state of MgO and the Ca group elements, if the compounds of the Ca group elements are excessively fine and R2/R1 becomes less than 0.5, the compounds of the Ca group elements aggregate. If making such a mixture deposit on the surface of the base steel sheet, in the state of contact with the base steel sheet, regions in which only the Ca group elements contact the base steel sheet will be present as regions of considerable size. In formation of the primary coating proceeds due to the finish annealing in this state, in regions where only the Ca group elements contacts the base steel sheet, the supply of Mg becomes slow, so the formation of the primary coating becomes slow and the coating adhesion becomes poor.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0272">In the same way, if R2/R1 is over 3.0, the diffusion of the Ca group elements with respect to the MgO becomes sparser, so the supply of Ca is delayed and the coating adhesion of the primary coating formed becomes poor.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0273">This results in the presence of compounds of Ca group elements between the MgO and the steel sheet and obstructs the supply of Mg to the base steel sheet. That is, regions where the MgO does not contact the base steel sheet are just voids if compounds of Ca group elements are not present in relatively fine states, but if compounds of Ca group elements are relatively fine, the regions change to regions obstructing the supply of Mg to the base steel sheet. As a result, in regions where the MgO contacts the base steel sheet and regions where it does not, a remarkable difference arises in the supply of Mg to the base steel sheet and the primary coating becomes uneven in development. For this reason, the number density of the anchoring oxides becomes excessive and becomes an inhibiting factor in the magnetic properties.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0274">In the same way, even if adding Ca group elements with a particle size excessively larger than the particle size of the MgO, the range by which the Ca group elements can be supplied is decreased, so in the end, the supply of Ca group elements becomes lopsided and, at locations where they are excessively supplied, the number density of the roots of the primary coating becomes excessively high.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0275">On the other hand, if R2/R1 is in a suitable range, the number density of compounds of Ca group elements dispersed in the annealing separator layer near the steel sheet increases, so compared with making the compounds of the Ca group elements finer and adding them in large amounts, the supply of Ca, Sr, and Ba to the base steel sheet becomes uniform and as a result the number density of the anchoring oxides can be made uniform.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0276">Annealing Separator Layer</p><p id="p-0283" num="0277">The present invention prescribes the structure of the annealing separator in the state deposited on the surface of the steel sheet right before the finish annealing after the end of the above-mentioned process for forming an annealing separator layer.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0278">In the annealing separator layer of the present invention, the number density of particles comprising Ca group elements in the Ca group concentrated regions present in the region of 0 to 3.0 &#x3bc;m from the surface of the base steel sheet is 0.003 to 1.400/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>. Below, this &#x201c;number density of particles comprising Ca group elements in the Ca group concentrated regions&#x201d; will be referred to as D42. If controlling D42 to the above range, the adhesion of the primary coating after the finish annealing is improved.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0279">The reason why the adhesion of the primary coating is improved if D42 is in the above range is not completely clear, but is believed to be as follows: It is believed, as explained above, that the Ca group elements comprised in the annealing separator diffuse in the primary coating formed during the finish annealing toward the base steel sheet side and form composite oxides with the Al supplied from the base steel sheet side of the primary coating, that is, from the base metal side at the front ends of the anchoring oxides thereby acting to fix the Al at the front ends of the anchoring oxides. To render this action more remarkable, the position of presence of the Ca group elements in the annealing separator layer is important. The presence of Ca group element concentrated regions at the base steel sheet side, that is, the region of 0 to 3.0 &#x3bc;m from the surface of the base steel sheet, becomes convenient. Further, as explained above, contact with the base steel sheet should not have a local leaning. A suitable state of diffusion of elements in the annealing separator is believed to be correlated with the number density of Ca group concentrated regions of the primary coating formed.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0280">D42 can be found by the following method.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0281">The annealing separator layer of the surface of the finish annealing-use steel sheet after drying is analyzed by an EDS-SEM at the cross-section obtained by working each finish annealing-use steel sheet by CP processing to obtain a characteristic X-ray intensity of the Ca group elements. That is, the obtained characteristic X-ray intensity distribution chart is a distribution chart laying out information held by the annealing separator projected on a plane parallel to the cross-section of the finish annealing-use steel sheet in the thickness direction. The characteristic X-ray intensity distribution chart of the Ca group elements is obtained by a field of view where the border between the surface of the steel sheet and the annealing separator layer becomes extremely parallel to the upper and lower ends of the observed region and, furthermore, the annealing separator layer does not stick out to the outside from the under and lower ends the observed region. Below, the observed width direction of surface of the steel sheet and the annealing separator layer and the direction perpendicular to the observed width direction will be called the observed height direction. The scanning steps of the characteristic X-ray intensity distribution chart are made the same in the observed width direction and observed height direction and is made a length of 0.1 or less. Further, the observed width direction is made at least a length of 20 &#x3bc;m or more. That is, the characteristic X-ray intensity distribution chart is broken down in at least 200 pixels in the observed width direction. Here, in the characteristic X-ray intensity distributions of the obtained Ca group elements, the respective of the characteristic X-ray intensities of Ca, Sr, and Ba are identified and a region where a characteristic X-ray intensity of Ca of 20% or more of the maximum value of the characteristic X-ray intensity of Ca is obtained, a region where a characteristic X-ray intensity of Sr of 20% or more of the maximum value of the characteristic X-ray intensity of Sr is obtained, and a region where a characteristic X-ray intensity of Ba of 20% or more of the maximum value of the characteristic X-ray intensity of Ba is obtained are together defined as &#x201c;Ca group element concentrated regions&#x201d;. Furthermore, a region where pixels of such a Ca group element concentrated region continue up and down or left and right in pixel units is deemed as a single region and a region comprised of four or more pixels is judged to be a particle. Furthermore, the coordinates of the center of gravity of each Ca group element concentrated region of the observed region is obtained by image analysis. After that, a number N1 of particles with centers of gravity present at a height of 3 &#x3bc;m from the surface of the base steel sheet in the thickness direction is counted. The mean value R2 of the circle equivalent diameters of the particles comprising Ca group elements in the Ca group element concentrated regions (((area of 1 pixel)&#xd7;(number of pixels of consecutive units)&#xd7;4/&#x3c0;)) is calculated. From the obtained N1, the R2 obtained as explained above, and the length L m of the observed region in the direction of observation (length of observed region in direction perpendicular to thickness direction at cross-section (length of observed region in width direction of finish annealing-use steel sheet)), D42=N1/(3&#xd7;L&#xd7;R2)(/&#x3bc;m<sup>3</sup>) can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0282">Note that, the mean particle size (for example, R1) of compounds dispersed in the annealing separator layer is understood as being substantially the same as the mean particle size obtained from the distribution of particle size of the raw material powder alone added when prepared as an aqueous slurry. Accordingly, the mean particle sizes of the compounds can be found from the mean particle sizes of the raw material powders using methods similar to the method of calculation of R1. The method for controlling the sizes of particles of compounds comprising the elements in the raw material powder to suitable ranges does not have to be limited. Powder having the targeted distribution of particle size can be manufactured by the adjustment of the firing conditions and classification etc. It would not be difficult for a person skilled in the art manufacturing the raw material powder.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0283">By using such Ca group compound powder and MgO powder as raw material for the aqueous slurry, it is possible to suitably control the number density of Ca group concentrated regions by regions of 0 to 3.0 &#x3bc;m from the surface of the base steel sheet in the annealing separator layer.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0290" num="0284">Below, modes of the present invention will be explained more specifically by examples.
