id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present disclosure relates to a communication method and system for converging a 5<sup>th</sup>-Generation (5G) communication system for supporting higher data rates beyond a 4<sup>th</sup>-Generation (4G) system with a technology for Internet of Things (IoT). The present disclosure may be applied to intelligent services based on the 5G communication technology and the IoT-related technology, such as smart home, smart building, smart city, smart car, connected car, health care, digital education, smart retail, security and safety services. A method for processing a packet by a transmission device in a wireless communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention comprises the steps of: checking whether a data radio bearer (DRB) mapped to a quality of service (QoS) flow changes from a first DRB to a second DRB; and when the DRB changes from the first DRB to the second DRB, transmitting, to a reception device, information on a last packet transmitted through the first DRB in the QoS flow.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="93.64mm"

Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To meet the demand for wireless data traffic having increased since deployment of 4G communication systems, efforts have been made to develop an improved 5G or pre-5G communication system. Therefore, the 5G or pre-5G communication system is also called a &#x2018;Beyond 4G Network&#x2019; or a &#x2018;Post LTE System&#x2019;. The 5G communication system is considered to be implemented in higher frequency (mmWave) bands, e.g., 60 GHz bands, so as to accomplish higher data rates. To decrease propagation loss of the radio waves and increase the transmission distance, the beamforming, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), Full Dimensional MIMO (FD-MIMO), array antenna, an analog beam forming, large scale antenna techniques are discussed in 5G communication systems. In addition, in 5G communication systems, development for system network improvement is under way based on advanced small cells, cloud Radio Access Networks (RANs), ultra-dense networks, device-to-device (D2D) communication, wireless backhaul, moving network, cooperative communication, Coordinated Multi-Points (CoMP), reception-end interference cancellation and the like. In the 5G system, Hybrid FSK and QAM Modulation (FQAM) and sliding window superposition coding (SWSC) as an advanced coding modulation (ACM), and filter bank multi carrier (FBMC), non-orthogonal multiple access(NOMA), and sparse code multiple access (SCMA) as an advanced access technology have been developed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Internet, which is a human centered connectivity network where humans generate and consume information, is now evolving to the Internet of Things (IoT) where distributed entities, such as things, exchange and process information without human intervention. The Internet of Everything (IoE), which is a combination of the IoT technology and the Big Data processing technology through connection with a cloud server, has emerged. As technology elements, such as &#x201c;sensing technology&#x201d;, &#x201c;wired/wireless communication and network infrastructure&#x201d;, &#x201c;service interface technology&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Security technology&#x201d; have been demanded for IoT implementation, a sensor network, a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication, Machine Type Communication (MTC), and so forth have been recently researched. Such an IoT environment may provide intelligent Internet technology services that create a new value to human life by collecting and analyzing data generated among connected things. IoT may be applied to a variety of fields including smart home, smart building, smart city, smart car or connected cars, smart grid, health care, smart appliances and advanced medical services through convergence and combination between existing Information Technology (IT) and various industrial applications.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In line with this, various attempts have been made to apply 5G communication systems to IoT networks. For example, technologies such as a sensor network, Machine Type Communication (MTC), and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication may be implemented by beamforming, MIMO, and array antennas. Application of a cloud Radio Access Network (RAN) as the above-described Big Data processing technology may also be considered to be as an example of convergence between the 5G technology and the IoT technology.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, the recent development of LTE and LTE-Advanced has led to the need of a method and apparatus for reducing layer 2 (data link layer) overhead in communication between a transmitter and a receiver.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The disclosure proposes a method for reducing layer 2 (data link layer) overhead amount in communication between a transmitter and a receiver.

Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout the specification.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading><p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a 3GPP NR (New RAT) layer 2 data format. In a transmitter, a data packet generated from an upper layer on or above a network layer, a so called IP packet, is passed down to layer 2 on which sublayer protocol-specific headers are generated.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The layer 2 of 3GPP NR is split into four sublayers: sublayer responsible for QoS management, PDCP sublayer, RLC sublayer, and MAC sublayer. Each sublayer generates a header, which may be omitted. In an embodiment, the QoS sublayer, PDCP sublayer, RLC sublayer, and MAC sublayer each generate a header in order as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the headers are added to each of three IP packets; in this case, if the size of an IP packet is small, a ratio of the layer 2 headers to IP packets increases, resulting in degradation of transmission efficiency. Particularly in a small packet-intensive environment, the transmission efficiency is likely to deteriorate further.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a principle of IP packet concatenation (IP concatenation) according to a first embodiment of the disclosure. Unlink the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, where the individual layer 2 headers are generated per IP packet, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is characterized in that the layer 2 headers are generated per group of multiple concatenated IP packets. In this case, there is a need of information and a procedure for notifying a receiver that the IP packets are concatenated.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of a normal IP packet. Typically, an IP packet includes an IP header, a TCP header, and a payload carrying data. In the case where the TCP is not used for end-to-end (E2D) for an End-to-End (E2E) scheme, other transport protocols such as UDP may be used. This concept of an IP packet is typically used in communication systems and computer systems as well as in the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an IP packet including an IP header with a length field indicating a total length of the IP packet. The IP header may include a version field, a DSCP field, a Tim-To-Live field, a Header Checksum field, and a total length field. The IP header may further include other fields, and per-field lengths may vary according to the version of the IP (Internet Protocol). The total length field included in the IP header indicates the total length of the IP header and the remaining part (TCP header and payload in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) of the IP packet in bytes. By reading the total length field, it is possible to acquire the total size of the IP packet.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an outcome of an IP concatenation operation of a transmitter utilizing an IP layer according to the first embodiment of the disclosure. If IP concatenation is performed in Layer 2 of the transmitter (hereinafter referred to as transmitter, when there is no specific representation), the transmitter may perform an operation of concatenating IP packets to be transmitted as in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In this case, each IP header has to include a total length field (L in the drawing). The transmitter may regard the IP concatenated packet as a service data unit (SDU) to perform layer 2 processing thereon. The concatenated IP data may first be recognized as SDU by the QoS sublayer or the PDCP sublayer.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an outcome of an IP concatenation operation of a receiver utilizing an IP layer according to the first embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">If the IP concatenation is performed in the Layer 2 of the transmitter, the IP packets in which the IP concatenation has been performed should be separated in the Layer 2 of the transmitter corresponding to Layer 2 of the receiver. First, the receiver receives an SDU as concatenated IP packets. The receiver decodes the total length field (L in drawing) of the IP header of the first packet to determine whether the IP concatenation is applied, i.e., whether the packet is IP-concatenated, based on acquired information. If a value indicated by the total length field matches the length of the remaining part of the SDU, this means that the IP concatenation has not been performed. If not, this means that the IP concatenation has been performed and there is a new IP header following a point inferred by the total length field; thus, the receiver performs total length field decoding again. If a value indicated by the total length field matches the length of the remaining part of the SDU, this means that the IP concatenation has not been performed. If not, this means that the IP concatenation has been performed and there is a new IP header following a point inferred by the total length field; thus, the receiver performs total length field decoding again. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the receiver de-concatenates three IP-concatenated IP packets to recover three IP packets.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Here, an indicator indicating whether the IP concatenation has been applied or a field indicating a number of concatenated IP packets may be included in a predetermined layer 2 header. In this case, the receiver needs to decode the total length field of the IP header only when it knows that the IP concatenation has been applied, which leads to reduction of data processing.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a signal flow diagram illustrating a message exchange and data processing procedure for IP concatenation between a terminal and a base station according to the first embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The IP concatenation may be performed only when the terminal has an IP concatenation capability.

Given an expectation of supportability of various communication services beyond legacy voice and data services in the future, a 5G communication system should be designed with a scalable communication standard to support various and distinct services and QoSs in comparison with the legacy 4G LTE system. It is expected that the 5G communication system will supports various types of services such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable and low latency communication (URLLC), and enhanced machine type communication (eMTC). In order to support such services, it is necessary to subdivide legacy QoSs and distinguish between the subdivided QoSs with QoS flow IDs for use in data transmission between a terminal and a base station.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0235">In this regard, there is a need of defining a rule for mapping between a DRB defined through a PHY/MAC/RLC/PDCP layer and a newly introduced QoS flow. For a 3GPP RAN, a new layer that supports mapping between the DRB and QoS flow and is responsible for the mapping function is defined. This new layer is a user plane access stratum (AS) protocol layer, and the corresponding protocol is referred to as packet data association protocol (PDAP), service data adaptation protocol (SDAP), etc. This new layer also supports marking QoS flow ID in downlink and uplink packets as well as mapping between QoS flow and DRB. A QoS flow is determined by a terminal for UL and by a core network (CN) for DL, the rule for mapping between the QoS flow and DRB is determined by a RAN. It is also characterized that Multiple QoS flows can be mapped to one DRB.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0236"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating mapping between QoS flows and DRBs in a new layer according to the second embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0237">An initially (or one-time) configured QoS flow-DRB mapping rule may be changed.
