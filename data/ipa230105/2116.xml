described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments are shown. Indeed, the invention(s) may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. The term &#x201c;or&#x201d; (also designated as &#x201c;/&#x201d;) is used herein in both the alternative and conjunctive sense, unless otherwise indicated. The terms &#x201c;illustrative&#x201d; and &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; are used to be examples with no indication of quality level. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As used herein, the term &#x201c;about,&#x201d; &#x201c;substantially,&#x201d; and &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; generally mean plus or minus 10% of the value stated, e.g., about 250 &#x3bc;m would include 225 &#x3bc;m to 275 &#x3bc;m, approximately 1,000 &#x3bc;m would include 900 &#x3bc;m to 1,100 &#x3bc;m, and substantially sealed would include 90% to 100% sealed.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As used herein, the term &#x201c;opaque&#x201d; generally means that a material is impenetrable by certain kinds of electromagnetic energy, such as visible light, and is therefore not transparent or translucent. As such, an average person viewing an opaque material, as defined herein, from a reasonable distance such as arm's length or closer, under normal lighting conditions, may not be able to see clearly through the opaque material. By way of example only, an average person may be able to discern a color of another object behind an opaque object but may not be able to read text or discern an image on the other object behind the opaque object. For instance, a sheet of about 90 brightness to about 98 brightness paper of normal thickness, such as greater than about 1/100<sup>th </sup>of a millimeter, greater than about 1/10<sup>th </sup>of a millimeter, greater than about 1 millimeter, or greater than about 10 millimeters, may be considered opaque under normal lighting and viewing conditions.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Envelopes are used to enclose and transmit pieces of mail, e.g., documents that contain personal information about the sender or receiver, invoices, bills, statements, business documents, legal documents, and/or the like. However, preparing, assembling, sorting, and mailing such pieces of mail often requires printing of the document to be mailed and printing of additional information (e.g., mailing address, return address, sorting identifier, and/or the like) on a front panel (e.g., a face) of the envelope. For instance, a bill is often printed with the bill sender's name and contact information and the bill receiver's name and contact information printed somewhere on the bill, and then the same information is redundantly printed on the face of the envelope. This leads to inefficient mail creation.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As a way to reduce or eliminate the redundancy of printing the same information on the document within the envelope as well as on the face of the envelope, window envelopes were developed. Window envelopes typically define an opening through the front face of the envelope which allows information from the document being mailed such as a mailing address, a return address, and/or other identifying information to be viewable on the front face of the envelope once the document is disposed within the envelope and the envelope is sealed shut. The use of a window in envelopes allows for the production of anonymized envelopes onto which the printing of information, such as a mailing address and/or a return address, is not required, so long as the necessary information is printed in the proper location on the document being mailed within the envelope. Returning to the example of a bill, if the bill recipient's name and address are printed on a particular portion of the bill that corresponds particularly, once the bill is disposed within the envelope, with a top surface of the bill that is visible through the window of the envelope, then each bill can be printed as a unique printing while any suitably sized envelope with a properly positioned window can be used without the need for printing the unique name and address of the recipient on a front panel (a face) of the envelope.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Over time, a variety of sizes, colors, and window styles were created, including but not limited to single window envelopes that have just one opening for the mailing address, double window envelopes that have an additional opening for the return address, full face envelopes that have an opening that covers the entire front of the envelope, and the like. As such, each piece of mail or document that is produced for mailing can be configured to fit one of the available window envelopes such that the necessary information is visible through the window. The use of window envelopes has led to reduced costs and increased production speeds, but has also led to many unintended consequences such as the need to very particularly fold and/or pack envelopes such that the correct portion of the document within the envelope is visible through the window, the unintended exposure of private or confidential information through the envelope window either when the document is inserted into the envelope incorrectly or when the document to envelope tolerances are not sufficiently minimized and the document is able to shift within the envelope, exposing such information through the window, the proliferation of international and domestic mailing standards and protocols for ensuring compliance with those standards (e.g., the USPS's &#x201c;tap&#x201d; test), and complications with optical and machine learning sorting of prepared mail when a portion or all of the mailing or return address(es) are not visible through the window.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Sometimes, a barcode or similar unique identifier can be printed on a front panel (a face) or the back of the envelope in order to identify the particular type, size, color, window configuration, and/or other characteristics of the envelope, or the identify a unique piece of mail once assembled and once the document is sealed within the envelope. In some cases, a catalog number can be imprinted on the front of envelope to distinguish between different envelopes used by different senders, for difference purposes, associated with different documents, or the like. Since there are hundreds of different envelope sizes, envelope material types, envelope colors, window numbers, window sizes, window positions, and the like, which can lead to millions of unique combinations, it is often difficult or impossible to prepare, assemble, sort, and distribute such mail without a difficult and time-consuming process of manually checking any mail that does not pass the various automated tests, such as optical character recognition (OCR) analysis or the like.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Since window envelopes define an opening in a front panel (a face) of the envelope, the inside of such envelopes is open to the elements and contamination during mailing, and the edge of the opening can often catch on other mail or mechanisms used during sorting or distribution and can tear open a front panel (a face) of the envelope. As such, a further advancement for the window envelope was the use of cellophane over the address window to protect the document within the envelope. Since the use of cellophane over the window increased the cost of production of the envelope, it was typically reserved for the most important documents, such as bills, legal contracts, and/or the like. As the use of such window envelopes continued to grow, it became common for less important mail (e.g., &#x201c;junk mail&#x201d;) to either not include a window or to have a window that is not covered by cellophane, meaning that recipients began associating the use of cellophane over the window with the envelope containing a relatively more important document, which meant that such envelopes were more frequently opened by recipients instead of being unopened or simply thrown away.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">However, as mentioned above, the use of a window envelope, whether cellophane covered or not, relies upon the proper positioning of sender/receiver information on the document within the envelope. When a document shifts around in the envelope, personal or sensitive information may become viewable through the window of the envelope, which may present a costly problem to the mail sender, the mail receiver, the mail distributor, and/or the mail producer. However, the only currently available option for preventing the exposure of personal or private information from a document within a window envelope is to use a conventional (non-window) envelope, which, as described above, requires the costly and inefficient duplication of information on the envelope as well as the document within the envelope. To avoid the exposure of personal or private information, such as in the case of a medical bill, a medical explanation of benefits, tax documents, any information protected under attorney-client privilege or under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPPA), some companies have begun to create an entirely additional document (e.g., a cover page) that is added to the outside of the document being mailed, the only information printed on the additional document being the mailing address and/or return address or the like. However, this additional document and the unique printing of sender and/or recipient information on the additional document represents additional cost, additional weight added to the mailing in a system in which the cost of mailing the document depends typically on the mass of the final, sealed envelope, and still represents a duplication of information with that information that is already printed on the document within the cover page. Due to the legal implications of such privacy matters for many companies, the extra cost of such measures has been outweighed by the potential cost that could result from fines, litigation, and/or the like if they allow such private information to be exposed. However, for many senders of mail, there is less or no need to protect private information, but the only available options remain either a window-less envelope, which is costly to print for unique recipients and which is more likely to be discarded by the recipient, or a window envelope which adds to the complexity of printing the document within the envelope due to the particular positioning of the information so it is viewable through the window.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Some additional issues related to the conventional window envelopes are that senders often use a similarly sized and shaped envelope with the only distinguishing characteristics between them being a sender-specific identifier, e.g., a 10 digit alpha numeric catalog number or a barcode, printed somewhere on the envelope. However, many senders rely upon a centralized manufacturer, printer, assembler, distributor, or the like to manufacture, prepare, assemble, sort, and/or ship their mail, which means that such centralized entities often have difficulty discerning between which unique envelope should be used for which particular document. Due to this similarity of or only slight differences between envelopes used by different senders, it is difficult for operators to verify different envelopes, and this similarity combined with the many customized envelopes used by many senders can increase the possibility of an error being made, which may lead to mail being undeliverable or more costly to deliver due to some or all of the mailing address not being visible, or which may lead to the exposure of private or HIPPA-protected information, for instance. Additionally, maintaining custom envelopes increases required inventory space, warehousing costs, transportation waste, equipment change-over time, and decreases the overall efficiency of the process.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Additionally, mail sent in single or double window envelopes typically requires that a tap-test be conducted to ensure the address on the letter is not obscured by the window when the document shifts inside the envelope. Mail that does not meet the relevant regulation (e.g., United States Postal Service (USPS) regulation DMM 601.6.3), for which a portion of the address or other critical information falls outside of the window, are separated and metered at full-rate, meaning the cost to mail the document increases.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As such, the inventors, through diligent effort and innovation, have invented a new envelope and associated methods, apparatuses, and computer program products for solving at least some of the problems associated with conventional envelopes. In general, described herein are embodiments that minimize the mass of the mailed envelope, that allow for the use of anonymized envelopes without needing to print any unique identifiers on the envelope shell itself, that convey the importance of the document within the envelope, that eliminate the need for the document within the envelope to be printed in such a way that the particular location of the sender's or receiver's information is suitably viewable through a window in a front panel (a face) of the envelope, and that eliminates the possibility that private/confidential information from the document will be visible through the window of the envelope.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, a high-integrity opaque-inset panel envelope construction is provided. In some embodiments, the envelope construction can comprise a panel fixed to an inside surface of the front panel of the envelope shell, the envelope shell having a window through a front panel (a face) of the envelope shell, the panel being disposed within the envelope in such a way that the panel covers the opening. In some embodiments, information such as the mailing address, return address, sender/receiver information, a logo, an identifier, and/or other content can be printed on the panel either before or after the panel is fixed within the envelope. In some embodiments, the optical properties of the opaque panel can be different from those of the envelope shell so that the opaque panel, viewable through the window defined through the front panel (the face) of the envelope shell, appears to the recipient to be the document within the envelope. In some embodiments, while this opaque panel may give the illusion that the address in the window is printed on the document within the envelope and is showing through the window, since the panel is fixed within the envelope and cannot shift within the envelope, there is no possibility that the address or other information will be hidden due to the shifting of the document within the envelope or that private information on the document may be viewable through the window. In some embodiments, a particular optical property, such as brightness, can be used to differentiate between the envelope shell and the panel. By way of example only, a sufficient brightness difference may be a brightness of 96 for the opaque panel and a brightness of 92 for the envelope paper. Other brightness values, differences in brightness values, ratio of brightness values, and/or other characteristics are contemplated and are considered to be within the scope of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, to permit the address on the panel to be viewed by an automated sorting machine and the like, the print contrast ratio may adhere to the USPS print contrast ratio (PCR) standards in DMM 204.1.4, which may increase the likelihood of efficient processing and delivery. In some embodiments, the high-integrity opaque-inset panel envelope can be inkjet treated and moisture proof such that damage to the document within the envelope is reduced or prevented. In some embodiments, a surface treatment, coating, or the like may be disposed on one or both surfaces of the opaque panel such that, when inset within the envelope, beneath the window(s), the opaque panel may provide the appearance that the window(s) is(are) covered with a protective covering such as cellophane.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Also described herein are systems, methods, apparatuses, and computer program products suitable for managing a system of manufacturing, assembling, sorting, and distributing such high-integrity opaque-inset panel envelopes. As described herein, exemplary systems and apparatuses can be provided, along with associated computer code, computer instructions, and/or computer program products, for carrying out any of the methods described herein. For instance, an exemplary system can comprise one or more of the computing entities described herein for use in tracking and selecting the envelope shells and inset opaque panels. Alternatively or additionally, an exemplary system can comprise one or more of the computing entities described herein for use in printing desired content, such as a mailing address, a return address, a unique identifier, or the like on the inset opaque panel.

As such, the use of two or more opaque inset panels (e.g., <b>203</b>, <b>205</b>) can reduce the cost and weight of the envelope <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, depending upon the orientation, size, shape, and durability of the envelope <b>200</b>, it may be desired to define apertures <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> elsewhere in the front panel <b>201</b> of the envelope <b>200</b>, e.g., in an orientation that is one quarter of a clockwise rotation and similarly respectively oriented, such that aperture <b>202</b> may present therethrough a return address or the like while aperture <b>204</b> may present therethrough a mailing address or the like.

Even when a cellophane cover is disposed across the window of such large envelopes, the flexible cellophane film provides little or no structural or mechanical strength to the envelope. However, with envelope <b>300</b>, when the opaque inset panel <b>303</b> is formed from a durable material, and when the extents of the opaque inset panel <b>303</b> are adhesively coupled to the back of the front panel <b>301</b> either continuously or discretely about the aperture <b>302</b>, the resulting envelope <b>300</b> has similar or equal mechanical strength and structural durability to similarly sized and similarly constructed envelopes that do not have a window or aperture formed through the face of the envelope. As such, not only in the larger envelopes (e.g., <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>) but also in the smaller envelopes, such as commercial mail envelopes, baronial envelopes, A-style envelopes, and the like, the use of an opaque inset panel can lead to improved durability and mechanical strength of the overall envelope, can lead to a reduced likelihood of damage occurring to the envelope, and can lead to a further reduction in the likelihood that private documents and information from inside the envelope will be exposed during sorting or distribution.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In addition, while envelope <b>200</b> provides surface area on the front panel <b>201</b> of the envelope <b>200</b> that is advantageous for printing anonymized imagery, a company logo, or the like thereon, this requires that printing occurs on the envelope itself and not just the opaque inset panels <b>203</b>, <b>205</b>.
