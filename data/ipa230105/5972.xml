In the front-illuminated type CMOS solid-state imaging device, light is made to enter a front surface side of a substrate surface formed with a multi-layer wiring layer and a pixel transistor by setting this substrate front surface as a light receiving surface. In the back-illuminated type CMOS solid-state imaging device, light is made to enter a back surface side that is an opposite side of the substrate front surface formed with the multi-layer wiring layer and the pixel transistor by setting the back surface of the substrate as a light receiving surface (refer to Patent Document 1, for example).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the back-illuminated type, the light is made to enter a photodiode without restriction of the multi-layer wiring layer. Therefore, in the case of comparing both types under the condition of a same pixel pitch, an opening of the photodiode can be formed wider in the back-illuminated type and sensitivity higher than the front-illuminated type can be achieved. Furthermore, since the back-illuminated type has no wiring layer on the light receiving surface side, a height of a light condensing structure can be formed lower than the front-illuminated type, and excellent oblique light characteristics can be achieved (refer to Non-Patent Document 1, for example).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2011-135101</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Non-Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0006">Non-Patent Document 1: The latest trend in CMOS image sensors-high performance, versatile functions, and wide application thereof (2007 CMC Publishing Co.

In the case of adjusting the oblique light characteristics in a state that a height is lowered, it is considered to adjust a width of a light shielding film between pixels, but since a distance between an on-chip lens and a light shielding film is close, vignetting may be caused at an opening of the light shielding film and sensitivity may be deteriorated. In the case of intending to have sensitivity only for light in a necessary angle range, adjustment can be made with the width of the light shielding film between the pixels in a state that a height is increased and a focus point is adjusted to a light receiving surface (opening of the light shielding film) to a some extent. However, in this case, there may be a concern that color mixture may be caused by oblique light from between the on-chip lens and the light shielding film.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present

In the pixel array unit <b>3</b>, a plurality of pixels <b>2</b> is two-dimensionally arranged in a matrix on a semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> using silicon (Si) as a semiconductor, for example. The peripheral circuit unit includes a vertical drive circuit <b>4</b>, a column signal processing circuit <b>5</b>, a horizontal drive circuit <b>6</b>, an output circuit <b>7</b>, a control circuit <b>8</b>, and the like.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The pixel <b>2</b> is formed by including a plurality of pixel transistors and a photodiode as a photoelectric conversion element. The plurality of pixel transistors is formed of, for example, four MOS transistors including a transfer transistor, a selection transistor, a reset transistor, and an amplification transistor.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Furthermore, the pixel <b>2</b> can have a shared pixel structure. The shared pixel structure is formed of a plurality of photodiodes, a plurality of transfer transistors, one shared floating diffusion (floating diffusion region), and another pixel transistor shared in each. More specifically, in the shared pixel structure, the photodiodes and the transfer transistors constituting a plurality of unit pixels are formed in a manner sharing another pixel transistor in each.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The control circuit <b>8</b> receives an input clock and data that commands an operation mode and the like, and also outputs data such as internal information of the solid-state imaging device <b>1</b>. More specifically, the control circuit <b>8</b> generates a clock signal and a control signal to be reference of operation of the vertical drive circuit <b>4</b>, column signal processing circuit <b>5</b>, horizontal drive circuit <b>6</b>, and the like based on a vertical synchronization signal, a horizontal synchronization signal, and a master clock. Furthermore, the control circuit <b>8</b> outputs the generated clock signal and control signal to the vertical drive circuit <b>4</b>, column signal processing circuit <b>5</b>, horizontal drive circuit <b>6</b>, and the like.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The vertical drive circuit <b>4</b> is formed of, for example, a shift register and selects a predetermined pixel drive wire <b>10</b>, supplies a pulse to the selected pixel drive wire <b>10</b> in order to drive a pixel <b>2</b>, and drives pixels <b>2</b> in row units. More specifically, the vertical drive circuit <b>4</b> selectively and sequentially scans each of the pixels <b>2</b> in the pixel array unit <b>3</b> in the row units in a vertical direction, and supplies the column signal processing circuit <b>5</b> with a pixel signal via a vertical signal line <b>9</b> based on signal charge generated in a photoelectric conversion unit in each of the pixel <b>2</b> in accordance with a light receiving amount.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The column signal processing circuit <b>5</b> is arranged, for example, per column of the pixels <b>2</b> and adapted to apply, per pixel column, signal processing such as noise removal for a signal output from the pixels <b>2</b> in one row. The column signal processing circuit <b>5</b> performs signal processing such as AD conversion and correlated double sampling (CDS) in order to remove fixed-pattern noise unique to a pixel.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The horizontal drive circuit <b>6</b> is formed of, for example, a shift register, and sequentially selects each of column signal processing circuits <b>5</b> and causes each of column signal processing circuits <b>5</b> to output a pixel signal to a horizontal signal line <b>11</b> by sequentially outputting horizontal scanning pulses.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The output circuit <b>7</b> applies signal processing to the signal sequentially supplied from each of the column signal processing circuits <b>5</b> via the horizontal signal line <b>11</b>, and outputs the signal subjected to the signal processing. The output circuit <b>7</b> may perform, for example, only buffering or may perform black level adjustment, correction of column variation, various kinds of digital signal processing, and the like. The input/output terminal <b>13</b> exchanges signals with the outside.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The solid-state imaging device <b>1</b> thus configured is a CMOS image sensor of a so-called AD system in which the column signal processing circuit <b>5</b> adapted to perform the CDS processing and AD conversion processing is arranged per pixel column.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">&#x3c;2. First Embodiment of Pixel&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">&#x3c;Cross-Sectional View of Structure of Pixel&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a structure of a pixel <b>2</b> according to a first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a solid-state imaging device <b>1</b>, a photodiode PD is formed per pixel by forming an n-type (second conductivity type) semiconductor region <b>42</b> per pixel <b>2</b> in a p-type (first conductive type) semiconductor region <b>41</b> of the semiconductor substrate <b>12</b>, for example. The p-type semiconductor region <b>41</b> facing both of the front and back surfaces of the semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> also functions as a positive hole charge accumulating region in order to suppress dark current.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The front surface side of the semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> (lower side in the drawing) is formed with: a plurality of pixel transistors Tr adapted to read charge accumulated in a photodiode PD; and a multi-layer wiring layer <b>45</b> including a plurality of wiring layers <b>43</b> and an interlayer dielectric film <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Since light does not enter the multi-layer wiring layer <b>45</b> side of the semiconductor substrate <b>12</b>, layout of the wiring layer <b>43</b> can be freely set without restriction.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">An insulation layer <b>46</b> is formed on a boundary surface on the back surface side of the semiconductor substrate <b>12</b> (upper side in the drawing). In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the insulation layer <b>46</b> is formed of a plurality of layers having different refraction indexes, for example, two layers of a hafnium oxide (HfO2) film <b>48</b> and a silicon oxide film <b>47</b>, and the insulation layer <b>46</b> optically functions as a reflection preventing film.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">A flattened film <b>49</b> is formed on an upper surface of the insulation layer <b>46</b>, and an inter-pixel light shielding film <b>50</b> is formed at a pixel boundary portion on the flattened film <b>49</b>. The inter-pixel light shielding film <b>50</b> is needed to be at least a material that shields light, and preferably the inter-pixel light shielding film is formed of a film of a metal such as aluminum (Al), tungsten (W), or copper (Cu) as a material that has a high light shielding property and can be accurately processed by fine processing such as etching.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the inter-pixel light shielding film <b>50</b> is the same layer as an optical black (OPB) forming film <b>51</b> outside a pixel effective area and a pupil division light shielding film <b>52</b> of a phase difference pixel <b>2</b>P (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>), and can be formed together at the same time. The inter-pixel light shielding film <b>50</b> suppresses color mixture between pixels and light of a flare component incident at an unexpected angle. The OPB forming film <b>51</b> forms, by covering the outside of the pixel effective area, an OPB clamp region adapted to detect a black level to be reference of output in the dark. The pupil division light shielding film <b>52</b> divides light from different eye points in the phase difference pixel <b>2</b>P.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, there are two kinds of the phase difference pixels <b>2</b>P formed by the pupil division light shielding film <b>52</b>: a type A in which a left half portion of a light receiving surface of a photodiode PD is opened; and a type B in which a right half portion thereof is opened. A pair of these two kinds of phase difference pixels is arranged at a predetermined position of the pixel array unit <b>3</b>. Between a pixel signal from the type A and a pixel signal of the type B, image displacement is caused because formed positions of the opening portions are different. From this image displacement, a defocus amount is calculated by calculating a phase displacement amount, and auto-focus can be achieved by adjusting (moving) a photographing lens.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Needless to mention, there is no need to form the inter-pixel light shielding film <b>50</b>, OPB forming film <b>51</b>, and pupil division light shielding film <b>52</b> at the same time, and the films may also be formed individually. Furthermore, for example, in the case of prioritizing improvement of sensitivity by suppressing color mixture and flare, a width of a grid in the inter-pixel light shielding film <b>50</b> may be formed shorter.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring back to the description for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, layers of the light shielding walls <b>61</b> and the flattened films <b>62</b> are formed in multiple stages on the inter-pixel light shielding film <b>50</b> and the insulation layer <b>46</b>. More specifically, in a portion on the inter-pixel light shielding film <b>50</b>, a first light shielding wall <b>61</b>A is formed and also a first flattened film <b>62</b>A is formed between the first light shielding walls <b>61</b>A. Furthermore, on the first light shielding wall <b>61</b>A and the first flattened film <b>62</b>A, a second light shielding wall <b>61</b>B and a second flattened film <b>62</b>B are formed.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">On upper surfaces of the second light shielding wall <b>61</b>B and second flattened film <b>62</b>B, a color filter <b>71</b> is formed per pixel. As an array of the color filter <b>71</b>, respective colors of red (R), green (G), and blue (B) are arranged in the Bayer array, for example, but arrangement may also be based on a different arraying method.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The first light shielding walls <b>61</b>A and the second light shielding walls <b>61</b>B are formed in a grid at pixel boundary portions with respect to a plane direction same as the inter-pixel light shielding film <b>50</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The second light shielding wall <b>61</b>B located on a topmost stage out of the multiple stages may have a shape projecting to a layer of the color filter <b>71</b> from the second flattened film <b>62</b>B in order to provide light shielding between the adjacent color filters <b>71</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">An on-chip lens <b>72</b> is formed on the color filter <b>71</b> per pixel. As a material of this on-chip lens <b>72</b>, for example, organic materials such as a styrene-based resin, an acryl-based resin, a styrene-acrylic copolymer resin, and a siloxane-based resin may be applied. A refraction index of the styrene-based resin is about 1.6, and a refraction index of the acryl-based resin is about 1.5. A refraction index of the styrene-acrylic copolymer resin is about 1.5 to 1.6, and a refraction index of the siloxane-based resin is about 1.45.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Additionally, as the organic material, an organic-inorganic hybrid material obtained by dispersing TiO fine particles into the above-described resins and a polyamide resin may also be utilized.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Additionally, as the material of this on-chip lens <b>72</b>, for example, inorganic materials such as SiN and SiON may also be used. A refraction index of the SiN is about 1.9 to 2.0, and a refraction index of SiON is about 1.45 to 1.9.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">A surface of the on-chip lens <b>72</b> is covered with a reflection preventing film <b>73</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the drawing, the first light shielding wall <b>61</b>A, second light shielding wall <b>61</b>B, color filter <b>71</b>, and on-chip lens <b>72</b> formed on an upper side of the inter-pixel light shielding film <b>50</b> are formed so as to perform pupil correction.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">More specifically, since an incident angle of a main beam of incident light from an optical lens (not illustrated) becomes zero degree at a center portion of the pixel array unit <b>3</b>, there is no need to perform pupil correction, and a center of a photodiode PD coincides with centers of the color filter <b>71</b> and on-chip lens <b>72</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">On the other hand, since the incident angle of the main beam of the incident light from the optical lens has a predetermined angle in accordance with design in a peripheral portion (outer peripheral portion) of the pixel array unit <b>3</b>, pupil correction is performed. More specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the centers of the color filter <b>71</b> and on-chip lens <b>72</b> are arranged in a manner deviated to the center side of the pixel array unit <b>3</b> from the center of the photodiode PD. A deviation amount between the center position of the photodiode PD and the center positions of the color filter <b>71</b> and on-chip lens <b>72</b> becomes larger as a position approaches to the outer periphery of the pixel array unit <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Additionally, in accordance with such deviation of the color filter <b>71</b> and on-chip lens <b>72</b>, positions of the first light shielding wall <b>61</b>A and second light shielding wall <b>61</b>B are also deviated to the center side as a position approaches to the outer periphery of the pixel array unit <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Meanwhile, the pixel structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is the example in which the light shielding walls <b>61</b> are formed in the two stages including the first light shielding wall <b>61</b>A and the second light shielding wall <b>61</b>B, but the light shielding walls can be formed in optional number of stages (Q stage (Q&#x3e;2). In the following, a layer formed with the light shielding wall <b>61</b> will be also referred to as a light shielding wall layer.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">As for pupil correction of the light shielding wall <b>61</b>, loss of sensitivity in the peripheral portion (angle field edge) of the pixel array unit <b>3</b> can be minimized by applying an optimal correction amount at a height of each light shielding wall <b>61</b> in a certain image height.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the certain image height, the more increased the number of stages of the light shielding wall <b>61</b> is, in other words, the closer to the color filter <b>71</b> a position approaches to, the larger a pupil correction amount is. However, a pupil correction amount at the light shielding wall <b>61</b> in the topmost stage is equal to or less than a pupil correction amount of the color filter <b>71</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Further, as for the pupil correction amount of the color filter <b>71</b>, when the correction amount is large, there is a concern that color mixture may be caused by the color filter <b>71</b> of own pixel entering a region surrounded by light shielding walls <b>61</b> of adjacent pixels. Therefore, the pupil correction amount of the color filter <b>71</b> is set within a range from a correction amount same as the light shielding wall <b>61</b> in the topmost stage closest to the color filter <b>71</b> to a correction amount obtained by adding a half width of the light shielding wall <b>61</b> of the topmost stage to the pupil correction amount of the light shielding wall <b>61</b> of the topmost stage. More specifically, provided that the pupil correction amount and the width of the light shielding wall <b>61</b> of the topmost stage are C and X, the color filter <b>71</b> is formed such that the pupil correction amount D of the color filter <b>71</b> becomes C&#x2264;D&#x2264;C+X/2.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Also, the pupil correction amount becomes larger in the following order: inter-pixel light shielding film <b>50</b> light shielding wall <b>61</b> of first stage&#x2264;light shielding wall <b>61</b> of second stage&#x2264; . . . &#x2264;light shielding wall in topmost stage <b>61</b>&#x2264;color filter <b>71</b>&#x2264;on-chip lens <b>72</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Furthermore, in the case where one stage of the light shielding wall <b>61</b> has the same height and a material of the flattened film <b>62</b> is the same, preferably, the pupil correction amount of the light shielding wall <b>61</b> is proportional to a height of layer where the light shielding wall <b>61</b> is located.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Additionally, when strong light such as sun light enters an angle field edge, there is a concern of having influence of color mixture such as flare because the light enters from a direction different from normal light incident from a lens due to reflection light inside a camera casing (the different direction may be a direction opposite to a pupil correction direction). Therefore, in order to handle the incident light from various directions, preferably, the pupil correction of the color filter <b>71</b> is the same correction amount as the light shielding wall <b>61</b> in the topmost stage below the color filter <b>71</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Since the pupil correction amount is large at the angle field edge, a light shielding wall <b>61</b> of an upper stage does not overlap at all with a light shielding wall <b>61</b> of a stage immediately below, and the light shielding wall <b>61</b> of the upper stage is in a state stepping away from the light shielding wall <b>61</b> of the stage immediately below. In this case, there is a concern that arcing may occur at the time of etching the flattened film <b>62</b> when pattern processing is applied to the light shielding wall <b>61</b>. However, pupil correction amounts of the light shielding walls <b>61</b> on the respective stages become almost equal in a center of an image height, and the wall of the lower stage is surely connected and the connected upper and lower light shielding walls <b>61</b> have electrically same potential.
