Discussion of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system is revolutionizing gene therapy.<sup>[1] </sup>A CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing system is composed of two functional components, i.e., Cas9 endonuclease and an engineered short, single-guide RNA (sgRNA), which form a ribonucleoprotein complex, Cas9.sgRNA. Based on a base-pairing mechanism, Cas9.sgRNA complex recognizes and cuts the targeted site, precisely inducing a double-strand break (DSB).<sup>[1] </sup>Subsequently, endogenous DNA repair occurs via either a non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or a homology directed repair (HDR) pathway. As a general therapeutic solution for treating genetic diseases,<sup>[2] </sup>the HDR pathway is often adopted for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockin,<sup>[3]</sup> by which a therapeutic gene carried by donor DNA (dDNA) is integrated into DSB. However, HDR-based CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockin is less efficient in vivo since the HDR pathway is not readily accessible to non-dividing cells in tissue.<sup>[4] </sup>By contrast, the NHEJ pathway is active in both non-dividing and proliferating cells, and thus, can be adopted to achieve more efficient in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockin. A homology-independent targeted integration (HITI) strategy<sup>[5] </sup>was developed based on the NHEJ pathway to enable robust knockin of non-dividing cells in vivo. In brief, HITI strategy introduces two pre-determined CRISPR/Cas9 target sites into dDNA. After cutting the targeted sites present in both genomic DNA and dDNA, the resulting three DSB sites undergoes endogenous DNA repair via the NHEJ pathway to achieve gene integration.<sup>[5]</sup> In animal studies, the HITI strategy enables more efficient CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockin, suitable for a local gene-editing solution in organs, like eyes and brains.<sup>[5a]</sup> However, the technical challenge remains to develop safe and reliable delivery vectors that can co-deliver Cas9.sgRNA and dDNA into the target cells and/or tissues.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, XLRS is a condition characterized by impaired vision that begins in childhood in males. Approximately 200 mutations of the RS1 gene have been identified as associated with either decreases in or complete loss of functional retinoschisin, which disrupts the maintenance and organization of cells in the retina.<sup>[6]</sup> Recently, a small number of clinical trials<sup>[7] </sup>were initiated to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy approaches, which introduce functional retinoschisin in retina to treat XLRS. To date, none of the AAV-based RS1 gene therapy approaches<sup>[8]</sup> has reached a satisfactory clinical endpoint. Meanwhile, researchers have been exploring CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockin of RS1 gene to achieve a curative therapeutic solution for XLRS. While AAV<sup>[9] </sup>is also frequently used for delivering CRISPR/Cas9 system, its limited packaging capacity (&#x3c;4.7 kb)<sup>[10] </sup>and safety concerns on viral integration and immunogenicity remain. Alternative approaches harness the potential of non-viral vectors,<sup>[11] </sup>including lipids,<sup>[12]</sup> polymers<sup>[13]</sup> and nanoparticles<sup>[14]</sup> for carrying Cas9, guide RNA (gRNA), and donor DNA (dDNA). Although there has been substantial progress made for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout,<sup>[14c, 15]</sup> and knockdown<sup>[16]</sup> using non-viral vectors along the NHEJ pathway, relatively limited results have been obtained for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockin,<sup>[14d, 17]</sup> especially for integration of a full-length gene.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">All publications and patent applications identified herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety and to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An embodiment of the invention relates to a composition for delivering a nucleic acid encoding an endonuclease and a nucleic acid sequence encoding a donor protein to a cell including: a first plurality of self-assembled supramolecular nanoparticles (SMNPs), each of the first plurality of self-assembled supramolecular nanoparticles (SMNPs) including: a plurality of binding components, each having a plurality of binding regions; a plurality of cores that are suitable to at least provide some mechanical structure to the plurality of self-assembled supramolecular nanoparticles (SMNPs), the plurality of cores including at least one core binding element adapted to bind to the binding regions to form a first inclusion complex, wherein the plurality of binding components and the plurality of cores self-assemble when brought into contact to form the first plurality of self-assembled supramolecular nanoparticles (SMNPs); a plurality of terminating components, each having a single terminating binding element that binds to remaining binding regions of one of said plurality of binding components by forming a second inclusion complex, wherein the plurality of terminating components act to occupy the remaining binding regions of the plurality of binding components, and the plurality of terminating components are present in a sufficient quantity relative to the plurality of binding regions of the plurality of binding components to terminate further binding, thereby forming a discrete particle; the nucleic acid sequence encoding the endonuclease; and a nucleotide sequence including a recognition sequence specific to the endonuclease; and a second plurality of self-assembled supramolecular nanoparticles (SMNPs), each of the second plurality of self-assembled supramolecular nanoparticles (SMNPs) including: a plurality of binding components, each having a plurality of binding regions; a plurality of cores that are suitable to at least provide some mechanical structure to the plurality of self-assembled supramolecular nanoparticles (SMNPs), the plurality of cores including at least one core binding element adapted to bind to the binding regions to form a first inclusion complex, wherein the plurality of binding components and the plurality of cores self-assemble when brought into contact to form the second plurality of self-assembled supramolecular nanoparticles (SMNPs); a plurality of terminating components, each having a single terminating binding element that binds to remaining binding regions of one of said plurality of binding components by forming a second inclusion complex, wherein the plurality of terminating components act to occupy the remaining binding regions of the plurality of binding components, and the plurality of terminating components are present in a sufficient quantity relative to the plurality of binding regions of the plurality of binding components to terminate further binding, thereby forming a discrete particle; and the nucleic acid sequence encoding the donor protein.

By intravitreally injecting the two SMNP vectors in BALB/c-strain mice, it was successfully demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockin of 3.0-kb RS1/GFP gene into the Rosa26 site in mice retinas is possible. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential of the combined use of the SMNP vectors with the HITI strategy to achieve in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockin of a therapeutic gene. Since nearly 200 mutation sites in the RS1 gene have been identified and associated with XLRS, it is not feasible to develop CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing according to individual patients' mutations. Performing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockin of RS1 gene in the retinas of XLJR patients via either intravitreal or subretinal injection of the SMNPs would offer a revolutionary curative therapeutic solution. The same strategy should apply for treating other genetic diseases in which specific mutations only function in local organs (e.g., cystic fibrosis).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Materials and Methods.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Chemical reagents and solvents were purchased from Sigma and were used as received without further purification unless otherwise noted.
