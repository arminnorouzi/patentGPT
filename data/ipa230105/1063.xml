The two principal dialysis methods are hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). Various unwanted substances may be removed from a patient's blood during a dialysis treatment, including waste products (for instance, urea), toxins, and foreign substances (for instance, prescription drug molecules). In contrast to free or unbound substances, dialysis processes may not be able to effectively remove protein-bound substances because only the unbound fraction of the substance may pass through the membrane of a dialyzer. Accordingly, protein-bound substances typically require specific treatment methods to be efficiently and effectively removed from the blood of a patient during a dialysis treatment. It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present improvements may be useful.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to necessarily identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with various aspects of the described embodiments is an apparatus that may include a memory and at least one processor coupled to the memory. The memory may include instructions that, when executed by the at least one processor, cause the at least one processor to access dialysis information for a dialysis process performed by a dialysis machine, the dialysis information indicating a target substance to be displaced from a binding compound by a displacer, and determine an infusion profile for infusing the displacer into a patient during a displacer infusion process of the dialysis process, the infusion profile determined based on the dialysis information and an infusion constraint.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In exemplary embodiments of the apparatus, the instructions, when executed by the at least one processor, may cause the at least one processor to perform the displacer infusion process via the dialysis machine by infusing the patient with the displacer according to the infusion profile. In various embodiments of the apparatus, the infusion constraint may include maintaining a concentration of the target substance at or below an initial concentration during the displacer infusion process.

The subject matter of the present disclosure, however, may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and willfully convey the scope of the subject matter to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Various embodiments may generally be directed toward systems, methods, and/or apparatuses for performing displacement dialysis processes for removing protein-bound substances from patient blood. In general, a substance or target substance may be present within patient fluids in a free or unbound form and in a protein-bound form. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a patient <b>105</b> depicting the patient fluids compartmentalized as intracellular fluid <b>110</b>, interstitium fluid <b>112</b>, and plasma fluid <b>114</b>, where T indicates toxins and P indicates proteins. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, free toxins (T<sub>ic</sub>, T<sub>is</sub>, and T<sub>pl</sub>) may be equilibrated in intracellular fluid <b>110</b>, interstitium fluid <b>112</b>, and plasma fluid <b>114</b>. Protein-bound substances or toxins (PT<sub>is </sub>and PT<sub>pl</sub>) are distributed in the interstitium fluid <b>112</b> and plasma fluid <b>114</b> only. Conventional dialysis processes may be able to remove the substance in the unbound form, but not able (or at least not effectively and/or efficiently able) to remove the substance in the protein-bound form.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Some processes may introduce a displacer during dialysis treatment that is operative to displace the target substance from the protein in the protein-bound form to generate free substance. In general, a target substance is an unwanted substance for removal via dialysis that may be freed via application of a displacer. However, generating free target substances in the blood may cause the amount of substance to increase to unsafe levels. Accordingly, displacement dialysis processes according to some embodiments may operate to balance introducing a sufficient amount of the displacer to effectively generate free substance from protein-bound substance for removal via dialysis, while not causing an unsafe level of substance to be present in the blood during the treatment. For example, infusing the patient with an inadequate amount or concentration of the displacer may cause too much of the protein-bound substance to remain in the blood stream following dialysis treatment and/or may require a greatly increased dialysis treatment time to remove a sufficient amount of the substance. Alternatively, infusing the patient with too much of the displacer at a given time may cause the substance to reach unsafe concentrations in the blood, potentially causing harm to the patient. Accordingly, displacement dialysis processes according to some embodiments may include determining a displacer infusion process or profile operative to manage the infusion of displacer into the blood of a patient during dialysis to facilitate the effective removal of the substance while preventing the substance from reaching an unsafe level.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, substances may include foreign substances such as drug compounds. Non-limiting examples of drug compounds may include ibuprofen, valproic acid, phenytoin, carbamazepine, digoxin, and/or the like. In various embodiments, the protein that binds the substance may be or may include albumin. In exemplary embodiments, the displacer may be or may include aspirin. For example, drug compounds such as ibuprofen, valproic acid, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and/or digoxin bind to albumin, and aspirin binds to the same binding site on albumin. Accordingly, aspirin will compete for binding sites with the drug compounds, leading to increased free drug compounds and decreased (or even eliminated) protein-bound drug compounds. Although phenytoin, albumin, and aspirin are used in examples in this Detailed Description, embodiments are not so limited, as any substance, protein, and displacer combination(s) capable of operating according some embodiments are contemplated herein.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Dialysis processes may operate to minimize or even completely eliminate the end-dialysis toxic drug concentration in the minimum time possible, which may be achieved by maximizing the free drug concentration in serum or plasma. Increasing the free fraction of the substance may be achieved by infusing the displacer right before the dialysis interaction with patient blood (for instance, in the vicinity of where the blood engages a dialysis membrane). In this manner, displacer may compete more effectively for the binding protein and increase the free fraction of the substance. The patient should be undergoing dialysis or immediately undergo dialysis to reduce or even eliminate free substance diffusing to inaccessible fluid compartments of the patient fluidic system.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, a conventional non-displacement dialysis process may take about 360 to 420 minutes to take the concentration of a substance (for instance, phenytoin) from a toxic level (greater than 30 mg/L, such as about 70 mg/L) to a safe or therapeutic level (less than about 20 mg/L, such as about 15 mg/L). A displacement dialysis process may decrease this time to less than 100 minutes, such as about 75 minutes (for example, infusing a patient with 2000 mg aspirin dissolved in 200 ml saline before dialysis). The decrease in the time required to reach a safe or therapeutic level with a displacement dialysis process is due to the displacer significantly increasing the free substance concentration. However, the concentration of the free substance may spike during infusion of the displacer (for instance, the free concentration of phenytoin in the plasma may spike from about 10 mg/L to about 50 mg/L with 2000 mg aspirin dissolved in 200 ml saline before dialysis). It is the free concentration of the substance that may cause deleterious effects, such that pre-dialysis displacer infusion without displacer profiling according to some embodiments may actually harm the patient. Accordingly, some embodiments may provide displacer profile processes to avoid harmful spiking of substances, such as phenytoin.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In various embodiments, displacer profile processes may facilitate the infusion of displacer optimized to minimize or even eliminate the end-dialysis concentration of the target substance in a minimum time such that the free substance concentration does not go beyond or substantially beyond initial free concentration. Accordingly, displacement dialysis processes according to some embodiments may operate to provide a displacer infusion rate or profile such that the maximum concentration of the substance (for example, T<sub>pl</sub>) at any time t during infusion and/or a dialysis treatment is less than (or substantially less than or equal to) the initial concentration of the substance (T<sub>0</sub>) to provide the following infusion constraint: maxT<sub>pl</sub>(t)&#x3c;T<sub>0</sub>. The infusion constraint operates to protect the patient from harm due to a too high concentration of the free substance during the dialysis treatment due to generating free substance from protein-bound substance.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of an operating environment <b>200</b> that may be representative of some embodiments. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a dialysis machine <b>205</b> may operate to cause a dialysate inflow of a dialysis fluid <b>204</b> and a dialysis outflow of the dialysate fluid along with unwanted substances <b>206</b> (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>).

Accordingly, determining an infusion profile that satisfies (1) and (2) may involve a multi-objective optimization (MOO) process involving conflicting objectives (&#x201c;displacement process MOO&#x201d;). In some embodiments, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) may be used to solve a MOO. For example, NSGA II as described in Deb et al., &#x201c;A Fast and Elitist Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm: NSGA-II,&#x201d; IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, vol. 6, no. 2, pp. 182-197, April 2002. Non-limiting examples of parameters that may be used for determining the infusion profile may include blood flow rate (Qb), dialysate flow rate (Qd), dialyzer size, patient size, and/or drug distribution volume (for instance, typically related to patient size).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a graph <b>305</b> of competing NSGA-II solutions for the displacement process MOO.

In various embodiments, a displacer infusion process may be determined, for example, as a point on the Pareto-optimal front <b>315</b>. For example, point <b>310</b> may be selected because, among other things, the point may correspond to a vector of optimal decision variables resulting in a minimum possible dialysis time to provide a minimum possible end-dialysis target substance concentration within given constraints.
