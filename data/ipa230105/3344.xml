Transporting such cryogenic gases in a gaseous state has been known for many years. However, the total volume of cryogenic gas which can be transported in a gaseous state is considerably less than can be transported in a liquid state. Argon has an expansion ratio of 1 to 840, which means that a unit weight of gaseous argon has a volume about 840 times greater than the same unit weight of liquid argon.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, in order to maximize the quantity of gas that can be transported, the gas is maintained in a liquid state in bulk storage tanks and then transferred from those bulk tanks to a transportation tank, where the liquid argon is then transported to various locations where it will be used. A pressure drop must occur during the transfer of gas from a storage tank to a transportation tank in order to satisfy federal transport regulations. These regulations limit the pressure for transportation of the liquid gas, as opposed to the much higher pressure permitted for bulk storage of the liquefied gas. For instance, liquid argon is typically stored at a pressure of about 100 psig, whereas the transport pressure is typically 25 psig although there are different allowable pressures based on the density of the liquid. The significant pressure drop is experienced when the argon is transferred from the storage tank to the transportation tank causes as much as 30-50% of the volume of liquefied argon that is transferred to a transportation tank to change state and evaporate to the atmosphere as part of the liquid gas transfer system. Historically, customers have absorbed this loss, which can amount to as much as 2200 gallons (worth about $6600) for a 2489 gal sized tank, as a general cost of doing business.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there is a significant unmet need for a system and method for bulk transfer of liquid argon, and other cryogenic gases, which greatly minimizes the losses incumbent with the current methods of transfer.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A system and method is provided for transferring liquid argon from a bulk storage tank to a transport tank in which liquid argon is transferred at a first temperature and a first pressure through a tubing arrangement within a housing. The tubing arrangement is contacted by liquid nitrogen within the housing, the liquid nitrogen being at a second temperature within the housing that in one embodiment is lower than the first temperature. In another embodiment, the liquid nitrogen is at a second temperature equivalent to or higher than the first temperature. In this system, heat energy is transferred from the liquid argon to the liquid nitrogen. This heat transfer reduces the temperature and pressure of the liquid argon within the tubing arrangement for discharge to the transport tank. The heat transfer causes the liquid nitrogen to change to a gaseous state, resulting in amounts of gaseous nitrogen to be vented from the housing, reducing the amount of vented gaseous argon. In one embodiment, the first temperature of the liquid argon is &#x2212;256 F and the second temperature of the liquid nitrogen is &#x2212;280 F, and the first pressure of the liquid argon is between 50-250 psig and the reduced pressure of the liquid argon is between 5-50 psig or less. In another aspect, the first temperature of the liquid argon is &#x2212;254 F at a pressure of 250 psig.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, the tubing arrangement for the liquid argon is a spiral tube from an inlet at the top of the housing to an outlet at the bottom of the housing. In one embodiment, the liquid nitrogen is directed into the housing and onto the spiral tube by a spray nozzle at the top of the housing. In another embodiment, the liquid nitrogen is directed through a second spiral tubing arrangement concentrically disposed adjacent to the liquid argon tubing arrangement. A series of openings in the liquid nitrogen tube directs the liquid nitrogen directly onto the tubing arrangement for the liquid argon.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a further embodiment, the tubing arrangement for the liquid argon includes a plurality of U-shaped tubes. The tubes are configured for generally nested arrangement within a tubular housing. Liquid nitrogen is introduced into the tubular housing to directly contact each of the plurality of U-shaped tubes to affect the heat transfer between the liquid argon and the liquid nitrogen.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram of a system for transferring liquid argon from a bulk storage tank to a transport tank according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an enlarged view of argon and nitrogen tubing arrangements in a heat exchanger of the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref></p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side view of a heat exchanger according to another embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a top view of the heat exchanger shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the heat exchanger shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a side cut-away view of the argon tubing arrangement for the heat exchanger shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b </i></figref>are top views of baffles disposed within the heat exchanger shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an enlarged cut-away view of the mounting flange of the heat exchanger shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the disclosure, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and described in the following written specification. It is understood that no limitation to the scope of the disclosure is thereby intended. It is further understood that the present disclosure includes any alterations and modifications to the illustrated embodiments and includes further applications of the principles disclosed herein, to include the application to other cryogenic gases, as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which this disclosure pertains.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">One embodiment of the present system is depicted schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A supply of liquid argon is stored within a bulk tank <b>10</b> at 100 psig and a temperature of &#x2212;256&#xb0; F. The bulk tank is constructed in a conventional manner to safely hold the liquefied argon under pressure and may be insulated in a conventional manner. Liquid argon is supplied by tube <b>12</b> to internal pipes or a tube arrangement <b>14</b> within a heat exchanger unit <b>15</b>. The liquid argon exits the heat exchanger unit <b>15</b> through an outlet tube <b>16</b> that supplies the liquid argon to a Department of Transportation (DOT) approved transport vehicle <b>18</b>. As will be understood by one having skill in the art, the materials for the heat exchanger unit <b>15</b> are only limited in that such materials must be able to withstand cryogenic temperatures, i.e. &#x2212;321 F. In one embodiment, the shell and outlet tubes of heat exchanger unit <b>15</b> are preferably oriented vertically to prevent adverse bending of the heat exchanger due to unequal temperature changes which sometimes happen if the heat exchanger is in a horizontal position.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, the heat exchanger unit includes a housing <b>15</b><i>a </i>defining an interior volume <b>15</b><i>b</i>. The housing may be formed of any suitable material capable of maintaining the interior volume substantially sealed except at pre-defined inlets and outlet. The inlet tube <b>12</b> and outlet tube <b>16</b> can be connected to the heat exchanger <b>15</b> by appropriate fittings to maintain a leak-proof transfer of the liquid argon from the inlet tube <b>12</b> to the internal tube arrangement <b>14</b>, and from the tube arrangement to the outlet tube <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the internal tube arrangement <b>14</b> includes a tube or pipe, such as a copper tube, that is wound within the interior volume <b>15</b><i>b </i>from the inlet tube <b>12</b> to the outlet tube <b>16</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The tube arrangement can thus include a number of turns, such as 20 turns, in the spiral configuration. The spiral configuration can start with the first loop <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the spiral having a diameter slightly less than the perimeter dimensions of the housing <b>15</b><i>a</i>. In one specific embodiment, the housing is a six-foot cube, so the first loop <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the spiral tube arrangement <b>14</b> can have a diameter of about five feet. The diameter of each successive loop can decrease to the last loop <b>14</b><i>b </i>that is connected to the outlet tube <b>16</b>, which can have a diameter of about one foot.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one feature of the present disclosure, a liquid nitrogen tank <b>20</b> is connected to the heat exchanger <b>15</b> by an inlet tube <b>22</b>. In one embodiment, the inlet tube <b>22</b> is connected to a spray nozzle <b>24</b> mounted within the housing <b>15</b><i>a</i>. The spray nozzle <b>24</b> is configured and arranged to direct a spray of liquid nitrogen across the internal tube arrangement <b>14</b> carrying the liquid argon. A vent <b>26</b> is provided to vent the nitrogen as it changes state from liquid to gas.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The liquid nitrogen in the tank <b>20</b> is maintained at a temperature and pressure. In one embodiment, the temperature of the stored liquid nitrogen is at a lower temperature than the temperature of the liquid argon. In another embodiment, the temperature of the stored liquid nitrogen is at the same temperature or a higher temperature than the temperature of the liquid argon. It is to be understood that the temperature is generally dependent on the saturated pressure. Based on construction of typical bulk tanks, in many cases, the maximum temperature of the liquid nitrogen is about &#x2212;254 F at 250 psig, which is the normal maximum allowable operating pressure (MAWP) of the bulk tanks. In the first illustrated embodiment the liquid argon is stored at a temperature of &#x2212;256&#xb0; F. and warms slightly to a temperature of about &#x2212;250&#xb0; F. upon entering the heat exchanger <b>15</b>. In this illustrated embodiment, the liquid nitrogen is stored at a temperature of &#x2212;250&#xb0; F. The liquid nitrogen is stored at a pressure of 100 psig so that as the nitrogen is depressurized upon exiting the nozzle <b>24</b> it will sufficiently cover the internal tube arrangement <b>14</b>. As the nitrogen depressurizes its temperature decreases to about &#x2212;320&#xb0; F., which is significantly colder than the liquid argon flowing through the internal tube arrangement <b>14</b>. This temperature is the boiling point of the nitrogen and results in a temperature where nitrogen can absorb the most hear. Thus, this temperature differential results in heat transfer from the liquid argon to the liquid nitrogen sprayed onto the tube arrangement, thereby reducing the temperature of the liquid argon by about 20&#xb0; F. Spraying the nitrogen onto the internal tube arrangement reduces the Leidenfrost effect, which helps maintain the heat transfer from the liquid argon to the liquid nitrogen.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In another embodiment, the spray nozzle <b>24</b> is replaced by a spiral tube, such as spiral tube <b>24</b>&#x2032;, which is concentrically disposed adjacent an internal spiral tube arrangement <b>14</b>&#x2032; for the liquid argon, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The liquid nitrogen spiral tube includes a series of small holes <b>24</b><i>a </i>in the tube directed toward the adjacent spiral tube arrangement <b>14</b>&#x2032; so that liquid nitrogen ejected from each hole is sprayed directly onto the argon tube <b>14</b>. The end <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the tube can be capped. As one of skill in the art understands, varying the internal tube arrangement for the nitrogen gas so as to result in a further pressure decrease and corresponding temperature decrease so as to maximize the system is anticipated. The nitrogen sprayed from the tube again acts to draw thermal energy from the argon flowing through the tube arrangement <b>14</b> to thereby lower the temperature of the liquid argon. The holes <b>24</b><i>a </i>can be limited to portions of the spiral tube <b>24</b>&#x2032; that are in immediate proximity to portions of the argon tube arrangement <b>14</b>, or can extend along substantially the entire length of the tube. In the illustrated embodiment, the liquid nitrogen spiral tube <b>24</b>&#x2032; is concentrically wound with the liquid argon spiral tube <b>14</b>&#x2032;. In a specific embodiment, the liquid nitrogen tube <b>24</b>&#x2032; is wound at a smaller diameter than the liquid argon tube <b>14</b>&#x2032; so that the liquid nitrogen tube is generally radially inboard of the liquid argon tube. In this configuration, the openings <b>24</b><i>a </i>are arranged in the tube <b>24</b>&#x2032; to direct the liquid nitrogen generally radially outward toward the liquid argon tube <b>14</b>&#x2032;. Alternatively, the liquid nitrogen tube can be wound at a larger diameter than the liquid argon tube, in which case the liquid nitrogen tube is generally radially outboard of the liquid argon tube. In this configuration, the openings in the liquid nitrogen tube are arranged to direct the liquid nitrogen generally radially inward.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">It can be appreciated that the heat exchanger <b>15</b> of the present disclosure operates to lower the temperature of the liquid argon flowing from the bulk tank <b>10</b> to the transport tank <b>18</b>. As the argon is cooled the pressure of the liquid argon within the tube arrangement <b>14</b> decreases by about 30-50 psig without any corresponding loss of liquid argon or any corresponding change of state of the liquid argon. The lower pressure of the liquid argon as it leaves the heat exchanger through the outlet tube <b>16</b> reduces, and in some cases eliminates, the losses that occur in the conventional transfer process. In the conventional process the liquid argon is maintained substantially at its bulk storage pressure, 100 psig in the present example, but must be reduced to the DOT regulated pressure of 22-25 psig within the transport tank <b>18</b>. In order to achieve this significant pressure reduction it is necessary to open a relief valve in the transport tank and relieve argon gas to the atmosphere. It can be appreciated that a 75 psig differential in the conventional system can require significant venting of argon gas, leading to the 30-50% loss of liquid argon. However, with the system and method of the present disclosure the liquid argon enters the transport tank <b>18</b> at a much lower pressure, nominally 30-50 psig or less. The pressure differential is no longer 75 psig, but in the range of 5-25 psig. It can thus be appreciated that this much reduced pressure differential means that significantly less argon gas must be vented to achieve the DOT regulated pressure within the transport tank <b>18</b>. Moreover, the liquid argon increases in density as it cools. The greater density allows more liquid argon to flow into the transport tank <b>18</b> regardless of the constraints of the total volume of the transport tank <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, a heat exchanger <b>50</b> includes a vertical tubular housing <b>52</b> supported on a skirt <b>54</b> mounted on a platform <b>55</b>. In some embodiments, the skirt is anchored with gussets <b>55</b><i>a </i>although the means of anchoring to the platform is not meant to be limited. The elongated tubular housing <b>52</b> defines an interior chamber <b>53</b> that is supplied with liquid nitrogen through nitrogen inlet <b>74</b>. As the nitrogen ascends within vertical housing <b>52</b> it gradually changes to the gaseous state, exiting the housing at the nitrogen vapor vent <b>76</b> at the top of the housing. An arrangement of baffles <b>70</b>, <b>71</b> define an upward serpentine path for the nitrogen flowing within the tubular housing <b>52</b> from the bottom of the housing to the vent <b>76</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The skirt <b>54</b> defines an interior chamber <b>62</b> that is separated by a baffle <b>64</b> into an inlet chamber <b>62</b><i>a</i>, an outlet chamber <b>62</b><i>b </i>and left and right intermediate chambers <b>62</b><i>c </i>and <b>62</b><i>d</i>, respectively. The inlet chamber <b>62</b><i>a </i>is in fluid communication with a liquid argon inlet <b>58</b>, while the outlet chamber <b>62</b><i>b </i>is in fluid communication with a liquid argon outlet <b>59</b>. The tubular housing <b>52</b> is engaged to the skirt <b>54</b> at a mounting flange <b>56</b>, with the flange positioned above the argon inlet and outlet. As shown in the detail view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the mounting flange <b>56</b> includes a mounting plate <b>66</b> sandwiched between the mounting flange elements <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>b</i>. The mounting flange includes an appropriate gasket or seal arrangement to provide a fluid and gas tight seal between the mounting plate <b>66</b> and the skirt chamber <b>62</b>, and between mounting plate and the housing chamber <b>53</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the mounting plate <b>66</b> includes a plurality of openings, such as openings <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>b</i>, to receive and support the argon tube arrangement that includes a plurality of U-shaped tubes <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The lower ends <b>61</b><i>a</i>, <b>61</b><i>b </i>open into the respective inlet chamber <b>62</b><i>a </i>and outlet chamber <b>62</b><i>b</i>, that in turn communicate with the respective liquid argon inlet <b>58</b> and outlet <b>59</b>. The tubes <b>60</b> pass through corresponding openings <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>71</b><i>a </i>in respective baffles <b>70</b>, <b>71</b> to support the tubes along the entire length of the tubular housing <b>52</b>. A number of tie bars (not shown) can pass through openings <b>73</b> in the baffles <b>70</b>, <b>71</b> and anchored at the mounting flange <b>56</b> to provide stability to the tubular housing and argon tube arrangement <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Tubes <b>60</b> can be provided in a range of nested sizes, from the tubes <b>60</b><i>a </i>having a narrower lateral extent to the tubes <b>60</b><i>b </i>having a wider lateral extent. U-shaped tubes <b>60</b><i>c </i>and <b>60</b><i>d </i>are sized to nest between the narrower and wide tubes <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b</i>. As depicted in the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, fourteen U-shaped tubes <b>50</b> can fit within the chamber <b>53</b> of the tubular housing <b>52</b>. Each of the U-shaped tubes defines a bend radius R to the centerline (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). In one specific embodiment, the bend radius can be about 0.95 in. for the smaller tube <b>60</b><i>a, </i>1.6 in. for the tube <b>60</b><i>d, </i>2.2 in. for the tube <b>60</b><i>c </i>and about 2.8 in. for the larger tube <b>60</b><i>b</i>. The differing bend radii allow the tubes to be arranged in a generally nested fashion, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. With this configuration, 28 tubes having a tube diameter of 0.625 in. can be arranged within an 8 in. diameter tubular housing <b>52</b>&#x2014;including six tubes at each of the larger bend radii and eight tubes at each of the smaller bend radii. However, as it is generally understood by the skilled artisan, the number of tubes is not meant to be limiting and different numbers of tubes can be used in different situations. The tubes <b>60</b> include generally straight legs <b>61</b> that can have a length in the specific embodiment of about 96 in. The tubular housing <b>52</b> is thus appropriately sized to encase the tubes <b>60</b>. In a specific embodiment, fourteen baffles <b>70</b>, <b>71</b> are provided to support the tubes within the housing. The baffles also increase the flow velocity and turbulence of the nitrogen within the housing by forcing the nitrogen to flow largely perpendicularly to the tubes, the forcing the nitrogen to flow around the tubes, in a generally horizontal manner. The baffles thus increase the heat transfer rate between the argon in the tubes and the liquid nitrogen in the housing.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The liquid argon inlet <b>58</b> can be connected by way of a cryogenic pump to the liquid argon tank <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and the argon outlet <b>59</b> can likewise be connected to the transport tank <b>18</b> in a known manner. Liquid argon is transferred (by pumping or by pressure differential) at 100 psig and &#x2212;256&#xb0; F. into the inlet chamber <b>62</b><i>a </i>and from there into each of the plurality of U-shaped tubes <b>60</b>. The liquid argon is directed into the tubes at the inlet chamber <b>62</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) and then upward through the tubes to the U-shaped bend within the left intermediate chamber <b>62</b><i>c</i>. The argon then flows downward through the tubes to the bottom of the left intermediate chamber <b>62</b><i>c</i>, where the argon then passes into the U-shaped tubes in the right intermediate chamber <b>62</b><i>d</i>. The argon flows upward within the tubes in the intermediate chamber to the U-shaped bend, and then downward within the housing to the argon outlet <b>59</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The liquid nitrogen inlet <b>74</b> is connected by way of a cryogenic pump to the liquid nitrogen tank <b>20</b> and is concurrently transferred through the nitrogen interior chamber <b>53</b> of the tubular housing <b>52</b>. The temperature of the nitrogen at the inlet is automatically controlled to prevent the argon from freezing at its outlet. In this embodiment, the liquid nitrogen at the inlet is approximately the temperature/pressure of the bulk nitrogen tank, i.e., usually a temperature that is warmer than &#x2212;300 F, even at a pressure of 25 psig. This is warmer than the freezing point of argon which is &#x2212;308 F. The baffles <b>70</b>, <b>71</b> interrupt the flow of nitrogen through the chamber so that the nitrogen is maintained in contact with the U-shaped tubes <b>60</b> carrying the liquid argon. In addition, the thermodynamic characteristics of the nitrogen changes as it moves upward within the housing, so that the nitrogen is warmer at the inlet and colder at the outlet to cool the argon without it freezing at its outlet. And although not meant to be limiting, the U-shape of the argon tubes ensures that the entire length of the tubing is contacted by the liquid nitrogen, which upon entry into the chamber decreases in temperature in association with the corresponding decrease in pressure. As with previous embodiments, as the nitrogen changes state it draws heat energy from the argon flowing through the U-shaped tubes <b>60</b>, thereby reducing the temperature and pressure of the argon, while increasing the density of the liquid argon that exits the outlet <b>59</b> into the transport tank <b>20</b>. The argon can thus enter the transport tank at &#x2212;300&#xb0; F. and at a pressure lower than the DOT regulated pressure for transport. This translates to significant lower losses of argon to atmosphere as the transport tank is filled. And even though nitrogen is released into the atmosphere in the system, the overall cost savings are significant. The general cost of nitrogen is approximately 10&#xd7; lower than the cost of an equivalent amount of argon. Additionally, there is a current argon shortage suggesting that the cost of argon will continue to climb. As nitrogen is almost 80% of our atmosphere and can be easily generated in house, it is unlikely to ever become limiting. In the embodiments where nitrogen is stored at a temperature higher or equal to the temperature of the argon, further cost savings are realized because the lower temperature does not have to be maintained in the nitrogen storage tank.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The present disclosure should be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character.
