Therefore the technology on non-isocyanate (NICN) curing without any free TDI has gained great attention in academic and industrial fields.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To date, there have been several potentially curable methods by NICN in industrial applications, for example including a polycarbodiimide (PCDI) curing system, a Michael Addition curing system and so on. The PCDI curing system, however, is hardly commercialized on account of its short pot-life at this stage. Currently, the Michael Addition curing system has been widely applied in industry fields. Meanwhile, this Michael Addition curing system has many attractive advantages, including: (1) capable of curing at ambient temperatures, even lower temperature; (2) very low solvent content such as VOC&#x3c;250 g/1; (3) very long pot-life such as a pot life of &#x3e;8 hours at 23&#xb0; C.; (4) excellent appearance such as gloss @60&#xb0; of &#x3e;90 and DOI&#x3e;90; (5) capable of applying at a thick layer, such as with as a thickness of &#x3e;150 &#x3bc;m; (6) very good chemical resistance; (7) excellent flexibility; (8) good outdoor durability; and (9) free of isocyanate; formaldehyde and organotin. Thus, there has been a strong demand for this Michael Addition curing system in market.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In terms of composition, a Michael addition-curable system is usually composed of a reactive donor, a reactive acceptor, a catalyst for catalyzing the Michael addition crosslinking reaction between the reactive donor and the reactive acceptor, and other additional components. At present, the research on this curing system mainly focuses on the catalyst and the additional components, and the research on the reactive donor and reactive acceptor is very limited. In the disclosed Michael addition-curable systems, the reactive donors and reactive acceptors are mostly polymers with linear structures, providing reactive active hydrogens and unsaturated carbon-carbon double bonds, respectively. In many applications, paint films formed by the Michael addition reaction curing system have the problems of low hardness and slow drying speed, which cannot meet the growing market requirements for the performance of coating compositions, especially curing performance and coating performance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is a need in industry for an improved Michael Addition curable system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the present application discloses a Michael Addition curable composition, comprising:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">at least one reactive donor capable of providing two or more nucleophilic carbanions;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">at least one reactive acceptor comprising two or more carbon-carbon double bonds; and</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">at least one catalyst for catalyzing the Michael Addition crosslinking reaction between the at least one reactive donor and the at least one reactive acceptor;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">wherein the at least one reactive donor comprises at least one branched polyester comprising at least one polyester backbone and at least one &#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(O)-moiety; wherein the at least one polyester backbone is derived from an alcohol component comprising at least one alcohol having at least three hydroxyl groups; and wherein the at least one branched polyester has a &#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(O)-moiety equivalent of no more than 700 g/mol.

As described above, the nucleophilic carbanion refers to an active intermediate of carbon with a lone pair of electrons to which two or three strong electronegative groups are typically attached. As an example of the strong electronegative groups, it may be selected from one or more of the following &#x2014;NO<sub>2</sub>, &#x2014;C(&#x2550;O)&#x2014;, &#x2014;CO<sub>2</sub>R<sub>1</sub>, &#x2014;SO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, &#x2014;CHO, &#x2014;CN, and &#x2014;CONR<sub>2</sub>, and the like, wherein R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>each independently represent an alkyl group.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0048">In an embodiment of the present application, the reactive donor comprises at least one branched polyester. The branched polyester has a branch structure and also contains a certain amount of &#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(O)-moiety, for example, with an &#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(O)-moiety equivalent of no more than 700 g/mol, to provide nucleophilic carbanions so as to function as a reactive donor. It was surprisingly found that the Michael addition-curable system composed of this reactive donor has a faster curing speed, for example, its tack-free time can be controlled within an appropriate time period, for example, within 1.5 hours.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0049">In an embodiment, the branched polyester has a branch structure, and its backbone structure is derived from an alcohol component comprising a polyol, wherein an alcohol having at least three hydroxyl functional groups in the alcohol component serves as a core of the branched polyester, leading to the formation of branched structures. Therefore, in the synthesis of the branched polyester, an alcohol having at least three hydroxyl functions are one of the essential components.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0050">In an embodiment, the branched polyester also has a certain amount of &#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(O)-moiety, thereby enabling it to act as a reactive donor in the Michael addition-curable system. Specifically, the &#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(O)-moiety equivalent of the branched polyester according to the present application is set within a specific range. It was found that the &#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(O)-moiety equivalent of the branched polyester as a reactive donor is directly relevant to the curing speed of coating. The higher the equivalent, the lower the content of active hydrogen functional groups is, thereby enabling the coating formed therefrom to have relatively lower curing rate; the lower the equivalent, the higher the content of active hydrogen functional groups is, thereby enabling the coating formed therefrom to have relatively higher curing rate. According to some embodiments of the present application, the branched polyester has a &#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(O) moiety equipment of no more than 600 g/mol, preferably of no more than 500 g/mol, more preferably of no more than 400 g/mol, and even more preferably of no more than 240 g/mol and has a &#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(O) moiety equipment of at least 200 g/mol.

As mentioned above, the polyester backbone of the reactive donor has a rigid aromatic structure. It was surprisingly found that introduction of an aromatic ring or aromatic ring system with a rigid structure in the polyester backbone of the reactive donor can reduce gelling of branched polyesters during polymerization and can also provide cured coatings with improved hardness, relative to the Michael addition-curable coating with a flexible alkyl or cycloalkyl. Preferably, the aromatic polyester backbone is derived from aromatic carboxylic acids. As mentioned above, the aromatic carboxylic acids refer to an aromatic carboxylic acid component capable of providing carboxylic acid groups or potential carboxylic acid groups, including but not limited to aromatic carboxylic acids, carboxylic acid anhydrides, acid halides, esters of carboxylic acids and lower alkanols or analogs.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0052">In some embodiments according to the present application, the branched polyester as a reactive donor has a relatively low viscosity as measured by IWATA NK-2 at 25&#xb0; C. It was found that a lower viscosity of the branched polyester as a reactive donor is advantageous for improving applicability of the resulting coating. In one embodiment, the branched polyester has a viscosity of less than 2000 mPa&#xb7;s, preferably of less than 1800 mPa&#xb7;s, more preferably of less than 1500 mPa&#xb7;s, still more preferably of less than 1200 mPa&#xb7;s, and even more preferably of less than 1000 mPa&#xb7;s, as measured with IWATA NK-2 at 25&#xb0; C. However, considering the practical application, especially application efficiency of the coating, the viscosity of the branched polyester as a reactive donor is not suitable to be too low, otherwise the application efficiency of the coating will be negatively affected. Accordingly, the branched polyester constituting the reactive donor according to the present application has a viscosity of at least 500 mPa&#xb7;s as measured by IWATA NK-2 at 25&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0053">In some embodiments according to the present application, the reactive donor comprises at least one first branched polyester. The first branched polyester has a polyester backbone derived from an alcohol component comprising at least one alcohol having at least three hydroxyl functional groups and &#x2014;C(O)&#x2014; CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(O)-moiety covalently incorporated into the polyester backbone. The branched polyester has a novel specific structure in which at least one &#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(O)-moiety is covalently incorporated into the polymer backbone. That is, the &#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(O)-moiety is mainly distributed in the middle of the backbone structure of the branched polyester, not at the terminal. The branched polyester of this structure was successfully synthesized by the applicant of the present application for the first time, and was successfully applied in the Michael addition-curable system. Prior to this application, there is no prior art to disclose and teach this new type of branched polyester and its use in a Michael addition-curable system. Thus, the novel branched polyester according to embodiments of the present application broadens the window of reactive donors for Michael addition-curable compositions, and thus extends the range of applications for Michael addition-curable compositions.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0054">According to some embodiments of the present application, the first branched polyester has a weight average molecular weight of 30,000 g/mol or higher as determined by GPC referencing ASTM D5296.

Furthermore, the first branched polyester may have a molecular weight distribution of at least 10.0, preferably a molecular weight distribution of at least 12.0, more preferably a molecular weight distribution of at least 14.0, still more preferably a molecular weight distribution of 16.0, even more preferably a molecular weight distribution of 18.0, as determined by GPC referencing ASTM D5296.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0055">According to some embodiments of the present application, the first branched polyester has a glass transition temperature of greater than 0&#xb0; C., as determined by Differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC) using ASTM D6604-00. Preferably, the glass transition temperature of the first branched polyester is greater than 2&#xb0; C. Considering the practical application, the glass transition temperature of the first branched polyester should not be too high, otherwise it will negatively affect the curing of the coating and bring about unnecessary VOC emissions. Therefore, the first branched polyester according to the present application preferably has a glass transition temperature in the range of 2&#xb0; C. to 10&#xb0; C. using ASTM D6604-00.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0056">In one embodiment according to the present application, the first branched polyester is prepared by a transesterification reaction between an alcohol component and a carboxylic ester component in a one-step process, wherein the carboxylic ester component comprises at least one aromatic carboxylic ester having at least two carboxyl functional groups, and at least one alkyl malonate, and the alcohol component comprises at least one alcohol having at least three hydroxyl functional groups. As mentioned above, the first branched polyester is derived from alkyl malonate, so the first branched polyester is also referred to as a &#x201c;malonate-type branched polyester&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057">The above-mentioned malonate-type branched polyester is prepared by a transesterification reaction between a carboxylic ester component and an alcohol component in a one-step process, wherein the carboxylic ester component is in excess relative to the alcohol component, so that gelling during the preparation of the branched polyesters can be avoided. For example, the carboxylic ester component to the alcohol component may have a molar equivalent ratio of 1.1:1 or higher, preferably 1.2:1 or higher, more preferably 1.3:1 or higher.

When the temperature of mixture reached 180&#xb0; C., it was kept for a while until the distillation temperature was below 60&#xb0; C. The mixture was then cooled to below 100&#xb0; C. and then mixed with 488 g of n-butyl acetate (n-BA) with a solids content of about 68%. The obtained reactive donor A2 had the following properties: a weight average molecular weight of 5227 g/mol as measured by GPC referencing ASTM D5296, a molecular weight distribution of 3.2, a Tg of &#x2212;1.2&#xb0; C., a viscosity of less than 1000 mPa&#xb7;s@25&#xb0; C., &#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(The O)-moiety equivalent of 228 g/mol.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Reactive Acceptor</heading><p id="p-0140" num="0135"></p><p id="p-0141" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="315pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>various reactive acceptors</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="280pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Reactive</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Acceptors</entry><entry>Structure Formula</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>B1</entry><entry><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-C00005" he="19.13mm" wi="58.84mm" file="US20230002635A1-20230105-C00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="table" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>B2</entry><entry><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-C00006" he="21.76mm" wi="66.38mm" file="US20230002635A1-20230105-C00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="table" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>B3</entry><entry><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-C00007" he="26.67mm" wi="48.77mm" file="US20230002635A1-20230105-C00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="table" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>B4</entry><entry><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-C00008" he="44.20mm" wi="97.87mm" file="US20230002635A1-20230105-C00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="table" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0018" level="2">Catalyst</heading><p id="p-0142" num="0136">Catalysts C1: Strong base which is blocked with di-ethyl carbonate</p><p id="p-0143" num="0137">Catalysts C1: 30% aqueous solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride</p><heading id="h-0019" level="2">Coating Composition</heading><heading id="h-0020" level="1">Example 1 Michael Addition Curable Composition</heading><p id="p-0144" num="0138">The ingredients of Component A in the amounts shown in Table 2 and Table 3 below were mixed to form Component A, and then Component A, Component B and Component C were mixed in the amounts shown in Table 2 below, thereby forming coating compositions 1-16 suitable for forming Michael addition cured coatings.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0139">The compositions prepared in the examples shown in the following Tables 2 and 3 were respectively applied to the test substrate with a wet coating thickness of 100 microns, and cured at room temperature.

Michael addition-curable composition can be cured at room temperature. According to the specific experimental results, it can be seen that the type of branched polyester and the choice of catalyst have influence on the track-free time and hardness of the curing system. The combination of acetoacetate-type branched polyester and catalyst of a strong base which is blocked with di-ethyl carbonate (Examples 1-4) had a shorter tack-free time (about 1 hour), and established a proper hardness within 3 days. Furthermore, the malonate-type branched polyester A1, which was successfully synthesized by the applicant of the present application for the first time using a one-step process, is also suitable for formulating a Michael addition curable compositions with certain catalysts, such as a catalyst with a strong base which is blocked with di-ethyl carbonate, and the resulting coating likewise exhibit a proper cure speed and 3 days hardness.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="1">Example 2: Effect of Reactive Donors Combination on Properties of Coating Compositions</heading><p id="p-0149" num="0141">The ingredients of Component A in the amounts shown in Table 4 below were mixed to form Component A, and then Component A, Component B, and Component C were mixed in the amounts shown in Table 4 below to form Michael Addition-curable coating compositions 2-1 to 2-10.

In addition, it was surprising that the above-mentioned two branched polyesters of different structures are combined in a specific mass ratio, and the resulting coating composition can obtain a low-gloss coating film without adding an additional matting agent and even can achieve self-extinction, which was difficult to foresee prior to this application.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="1">Example 3: Gel Time of Coating Compositions</heading><p id="p-0152" num="0143">In this example, the gel time of primers and topcoats formed from the Michael curable compositions of the present application under different application solids content and different temperature conditions was investigated.
