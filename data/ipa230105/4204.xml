However, performance of a high density storage system, for example, a three-dimensional (<b>3</b>D) NAND storage system, is often restricted by the maximum amount of power (or peak current) that it can use. Currently, operations consuming high power (i.e., peak power operations) that are carried out by various memory dies of the NAND storage system can be staggered by a system controller. Only a limited number of peak power operations can be performed simultaneously. This approach can also result in increased system loading with unnecessary over-management. It is desirable to establish communications between different memory dies to coordinate the peak power operations. In the present disclosure, coordination between two or more memory dies can be arranged through a peak power management (PPM) circuit on each memory die, where the PPM contact pads of the PPM circuits can be held at the same electric potential. Peak power operations can be coordinated between two or more memory dies by regulating the electric potential of the PPM contact pads and by implementing a unique delay time period for each memory die.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One aspect of the present disclosure provides a method of peak power management (PPM) for multiple NAND memory dies.

In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the pull-down current I<sub>pull_dn </sub>can be the sum of the first current I<sub>up_1 </sub>and the second current I<sub>up_2</sub>. When the second pull-up driver <b>315</b> is switched on, the pull-down current I<sub>pull_dn </sub>is dominated by the second current I<sub>up_2 </sub>because the second current I<sub>up_2 </sub>flowing through the &#x201c;strong pull-up driver&#x201d; is much larger than the first current I<sub>up_1 </sub>flowing through the &#x201c;weak pull-up driver,&#x201d; as discussed previously.

In this example, when the pull-down driver <b>336</b> is switched on, the magnitude of the current flowing through the pull-down driver <b>336</b> from the node <b>322</b> to the ground (i.e., the pull-down current I<sub>pull_dn</sub>) depends on the second control signal <b>342</b>. When the pull-down driver <b>336</b> is an nFET, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the pull-down current I<sub>pull_dn </sub>can be determined by the voltage level of the second control signal <b>342</b> and the trans-conductance of the pull-down driver <b>336</b>. According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, a current profile I<sub>cc </sub>of a memory die (e.g., the NAND flash memory <b>100</b>-<b>1</b>) can correspond to the voltage level of the second control signal <b>342</b>, and thereby correspond to the pull-down current I<sub>pull_dn</sub>. Therefore, the pull-down current I<sub>pull_dn </sub>can function as a current mirror of the current profile I<sub>cc </sub>of the memory die.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, the pull-down current I<sub>pull_dn </sub>can be proportional to a current level of the current profile I<sub>cc</sub>.

For example, if the memory die is operating with 200 mA of current, the pull-down current I<sub>pull_dn </sub>of the PPM circuit <b>202</b> can be 200 &#x3bc;A. Therefore, memory operations and corresponding current can be regulated for each memory die through the pull-down current I<sub>pull_dn</sub>. Furthermore, through the die-to-die connections at the PPM contact pads, peak power operations in the PPM group <b>203</b> can be coordinated between two or more memory dies as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">For example, when the PPM circuit <b>202</b> is at a reset state, the second pull-up driver <b>315</b> can be switched off and no second current I<sub>up_2 </sub>flows through the node <b>322</b>. In the meantime, the first pull-up driver <b>314</b> can be kept on by default, and the pull-down driver <b>336</b> can be switched off. Accordingly, the electric potential V<sub>ppm </sub>at node <b>322</b> (or at PPM contact pad <b>204</b>) can be held at a first voltage level, higher than the reference voltage V<sub>ref</sub>, via a conductive path through the PPM resistor <b>318</b> and the first pull-up driver <b>314</b> to the first power source <b>312</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some embodiments, at the reset state, the pull-down driver <b>336</b> can also be kept on slightly or weakly (e.g., with low trans-conductance) such that the electrical potential of V<sub>ppm </sub>can be held close to the first voltage level, still higher than the reference voltage V<sub>ref</sub>. In this example, the pull-down current I<sub>pull_dn </sub>can be determined by the first current I<sub>up_1 </sub>in the absent of the second current I<sub>up_2</sub>.
