Even if underground cables, when compared to equivalent overhead lines, are more expensive, they allow ensuring uninterrupted power supply in sites less suitable for overhead systems due to, e.g., heavy winds and gales, failure of supporting structures, landscape appearance, etc. Therefore, in certain areas, the benefits of underground cables outweigh disadvantages of undergrounding. Among the various cable underground installation methods, tunnel installation is generally used in urban locations where direct bury installation would cause unacceptable disruption, or to cross physical obstacles such as rivers, lakes etc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In cable underground deposition processes, the cable is to be festooned along the deposition site, mainly to avoid kinking in case of thermal expansion and to significantly reduce all thermal-mechanic forces generated during the cable service. To this end, generally an excess length of cable is positioned on the support by slidable means, such as rollers, and the desired sagging is achieved by an operator pushing the cable into position. Such an operation can be, however, time-consuming and imprecise.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments discussed in this application provide a method for festooning a power cable in an unmanned, time-effective, safe and precise manner.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments describe a method wherein a cable is festooned during its deployment on the final site.

This is done merely for convenience and to give a general sense of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With reference to the attached Figures, the aim of the method according to the present disclosure is festooning a cable <b>1</b>, such as an underground HV cable, while deploying it in an intended deployment site including a fixed support, for example a rail <b>2</b> supporting at least one portion of the cable <b>1</b> itself. For example, a single length of cable can be installed from a starting point to an end point, wherein part of the cable length is in a tunnel, and the remaining part/s is/are outside of the tunnel. For example, the tunnel is under the ground level and the starting point and the end point are at the ground level. Possible methods and equipment for the installation of a power cable in a deployment site, wherein the cable is supported by a rail, are disclosed in the Italian patent applications of the Applicant nos. 102020000019975 and 102021000011645, which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The cable <b>1</b> is provided with a plurality of cable holders <b>3</b> slidable along the rail <b>2</b>. A possible method for applying said holders to the cable is disclosed in the above-mentioned Italian patent application no. 102021000011645. The holders <b>3</b> are at a predetermined distance on the cable <b>1</b>. The distance between two consecutive holders <b>3</b> (holder predetermined distance) is generally the same for all the couples of consecutive holders provided on the cable <b>1</b>. The holder predetermined distance is set to provide the sought cable sagging, as will be described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As per <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in an embodiment, each holder <b>3</b> comprises a clamp <b>5</b> optionally made of two parts which are releasably connectable one another so to lock a portion of cable <b>1</b>. For example, each clamp <b>5</b> comprises a first bracket <b>5</b>&#x2032; and a second bracket <b>5</b>&#x2033; joined by fasteners <b>5</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; around a portion of cable <b>1</b> in a releasable manner.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each holder <b>3</b> comprises a respective trolley <b>4</b>. The trolley <b>4</b> comprises bearings <b>4</b><i>b </i>and, optionally, a trolley bar <b>4</b><i>a. </i>Said trolley <b>4</b> is suitable to be positioned on and slide along the rail <b>2</b>. In an embodiment, the second bracket <b>5</b>&#x2033; is connected to a trolley <b>4</b> at a side opposite to that joining the first bracket <b>5</b>&#x2032;. In an embodiment, the second bracket <b>5</b>&#x2033; is directly connected to trolley bearings <b>4</b><i>b, </i>thus no trolley bar <b>4</b><i>a </i>is present.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In order to minimize the friction with the guiding rail <b>1</b>, bearings <b>4</b><i>b </i>have a low friction coefficient.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an embodiment, each holder <b>3</b> can be connectable to a pulling rope driven by a pulling device (both not shown). Once connected to the pulling rope, each holder <b>3</b> can be made to slide along the rail <b>2</b> thanks to the pulling force exerted by the pulling rope and can integrally carry the cable <b>1</b>. The connection among the pulling rope and at least one of the holders bearing the cable and the sliding of the holders engaged to the rail <b>2</b> allow moving the cable <b>1</b> longitudinally along the rail <b>2</b> to reach the final deployment position by dragging the pulling rope.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the present disclosure, the cable <b>1</b> is festooned during its longitudinal movement. To this aim, a festooning apparatus <b>7</b> is provided.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>-<b>5</b><i>b, </i>the festooning apparatus <b>7</b> is positioned after the start of the rail <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As it can be appreciated by the skilled persons, the position of the festooning apparatus <b>7</b> with respect to the rail <b>2</b> (i.e. festooning predetermined distance) shall be selected in view of the intended cable portion to be festooned (sagged) and of the location thereof. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>-<b>5</b><i>b, </i>where the deployment site comprises a tunnel and the cable portion intended to stay in the tunnel is to be festooned, the festooning apparatus <b>7</b> is positioned inside the tunnel and in the vicinity of its entrance.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>-<b>5</b><i>b, </i>the festooning apparatus <b>7</b> acts on subsequent portions of cable <b>1</b> comprised between two consecutive holders <b>3</b><sup>I </sup>and <b>3</b><sup>II </sup>longitudinally moving along the rail <b>2</b>, for example by means of respective trolleys <b>4</b><sup>I </sup>and <b>4</b><sup>II</sup>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The festooning apparatus <b>7</b> comprises a lowering device <b>8</b> movable transversally, in particular substantially parallel to the gravity acceleration, with respect to the advancing direction of the cable <b>1</b>, between a raised position and a lowered position. When the lowering device <b>8</b> is in the raised position, the cable <b>1</b> is disengaged by the lowering device <b>8</b>, whereas, when the lowering device <b>8</b> moves from the raised position to the lowered position, the cable <b>1</b> is engaged at a point which is accordingly moved downward. In an embodiment, the lowering device <b>8</b> acts as a pusher on the engaged cable <b>1</b> point, i.e. it pushes the latter downwards.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment, the lowering device <b>8</b> comprises one or more, for example a couple of, rollers <b>9</b> shaped to engage the cable <b>1</b> and, optionally, to roll thereon. A roller <b>9</b> can be, for example, positioned at a tip of an arm <b>10</b> of the lowering device <b>8</b> which can be lowered and raised, and the roller <b>9</b> accordingly, between the above-mentioned raised and lowered positions. The arm <b>10</b> can be powered by a hydraulic actuator, between the raised and the lowered positions along a frame <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an embodiment, the frame <b>11</b> of the festooning apparatus <b>7</b> can be movable for example along fixed guides <b>12</b> transversally positioned with respect to the cable <b>1</b> advancing direction, in particular perpendicularly positioned with respect to the cable <b>1</b> advancing direction and with respect to the lowering device <b>8</b> moving direction between the raised and the lowered positions. Due to the movement of the frame ii relative to the guides <b>12</b>, the lowering device <b>8</b> can additionally be moved between a first side position closer to the cable and a second side position far from the cable. In the first side position the lowering device <b>8</b>, if lowered, engages the cable <b>1</b>, whereas in the second side position the lowering device <b>8</b> cannot interact with the cable in any position between the raised and the lowered positions. The necessity of moving the frame <b>11</b> between the first and second side position can depend on the configuration of the lowering device <b>8</b>, and can be evaluated by the skilled person on a case by case basis.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Starting, by way of example, from a condition where the lowering device <b>8</b> is in the raised position and, optionally, in the second side position further from the cable <b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>), the cable <b>1</b> is advancing (from left to right in the figures, according to the depicted arrow a) supported by a plurality of holders <b>3</b> slidable along the rail <b>2</b> towards the festooning apparatus <b>7</b>. Particularly, in the Figures two consecutive holders <b>3</b><sup>I </sup>and <b>3</b><sup>II </sup>with respective trolleys <b>4</b><sup>I </sup>and <b>4</b><sup>II </sup>bearing the cable <b>1</b> are shown. Holder <b>3</b><sup>I </sup>is shown as the first holder bearing the cable <b>1</b>, but this is only for illustrative purposes. In the practice, holder <b>3</b><sup>I </sup>can be any holder bearing a portion of cable <b>1</b> intended to be sagged.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Once, due to the cable <b>1</b> advancing, each of two consecutive holders <b>3</b><sup>I </sup>and <b>3</b><sup>II </sup>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>) is at one side of the lowering device <b>8</b>, the frame <b>11</b> may move towards the first side position (closer to the cable i) if the circumstances so require, and the arm <b>10</b> is lowered towards the lowered position so that the rollers <b>9</b> (in the depicted case, a pair of rollers) can engage a point of the cable <b>1</b> between said two consecutive holders <b>3</b><sup>I </sup>and <b>3</b><sup>II</sup>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an embodiment, the above-mentioned movements of the lowering device <b>8</b> take place while the cable <b>1</b> is advancing, i.e. the cable <b>1</b> is never stopped in its advancing. Accordingly, these movements are started&#x2014;together or in subsequent moments&#x2014;when the first holder <b>3</b><sup>I </sup>just overpassed the festooning apparatus <b>7</b>, and the arm <b>10</b> reaches the lowered position when the lowering device <b>8</b> is halfway between the two consecutive holders <b>3</b><sup>I </sup>and <b>3</b><sup>II</sup>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an alternative embodiment, the cable <b>1</b> advancing is stopped when the festooning apparatus <b>7</b> is halfway the two consecutive holders <b>3</b><sup>I </sup>and <b>3</b><sup>II</sup>, and the arm <b>10</b> is lowered only once it is in this halfway position or close to the same. Similarly, the frame <b>11</b> movement towards the first side position, when needed, can take place only after the cable advancing is stopped, or, alternatively, it can be started shortly before the cable <b>1</b> is stopped, provided that the lowering device <b>8</b> is already in an intermediate position between the two consecutive holders <b>3</b><sup>I </sup>and <b>3</b><sup>II </sup>so that the lowering device <b>8</b> does not interfere with the first holder <b>3</b><sup>I</sup>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The rollers <b>9</b> can touch the cable <b>1</b> and start pushing it down at any point before the holder predetermined distance half (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>). During the lowering of the lowering device <b>8</b>, the distance (holder predetermined distance) between the two consecutive holders <b>3</b><sup>I </sup>and <b>3</b><sup>II</sup>, which can be kept freely slidable along the rail <b>1</b>, decreases due to the festooning of the cable <b>1</b> portion between them. Once the lowering device <b>8</b> and its roller/s <b>9</b> reaches/reach the lowered position at the holder predetermined distance half, the cable <b>1</b> reaches the sought sagged configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>) and the holder predetermined distance is shortened.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Then, the arm <b>10</b> is raised again towards the raised position to disengage the cable <b>1</b> and the frame <b>11</b>, when needed, may be moved towards the second side position further from the cable (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As said above, to make the cable <b>1</b> advancing, at least one holder <b>3</b> is be connected to a pulling rope (not illustrated). For example, a plurality of holders <b>3</b> mounted on the rail <b>2</b> and bearing the cable <b>1</b> are connected to a pulling rope, comprising one or more of the holders bearing a portion of cable <b>1</b> to be sagged. Once the sagging of the cable <b>1</b> portion between the holders <b>3</b><sup>I </sup>and <b>3</b><sup>II </sup>is obtained, such configuration should be maintained even in presence of the pulling force exerted by the pulling rope. To this end, the shortened holder predetermined distance between the holders <b>3</b><sup>I </sup>and <b>3</b><sup>II </sup>is fixed by a suitable spacer. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>, the spacer is a spacer <b>13</b> in form, for example, of a rod or a rope, which is connected to the holders <b>3</b><sup>I </sup>and <b>3</b><sup>II </sup>once the cable sagging is obtained. In a non-illustrated embodiment, the spacer can be the pulling rope itself, which is connected to the holder <b>3</b><sup>I </sup>and then, once the cable sagging is obtained, to the holder <b>3</b><sup>II </sup>as well. In this manner, even when the first holder <b>3</b><sup>I </sup>is pulled for moving the cable <b>1</b> along the advancing direction, the holder <b>3</b><sup>II </sup>is in turn pulled by the spacer <b>13</b> or by the pulling rope while being maintained at the same distance (the shortened holder predetermined distance) from the first holder <b>3</b><sup>I</sup>. Accordingly, the cable sagged configuration of the cable portion between the holders <b>3</b><sup>I </sup>and <b>3</b><sup>II </sup>is maintained.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the spacer <b>13</b> is in form of a rod, it can comprise a single rigid element, or, alternatively, a plurality of rigid elements consecutively linked, optionally hinged, together such that the maximum length of the linked rods corresponds to the desired distance between the two consecutive holders <b>3</b><sup>I </sup>and <b>3</b><sup>II </sup>in the sagged configuration.
