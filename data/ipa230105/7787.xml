For example, such materials may include a non-conductive material (e.g., the core) which may further comprise dielectric properties within the core, an adhesive layer, and a conductive metal such as copper. The lamination stack may then be laminated (i.e., heated and/or pressurized) to solidify a bond between the materials to create the structure of the PCB. The metal layer (e.g., copper) may be etched to create the conductive trace of the PCB.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the present invention, a lamination stack comprising a conductive-lubricant-metal structure, rather than just a metal layer (e.g., copper), is described to allow a PCB to have improved (high) frequency performance and/or improved heat management. The conductive-lubricant-metal structure may comprise such conductive-lubricant materials as one or more layers of graphene or one or more layers of hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN). The conductive-lubricant-metal structure is arranged on or around the core of the PCB. An adhesive layer may be used to attach the conductive-lubricant-metal structure to the core of the lamination stack at the pre-processing stage (pre-lamination) of the PCB. By adding a conductive-lubricant-metal structure to a lamination stack, where traditionally only a metal layer is placed on the lamination stack, the PCB is imbued with improved properties over a conventional PCB. For instance, the inclusion of graphene improves heat management because of its high heat conductivity properties, promotes higher electrical conductivity, low friction, and higher electron mobility, without having to make allowances for increased thickness on a PCB (graphene is extremely thin as a monolayer and additional layers). Similarly, the addition of h-BN promotes higher thermal conductivity and low friction, without having to make allowances for increased thickness on a PCB (h-BN, like graphene, is extremely thin as a monolayer or multiple layers).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a core <b>101</b> is provided as the non-conductive material of the lamination stack of the PCB.
