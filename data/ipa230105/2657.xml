This platform rejuvenation is severely limiting the size of the internal combustion engine (ICE) in hybrid, plug-in hybrid vehicles or possibly eliminating the ICE altogether in pure electric vehicles. Some vehicles still maintain an ICE and are noted as hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) or plug-in hybrids electric vehicle (PHEV) or mild hybrids electric vehicles (MHEV). Vehicles which are fully electric and have no ICE are denoted as full EVs. All HEV, PHEV, MHEV and EVs use at least one electric motors, where the electric motor provides some form of propulsion for the vehicles normally provided by the internal combustion engine (ICE) found in gasoline/diesel powered vehicles.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In electrified vehicles, the ICE is typically reduced in size (HEV, PHEV, or MHEV) or eliminated (EV) to reduce vehicle weight thereby increasing the electric drive-cycle. While the ICE's primary function is to provide vehicle propulsion, it also provides heat to the passenger cabin as its secondary function. Typically, heating is required when ambient conditions are 10&#xb0; C. or lower. In a non-electrified vehicle, there is excess heat from the ICE, which can be scavenged and used to heat the passenger cabin. It should be noted that while the ICE may take some time (several minutes) to heat up and generate heat, it functions well to temperatures of &#x2212;30&#xb0; C. Therefore, in electrified vehicles, ICE size reduction or elimination is creating a demand for effective heating of the passenger cabin using a heat pump type fluid, i.e., a heat transfer fluid or working fluid which is capable of being used in the heating, and/or in the cooling mode as the needs of the passenger cabin and battery management require heating and cooling.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Due to environmental pressures, the current automotive refrigerant, R-134a, a hydrofluorocarbon or HFC, is being phased out in favor of lower global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants with GWP&#x3c;150. While HFO-1234yf, a hydrofluoro-olefin, meets the low GWP requirement (GWP=4 per Pappadimitriou and GWP &#x3c;1 per AR5), it has lower refrigeration capacity and cannot fully meet the heating needs at low (&#x2212;10&#xb0; C.) to very low (&#x2212;30&#xb0; C.) ambient temperatures typically, without some type of system alteration or working fluid change. Examples of compositions comprising HFO-1234yf are disclosed in WO2007/126414; the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Similarly, the heating and cooling of stationary residential and commercial structures also suffers from a lack of suitable low GWP refrigerants to replace the older high GWP refrigerants currently in use.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need for low GWP heat pump type fluids to meet the ever-increasing needs of hybrid, mild hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles, electrified mass transport, and residential and commercial structures for thermal management which can provide cooling and heating.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention relates to compositions of environmentally friendly refrigerant blends with ultra-low GWP, (GWP less than or equal to 10 GWP) low toxicity (class A per ANSI/ASHRAE standard 34 or ISO standard 817)), and low flammability (class 2 or class 2L per ASHRAE 34 or ISO 817) with low temperature glide (less than 3K) or nearly negligible glide (less than 0.75K) for use in a hybrid, mild hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or full electric vehicles for thermal management (transferring heat from one part of the vehicle to the other) of the passenger compartment providing air conditioning (A/C) or heating to the passenger cabin. These refrigerants can also be used for mass transport mobile applications which benefit from heat pump type heating or cooling of passenger cabin areas. Mass transport mobile applications are not limited to, but can include transport vehicles such as ambulances, buses, shuttles, and trains.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Compositions of the present invention exhibit low temperature glide over the operating conditions of vehicle thermal management systems. In one aspect of the invention, the refrigerant compositions include mixtures of HFO-1234yf and fluoroethane exhibiting near-azeotropic behavior. In another aspect of the invention, the refrigerant compositions include mixtures of HFO-1234yf and fluoroethane exhibiting azeotropic-like behavior. Due to the manner in which automotive vehicles are repaired or serviced, the fluid must have low or negligible glide. Currently, during the vehicle A/C repair or service process, refrigerant is handled through specific automotive service machines which recover the refrigerant, recycle the refrigerant to some intermittent quality level removing gross contaminants and then recharge the refrigerant back into the vehicle after repairs or servicing have been completed. These machines are denoted as R/R/R machines since they recover, recycle, recharge refrigerant. It is this on-site recovery, recycle and recharge of refrigerant during vehicle maintenance or repair, that low glide is preferable and negligible glide most preferable to prevent composition shift. The current automotive service machines are not typically capable of handling refrigerant with high glide or glide. Since the refrigerant is handled &#x201c;on-site&#x201d; at a vehicle repair shop, there is no opportunity to reconstitute a blend refrigerant to the correct composition such as is done at a refrigerant recycler. Refrigerants with higher glide can sometimes require &#x201c;reconstitution&#x201d; to the original formulation otherwise there will be a loss in cycle performance. Therefore, there is a need for refrigerants which have low or no glide for automotive applications. Since a heat pump fluid would be handled in the same manner as the air-conditioning fluid, this requirement for low or no glide would also apply for a heat pump type fluid as it would be handled and/or serviced in the same manner as the traditional air-conditioning fluids.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">While HFO-1234yf can be used as an air-conditioning refrigerant, it may be limited in its ability to perform as a heat pump type fluid, i.e., capable of operating in cooling or heating modes or in a reversible cycle system. Therefore, the refrigerants noted herein uniquely provide improved capacity over HFO-1234yf in the heating operating range, and/or extend the lower heating range capability over HFO-1234yf to &#x2212;30&#xb0; C., have extremely low GWP and low to mild flammability, while also uniquely exhibiting low or nearly negligible temperature glide. Hence these refrigerants are most useful in electrified vehicle applications, particularly HEV, PHEV, MHEV, EV and mass transport vehicles which require these properties over the lower end heating range. It should also be noted that any heat pump type fluid also needs to perform well in the air-conditioning range, i.e., up to 40&#xb0; C., providing increased or equivalent capacity versus HFO-1234yf. Therefore, the refrigerant blends noted herein perform well over a range of temperatures, particularly from &#x2212;30&#xb0; C. up to +40&#xb0; C. and can provide heating or cooling depending upon which cycle they are being used in the heat pump system.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention includes the following aspects and embodiments:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0012">In one embodiment, disclosed herein are compositions useful as refrigerants and heat transfer fluids.

Example of a heat source in this embodiment is the vehicle passenger compartment requiring air conditioning.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0078">A heat sink is defined as any space, location, object or body capable of absorbing heat. Example of a heat sink in this embodiment is the vehicle passenger compartment requiring heating.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0079">A heat transfer system is the system (or apparatus) used to produce a heating or cooling effect in a particular location. A heat transfer system in this invention implies the reversible heating or cooling system which provides heating or cooling of the passenger cabin. Sometimes this system is called a heat pump system, reversible heating loop, or reversible cooling loop.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0080">A heat transfer fluid comprises at least one refrigerant and at least one member selected from the group consisting of lubricants, stabilizers and flame suppressants.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0081">Refrigeration capacity (also referred to as cooling capacity) is a term which defines the change in enthalpy of a refrigerant in an evaporator per pound of refrigerant circulated, or the heat removed by the refrigerant in the evaporator per unit volume of refrigerant vapor exiting the evaporator (volumetric capacity). The refrigeration capacity is a measure of the ability of a refrigerant or heat transfer composition to produce cooling or heating Therefore, the higher the capacity, the greater the cooling or heating that is produced. Cooling rate refers to the heat removed by the refrigerant in the evaporator per unit time. Heating rate refers to the heat removed by the refrigerant in the evaporator per unit time.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0082">Coefficient of performance (COP) is the amount of heat removed divided by the required energy input to operate the cycle. The higher the COP, the higher is the energy efficiency. COP is directly related to the energy efficiency ratio (EER) that is the efficiency rating for refrigeration or air conditioning equipment at a specific set of internal and external temperatures. Subcooling refers to the reduction of the temperature of a liquid below that liquid's saturation point for a given pressure. The liquid saturation point is the temperature at which the vapor is completely condensed to a liquid. Subcooling continues to cool the liquid to a lower temperature liquid at the given pressure. By cooling a liquid below the saturation temperature (or bubble point temperature), the net refrigeration capacity can be increased. Subcooling thereby improves refrigeration capacity and energy efficiency of a system. The subcool amount is the amount of cooling below the saturation temperature (in degrees).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0083">Superheating refers to the increase of the temperature of a vapor above that vapor's saturation point for a given pressure. The vapor saturation point is the temperature at which the liquid is completely evaporated to a vapor. Superheating continues to heat the vapor to a lower temperature liquid at the given pressure. By heating the vapor above the saturation temperature (or dew point temperature), the net refrigeration capacity can be increased. Superheating thereby improves refrigeration capacity and energy efficiency of a system. The superheat amount is the amount of heating above the saturation temperature (in degrees).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0084">Temperature glide (sometimes referred to simply as &#x201c;glide&#x201d;) is the absolute value of the difference between the starting and ending temperatures of a phase-change process by a refrigerant within a component of a refrigerant system, exclusive of any subcooling or superheating. This term may be used to describe condensation or evaporation of a near azeotrope or non-azeotropic composition. When referring to the temperature glide of an air conditioning or heat pump system, it is common to provide the average temperature glide being the average of the temperature glide in the evaporator and the temperature glide in the condenser. Glide is applicable to blend refrigerants, i.e. refrigerants that are composed of at least 2 components.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0085">Low glide here is defined as average glide which is less than 3K over operating range of interested, more preferably low glide is less than 2.5K over operating range of interest with most preferable being less than 0.75K over operating range of interest (e.g., a glide ranging from great than 0 to less than about 0.75K).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0086">By azeotropic composition is meant a constant-boiling mixture of two or more substances that behave as a single substance. One way to characterize an azeotropic composition is that the vapor produced by partial evaporation or distillation of the liquid has the same composition as the liquid from which it is evaporated or distilled, i.e., the mixture distills/refluxes without compositional change. Constant-boiling compositions are characterized as azeotropic because they exhibit either a maximum or minimum boiling point, as compared with that of the non-azeotropic mixture of the same compounds. An azeotropic composition will not fractionate within an air conditioning or heating system during operation. Additionally, an azeotropic composition will not fractionate upon leakage from an air conditioning or heating system.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0087">A near-azeotropic composition (also commonly referred to as an &#x201c;azeotrope-like composition&#x201d;) is a substantially constant boiling liquid admixture of two or more substances that behaves essentially as a single substance. One way to characterize a near-azeotropic composition is that the vapor produced by partial evaporation or distillation of the liquid has substantially the same composition as the liquid from which it was evaporated or distilled, that is, the admixture distills/refluxes without substantial composition change. Another way to characterize a near-azeotropic composition is that the bubble point vapor pressure and the dew point vapor pressure of the composition at a particular temperature are substantially the same. Herein, a composition is near-azeotropic if, after 50 weight percent of the composition is removed, such as by evaporation or boiling off, the difference in vapor pressure between the original composition and the composition remaining after 50 weight percent of the original composition has been removed is less than about 10 percent.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0088">Near-azeotropic compositions exhibit dew point pressure and bubble point pressure with virtually no pressure differential. That is, the difference in the dew point pressure and bubble point pressure at a given temperature will be a small value. It may be stated that compositions with a difference in dew point pressure and bubble point pressure of less than or equal to 3 percent (based upon the bubble point pressure) may be considered to be a near-azeotropic.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0089">It is also recognized that both the boiling point and the weight percentages of each component of the azeotropic or near-azeotropic liquid composition may change when the azeotropic or near-azeotropic liquid composition is subjected to boiling at different pressures. Thus, an azeotropic or a near-azeotropic composition may be defined in terms of the unique relationship that exists among the components or in terms of the compositional ranges of the components or in terms of exact weight percentages of each component of the composition characterized by a fixed boiling point at a specified pressure. It is also recognized in the art that various azeotropic compositions (including their boiling points at particular pressures) may be calculated (see, e.g., W. Schotte Ind. Eng. Chem. Process Des. Dev. (1980) 19, 432-439; the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference). Experimental identification of azeotropic compositions involving the same components may be used to confirm the accuracy of such calculations and/or to modify the calculations at the same or other temperatures and pressures.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0090">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;has,&#x201d; &#x201c;having&#x201d; or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion.

GWP can be calculated for different time horizons showing the effect of atmospheric lifetime for a given gas. The GWP for the 100-year time horizon is commonly the value referenced. For mixtures, a weighted average can be calculated based on the individual GWPs for each component. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control (IPCC) provides vetted values for refrigerant GWPs in official assessment reports (ARs.) The fourth assessment report is denoted as AR4 and the fifth assessment report is denoted as AR5. Regulating bodes are currently using AR4 for official legislating purposes.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0096">Ozone-depletion potential (ODP) is a number that refers to the amount of ozone depletion caused by a substance. The ODP is the ratio of the impact on ozone of a chemical compared to the impact of a similar mass of R-11 or fluorotrichloromethane. R-11 is a type of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and as such has chlorine in it which contributes to ozone depletion. Furthermore, the ODP of CFC-11 is defined to be 1.0. Other CFCs and hydrofluorochlorocarbons (HCFCs) have ODPs that range from 0.01 to 1.0. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and the hydrofluoro-olefins (HFO's) described herein have zero ODP because they do not contain chlorine, bromine or iodine, species known to contribute to ozone breakdown and depletion. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFC's) also do not have ODP as they by definition also do not contain chlorine, bromine or iodine.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0097">The refrigerant blend compositions comprise at least one hydrofluoro-olefin such as 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene (HFO-1234yf) and at least one hydrofluorocarbon such as fluoroethane (HFC-161). Suitable amounts of fluoroethane (HFC-161) in the refrigerant blend include, but are not limited to an amount between about 1 weight percent and 20 weight percent or between about 1 weight percent and 15 weight percent or between about 1 weight percent and 10 weight percent or between about 1 weight percent and 7.5 weight percent or between about 1 weight percent and 5 weight percent or between about 4 weight percent and 6 weight percent based on the total refrigerant composition.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0098">The unsaturated hydrofluoro-olefin (HFO) refrigerant components also have very low GWP, with all HFO components having GWP&#x3c;10.

At &#x2212;30&#xb0; C. ambient temperatures, HFO-1234yf does not perform well. The compressor inlet pressure is sub-atmospheric and air would be pulled into the compressor. Therefore, HFO-1234yf is limited for use as a heat pump fluid to &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. without some sort system design. However, even 5 wt % R-161 (fluoroethane) improves the performance of the resultant blend with HFO-1234yf (99 wt %)/ R-161 (1 wt %) being able to operate at temperatures down to &#x2212;30&#xb0; C. Therefore, the inventive blends of HFO-1234yf/R-161 extend the heating range by a delta of 10&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0157">Blends of HFO-1234yf with R-161 (fluoroethane) from 1 wt % to 10 wt % also provide an advantage over neat HFO-1234yf in terms of improved heating capacity.

Table 10 illustrates that a blend comprising greater than 0 to at least 10% R-161 has a BV of less than 10 cm/sec and a desirable LFL compared to neat R-161 (4.5-5.0 vol % compared to 3.4 vol %.)</p><p id="p-0176" num="0171">The flammability of 1234yf/161 blends in combination with a perfluoropolyether lubricant (Krytox&#xae; oil) was measured in accordance with ASTM E681. The results of the measurement are listed below in Table 11. These results illustrate that the presence of the tested lubricant oil does not significantly change the LFL of 1234yf/161 blends which is an unexpected and desirable improvement over other non-fluorinated lubricants. Generally, lubricants reduce the LFL of refrigerants (increasing the flammability of said blend.) However, in this case, the resultant blend did not decrease in flammability level. This implies that adding perfluoropolyether lubricants to a thermal management system (e.g., an automotive heat pump system), can take full advantage of the refrigerant/lubricant performance without negatively impacting flammability.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00014" num="00014"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0"

BV for the R-161/YF blends was measured using the vertical tube described in ISO 817:2014. ISO 817:2104 Annex C provides details regarding the BV method developed by Jabbour and Clodic (detailed description for this method can be found in both Jabbour, T., <i>Flammable refrigerant classification based on the burning velocity. </i>PhD Thesis, Ecole des Mines: Paris, France, 2004 and in Jabbour. T. and Clodic, D.F., <i>Burning velocity and refrigerant flammability classification. </i>ASHRAE Transactions 110(2), 2004.) In accordance with this BV method, the refrigerant blend is ignited at the base of a 1.3 m long vertical tube with internal diameter of 40 mm and outer diameter of 50 mm, manufactured bBODY y Schott glass. Flame propagation up the vertical tube was recorded using a Sony FDR-AX100 camera with 120 frames per second capability. Image processing software from Image Pro Insight version 8.0 was used to analyze the recorded flame front .

Leck noted that the R-161 molecule is chemically unusual because it easily decomposes to form HF and ethylene. Leck reported that sealed tube tests at 150&#xb0; C. found extensive formation of solids and gel, if any air was present. GC/MS analysis confirmed the presence of significant levels of ethylene after thermal aging. Leck, et al also noted that when either MO or POE lubricant was aged with HFC-161 extensive discoloration of the sample was observed. Visual analysis of the sealed 161/POE tubes found that the samples were dark brown to black indicating degradation of the refrigerant/lubricant system and possible &#x201c;coking&#x201d; of the lubricant portion of the sample. Leck also noted that there were very high TAN (total acid number) values in this study such that the titrator had difficulty identifying an end point even after samples were diluted, further indicating R-161 degradation.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0182">In contrast to previous reports regarding the thermal stability of R-161, this Example demonstrates unexpected and desirable results including that the 90%YF/ 10% 161 has improved thermal stability over the neat R-161 system. This is unexpected as the 1234yf has a double bond and it would be expected to degrade in this type of testing. Another unexpected result is that the inventive compositions (for example, 90% YF/10%161) and POE may be used without adding a lubricant stabilizer. Further, this Example demonstrates that there was no generation of flocs (particulates) or gelling of liquid in presence of POE lubricant with air and metal coupons. Further still, the fluoride ion level was very low (&#x3c;50 ppm for the 90%YF/ 10% 161/POE system and &#x3c;100ppm 90%YF/10% 161/POE/1.5 vol % air system) further indicating that the YF/161 system had unexpected stability compared to previous neat HFC-161 results</p><p id="p-0192" num="0183">While the invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention.
