It will be apparent, however, that the embodiments described by the present disclosure can be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Specific arrangements or orderings of schematic elements, such as those representing systems, devices, modules, instruction blocks, data elements, and/or the like are illustrated in the drawings for ease of description. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the specific ordering or arrangement of the schematic elements in the drawings is not meant to imply that a particular order or sequence of processing, or separation of processes, is required unless explicitly described as such. Further, the inclusion of a schematic element in a drawing is not meant to imply that such element is required in all embodiments or that the features represented by such element may not be included in or combined with other elements in some embodiments unless explicitly described as such.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, where connecting elements such as solid or dashed lines or arrows are used in the drawings to illustrate a connection, relationship, or association between or among two or more other schematic elements, the absence of any such connecting elements is not meant to imply that no connection, relationship, or association can exist. In other words, some connections, relationships, or associations between elements are not illustrated in the drawings so as not to obscure the disclosure. In addition, for ease of illustration, a single connecting element can be used to represent multiple connections, relationships or associations between elements. For example, where a connecting element represents communication of signals, data, or instructions (e.g., &#x201c;software instructions&#x201d;), it should be understood by those skilled in the art that such element can represent one or multiple signal paths (e.g., a bus), as may be needed, to affect the communication.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Although the terms first, second, third, and/or the like are used to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. The terms first, second, third, and/or the like are used only to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first contact could be termed a second contact and, similarly, a second contact could be termed a first contact without departing from the scope of the described embodiments. The first contact and the second contact are both contacts, but they are not the same contact.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The terminology used in the description of the various described embodiments herein is included for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used in the description of the various described embodiments and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well and can be used interchangeably with &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; or &#x201c;at least one,&#x201d; unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will also be understood that the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; as used herein refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.

For one unit (e.g., a device, a system, a component of a device or system, combinations thereof, and/or the like) to be in communication with another unit means that the one unit is able to directly or indirectly receive information from and/or send (e.g., transmit) information to the other unit. This may refer to a direct or indirect connection that is wired and/or wireless in nature. Additionally, two units may be in communication with each other even though the information transmitted may be modified, processed, relayed, and/or routed between the first and second unit. For example, a first unit may be in communication with a second unit even though the first unit passively receives information and does not actively transmit information to the second unit. As another example, a first unit may be in communication with a second unit if at least one intermediary unit (e.g., a third unit located between the first unit and the second unit) processes information received from the first unit and transmits the processed information to the second unit. In some embodiments, a message may refer to a network packet (e.g., a data packet and/or the like) that includes data.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As used herein, the term &#x201c;if&#x201d; is, optionally, construed to mean &#x201c;when&#x201d;, &#x201c;upon&#x201d;, &#x201c;in response to determining,&#x201d; &#x201c;in response to detecting,&#x201d; and/or the like, depending on the context. Similarly, the phrase &#x201c;if it is determined&#x201d; or &#x201c;if [a stated condition or event] is detected&#x201d; is, optionally, construed to mean &#x201c;upon determining,&#x201d; &#x201c;in response to determining,&#x201d; &#x201c;upon detecting [the stated condition or event],&#x201d; &#x201c;in response to detecting [the stated condition or event],&#x201d; and/or the like, depending on the context. Also, as used herein, the terms &#x201c;has&#x201d;, &#x201c;have&#x201d;, &#x201c;having&#x201d;, or the like are intended to be open-ended terms. Further, the phrase &#x201c;based on&#x201d; is intended to mean &#x201c;based at least partially on&#x201d; unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various described embodiments. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the various described embodiments can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, circuits, and networks have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the embodiments.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">General Overview</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some aspects and/or embodiments, systems, methods, and computer program products described herein include projected infrared (IR) emitters of radiation heating ring light on a lens and optical window surface. For example, an IR emitter transfers heat through electromagnetic radiation. A lens is used to converge the electromagnetic radiation output by the IR emitter. In an embodiment, the lens used to converge the electromagnetic radiation output by the IR emitter is a ring lens. In an embodiment, a ring wedge receives the converged electromagnetic radiation and redirects the electromagnetic radiation such that heating is achieved with the assembly (e.g., IR emitter, ring lens, ring wedge, or any combinations thereof) positioned outside the field of view (FOV) of the surface to be heated.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some aspects and/or embodiments, systems, methods, and computer program products described herein include control and operation of IR emitters that project electromagnetic radiation to heat a surface. A ring lens converges the electromagnetic radiation and projects the electromagnetic radiation onto a predetermined field coverage. In embodiments, a ring wedge receives the converged electromagnetic radiation and redirects the electromagnetic radiation. By redirecting the electromagnetic radiation, an assembly that includes at least one IR emitter, at least one ring light assembly, at least one ring lens, or any combinations thereof, are operable to heat a surface while being positioned outside a FOV of the surface to be heated.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">By virtue of the implementation of systems, methods, and computer program products described herein, the present techniques project 1.5 um wavelength and above IR radiation, which will not interfere with vision and NIR LiDAR systems as the wavelength is beyond what the lens and window coating could transmit. The present techniques enable non-contact heating all around a lens, a protective window, adjacent lens barrel surface, or any combinations thereof. Moreover, the present techniques have a lower cost and are more robust that conventional heaters. In some implementations, the present techniques enable mitigating frozen nozzles by applying heat as described herein.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, illustrated is example environment <b>100</b> in which vehicles that include autonomous systems, as well as vehicles that do not, are operated.

For example, the temperature is a temperature of the environment immediately adjacent to an optical lens, assembly of lenses, cover, protective window or other optical window surface. The optical window surface is associated with one or more sensors, such as a camera, LiDAR, or radar. In an example, the temperature is the ambient temperature of the environment (e.g., the overall temperature of the outdoor air surrounding the vehicle). In some embodiments, the temperature is captured by a temperature sensor of a sensor suite of an autonomous system, such as autonomous system <b>202</b><i>f </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the temperature is derived from sensor data captured by a sensor suite of the autonomous system, such as autonomous system <b>202</b><i>f </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

In some embodiments, if the temperature is below the predetermined threshold or falls outside of the predetermined range, a heating command is generated. In some examples, the predetermined threshold or predetermined range is defined by, at least in part, cold temperatures, temperatures below freezing, temperatures outside of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specifications, temperatures known to deteriorate device functionality, or any combinations thereof. For example, the predetermined threshold corresponds to temperature below which frozen fluid occurs on an optical window surface of a vehicle. In another example, the predetermined range corresponds to a range of temperatures outside of OEM specifications of a respective sensor.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The heating command <b>512</b> is transmitted to a heating system <b>508</b>. In examples, the heating system <b>508</b> causes the generation of radiation. For example, the heating system <b>508</b> includes an infrared (IR) assembly <b>510</b>. The IR assembly <b>510</b> includes at least one IR emitter, at least one ring light lens, at least one ring wedge, or any combinations thereof. The IR emitter powers on and generates radiation in response to the heating command. In some embodiments, the heating command <b>512</b> includes an instruction to power on the IR emitter for a predetermined length of time, a radiation intensity, and the like. In some examples, the IR emitter (e.g., IR emitter <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) of the IR assembly <b>510</b> emits near-infrared light. When the IR emitter is powered on, electromagnetic radiation causes contactless transfer of heat. In an example, the heat is transferred to a surface (e.g., optical window surface) that is a part of or associated with a component (e.g., a device, sensor, nozzle, or system as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>) of the vehicle <b>502</b>. By heating the surface, performance deterioration of the respective component in cold temperatures is reduced or eliminated.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an illustration of an infrared (IR) emitter <b>600</b>. For ease of description, the output of the IR emitter is referred to as energy or electromagnetic radiation. However, the output may also be referred to as a light beam, heat, or a general emission. In an embodiment, the IR emitter emits visible light. In an embodiment, the IR emitter does not emit visible light. The present techniques enable an internal IR emitter that produces electromagnetic radiation that heats another surface. In examples, an internal IR emitter produces radiation that travels across a relatively short distance. An external IR emitter produces radiation that travels across a greater distance when compared with internal IR emitters.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In an example, the IR emitter <b>600</b> is an IR light emitting diode (LED) ring light. The IR emitter <b>600</b> produces energy that is transferred to at least one surface. In some embodiments, the surface is an optical window surface associated with one or more components of a vehicle (e.g., vehicle <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The IR emitter <b>600</b> causes hearing of the surface without physical contact between the IR emitter and the surface. Additionally, the energy produced by the IR emitter <b>600</b> is transferred to the surface associated with the component without a medium to transfer the energy. For example, the IR emitter is operable to transfer energy in a vacuum or within an atmosphere without physical contact between the IR emitter and the surface that receives the energy.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In an embodiment, the IR emitter includes an infrared (IR) heating tube <b>602</b>. For example, the IR heating tube <b>602</b> is a quartz glass heating tube. In an embodiment, the IR heating tube <b>602</b> includes an IR transmitter. In embodiments, the IR transmitter is configured for carbon fiber, short wave, fast medium wave, standard medium wave, halogen short wave/near infrared emissions. A carbon fiber emitter configured for medium-wave infrared emissions yields a fast response speed. Moreover, the carbon fiber emitter configured for medium-wave infrared emissions enables a stable heater with a good product life cycle.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, the IR heating tube <b>602</b> is largely circular in shape. In embodiments, the shape of the IR heating tube corresponds to a shape of the surface to be heated or the shape of a portion of the surface to be heated. In examples, a generally circular lens (e.g., optical window surface) is heated by a generally circular IR heating tube. The shape of the IR heating tube <b>602</b> may be circular, oval, elliptical, rectangular, a generally polygonal shape, a generally circular shape, or any combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a coating <b>604</b> on the heating tube <b>602</b> reflects the infrared radiation and directs it towards the surface. For example, a temperature at or near the surface fails to satisfy a predetermined threshold or a predetermined range. A heating command is generated, and the IR emitter causes heating of the surface of the component to increase a temperature at or near the surface. In this example, the IR emitter is not in direct physical contact with the surface or component being heated. In some embodiments, the IR heating tube <b>602</b> is precisely matched with the surface. For example, the heating tube <b>602</b> shape is selected to correspond to a shape of the surface to be heated. The heating tube <b>602</b> is shaped to cause local area heating of an optical window surface. Precise heating that is directed toward a surface, locally, is enabled without directing heat to areas outside of the surface. For example, the faces, edges, angles, and curves of a surface/component receive energy, and all portions of the surface receive an accurate and precise amount of radiation to ensure even heating. The IR emitter <b>600</b> emits a large amount of energy in a short time period. For example, a fast response is 1 nanosecond from power on to emitting radiation corresponding to a predetermined heating temperature. A fast response is also 1 nanosecond from power off to the cessation of energy emission. Local area heating as described herein reduces power consumption when heating optical window surfaces and the corresponding components.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In an example, the heating tube <b>602</b> is shaped to heat a generally circular lens (e.g., optical window surface). Frozen fluid on lens surface during a cold season where temperatures reach below a freezing point can negatively affect cameras and LiDAR in AV systems. The freezing point may be, for example, the freezing point of anti-freeze solutions or fluid applied in an AV system. The freezing point may be, for example, the freezing point of water (0&#xb0; C.). Cold temperatures (including low temperatures above the freezing point) can render a fluid based cleaning system useless, even with increased alcohol concentration in the fluid. Generally, an integrated lens heating system within the lens is costly and inefficient.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition to selecting the heating tube <b>602</b> shape based on the optical window surface or component to be heated, the heating tube <b>602</b> is selected to generate an accurate and precise amount of radiation corresponding to a predetermined heating temperature or predetermined heating temperature range generated by the IR emitter <b>600</b>. The IR emitter has a fast response time that enables precise control of the output of energy. In examples, the surface to be heated is heated in a localized area, or the entire surface is heated. The length of heating time is precisely controlled as a result of the fast response time. The intensity of the heating is also precisely controlled. This ultimately results in less power consumption with fast heating when compared to other forms of heating.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In examples, the predetermined heating temperature is a temperature (or range) that corresponds to the electromagnetic radiation output by the IR emitter <b>600</b>. In an embodiment, the wavelength output by the IR emitter <b>600</b> is selected such that a majority of the radiation is absorbed by the surface to be heated. For example, short-wave radiation generally includes wavelengths in the range of 780 nanometers to 1.4 micrometers and can penetrate some solid materials to obtain uniform heating throughout the surface to be heated. Medium-wave radiation generally includes wavelengths between 1.4 and three micrometers and is largely absorbed by the surface of the component to be heated, wherein the surface is an outer layer, top layer, or layer of the surface closest to the IR emitter.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In examples, in temperatures below &#x2212;15&#xb0; C. frozen fluid accumulates on a surface of the component (e.g., sensors, nozzles). In some embodiments, the accumulation of frozen fluid triggers a cleaning system used for sensor cleaning, and the frozen fluid results in sensor performance degradation. The present techniques reduce frozen fluid on a surface by incorporating a light projecting ring lens on an internal IR emitting ring radiant heater to heat up surfaces of a component, such as a lens barrel, lens surface, protective window, or any combinations thereof. In an embodiment, the present techniques incorporate a light projecting ring lens on an internal IR emitting ring radiant heater to heat surfaces (such as physical AV components described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>) as described above. An optical ring lens, ring wedges, and any combinations thereof are used to converge and position the generated radiation (e.g., energy output by the IR emitter) on lenses, protective windows, lens barrel, and other surfaces to enable effective contactless heating to melt frozen fluid in cold freezing environment for an AV.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an illustration of components <b>710</b> and <b>730</b> with respective IR assemblies.

In examples, the IR emitters <b>712</b> and <b>718</b> are internal IR emitters that produce radiation that travels a relatively short distance. In examples, the IR emitters <b>712</b> and <b>718</b> are divergent, such that a width of radiation emitted from the emitters <b>712</b> and <b>718</b> increases in diameter as a distance from a respective IR emitter increases. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, radiation <b>713</b> output by the IR emitter <b>712</b> is divergent, and radiation <b>719</b> output by the IR emitter <b>718</b> is divergent.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">As illustrated, the radiation <b>713</b> is received by a ring lens <b>714</b>.

In examples, the ring lenses <b>714</b> and <b>720</b> cause parallel rays of radiation to converge when passing through each respective lens, such that the parallel rays of radiation meet at a point on the opposite side of the respective lens. By deploying ring lens with converging power to concentrate the radiation to a predetermined field coverage, an increased heating power density is generated using radiation from the IR emitters. The field coverage covers, for example, surfaces of the camera <b>702</b>A including the lens <b>704</b>A and a portion or all the lens barrel <b>705</b>A. In some embodiments, ring wedges <b>716</b> and <b>722</b> received converged radiation from the ring lenses <b>714</b> and <b>720</b>, respectively. Ring wedges <b>716</b> and <b>722</b> tilt or redirect the beams of radiation <b>726</b> and <b>728</b> to direct the radiation to a predetermined area (e.g., optical window surface). By tilting or redirecting the radiation <b>726</b> and <b>728</b> generated for heating, the IR emitters <b>712</b> and <b>718</b>, ring lenses <b>714</b> and <b>720</b>, and ring wedges <b>716</b> and <b>722</b> (or any combinations thereof) are positioned beyond a field of view (FOV) of the component.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the component <b>710</b> to be heated includes all or a portion of the fisheye camera <b>702</b>A, with FOV as illustrated by dashed lines <b>724</b>A and <b>724</b>B of greater than 180 degrees. The present techniques enable heating of the entire the lens <b>704</b>A and adjacent lens barrel <b>705</b>A by the IR emitters without placement of the heating system in the fisheye camera FOV. Accordingly, the IR emitters, ring lenses, and ring wedges do not intrude upon the FOV of the camera. Moreover, the IR emitters, ring lenses, and ring wedges are not integrated into the surface to be heated.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The component <b>730</b> is a fisheye camera <b>702</b>B including a lens (e.g., optical window surface) <b>704</b>B and a lens barrel <b>705</b>B.

In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, radiation <b>733</b> is transmitted to a ring lens <b>734</b>. The ring lens <b>734</b> converges the received radiation <b>733</b> into convergent radiation <b>736</b>. By deploying ring lens <b>734</b> with converging power to concentrate the radiation <b>733</b> to the convergent radiation <b>736</b>, an increased heating power density is generated using radiation from the IR emitters.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an illustration of IR assemblies heating a surface of a component.

In examples, the LiDAR is positioned in a housing that includes a lens or other optical window surface. In some embodiments, the LiDAR is included in a vehicle that is the same as or similar to the vehicle <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or the vehicle <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the LiDAR <b>810</b> has a corresponding field of view (FOV) <b>812</b>. In some examples, the FOV is 905 NM. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, IR assemblies <b>820</b>, <b>830</b>, <b>840</b>, and <b>850</b> are illustrated. In particular, IR emitters <b>802</b>A, <b>802</b>B, <b>802</b>C, and <b>802</b>D are illustrated. The IR emitters <b>802</b>A, <b>802</b>B, <b>802</b>C, and <b>802</b>D emit radiation to ring lenses <b>804</b>A, <b>804</b>B, <b>804</b>C, and <b>804</b>D. Ring wedges <b>806</b>A, <b>806</b>B, <b>806</b>C, and <b>806</b>D are used to direct the converged radiation <b>808</b> (e.g. field coverage) to surfaces of the LiDAR <b>810</b>.

For example, IR assemblies <b>820</b> and <b>830</b> are positioned on a same side of the LiDAR <b>810</b>, and the IR assemblies <b>840</b> and <b>850</b> are positioned on a same side of the LiDAR <b>810</b>. In some embodiments, the IR assemblies produce radiation with a wavelength of 1500 nm. In some embodiments, the wavelengths of radiation produced by the IS assemblies <b>820</b>, <b>830</b>, <b>840</b>, and <b>850</b> is longer than visible light. The IR assemblies transmit energy to the LiDAR <b>810</b> for uniform heating. As illustrated, the LiDAR surface is heated by the plurality of IR emitters, each with a corresponding ring lens that converges power to concentrate the radiation to a predetermined field coverage that includes surfaces of the LiDAR. The respective ring wedges tilt the radiation such that the IR assembly is outside the field of view (FOV) of the LiDAR.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some embodiments, field coverage describes an extent of an area where radiation is output by the IR assembly. Put another way, field coverage refers to the area to be heated. In some embodiments, the field coverage refers to converged radiation output by a respective IR assembly. In examples, the field coverage is a substantially circular area that corresponds to the surface area of a camera lens. In some examples, the field coverage corresponds to a portion of the surface to be heated.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, multiple IR assemblies transmit energy to the surface to be heated in concert, simultaneously outputting energy to heat the surface. In this example, the energy output by each IR emitter is configured independently according to known characteristics of the surface to be heated. Known characteristics of the surface include a temperature gradient or temperature differentials across the surface. Consider a scenario where a first portion of the surface to be heated is known to be cooler than a second portion of the surface when cold temperatures are observed. In examples, such a temperature differential is the result of other heat sources (e.g., other AV hardware) being closer to the second portion of the surface than they are to the first portion of the surface. The temperature differential may also be due to cooling situations being closer to the first portion of the surface when compared to the cooling situations proximity to the second portion of the surface. A cooling situation is, for example, when cold or freezing air is directed at or near the first portion of a lens while largely avoiding the second portion of the lens. In this scenario, an IR emitter of an assembly corresponding to the first portion of the surface outputs energy at a higher intensity when compared to the intensity of energy output by an IR emitter of an assembly corresponding to the second, warmer portion of the surface.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a process flow diagram of a process <b>900</b> that enables projecting infrared emissions for surface heating.
