In an embodiment, electromagnetic noise results from a fault of a propulsor or corresponding motor or inverter. Electromagnetic noise may further disrupt other flight systems, including without limitation flight controllers, actuators, flight components, and/or other propulsors or motors.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Aspects of the present disclosure can be used to detect a fault corresponding with electromagnetic noise. Aspects of the present disclosure can also be used to disconnect (from an electrical energy source) or otherwise disengage a flight component experiencing a detected fault. This is so, at least in part, because, in some case, noise monitoring circuit responsible for detecting a fault may be electrically connected to power lines supplying a faulty flight component and therefore able to detect not only a fault, but which flight component is experiencing the fault. Exemplary embodiments illustrating aspects of the present disclosure are described below in the context of several specific examples.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an exemplary embodiment of an electric propulsor fault detection system <b>100</b> is illustrated.

As used in this disclosure, &#x201c;electromagnetic noise&#x201d; is an electromagnetic and/or radiofrequency disturbance affecting an electric circuit. Electromagnetic noise may include electromagnetic interference and/or radiofrequency interference. Electromagnetic noise may originate from a source external to electric circuit; alternatively or additionally, electromagnetic noise may originate from one or more components within electrical circuit. In some cases, electromagnetic noise may include differential mode current. Alternatively or additionally, in some cases, electromagnetic noise may include common mode current. As used in this disclosure, &#x201c;common mode current&#x201d; is a flow of an electric charge having a path that include a common (e.g., ground). In some cases, a common mode current path may include capacitance (e.g., capacitor, air-gap between conductors, and the like) substantially upstream from common. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;differential mode current&#x201d; is a flow of an electrical charge having a flow path constituting that of an electrical circuit. For example, a differential mode current may include a flow of electrical charge having a flow path than includes a supply conductor and a return conductor of an electrical circuit.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, noise monitoring circuit <b>104</b> may include any computing device as described in this disclosure, including without limitation a microcontroller, microprocessor, digital signal processor (DSP) and/or system on a chip (SoC) as described in this disclosure.

An &#x201c;inverter,&#x201d; as used in this this disclosure, is a power electronic device or circuitry that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC). An inverter (also called a power inverter) may be entirely electronic or may include at least a mechanism (such as a rotary apparatus) and electronic circuitry. In some embodiments, static inverters may not use moving parts in conversion process. Inverters may not produce any power itself; rather, inverters may convert power produced by a DC power source. Inverters may often be used in electrical power applications where high currents and voltages are present; circuits that perform a similar function, as inverters, for electronic signals, having relatively low currents and potentials, may be referred to as oscillators. In some cases, circuits that perform opposite function to an inverter, converting AC to DC, may be referred to as rectifiers. Further description related to inverters and their use with electrical motors used on electric VTOL aircraft is disclosed within U.S. patent applications Ser. Nos. 17/144,304 and 17/197,427 entitled &#x201c;METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR A FRACTIONAL CONCENTRATED STATOR CONFIGURED FOR USE IN ELECTRIC AIRCRAFT MOTOR&#x201d; and &#x201c;SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR FLIGHT CONTROL IN ELECTRIC AIRCRAFT&#x201d; by C. Lin et al. T. Richter et al., respectively, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Inverter <b>112</b> may be configured to accept direct current and produce alternating current. As used in this disclosure, &#x201c;alternating current&#x201d; is a flow of electric charge that periodically reverses direction. In some cases, an alternating current may continuously change magnitude overtime; this is in contrast to what may be called a pulsed direct current. Alternatively or additionally, in some cases an alternating current may not continuously vary with time, but instead exhibit a less smooth temporal form. For example, exemplary non-limiting AC waveforms may include a square wave, a triangular wave (i.e., sawtooth), a modifier sine wave, a pulsed sine wave, a pulse width modulated wave, and/or a sine wave. In some cases, noise monitoring circuit may electrically connect to direct current which is provided to inverter <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, system <b>100</b> may include a motor <b>116</b>.
