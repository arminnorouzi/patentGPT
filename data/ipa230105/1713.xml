Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, various post-processing apparatuses performing post-processing on a medium on which recording is performed by ejected liquid have been used. Such a post-processing apparatus sequentially transports a plurality of media subjected to recording by ejected liquid, aligns tip ends of the individual media, and performs post-processing, such as a stapling process, on the media having aligned tip ends, for example. In general post-processing apparatuses, a medium being transported may skew. Therefore, JP-A-2018-188237, for example, discloses a post-processing apparatus having a width adjustment cursor capable of narrowing a transport path for media in a width direction intersecting with a medium transport direction by sandwiching the media in the width direction so as to suppress skew of the media.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, even when the post-processing apparatus has a component that narrows a transport path for media in the width direction, such as the width adjustment cursor of the post-processing apparatus according to JP-A-2018-188237, the skew of a medium in the post-processing apparatus may not be appropriately suppressed. Specifically, depending on a timing of a movement of the component, an amount of movement, or a movement method, a corner of a skewed medium being transported is damaged since the corner hits the component or a medium is not properly adjusted since the corner slips into a lower side of stacked media, for example.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a post-processing apparatus that performs post-processing on a medium recorded by a recording section includes a stacking section that stacks the medium to be subjected to the post-processing, a first transport section that is brought into contact with the medium and applies transport force to the medium so as to transport the medium in a transport direction, a tip end alignment section that aligns a tip end of the medium in a downstream of the transport direction, the medium being stacked on the stacking section, a side edge alignment section that is configured to move in a width direction orthogonal to the transport direction of the medium and that aligns the medium by abutting on side edges of the medium from opposite sides in the width direction, and a controller that controls a position of the side edge alignment section. The side edge alignment section is configured to move to a first position where the side edge alignment section abuts on the side edges from the opposite sides in the width direction, a second position, that is farther from the side edges in the width direction than the first position, where the medium is stacked on the stacking section, and a third position, that is between the first position and the second position in the width direction, where the side edge alignment section is in contact with the medium when the first transport section transports the medium in a skewed manner. The controller is configured to execute an adjustment operation of moving the side edge alignment section from the second position to the third position and an alignment operation of aligning the medium by causing the side edge alignment section to abut on the medium in the first position.

The post-processing apparatus includes a stacking section that stacks the medium to be subjected to the post-processing, a first transport section that is brought into contact with the medium and applies transport force to the medium so as to transport the medium in a transport direction, a tip end alignment section that aligns a tip end of the medium in a downstream of the transport direction, the medium being stacked on the stacking section, a side edge alignment section that is configured to move in a width direction orthogonal to the transport direction of the medium and that aligns the medium by abutting on side edges of the medium from opposite sides in the width direction, and a controller that controls a position of the side edge alignment section. The side edge alignment section is configured to move to a first position where the side edge alignment section abuts on the side edges from the opposite sides in the width direction, a second position, that is farther from the side edges in the width direction than the first position, where the medium is stacked on the stacking section, and a third position, that is between the first position and the second position in the width direction, where the side edge alignment section is in contact with the medium when the first transport section transports the medium in a skewed manner. The controller is configured to execute an adjustment operation of moving the side edge alignment section from the second position to the third position and an alignment operation of aligning the medium by causing the side edge alignment section to abut on the medium in the first position. The adjustment operation is executed while the first transport section transports the medium and the alignment operation is executed after the adjustment operation is performed and after the medium reaches the tip end alignment section.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to this aspect in addition to the alignment operation performed after the tip end of the medium reaches the tip end alignment section, the adjustment operation of moving the side edge alignment section from the second position to the third position is executed before the alignment operation while the medium is transported. Specifically, the process of suppressing skew of the medium is performed in a step-by-step manner. In this way, since the operation of suppressing skew of the medium is executed in a step-by-step manner, it is less likely that the corners of the medium transported in a skewed manner are damaged due to contact between the corners and the side edge alignment section and that the medium is not appropriately aligned since the corners slip into a lower side of the stacked media. Accordingly, the skew of the medium may be effectively reduced in the post-processing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a second aspect, in the post-processing apparatus of the first aspect, the side edge alignment section extends in the transport direction, and the controller executes the adjustment operation after the tip end passes, in the entire width direction, side edges of the side edge alignment section in a downstream of the transport direction.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to this aspect, since the side edge alignment section extends in the transport direction, the skew suppressing operation can be effectively executed for a long distance. Furthermore, the adjustment operation is executed after the tip end passes the downstream edge sections of the side edge alignment section in the transport direction in the entire width direction. Specifically, since the adjustment operation is executed after the corners of the tip end of the medium pass the side edge alignment section, crash of the corners of the tip end of the medium against the side edge alignment section can be suppressed and damage of the corners can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a third aspect, in the post-processing apparatus of the first or second aspect, the side edge alignment section is configured to move to a fourth position between the second position and the third position in the width direction, and the controller moves the side edge alignment section to the fourth position after the alignment operation so as to execute the alignment operation again.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to this aspect, since the alignment operation is performed again after the alignment operation is executed, skew of the medium in the post-processing apparatus may be effectively suppressed. Furthermore, since an amount of movement of the side edge alignment section in the width direction at the time of the alignment operation executed again is larger than that at the time of the preceding alignment operation, in particular, skew of the medium in the post-processing apparatus can be effectively suppressed.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a fourth aspect, the post-processing apparatus of any one of the first to third aspects further includes a second transport section that is disposed in a downstream of the first transport section in the transport direction and that is brought into contact with the medium and applies transport force to the medium so as to transport the medium in the transport direction. The controller executes the adjustment operation before the medium is brought into contact with the second transport section.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to this aspect, the adjustment operation is executed before the medium is brought into contact with the second transport section. When the adjustment operation is executed in a state in which the medium is in contact with the second transport section, the adjustment operation may not be appropriately performed due to friction force between the medium and the second transport section or the like. However, such possibility may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to a fifth aspect, the post-processing apparatus of any one of the first to third aspects further includes a second transport section that is disposed in a downstream of the first transport section in the transport direction and that is brought into contact with the medium and applies transport force to the medium so as to transport the medium in the transport direction. The second transport section is located in a position facing the medium and is moved between a contact position where the second transport section is in contact with the medium and a separation position where the second transport section is separated from the medium, and the controller executes the adjustment operation when the second transport section is in the separation position.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to this aspect, the adjustment operation is executed when the second transport section is in the separation position. When the adjustment operation is executed in a state in which the medium is in contact with the second transport section, the adjustment operation may not be appropriately performed due to friction force between the medium and the second transport section or the like. However, such possibility may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a sixth aspect, in the post-processing apparatus of any one of the first to fifth aspects, the first transport section is located in a position facing the medium and is moved between a contact position where the first transport section is in contact with the medium and a separation position where the first transport section is separated from the medium, and the controller executes the adjustment operation when the first transport section is in the separation position.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to this aspect, the adjustment operation is executed when the first transport section is in the separation position. When the adjustment operation is executed in a state in which the medium is in contact with the first transport section, the adjustment operation may not be appropriately performed due to friction force between the medium and the first transport section or the like. However, such possibility may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to a seventh aspect, the post-processing apparatus of any one of the first to sixth aspects further includes an estimation section that estimates an amount of skew of the medium. When the amount of skew estimated by the estimation section is not larger than a first threshold value, the controller executes the alignment operation without executing the adjustment operation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to this aspect, when the skew amount estimated by the estimation section is not larger than the first threshold value, the alignment operation is executed without executing the adjustment operation. When the skew amount is small, the alignment operation may be effectively performed without executing the adjustment operation, and therefore, control performed when the alignment operation is effectively performed but the adjustment operation is not executed can be simplified.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to an eighth aspect, in the post-processing apparatus disclosed in the seventh aspect, the recording section performs recording on the medium by ejecting liquid, the estimation section estimates the amount of skew using an ejection rate of the liquid per unit area of the medium, one of regions divided by a center of the medium in the width direction is determined as a first region, the other of the regions is determined as a second region, the ejection rate in the first region is determined as a first ejection rate, and the ejection rate in the second region is determined as a second ejection rate, and the controller executes the adjustment operation when a difference rate that is a difference between the first ejection rate and the second ejection rate is not less than a second threshold value.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to this aspect, the adjustment operation is executed when the difference rate is equal to or larger than the second threshold value. As the difference rate becomes large, a difference between a friction coefficient of the medium and the first transport section in the first region and a friction coefficient of the medium and the second transport section in the second region becomes large, and therefore, skew is likely to occur. However, since the adjustment operation is executed in such a case, the skew of the medium in the post-processing apparatus may be effectively suppressed.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to a ninth aspect, in the post-processing apparatus of any one of the first to sixth aspects, the controller executes the alignment operation after executing the adjustment operation when a stacked medium exists under the medium being transported by the first transport section, and executes the alignment operation without executing the adjustment operation when the stacked medium does not exist under the medium being transported by the first transport section.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to this aspect, the alignment operation is executed after the adjustment operation is executed when a stacked medium exists under the medium being transported by the first transport section, and the alignment operation is executed without executing the adjustment operation when the stacked medium does not exist under the medium being transported by the first transport section. When a stacked medium exists, skew is likely to occur when compared with a case where a stacked medium does not exist. However, when the adjustment operation is executed when a stacked medium exists, skew of the medium in the post-processing apparatus may be effectively reduced.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to a tenth aspect, the post-processing apparatus of any one of the first to ninth aspects further includes a low-friction member in such a position, in a transport region of the medium transported by the first transport section, that the low-friction member is in contact with a lower surface of the medium.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to this aspect, a low-friction member is provided in such a position, in a transport region of the medium transported by the first transport section, that the low-friction member is in contact with a lower surface of the medium. Therefore, the medium is easily moved in the transport region of the medium, and accordingly, the transport direction of the medium may be effectively corrected and the skew of the medium may be effectively suppressed.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to an eleventh aspect, in the post-processing apparatus of any one of the first to tenth aspects, the controller realizes a lower movement speed of the side edge alignment section at a time of the alignment operation than a movement speed of the side edge alignment section at the time of the adjustment operation.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to this aspect a lower movement speed of the side edge alignment section at the time of the alignment operation than a movement speed of the side edge alignment section at the time of the adjustment operation is realized. Specifically, the adjustment operation that requires lower accuracy is executed at high speed, and therefore, reduction of a transport speed of the medium is not required and degradation of throughput is suppressed, whereas the alignment operation that requires high accuracy is reliably executed at low speed, and therefore, the skew of the medium is effectively suppressed.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Hereinafter, an embodiment will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In an X-Y-Z coordinate system in each of the drawings, an X axis extends in a horizontal direction and indicates a width direction, a Y axis extends in the horizontal direction and indicates a direction orthogonal to the X axis, and a Z axis indicates a vertical direction.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Outline of Recording System</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A recording system <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a recording unit <b>2</b>, an intermediate unit <b>3</b>, and a processing unit <b>4</b> serving as a post-processing apparatus that are arranged in this order from right to left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for example.

The controller <b>60</b> performs the re-alignment operation by moving the side edge alignment section <b>45</b> to the fourth position L<b>4</b> in step S<b>170</b> after the alignment operation in step S<b>150</b> and moving the side edge alignment section <b>45</b> to the first position L<b>1</b> in step S<b>180</b>. Since the alignment operation is performed again in step S<b>180</b> after the alignment operation is executed in step S<b>150</b>, skew of the medium P in the post-processing apparatus may be effectively suppressed. Furthermore, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the fourth position L<b>4</b> is located farther from the side edge E<b>2</b> of the medium P than the third position L<b>3</b>. Specifically, a movement amount of the side edge alignment section <b>45</b> in the width direction is larger than that when the alignment operation performed before the re-alignment operation is performed. In this way, since the movement amount of the side edge alignment section <b>45</b> is large, deformation of the medium P due to pressure of the side edge alignment section <b>45</b> may be released. Since the side edge alignment section <b>45</b> executes the re-alignment operation, the undeformed medium P may be aligned and alignment accuracy may be improved. The operation described above may attain separation of a function of suppressing the skew of the medium P and suppressing advancing of the skew of the medium P in the alignment operation performed for the first time from a function of reliably aligning the medium P in the alignment operation performed for the second time.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As described above, the processing unit <b>4</b> of this embodiment includes the downstream paddles <b>44</b> that are disposed in the downstream of the upstream paddles <b>40</b> in the transport direction A<b>2</b>, that apply transport force to the medium P by being into contact with the medium P, and that serve as a second transport section that transports the medium P in the transport direction A<b>2</b>. Then the controller <b>60</b> executes the adjustment operation before the medium P is brought into contact with the downstream paddles <b>44</b>. When the adjustment operation is executed in a state in which the medium P is in contact with the downstream paddles <b>44</b>, the adjustment operation may not be appropriately performed due to friction force between the medium P and the downstream paddles <b>44</b> or the like. However, the processing unit <b>4</b> of this embodiment may reduce such possibility. Note that, although the second transport section in the processing unit <b>4</b> of this embodiment is the paddles having the plurality of plate-like bodies attached along the outer circumference of the rotation shaft with an interval, the configuration is not limited to this and the second transfer section may be rollers, for example.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In other words, the downstream paddles <b>44</b> of this embodiment have the plurality of plate-like bodies attached along the outer circumference of the rotation shaft with the certain interval. Therefore, when the downstream paddles <b>44</b> rotate along the rotation shaft, postures of the plate-like bodies of the downstream paddles <b>44</b> relative to the medium P are changed. The change in the postures causes change in positions where the plate-like bodies are in contact with the medium P and separation positions where the plate-like bodies are separated from the medium P. In other words, the downstream paddles <b>44</b> may be moved between separation positions for separation from the medium P and contact positions for contact with the medium P. Here, the controller <b>60</b> executes the adjustment operation when the downstream paddles <b>44</b> are in the separation positions. In this way, the processing unit <b>4</b> of this embodiment executes the adjustment operation when the downstream paddles <b>44</b> are in the separation positions. When the adjustment operation is executed in a state in which the medium P is in contact with the downstream paddles <b>44</b>, the adjustment operation may not be appropriately performed due to friction force between the medium P and the downstream paddles <b>44</b> or the like. However, the processing unit <b>4</b> of this embodiment may reduce such possibility. Furthermore, as for the change between the separation positions and the contact positions of the downstream paddles <b>44</b>, the separation positions and the contact positions may be switched from one to another when the downstream paddles <b>44</b> move in a vertical direction. Note that, when the second transport section is rollers, for example, positions of the rollers facing the medium P may be changed between contact positions where the rollers are in contact with the medium P and separation positions where the rollers are separated from the medium P.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Furthermore, as with the downstream paddles <b>44</b>, in the processing unit <b>4</b> of this embodiment, positions of the upstream paddles <b>40</b>, serving as the first transport section, facing the medium P may be changed between contact positions where the upstream paddles <b>40</b> are in contact with the medium P and separation positions where the upstream paddles <b>40</b> are separated from the medium P. Then the controller <b>60</b> executes the adjustment operation when the upstream paddles <b>40</b> are in the separation positions. When the adjustment operation is executed in a state in which the medium P is in contact with the upstream paddles <b>40</b>, the adjustment operation may not be appropriately performed due to friction force between the medium P and the upstream paddles <b>40</b> or the like. However, the processing unit <b>4</b> of this embodiment may reduce such possibility. Furthermore, as for the change between the separation positions and the contact positions of the upstream paddles <b>40</b>, the separation positions and the contact positions may be switched from one to another when the upstream paddles <b>40</b> move in a vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Furthermore, as with the downstream paddles <b>44</b>, although the upstream paddles <b>40</b> serving as the first transport section in the processing unit <b>4</b> of this embodiment are attached along an outer circumference of an rotation shaft with an interval, the configuration is not limited to this and the first transfer section may be rollers, for example. Furthermore, when the first transport section is rollers, for example, positions of the rollers facing the medium P may be changed between contact positions where the rollers are in contact with the medium P and separation positions where the rollers are separated from the medium P.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Furthermore, the controller <b>60</b> is electrically coupled to the controller <b>15</b> of the recording unit <b>2</b> and serves as an estimation section that estimates an amount of skew of the medium P using recorded data input to the controller <b>15</b>. Then, when the skew amount estimated by the controller <b>60</b> is equal to or smaller than a first threshold value, the controller <b>60</b> may execute the alignment operation in step S<b>150</b> without executing the adjustment operation in step S<b>140</b>. When the skew amount is small, the alignment operation may be effectively performed without executing the adjustment operation, and therefore, the processing unit <b>4</b> of this embodiment may simplify control performed when the alignment operation is effectively performed but the adjustment operation is not executed. Note that, although the controller <b>60</b> also serves as the estimation section in this embodiment, the configuration is not limited to this and an estimation section may be provided separately from the controller <b>60</b>. Furthermore, a camera capable of reading ink ejected to the medium P may be provided to estimate a skew amount using image data obtained by the camera.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The controller <b>60</b> may estimate a skew amount of the medium P using an ejection rate of ink, that is, liquid, per unit area of the medium P. Then, assuming that, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, one of regions divided at a center in the width direction of the medium P is determined as a first region S<b>1</b>, the other region is determined as a second region S<b>2</b>, an ejection rate in the first region S<b>1</b> is determined as a first ejection rate, and an ejection rate in the second region S<b>2</b> is determined as a second ejection rate, the controller <b>60</b> may perform control such that the adjustment operation is executed when a difference rate that is a difference between the first ejection rate and the second ejection rate is equal to or larger than a second threshold value. As the difference rate becomes large, a difference between a friction coefficient of the medium P and the upstream paddles <b>40</b> in the first region S<b>1</b> and a friction coefficient of the medium P and the upstream paddles <b>40</b> in the second region S<b>2</b> becomes large, and therefore, skew is likely to occur. However, since the adjustment operation is executed in such a case, the skew of the medium P in the post-processing apparatus may be effectively suppressed. The ejection rate here may be an ejection rate on a front surface of the medium P or an ejection rate on a back surface of the medium P. Furthermore, examples of the ejection rate include a rate of the number of dots of ink actually ejected to a largest number of dots of ink possibly ejected.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Furthermore, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the controller <b>60</b> may execute the alignment operation after executing the adjustment operation when the stacked media Ps exist under the medium P being transported by the upstream paddles <b>40</b>, and execute the alignment operation without executing the adjustment operation when the stacked media Ps do not exist under the medium P being transported by the upstream paddles <b>40</b>. When the stacked media Ps exist, it is likely that skew occurs when compared with a case where the stacked media Ps do not exist. This is particularly significant when an ink jet printer is employed. When an ink jet printer is employed, a friction coefficient on a surface is increased since a medium absorbs ink. Therefore, friction between the medium P and the stacked media Ps varies according to print patterns of the medium P and an uppermost medium Psi in the stacked media Ps, and therefore, a load at a time of transport varies. When the transport load is changed in the width direction, the medium P is likely to skew at the time of transport. Therefore, the skew of the medium P may be effectively suppressed by executing the adjustment operation when the stacked media Ps exist.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Furthermore, the controller <b>60</b> realizes a lower movement speed of the side edge alignment section <b>45</b> at the time of the alignment operation than a movement speed of the side edge alignment section <b>45</b> at the time of the adjustment operation. Specifically, the adjustment operation that requires lower accuracy is executed at high speed, and therefore, reduction of a transport speed of the medium P is not required and degradation of throughput is suppressed, whereas the alignment operation that requires high accuracy is reliably executed at low speed, and therefore, the skew of the medium P is effectively suppressed. However, the control is not limited to this.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Note that, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the processing unit <b>4</b> of this embodiment includes low friction members <b>50</b> in positions in contact with a lower surface of the medium P in a transport region of the medium P transported by the upstream paddles <b>40</b>. Therefore, in the processing unit <b>4</b> of this embodiment, the medium P is easily moved in the transport region of the medium P, and accordingly, the transport direction of the medium P may be effectively corrected and the skew of the medium P may be effectively suppressed. In the processing unit <b>4</b> of this embodiment, the low friction members <b>50</b> are disposed in opposite end portions in the width direction and includes a low friction member <b>50</b><i>a </i>on the +X side and a low friction member <b>50</b><i>b </i>on the &#x2212;X side.

Moreover, as the recording unit <b>2</b>, instead of an ink jet printer that performs recording by ejecting ink, a laser printer that performs recording by fusing toner may be used. When the laser printer is used as the recording unit <b>2</b>, the recording section corresponds to a portion associated with printing, such as a photoconductive drum.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Furthermore, the present disclosure is not limited to the embodiment above, and various modifications may be made within the scope of the present disclosure described in claims and are also included in the scope of the present disclosure.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
