The flux dotting process may be performed on a substrate strip <b>10</b> to which the plurality of substrate units <b>10</b>U are integrally connected. A plurality of pads <b>12</b>P are formed on the plurality of substrate units <b>10</b>U, and the flux dotting tool <b>100</b> may include a plurality of flux pins <b>120</b> corresponding to the plurality of pads <b>12</b>P. The flux dotting tool <b>100</b> may be attached to a separate transport member, for example, a mount block <b>20</b> to move on the substrate strip <b>10</b> to perform a flux dotting process. The mount block <b>20</b> may immerse the plurality of flux pins <b>120</b> in a flux plate (not illustrated) filled with liquid flux to aggregate the flux FL at the ends of each of the plurality of flux pins <b>120</b>. Subsequently, the mount block <b>20</b> moved to the substrate unit <b>10</b>U may seat the flux FL held by the plurality of flux pins <b>120</b> on each of the plurality of pads <b>12</b>P. In this process, the plurality of flux pins <b>120</b> may contact the plurality of pads <b>12</b>P, and the plurality of flux pins <b>120</b> may elastically move in a vertical direction by an elastic structure <b>130</b>. After the flux dotting process is completed, a solder ball attach (SBA) process for attaching solder balls to the flux FL and pads <b>12</b>P of the substrate unit <b>10</b>U may be continuously performed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the flux dotting tool <b>100</b> according to an example embodiment may include a housing <b>110</b> and a plurality of flux pins <b>120</b>.

In an example embodiment, a flux wetting region of the plurality of flux pins <b>120</b> may be limited by introducing a flux blocking structure <b>126</b> to lower portions of the plurality of flux pins <b>120</b>. For example, the flux dipped on the ends of the plurality of flux pins <b>120</b> may be prevented from climbing to the top of the plurality of flux pins <b>120</b> beyond the flux blocking structure <b>126</b>. Therefore, according to an example embodiment, there may be provided a flux dotting tool in which the amount of applied flux is maintained at a constant level even when the flux dotting process is continued for a long time. In this case, &#x201c;flux&#x201d; refers to any material for preventing the solder balls from dissolving and/or flowing onto the substrate and from being oxidized in the reflow process, and the &#x201c;flux&#x201d; in this specification is not particularly limited.

The plurality of through-holes <b>110</b>H may extend from the internal space <b>110</b>R to an external of the housing <b>110</b> to guide the movement of the plurality of flux pins <b>120</b>. The plurality of through-holes <b>110</b>H may be provided with a pitch and number corresponding to the pads <b>12</b>P of the substrate on which the solder balls are to be bumped. Accordingly, the plurality of through-holes <b>110</b>H and the plurality of flux pins <b>120</b> corresponding thereto may be provided in the same number as the number of pads on which the solder ball is to be formed. For example, the plurality of through-holes <b>110</b>H may include a larger number of through-holes than is illustrated in the drawings. The housing <b>110</b> is not particularly limited in shape and material. For example, the shape of the housing <b>110</b> is not limited to that illustrated in the drawings, and the housing <b>110</b> may have a form in which a plurality of parts are assembled.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The plurality of flux pins <b>120</b> are disposed in the internal space <b>110</b>R of the housing <b>110</b>, and extend in the first direction (Z-axis direction) to be exposed externally of the housing <b>110</b> through the plurality of through-holes <b>110</b>H.

The insulating layer <b>11</b> may include an insulating resin, and the wiring layer <b>12</b> may include a conductive material patterned on the insulating layer <b>11</b>. The wiring layer <b>12</b> may include pads <b>12</b>P exposed through the openings <b>13</b>H of the solder resist layer <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">According to an example embodiment of the present disclosure, each of the flux pins <b>120</b> include a flux blocking structure <b>126</b> limiting the wetting region (or dipping region) DR of the flux FL, and the flux FL applied to the flux pins <b>120</b> may be aggregated in a spherical or hemispherical shape within the wetting region DR. In the flux FL dotting process, since the flux FL does not rise beyond the flux blocking structure <b>126</b>, a sufficient amount of the flux FL may be seated on the pads <b>12</b>P.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">On the other hand, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, since the flux pin <b>120</b>&#x2032; of the comparative example does not include a flux blocking structure limiting the flux wetting region (DR&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>), a portion of the flux FL during the flux dotting process may rise to the upper portion of the flux pin <b>120</b>&#x2032; to form remaining flux FL&#x2032;. Therefore, in the case in which the flux dotting process continues, a sufficient amount of flux FL may not be seated on some of the pads <b>12</b>P, causing defects such as a missing ball in the subsequent solder ball attach process (SBA) and reflow process.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As set forth above, according to example embodiments, by introducing a flux blocking structure to limit a wetting region of the flux pin, a flux dotting tool having a constant flux dotting amount may be provided.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">While non-limiting example embodiments have been illustrated and described above, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that modifications and variations could be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
