Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a cartridge and an applicator for drug delivery and a microneedle patch used therefor.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The conventional drug injection method using a syringe has problems such as the need for a healthcare professional to administer an injection and the pain accompanying the injection. To solve these problems, a microneedle type drug injection system was developed.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The microneedle is a system that delivers active ingredients into the skin through the stratum corneum, which is the skin barrier layer. It is a new system that combines the efficacy of a conventional syringe with the convenience of a patch and has made many technological advances in recent years.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Yet, in the case of the patch-type microneedle, there is a problem in that a user himself or herself has to attach the microneedle to the skin and inject the drug, so that the user's active attachment action is still required.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, the present disclosure is proposed to solve the above-described problems and an objective of the present disclosure is to provide an applicator in the form of a wearable device that can automatically inject drugs using a microneedle patch.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another objective of the present disclosure is to provide a microneedle patch that can be used multiple times and can be used in replaceable cartridges in combination with a wearable device.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure for achieving the objectives as described above, provided is a microneedle patch including a body in which at least one opening is formed, and a microneedle body which is disposed in the opening and has at least one microneedle formed therein, wherein when an external force is applied in a first direction, the microneedle body moves in the first direction so as to administer a drug in the microneedle to a user's skin.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the microneedle patch can be used multiple times by rotating since it moves to administer the drug when an external force is applied thereto and moves back to the original position thereof, and it is configured in a form that can be used in combination with a wearable device so that the drug can be injected in a way convenient for users.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"
