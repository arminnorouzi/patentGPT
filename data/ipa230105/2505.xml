They are the leading cause of death in the developed world and the second leading cause of death in developing countries, with over 12 million new cancer cases diagnosed and 7 million cancer deaths occurring each year. The National Cancer Institute estimates that greater than half a million Americans will die of cancer in 2013, accounting for nearly one out of every four deaths in the country. As the elderly population has grown, the incidence of cancer has concurrently risen, as the probability of developing cancer is more than two-fold higher after the age of seventy. Cancer care thus represents a significant and ever-increasing societal burden.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Longstanding approaches to cancer treatment include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery to remove solid tumors. Recently, bispecific antibody-based immunotherapies have been developed. Such bispecific antibodies are capable of simultaneously binding cell surface antigens on cytotoxic cells and tumor cells, with the intent that the bound cytotoxic cell will destroy the bound tumor cell. Existing bispecific antibodies currently undergoing clinical trials for treating cancer are limited by their short half-lives and/or variable efficacy. Thus, there is an unmet need in the field for the development of effective bispecific antibodies for use in cancer treatment.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention relates to anti-cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) antibodies and methods of using the same.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, the invention features an anti-CD3 antibody, wherein the anti-CD3 antibody comprises a binding domain comprising the following six hypervariable regions (HVRs): (a) an HVR-H1 comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1; (b) an HVR-H2 comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2; (c) an HVR-H3 comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3; (d) an HVR-L1 comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4; (e) an HVR-L2 comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5; and (f) an HVR-L3 comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6.

Examples of antibody effector functions include: C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell receptor); and B cell activation.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0366">An &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; of a compound, for example, an anti-CD3 antibody of the invention or a composition (e.g., pharmaceutical composition) thereof, is at least the minimum amount required to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result, such as a measurable improvement or prevention of a particular disorder (e.g., a cell proliferative disorder, e.g., cancer). An effective amount herein may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the patient, and the ability of the antibody to elicit a desired response in the individual. An effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the treatment are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. For prophylactic use, beneficial or desired results include results such as eliminating or reducing the risk, lessening the severity, or delaying the onset of the disease, including biochemical, histological and/or behavioral symptoms of the disease, its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of the disease. For therapeutic use, beneficial or desired results include clinical results such as decreasing one or more symptoms resulting from the disease, increasing the quality of life of those suffering from the disease, decreasing the dose of other medications required to treat the disease, enhancing effect of another medication such as via targeting, delaying the progression of the disease, and/or prolonging survival. In the case of cancer or tumor, an effective amount of the drug may have the effect in reducing the number of cancer cells; reducing the tumor size; inhibiting (i.e., slow to some extent or desirably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and desirably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibiting to some extent tumor growth; and/or relieving to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the disorder. An effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations. For purposes of this invention, an effective amount of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to accomplish prophylactic or therapeutic treatment either directly or indirectly. As is understood in the clinical context, an effective amount of a drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition may or may not be achieved in conjunction with another drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition. Thus, an &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable result may be or is achieved.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0367">The term &#x201c;Fc region&#x201d; herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain that contains at least a portion of the constant region.

In one embodiment, growth inhibitory agent is growth inhibitory antibody that prevents or reduces proliferation of a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibody binds. In another embodiment, the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of cells in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression (at a place other than S phase), such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M-phase arrest. Classical M-phase blockers include the vincas (vincristine and vinblastine), taxanes, and topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin, epirubicin, daunorubicin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S-phase arrest, for example, DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen, prednisone, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, cisplatin, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and ara-C.

Docetaxel (TAXOTERE&#xae;, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer), derived from the European yew, is a semisynthetic analogue of paclitaxel (TAXOL&#xae;, Bristol-Myers Squibb). Paclitaxel and docetaxel promote the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilize microtubules by preventing depolymerization, which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0371">The term &#x201c;HER2-positive&#x201d; cancer comprises cancer cells which have higher than normal levels of HER2.

In some embodiments, the epitope as determined by crystallography is determined using amino acids QDGNEEMGGITQTPYK (SEQ ID NO: 284) of CD3.</p><p id="p-0462" num="0465">In some embodiments, the epitope as determined by crystallography may be performed by combining the anti-CD3 antibody Fab, dissolved in 0.15 M NaCl, 25 mM tris, pH 7.5 at 10 mg/ml, with a 2-fold molar excess (1 mg) of CD3&#x3b5; peptide and initially screening a sparse matrix of precipitants in a sitting drop vapor diffusion format. Optimized crystals may be grown from a 1:1 mixture with reservoir solution containing 70% v/v methyl-pentanediol, and 0.1 M HEPES buffer at pH 7.5. The reservoir may be be used as a cryoprotectant. The crystals may be transferred to cryogenic temperature by sudden immersion into liquid nitrogen.</p><p id="p-0463" num="0466">The diffraction data for crystals may be collected at Advanced Photon Source beam line 221D, using a MAR300 CCD detector. The recorded diffractions may be integrated and scaled using the program HKL2000.</p><p id="p-0464" num="0467">The structure may be phased by molecular replacement (MR) method using program Phaser. For example, the MR search model is a Fab subunit derived from a crystal structure of HGFA/Fab complex (PDB code: 2R0L). The CD3&#x3b5; peptide is built into the structure based on a Fo-Fc map. The structure may be subsequently refined with programs REFMAC5 and PHENIX using the maximum likelihood target functions, anisotropic individual B-factor refinement method, and TLS refinement method, to achieve convergence.</p><p id="p-0465" num="0468">In certain other embodiments, an antibody is provided that includes a paratope that binds to the same epitope as an anti-CD3 antibody provided herein. For example, in certain embodiments an antibody is provided that binds to the same epitope as an anti-CD3 antibody paratope comprising amino acids that form contacts at a distance of 3.5 Angstroms or less. In certain embodiments, an antibody is provided that binds to the same epitope as an anti-CD3 antibody paratope consisting of amino acids of the VH region of an anti-CD3 antibody selected from the group comprising 33Tyr, 35His, 50Trp, 97Tyr, and 98Ser. In certain embodiments, an antibody is provided that binds to the same epitope as an anti-CD3 antibody paratope consisting of one, two, three, four, or five amino acids of the VH region of an anti-CD3 antibody selected from the group comprising 33Tyr, 35His, 50Trp, 97Tyr, and 98Ser. In certain embodiments, an antibody is provided that binds to the same epitope as an anti-CD3 antibody paratope consisting of amino acids of the VL region of an anti-CD3 antibody selected from the group comprising 27Arg, 27Asn, 30Lys, 32Tyr, 92Phe, 94Leu, and 96Arg. In certain embodiments, an antibody is provided that binds to the same epitope as an anti-CD3 antibody paratope consisting of one, two, three, four, five, six, or seven amino acids of the VL region of an anti-CD3 antibody selected from the group comprising 27Arg, 27Asn, 30Lys, 32Tyr, 92Phe, 94Leu, and 96Arg. In an optional embodiment, an antibody is provided that does not bind to the same epitope as an anti-CD3 antibody paratope consisting of amino acids of the VL region comprising 91Ser. In a further aspect of the invention, an anti-CD3 antibody according to any of the above embodiments is a monoclonal antibody, comprising a chimeric, humanized, or human antibody. In one embodiment, an anti-CD3 antibody is an antibody fragment, for example, a Fv, Fab, Fab&#x2032;, scFv, diabody, or F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment. In another embodiment, the antibody is a full length antibody, e.g., an intact IgG antibody (e.g., an intact IgG1 antibody) or other antibody class or isotype as defined herein.</p><p id="p-0466" num="0469">In a further aspect, an anti-CD3 antibody according to any of the above embodiments may incorporate any of the features, singly or in combination, as described in Sections 1-7 below.</p><p id="p-0467" num="0470">1. Antibody Affinity</p><p id="p-0468" num="0471">In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein has a dissociation constant (Kd) of &#x2264;1 &#x3bc;M, &#x2264;100 nM, &#x2264;10 nM, &#x2264;1 nM, &#x2264;0.1 nM, &#x2264;0.01 nM, or &#x2264;0.001 nM (e.g., 10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>M or less, e.g., from 10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>M to 10<sup>&#x2212;13 </sup>M, e.g., from 10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>M to 10<sup>&#x2212;13 </sup>M).</p><p id="p-0469" num="0472">In one embodiment, Kd is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA). In one embodiment, an RIA is performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen. For example, solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (<sup>125</sup>I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (see, e.g., Chen et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>293:865-881(1999)). To establish conditions for the assay, MICROTITER&#xae; multi-well plates (Thermo Scientific) are coated overnight with 5 &#x3bc;g/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23&#xb0; C.). In a non-adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [<sup>125</sup>I]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of the anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., <i>Cancer Res. </i>57:4593-4599 (1997)). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., about 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20&#xae;) in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 &#x3bc;l/well of scintillant (MICROSCINT-20&#x2122;; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a TOPCOUNT&#x2122; gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.</p><p id="p-0470" num="0473">According to another embodiment, Kd is measured using a BIACORE&#xae; surface plasmon resonance assay. For example, an assay using a BIACORE&#xae;-2000 or a BIACORE&#xae;-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) is performed at 25&#xb0; C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at &#x2dc;10 response units (RU). In one embodiment, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIACORE, Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N&#x2032;-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 &#x3bc;g/ml (&#x2dc;0.2 &#x3bc;M) before injection at a flow rate of 5 &#x3bc;l/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20&#x2122;) surfactant (PBST) at 25&#xb0; C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 &#x3bc;l/min. Association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIACORE&#xae; Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio k<sub>on</sub>/k<sub>off</sub>. See, for example, Chen et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>293:865-881 (1999). If the on-rate exceeds 10<sup>6</sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25&#xb0; C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO&#x2122; spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.</p><p id="p-0471" num="0474">2.

In one example, a chimeric antibody comprises a non-human variable region (e.g., a variable region derived from a mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, or non-human primate, such as a monkey) and a human constant region. In a further example, a chimeric antibody is a &#x201c;class switched&#x201d; antibody in which the class or subclass has been changed from that of the parent antibody. Chimeric antibodies include antigen-binding fragments thereof.</p><p id="p-0478" num="0481">In certain embodiments, a chimeric antibody is a humanized antibody. Typically, a non-human antibody is humanized to reduce immunogenicity to humans, while retaining the specificity and affinity of the parental non-human antibody. Generally, a humanized antibody comprises one or more variable domains in which HVRs, e.g., CDRs, (or portions thereof) are derived from a non-human antibody, and FRs (or portions thereof) are derived from human antibody sequences. A humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of a human constant region. In some embodiments, some FR residues in a humanized antibody are substituted with corresponding residues from a non-human antibody (e.g., the antibody from which the HVR residues are derived), e.g., to restore or improve antibody specificity or affinity.</p><p id="p-0479" num="0482">Humanized antibodies and methods of making them are reviewed, e.g., in Almagro and Fransson, <i>Front.

Immunol. </i>20:450-459 (2008).</p><p id="p-0483" num="0486">Human antibodies may be prepared by administering an immunogen to a transgenic animal that has been modified to produce intact human antibodies or intact antibodies with human variable regions in response to antigenic challenge. Such animals typically contain all or a portion of the human immunoglobulin loci, which replace the endogenous immunoglobulin loci, or which are present extrachromosomally or integrated randomly into the animal's chromosomes. In such transgenic mice, the endogenous immunoglobulin loci have generally been inactivated. For review of methods for obtaining human antibodies from transgenic animals, see Lonberg, <i>Nat.

Immunol., </i>147: 86 (1991).) Human antibodies generated via human B-cell hybridoma technology are also described in Li et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>103:3557-3562 (2006). Additional methods include those described, for example, in U.S. Pat.

Library-Derived Antibodies</p><p id="p-0487" num="0490">Antibodies of the invention may be isolated by screening combinatorial libraries for antibodies with the desired activity or activities. For example, a variety of methods are known in the art for generating phage display libraries and screening such libraries for antibodies possessing the desired binding characteristics. Such methods are reviewed, e.g., in Hoogenboom et al. in <i>Methods in Molecular Biology </i>178:1-37 (O'Brien et al., ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J., 2001) and further described, e.g., in the McCafferty et al., <i>Nature </i>348:552-554; Clackson et al., <i>Nature </i>352: 624-628 (1991); Marks et al., <i>J.

Rev. Immunol., </i>12: 433-455 (1994). Phage typically display antibody fragments, either as single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments or as Fab fragments. Libraries from immunized sources provide high-affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively, the naive repertoire can be cloned (e.g., from human) to provide a single source of antibodies to a wide range of non-self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths et al., <i>EMBO J, </i>12: 725-734 (1993). Finally, naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning unrearranged V-gene segments from stem cells, and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro, as described by Hoogenboom and Winter, <i>J. Mol. Biol., </i>227: 381-388 (1992). Patent publications describing human antibody phage libraries include, for example: U.S. Pat.

In certain embodiments, bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of CD3 (e.g., CD3&#x3b5; or CD3&#x3b3;). In certain embodiments, one of the binding specificities is for CD3 (e.g., CD3&#x3b5; or CD3&#x3b3;) and the other is for any other antigen (e.g., a second biological molecule, e.g., a cell surface antigen, e.g., a tumor antigen). Accordingly, a bispecific anti-CD3 antibody may have binding specificities for CD3 and a second biological molecule, such as a second biological molecule (e.g., a tumor antigen) listed in Table 1 and described in U.S. Pub.

Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further study will have modifications (e.g., improvements) in certain biological properties (e.g., increased affinity, reduced immunogenicity) relative to the parent antibody and/or will have substantially retained certain biological properties of the parent antibody. An exemplary substitutional variant is an affinity matured antibody, which may be conveniently generated, e.g., using phage display-based affinity maturation techniques such as those described herein. Briefly, one or more HVR residues are mutated and the variant antibodies displayed on phage and screened for a particular biological activity (e.g. binding affinity).</p><p id="p-1242" num="1249">Alterations (e.g., substitutions) may be made in HVRs, e.g., to improve antibody affinity. Such alterations may be made in HVR &#x201c;hotspots,&#x201d; i.e., residues encoded by codons that undergo mutation at high frequency during the somatic maturation process (see, e.g., Chowdhury, <i>Methods Mol. Biol. </i>207:179-196 (2008)), and/or residues that contact antigen, with the resulting variant VH or VL being tested for binding affinity. Affinity maturation by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries has been described, e.g., in Hoogenboom et al. in <i>Methods in Molecular Biology </i>178:1-37 (O'Brien et al., ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J., (2001).) In some embodiments of affinity maturation, diversity is introduced into the variable genes chosen for maturation by any of a variety of methods (e.g., error-prone PCR, chain shuffling, or oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis). A secondary library is then created. The library is then screened to identify any antibody variants with the desired affinity. Another method to introduce diversity involves HVR-directed approaches, in which several HVR residues (e.g., 4-6 residues at a time) are randomized. HVR residues involved in antigen binding may be specifically identified, e.g., using alanine scanning mutagenesis or modeling. CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 in particular are often targeted.</p><p id="p-1243" num="1250">In certain embodiments, substitutions, insertions, or deletions may occur within one or more HVRs so long as such alterations do not substantially reduce the ability of the antibody to bind antigen. For example, conservative alterations (e.g., conservative substitutions as provided herein) that do not substantially reduce binding affinity may be made in HVRs. Such alterations may, for example, be outside of antigen contacting residues in the HVRs. In certain embodiments of the variant VH and VL sequences provided above, each HVR either is unaltered, or contains no more than one, two or three amino acid substitutions.</p><p id="p-1244" num="1251">A useful method for identification of residues or regions of an antibody that may be targeted for mutagenesis is called &#x201c;alanine scanning mutagenesis&#x201d; as described by Cunningham and Wells (1989) <i>Science, </i>244:1081-1085. In this method, a residue or group of target residues (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) are identified and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (e.g., alanine or polyalanine) to determine whether the interaction of the antibody with antigen is affected. Further substitutions may be introduced at the amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the initial substitutions. Alternatively, or additionally, a crystal structure of an antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues may be targeted or eliminated as candidates for substitution. Variants may be screened to determine whether they contain the desired properties.</p><p id="p-1245" num="1252">Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody to an enzyme (e.g. for ADEPT) or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.</p><p id="p-1246" num="1253">b. Glycosylation Variants</p><p id="p-1247" num="1254">In certain embodiments, anti-CD3 antibodies of the invention (e.g., bispecific anti-CD3 antibodies of the invention that bind to CD3 and a second biological molecule, e.g., a cell surface antigen, e.g., a tumor antigen, such as TDB antibodies of the invention or variants thereof) can be altered to increase or decrease the extent to which the antibody is glycosylated. Addition or deletion of glycosylation sites to anti-CD3 antibody of the invention may be conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more glycosylation sites is created or removed.</p><p id="p-1248" num="1255">Where the antibody comprises an Fc region, the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. Native antibodies produced by mammalian cells typically comprise a branched, biantennary oligosaccharide that is generally attached by an N-linkage to Asn297 of the CH2 domain of the Fc region. See, e.g., Wright et al. <i>TIBTECH </i>15:26-32 (1997). The oligosaccharide may include various carbohydrates, e.g., mannose, N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc), galactose, and sialic acid, as well as a fucose attached to a GlcNAc in the &#x201c;stem&#x201d; of the biantennary oligosaccharide structure. In some embodiments, modifications of the oligosaccharide in an antibody of the invention may be made in order to create antibody variants with certain improved properties.</p><p id="p-1249" num="1256">In one embodiment, anti-CD3 antibody variants are provided having a carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached (directly or indirectly) to an Fc region. For example, the amount of fucose in such antibody may be from 1% to 80%, from 1% to 65%, from 5% to 65% or from 20% to 40%. The amount of fucose is determined by calculating the average amount of fucose within the sugar chain at Asn297, relative to the sum of all glycostructures attached to Asn 297 (e. g. complex, hybrid and high mannose structures) as measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, as described in WO 2008/077546, for example. Asn297 refers to the asparagine residue located at about position 297 in the Fc region (EU numbering of Fc region residues); however, Asn297 may also be located about &#xb1;3 amino acids upstream or downstream of position 297, i.e., between positions 294 and 300, due to minor sequence variations in antibodies. Such fucosylation variants may have improved ADCC function. See, e.g., US Patent Publication Nos. US 2003/0157108 (Presta, L.); US 2004/0093621 (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd).

Such antibody variants may have reduced fucosylation and/or improved ADCC function. Examples of such antibody variants are described, e.g., in WO 2003/011878 (Jean-Mairet et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,684 (Umana et al.); and US 2005/0123546 (Umana et al.). Antibody variants with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region are also provided.

Fc Region Variants</p><p id="p-1252" num="1259">In certain embodiments, one or more amino acid modifications may be introduced into the Fc region of an anti-CD3 antibody of the invention (e.g., a bispecific anti-CD3 antibody of the invention that binds to CD3 and a second biological molecule, e.g., a cell surface antigen, e.g., a tumor antigen, such as a TDB antibody of the invention or variant thereof), thereby generating an Fc region variant (see e.g., US 2012/0251531). The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence (e.g., a human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region) comprising an amino acid modification (e.g., a substitution) at one or more amino acid positions.</p><p id="p-1253" num="1260">In certain embodiments, the invention contemplates an anti-CD3 antibody variant that possesses some but not all effector functions, which make it a desirable candidate for applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions (such as complement and ADCC) are unnecessary or deleterious. In vitro and/or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction/depletion of CDC and/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc&#x3b3;R binding (hence likely lacking ADCC activity), but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc(RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc(RI, Fc(RII and Fc(RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, <i>Annu. Rev. Immunol. </i>9:457-492 (1991). Non-limiting examples of in vitro assays to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 (see, e.g. Hellstrom, I. et al. <i>Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA </i>83:7059-7063 (1986)) and Hellstrom, I et al., <i>Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA </i>82:1499-1502 (1985); 5,821,337 (see Bruggemann, M. et al., <i>J. Exp. Med. </i>166:1351-1361 (1987)). Alternatively, non-radioactive assays methods may be employed (see, for example, ACT&#x2122; non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay for flow cytometry (CellTechnology, Inc. Mountain View, Calif.; and CytoTox 96&#xae; non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.). Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. <i>Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA </i>95:652-656 (1998). C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. See, e.g., C1q and C3c binding ELISA in WO 2006/029879 and WO 2005/100402. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay may be performed (see, for example, Gazzano-Santoro et al. <i>J. Immunol. Methods </i>202:163 (1996); Cragg, M. S. et al. <i>Blood. </i>101:1045-1052 (2003); and Cragg, M. S. and M. J. Glennie <i>Blood. </i>103:2738-2743 (2004)). FcRn binding and in vivo clearance/half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art (see, e.g., Petkova, S. B. et al. <i>Int'l.

The cDNAs encoding extracellular domains of human or cyno CD3&#x3b5; and CD3&#x3b3; were generated using total RNA from anti-CD3/anti-CD28-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Normal PBMCs were activated by plate-immobilized anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS for 72h. Total mRNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit from Qiagen. cDNA was cloned using gene-specific primers by RT-PCR into TOPO vectors using Taq polymerase-amplified PCR products following the protocol provided with the TOPO TA cloning kit from Invitrogen. The resulting fragments were introduced into a mammalian expression vector containing a murine IgG2a Fc domain by restriction-free subcloning using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Catalog #M0530L). The CD3 fragments were thus amplified with overlapping regions contained in the template plasmid to orient them directly downstream of the signal sequence and N-terminal to the murine Fc.</p><p id="p-1345" num="1352">For both human and cyno constructs, the CD3&#x3b5;-Fc containing plasmid was transiently co-expressed with the CD3&#x3b3;-Fc containing plasmid in mammalian CHO cells.

The structure revealed that the CD3&#x3b5; peptide makes a small turn and inserts deeply into the cleft between heavy and light chains of the 38E4.v1 Fab (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>B and <b>14</b>C</figref>). Binding buries 666 &#x212b;<sup>2 </sup>of solvent accessible surface area between the peptide and the Fab fragment and involves an intricate network of hydrophobic, hydrogen binding and ionic interactions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>D</figref>). The N-terminal pyroglutamate (pyroglu) ring packs against heavy chain Tyr33 and makes a hydrogen bond with heavy chain His35 in HVR-H1. The bulky side chain of residue F100b in HVR-H3 pushes His35 into a proper orientation for its interaction with pyroglu and explains the loss of binding observed when F100b is mutated to alanine, a small side chain residue. In addition, consistent with the alanine scanning results, R96 in CDR-L3 makes a critical hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group in the pyroglu, whereas Y97 in CDR-H3 makes a hydrogen bond with Met7 of the CD3&#x3b5; peptide (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>E</figref>). Interestingly, while alanine substitution at R99 in CDR-H3 has a dramatic effect on antigen binding, the structure reveals that this side chain points away from the CD3&#x3b5; peptide and does not involve in any interactions with the peptide. Instead, R99 makes extensive contacts with several residues in CDR-H3, including a hydrogen bond with D101 and hydrophobic packing against Y100a that further impacts the vernier residue, LC Y49 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>F</figref>).

Distinct from ADCC activity, which is the main mechanism of action for classic monoclonal antibody therapy, CD20 TDB doesn't require the Fc region for its activity. F(ab&#x2032;)2 portion of CD20 TDB retained the same potency as the full-length IgG CD20 TDB in B cell killing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b>A</figref>). CD20 TDB is a conditional agonist, requiring target expression, T cells, and antibody for activity. B cell killing activity of CD20 TDB is T cell-dependent, as no B cell killing was detected with PBMCs depleted of CD3+ T cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b>B</figref>). Target expression is required for T cell activation, as no CD20 expression results in no activated T cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b>C</figref>). CD20 TDB is able to activate both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as measured by the induction of both CD69 and CD25 on T cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b>D</figref>). Comparable B cell killing can be achieved with either T cells as effectors, while CD8+ T cells appear to be more potent in BJAB cell killing, as CD8+ T cells resulted in higher extent of cell killing than equal number of CD4+ T cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b>C</figref>). However, Granzyme upregulation is more prevalent within CD8+ T cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b>E</figref>), as well as higher levels of perforin and Granzymes A and B (not shown) release associated with CD8+ T cells was detected in the media by ELISA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b>F</figref>). Activated T cells are capable of proliferation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>). Overall T cell count, however, didn't increase significantly after 24 hours in the presence of CD20 TDB and B cells without cytokine supplement in vitro, likely due to culture conditions.

To assess the potency of the CD20-TDB, 8 lines were selected that represent cells with a wide range of CD20 expression level (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b>B</figref>). The dose-response B cell killing curves are shown with the 8 cell lines, with PBMC isolated from healthy donor as effector cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b>A</figref>). Significantly, CD20-TDB had no activity against SU-DHL1 cells that are devoid of CD20 expression. The potency of the CD20-TDB was somewhat correlated with the various levels of surface CD20 detected by flow cytometry (<b>56</b>A). Nonetheless, CD20 TDB is potent in killing all 8 lines in a dose-dependent manner, with EC50 ranging from 0.38 to 11 ng/ml for 24 hour assay. The extent of cell killing varies somehow from 60 to 90% with up to 1000 ng/ml TDB in a 24 hour assay (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b>C</figref>). In general, complete B cell killing can be achieved with higher antibody concentration or extended assay time. SU-DHL-1 cells are included in the killing assay as a CD20 negative control, where no cell killing is observed demonstrating the requirement for target expression for CD20 TDB activity. Activity of CD20 TDB appears to require very low level of target expression, as Nalm-6 and SC-1 cells shown here all have very low CD20 surface expression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b>B</figref>). Monovalent binding affinity of CD20 TDB for CD20 is weaker than bivalent binding affinity of the parental anti-CD20, with a K<sub>D </sub>of 54 nM determined by scatchard. Taken together, the K<sub>D </sub>value and CD20 TDB B cell killing potency, receptor occupancy required for CD20 TDB activity is only less than 0.1%. TDBs generated to target different B cell antigens are also effective in mediating B cell killing as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b>D</figref>, where TDBs targeting 5 different B cell antigens, including a CD20 TDB (TDB A: 2H7v16/UCHT1v9), killed 75% to 90% of B cells.

The extent of B cell killing within 24 hours by CD20 TDB is very comparable or higher than B cell killing by an anti-CD3/anti-CD19 scFv (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b>H</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0021" level="2">CD20 TDB is Potent in Depleting B Cells In Vivo in Murine Models</heading><p id="p-1419" num="1422">As our tested CD20 TDB does not recognize murine CD20 and CD3 antigens, we took advantage of human CD20 and human CD3 transgenic mice (described above) to produce human CD3/CD20 double transgenic mice for subsequent efficacy studies in vivo. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b>A</figref>, human CD3/CD20 double transgenic mice express huCD3<sub>&#x3b5;</sub> on the surface of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in addition to huCD20 on the surface of CD19+ B cells at detectable levels compared to human derived T and B cells. With human CD20 transgenic mice, only rituximab is able to deplete B cells, as CD20 TDB cannot engage murine T cells without human CD3 expression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b>B</figref>). While with human CD3/CD20 double transgenic mice, CD20 TDB is able to engage murine T cells expressing huCD3, and is potent in depleting murine B cells expressing huCD20 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b>C</figref>). CD20 TDB appears to be more potent in depleting B cells in vivo, as fewer B cells are detected in mouse spleens 7 days after a single IV dose of CD20 TDB at 0.5 mg/kg, compared to after a single dose of rituximab at 10 mg/kg. A HER2 TDB, which has the same CD3 arm while with the other arm binds to HER2, was used as an isotype control here, and showed no activity here in cell depletion.</p><p id="p-1420" num="1423">To explore the lowest efficacious dose for CD20 TDB in depleting B cells with human CD3/CD20 double transgenic mice, mice were treated with a single dose of CD20 TDB starting at 0.5 mg/kg down to 0.00005 mg/kg. Then B cell count in blood was monitored on D1 (24 hours after dose), D8, and D15. Decreased B cell count was observed on D1, and B cell depletion was sustained up to D15 following CD20 TDB treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>58</b>A</figref>). Consistent with this observation of B cell count in blood, near complete B cell depletion in mouse spleens was achieved at D7 after a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg, while a lower dose of 0.05 mg/kg resulted in spleen B cell depletion partially and approximated an ED50 dose level (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>58</b>B</figref>). A time-course study with the double transgenic mice revealed that B cell depletion is near complete in spleens as early as 3 days after single dose treatment at 0.5 mg/kg, without significant sign of B cell recovery until D14 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>58</b>A</figref>). As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>58</b>C</figref>, CD20 TDB mediates B cell depletion in the periphery of double transgenic huCD20/huCD3, which is detected in the blood as early as two hours after treatment and maintained for up to seven days post treatment. Furthermore, activated CD8+ and CD4+ T cells are detectable in the blood within two hours of CD20 TDB administration and then decline by two days post-treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>58</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-1421" num="1424">Further, CD20 TDB depleted marginal zone B cells (MZB) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b>B</figref>) as efficiently as follicular B cells (FOB) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b>C</figref>) in mouse spleens, after a single IV dose of 0.5 mg/kg. We observed that splenic B cells declined &#x2dc;50% from baseline by day 1 (24 hours post dose) and continued to decline rapidly to reach a nadir on day 3 that was maintained throughout the study. This is apparently different from previous report with rituximab, where microenvironment is thought to play a role in rituximab effectiveness, suggesting different mode of action for CD20 TDB in vivo than that for rituximab. Murine T cell activation is usually observed as soon as 30 minutes after CD20 TDB treatment in blood, and mostly within the first 24 hours in spleen (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>59</b>D and <b>59</b>E</figref>). Following T cell activation, increase in T cell count was observed around D2-D3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>59</b>D and <b>59</b>E</figref>), as a result of cell proliferation. By day 2 the majority of T cells were no longer CD69-positive, although levels of CD69+CD8+ cells continued to range from 10-30% for the remainder of the two week study. However, possibly due to activation induced cell death, T cell count tends to decrease following the expansion phase. T cell count will recover eventually after TDB treatment, suggesting no inhibitory effect of CD20 TDB treatment in murine T cell regeneration.</p><p id="p-1422" num="1425">Humanized NSG mice were also used to further validate CD20 TDB potency in B cell depletion in murine models, and in a repeat dose setting.

IHC staining of representative examples of mouse spleens showed successful engraftment of B leukemia cells and autologous T cells from CLL patients in NSG mice. After a single dose of CD20-TDB treatment at 0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg, few B cells could be detected.

Further, transplantation of PBMCs alone delayed tumor outgrowth, but these mice developed detectable tumors by day 25 post-inoculation. Thus, CD20 TDB is also effective in preventing tumor growth in vivo in the presence of PBMC effector cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>63</b></figref>).</p><heading id="h-0023" level="2">CD20 TDB Potency Requires Very Low CD20 Expression Level</heading><p id="p-1426" num="1429">In addition to the different requirement for antibody Fc region for CD20 TDB activity comparing to conventional anti-CD20, and possibly different dependence on tumor microenvironment, CD20 TDB also appears to require a lower level of antigen expression for efficient B cell killing. For Bjab cells, which have high level of CD20 expression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b>A</figref>), comparable cell killing were accomplished with rituximab and CD20 TDB (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b>B</figref>). However, Nalm-6, SC-1, and OCI-Ly19 cells with much reduced level of CD20 expression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b>A</figref>) were only killed by CD20 TDB, while no cell killing was detected with rituximab (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b>C</figref>). Estimated CD20 copy number for these CD20-low cell lines is less than 500, based on scatchard and FACS binding data in comparison to BJAB cells (data not shown). In addition, monovalent binding affinity of CD20-TDB for CD20 is &#x2dc;50-100 nM, significantly less than 1-5 nM affinity of rituximab (both measured by scatchard). Taken together, the potency of CD20-TDB is consistent with the notion that TCR triggering only requires low receptor occupancy of 10-100 molecules (Purbhoo, M. A., et al. <i>Nat Immunol </i>5:524-530, 2004; Irvine, D.

We took advantage of rituximab-DANA, an effector-less rituximab variant (rituximab containing substitutions of residues 265 and 297 to alanine (DANA mutations described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,332,581 and 8,219,149)), which only binds to CD20 without B cell killing activity, as tested in human CD20/CD3 double transgenic mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b>D</figref>). Pretreatment of normal donor B-cell target cells with this inert rituximab molecule that competes with CD20-TDB binding had a remarkably minimal effect in blunting the activity of CD20-TDB. At concentrations up to to 250 &#x3bc;g/ml rituximab-DANA (a 5000-fold excess over the 42 ng/ml EC50 dose level), we observed only modest shifts in the dose-response curves in vitro (less than 7-fold shift at the EC50, 42 versus 320 ng/ml). Remarkably, CD20 TDB is still active in this setting. Although the EC50 for CD20-TDB was increased up to &#x2dc;7-fold with higher rituximab-DANA concentration, the extent of B cell killing is not significantly changed, (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b>A</figref>). This is consistent with our previous findings that very low antigen expression level, or very low receptor occupancy, is required for CD20 TDB potency. The in vitro observations were recapitulated in vivo in CD3/CD20 dual transgenic mice which were pretreated with 2 or 10 mg/kg of the rituximab-DANA protein and subsequently challenged with CD20-TDB. Here we show in vivo that CD20 TDB is still active in depleting B cells in mice pre-treated with rituximab-DANA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>66</b></figref>).

CD8+T cell counts, as well as that of CD4+T cells to a lesser extent, significantly increased after the first dose, and gradually returned to within 25-150% of baseline values.

The in vitro activity the hu4D5 TDBs with either anti-CD3 arm proved to be more effective than the 2C4 and 7C2 TDBs in mediating maximal SKBR3 and MCF7 cell killing as measured by their EC50 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>78</b></figref>). This killing activity was also dependent on the CD3 arm utilized. The combination of the anti-CD3 arm 38E4v1 with any one of the anti-HER2 hu4D5, 2C4, or 7C2 arms was more efficacious than that of the 40G5c HER2 TDB combinations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>79</b></figref>). Further testing of the 6 HER2 TDB combinations revealed that their target cell killing activity is not dependent on the level of HER2 expression in target cells. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>80</b></figref> shows that the HER2 TDBs were not selective for high HER2 expressing SKBR3 target cells over low HER2 expressing MCF7 target cells. The activity of the HER2 TDB was instead dependent on the affinity of the anti-HER2 arm for HER2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>81</b></figref>). The low HER2 affinity TDBs retained activity on low HER2-expressing MCF7 cells and were not able to selectively kill HER2 amplified SKBR3 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>82</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-1456" num="1457">The HER2 TDBs were also assayed for the specificity of the anti-HER2 arm for their respective HER2 epitopes. The killing activity of the hu4D5-40G5c HER2-TDB was limited when combined with increasing concentrations of Trastuzumab (hu4D5). However, the efficacy of trastuzumab is not affected by the combination of the hu4D5 TDB with the hu4D5 antibody (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>83</b></figref>). By contrast, target cell killing as mediated by 2C4-40G5c or 7C2 38E4v1 as blocked by co-administration of the bivalent monospecific antibodies pertuzumab (2C4) or 7C2, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>83</b></figref>). When additional anti-HER2 arms were tested in multiple affinity assays, all clones demonstrating high or medium HER2 TDB activity competed with trastuzumab or pertuzumab (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>84</b></figref>). For identification of candidate TDBs to be assayed in vivo, high (38E4v1, 38E4, and SP34) and low (40G5c and 2C11) affinity CD3 arms were tested in vitro with mouse-derived humanized CD3+ T cells in combination with hu4D5, 2C4, and 7C2 anti-HER2 arms (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>85</b>-<b>86</b></figref>). From this assay, three candidate TDBs were selected based on their killing activity for further characterization in vivo: hu4D5-SP34, hu4D5-2C11, and 2C4-38E4. The treatment of HER2-expressing tumor-bearing animals with the hu4D5-2C11 HER2 TDB resulted in an increase in CD45+ and CD8+ cells in the tumor as early as 4 hours post-treatment. Upon further analysis, HER2-TDB treated tumors revealed an increase in IFN&#x3b3;+ and PD1+CD8+ T cells as well as an increased presence of T regulatory (Treg) cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>87</b>B</figref>). The detection of increased immune infiltrates in tumors was also correlated with a decrease in the tumor volume of HER2-TDB treated animals as compared to vehicle control treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>87</b>A</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>88</b>A</figref>, the anti-HER2 arm hu4D5 combined with the low affinity anti-CD3 arm, 2C11 or high affinity anti-CD3 arm, SP34, both resulted in tumor regression in transgenic HER2 mice. However, this response was not observed with the lower affinity 2C4 anti-HER2 arm combined with the 38E4 high affinity anti-CD3 arm (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>88</b>A-<b>88</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-1457" num="1458">HER2 TDB was also compared to bivalent trastuzumab and trastuzumab-Fab fragments for its ability to directly inhibit SKBR3 proliferation. HER2-expressing SKBR3 target cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 5&#xd7;10<sup>3 </sup>cells/well and incubated overnight for cell attachment before treatment with the designated antibody or fragment antibody. Cell proliferation/viability was analyzed after 6 days of treatment by CELLTITERGLO&#xae; Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.).

In vitro cytotoxicity was monitored by flow cytometry. Target cells were labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) according to manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, #C34554). The CFSE-labeled target cells and purified CD8+ T cells from human PBMC were mixed in certain E:T ratio (as indicated in figure legends), with or without TDB for 24 hours. At the end of the incubation, the cells were lifted by trypsin and collected from the plate. The cells were resuspended in equal volume of PBS+2% FBS+1 mM EDTA+propidium iodine (PI). Flow cytometry analysis was done on a FACSCalibur in automation format. The number of live target cells was counted by gating on CFSE+/PI negative cells. The percentage of cytotoxicity was calculated as follows: % cytotoxicity (live target cell number w/o TDB&#x2212;live target cell number w/TDB)/(live target cell number w/o TDB)&#xd7;100.

For expression as muIgG2a, equivalent knob-into-hole mutations (Atwell et al. <i>J Mol Biol. </i>270: 26-35, 1997) were introduced into the Fc region, as well as D265A and N297G (EU numbering) to abolish effector function. In muIgG2a HER2 TDBs the &#x201c;knob&#x201d; arm is murine anti-HER2 hu4D5 and the &#x201c;hole&#x201d; is either chimeric anti-murine CD3 2C11 (Leo et al. <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. </i>84:1374-1378, 1987) (TDB 2C11/hu4D5) or mouse anti-hu CD3 SP34 (Pessano et al. <i>The EMBO Journal. </i>4: 337-344, 1985) (TDB SP34/hu4D5). The muIgG2a bispecific antibodies were expressed in CHO cells and assembled by in vitro assembly. Bispecific antibodies were purified from contaminants by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) as described elsewhere (Speiss et al. <i>Nat Biotechnology. </i>31: 753-758, 2013). The resulting material was analyzed for endotoxin levels using an ENDOSAFE&#xae; portable test system (Charles River, USA) and when needed, the endotoxin content was reduced by washing the protein with 0.1% TRITON&#x2122; X-114.

Generation and Characterization of Exemplary CD3/LYPD1 TDBs (LYPD1 TDBs)</heading><p id="p-1483" num="1482">We also explored the capacity of TDB antibodies to recruit the cytotoxic activities of T cells in eradicating tumor cells by recognition of a different cell surface antigen, LYPD1. To this end, we generated and characterized bispecific anti-CD3 antibodies having an anti-CD3 arm and an anti-LYPD1 arm (LYPD1 TDBs). As described above, the LYPD1 TDBs were produced as full-length antibodies in the knob-into-hole format as human IgG1, as previously described (Atwell et al. <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>270: 26-35, 1997). Half antibodies were expressed in either <i>E. coli </i>or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, purified by Protein A-affinity chromatography, and the proper half antibody pairs were annealed in vitro as described previously (Spiess et al. <i>Nat. Biotechnol. </i>2013). If TDB antibody production was carried out in CHO cells, the antibody included an aglycosylation mutation, for example, at residue N297 (e.g., N297G), such that the TDB antibody was an effector-less variant and unable to initiate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). After annealing, the LYPD1 TDBs were purified by Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC) and characterized by analytical gel filtration, mass spectrometry, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described above. The anti-LYPD1 arm used in the generation of LYPD1 TDBs was that of anti-LYPD1 antibody YWO.49.H6, comprising (a) a VH domain comprising an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 272 and (b) a VL domain comprising an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 273.
