A sample for observation, inspection, and measurement is held on the sample stage <b>109</b>.

The detector <b>105</b> outputs a detection signal of the charged particles to the control unit <b>111</b>. The control unit <b>111</b> forms an image of the sample based on the detection signal, and displays the image on a display unit provided in an input/output unit <b>112</b>, or stores the image in a storage unit <b>113</b>. The display unit may be arranged separately from the input/output unit <b>112</b>.

The foreign substance present in the sample chamber is once attached to a foreign substance attachment/detachment unit such as the objective lens <b>107</b> before observation of the sample, and then is dropped and collected by the foreign substance collecting unit <b>122</b> moved below the foreign substance attachment/detachment unit. The foreign substance attachment/detachment unit is a member from or to which a foreign substance is detached or attached by an electric field or a magnetic field, and is not limited to the objective lens <b>107</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Meanwhile, the foreign substance detached from the foreign substance attachment/detachment unit and dropped to the foreign substance collecting unit <b>122</b> may collide with the inner wall surface, i.e., a bottom surface or a side surface, of the foreign substance collecting unit <b>122</b> and scatter from the foreign substance collecting unit <b>122</b>, and the scattered foreign substance hinders sample observation. Therefore, in order to reduce scattering of the foreign substance collected by the foreign substance collecting unit <b>122</b>, an area of an opening provided in the upper end portion of the foreign substance collecting unit <b>122</b> and through which the foreign substance passes is made smaller than a horizontal cross-sectional area of an internal space of the foreign substance collecting unit <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The foreign substance collecting unit <b>122</b> according to the present embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the foreign substance collecting unit <b>122</b> disposed below the objective lens <b>107</b> that functions as a foreign substance attachment/detachment unit.
