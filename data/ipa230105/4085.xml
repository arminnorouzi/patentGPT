Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an actinic ray-sensitive or radiation-sensitive resin composition, an actinic ray-sensitive or radiation-sensitive film, a pattern forming method, and a method for manufacturing an electronic device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In processes for manufacturing semiconductor devices such as an integrated circuit (IC) and a large scale integrated circuit (LSI), microfabrication by lithography using a photosensitive composition has been performed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Examples of the lithographic method include a method in which a resist film is formed with the photosensitive composition, and then the obtained film is exposed and then developed. In particular, in recent years, studies have been conducted on the use of electron beam (EB) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light in addition to an ArF excimer laser during exposure, and an actinic ray-sensitive or radiation-sensitive resin composition suitable for EUV exposure has been developed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a formation of a resist pattern using EUV (wavelength: 13.5 nm) for the purpose of forming a fine pattern, it is necessary to suppress diffusion of acid more appropriately than a case of using ArF (wavelength: 193 nm) light or the like in the related art, and as an acid diffusion control agent, a compound which is decomposed by irradiation with actinic ray or radiation so that a basicity is lowered may be used.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, JP2014-178645A discloses an actinic ray-sensitive or radiation-sensitive resin composition including a resin which has a monocyclic structure including a sulfonyl group, a photoacid generator, and a basic compound, in which as the basic compound, a basic compound or an ammonium salt compound that basicity is reduced by irradiation with actinic ray or radiation is used.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">JP2019-168475A discloses a chemically amplified resist material including a resin having a sulfonyl group, a photoacid generator, and a compound that is a component relatively basic to an acid and that basicity is reduced by irradiation with radiation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">JP2013-209360A discloses a chemically amplified resist material including a resin which has a polycyclic structure including a sulfonyl group, a photoacid generator, and a compound which is sensitive to high energy rays or heat and generates a sulfonic acid having a specific nitrogen-containing group.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">WO2018/074382A discloses a composition including a resin which has a monocyclic structure including a sulfonyl group, a photoacid generator, and a composition including an acid diffusion control agent, in which as the acid diffusion control agent, a photodisintegrant base that is exposed to light and generates a weak acid may be used.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In recent years, it has been required to reduce defects of a pattern formed by using EUV light. In addition, it is required that a line width roughness (LWR) performance of the obtained pattern is good.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As the present inventors proceed with the studies, in the compositions disclosed in JP2014-178645A, JP2019-168475A, JP2013-209360A, and WO2018/074382A, it has been newly found that LWR performance in a case where a pattern is formed after long-term storage (for example, 180 days) after production and defect inhibition performance of the pattern formed in a case where a leaving time is provided after application of the composition are insufficient.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an actinic ray-sensitive or radiation-sensitive resin composition that, in a pattern formed by using EUV light, LWR performance is excellent even in a case of being stored for a long period of time and occurrence of pattern defects can be suppressed even in a case a leaving time is provided after production.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, another object of the present invention is to provide an actinic ray-sensitive or radiation-sensitive film formed of the actinic ray-sensitive or radiation-sensitive resin composition, a pattern forming method, and a method for manufacturing an electronic device.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present inventors have found that the above-described objects can be achieved by the following configurations.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">[1]</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">An actinic ray-sensitive or radiation-sensitive resin composition

For example, an &#x201c;alkyl group&#x201d; includes not only an alkyl group having no substituent (unsubstituted alkyl group), but also an alkyl group having a substituent (substituted alkyl group). In addition, an &#x201c;organic group&#x201d; in the present specification refers to a group including at least one carbon atom.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0110">In addition, in the present specification, the types of substituents, the positions of substituents, and the number of substituents in a case where it is described that &#x201c;a substituent may be contained&#x201d; are not particularly limited. The number of substituents may be, for example, one, two, three, or more.

In addition, the resist composition may be either a resist composition for alkali development or a resist composition for organic solvent development. The composition according to the embodiment of the present invention is typically a chemically amplified resist composition.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0116">The resist composition according to the embodiment of the present invention contains a resin (A) which contains a repeating unit (a1) having a structure represented by General Formula (1) described later, a compound (B) which generates an acid by an irradiation with an actinic ray or a radiation, and an ionic compound (C) that is a compound which is decomposed by an irradiation with an actinic ray or a radiation so that an acid-trapping property is lowered, has an anionic acid-trapping group, does not have a nonionic acid-trapping group, and contains a fluorine atom in an anionic moiety.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0117">In the resist composition according to the embodiment of the present invention, the compound (B) which generates an acid by an irradiation with an actinic ray or a radiation and the ionic compound (C) may be the same compound.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0118">A mechanism by which the objects of the present invention can be achieved through such configurations is not always clear, but is considered to be as follows by the present inventors.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0119">In a formation of a resist pattern using EUV (wavelength: 13.5 nm) for the purpose of forming a fine pattern, since a compound that is decomposed by irradiation with actinic ray or radiation so that a basicity is lowered, which has been used in the related art as an acid diffusion control agent, has a hydrophilic onium salt structure and an acid-trapping group such as an amino group, interaction between the acid diffusion control agents is strong. Therefore, in a case where a long storage period is provided after a preparation of the resist composition, or a case where a leaving time is provided after an application of the resist composition, the acid diffusion control agents in the resist composition aggregate with each other, and as a result, a deterioration of an LWR performance or an increase in defects occurs in a pattern to be obtained.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0120">In the present invention, as the acid diffusion control agent, among compounds which are decomposed by irradiation with actinic ray or radiation so that a basicity is lowered, an ionic compound that is a compound which does not have an acid-trapping group enhancing aggregating properties, such as an amino group, has an ionic acid-trapping group, and contains a fluorine atom in an anionic moiety is used to mitigate the above-described influence. As a result, it is possible to weaken the interaction between the acid diffusion control agents.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0121">Further, in the present invention, a resin having a monocyclic structure including a sulfonyl group (&#x2014;SO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;) as a ring member is used. By using the resin having a monocyclic structure including a sulfonyl group as a ring member, which has an appropriate interaction with the acid diffusion control agent, it is possible to improve dispersibility of the acid diffusion control agent. In a case where the sulfonyl group is included in a chain group, since a degree of freedom of the chain group including the sulfonyl group is high, the interaction with the acid diffusion control agent is too strong, and the acid diffusion control agent is present at a higher density around the sulfonyl group. In addition, in a case where the sulfonyl group is included in a polycyclic structure, since a degree of freedom of the cyclic structure including the sulfonyl group is high, the interaction with the acid diffusion control agent is too weak, so that the sulfonyl group does not contribute to the dispersion of the acid diffusion control agent.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0122">As described above, by suppressing the aggregation of the acid diffusion control agent, it is presumed that a pattern having excellent LWR performance can be obtained even in a case where the resist composition is stored for a long period of time, and occurrence of pattern defects can be suppressed even in a case where a leaving time is provided.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0123">[Components of Resist Composition]</p><p id="p-0133" num="0124">Hereinafter, components that can be included in the resist composition will be described in detail.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0125">&#x3c;(A) Resin&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0135" num="0126">The resist composition includes a resin (A).</p><p id="p-0136" num="0127">The resin (A) is typically an acid-decomposable resin that is a resin in which a polarity increases due to an action of acid, so that a solubility in an alkali developer increases and a solubility in an organic solvent decreases.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0128">The resin (A) has a group which is decomposed by the action of acid to form a polar group (in other words, structure in which a polar group is protected by a leaving group which is eliminated by the action of acid). Such a group (structure) is also called as an acid-decomposable group. A resin having the acid-decomposable group (that is, a resin which has a repeating unit having the acid-decomposable group) has an increased polarity by the action of acid, and thus has an increased
