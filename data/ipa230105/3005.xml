The previously known sanitary fittings have, for this purpose, a fitting housing which can be mounted for example on a washbasin that serves as a point of discharge. The fitting housing has a housing interior, into which a cartridge is inserted, with the aid of which the quantity of water or the temperature of the water flowing out of the fitting outflow of the outflow fitting can be adjusted. In the previously known cartridges, ceramic washers are used as shut-off element. These ceramic washers rotate against one another and displace one another, and steplessly release the flow of water. The position of the lever of the single-lever fitting, which corresponds to a particular relative position of the washers with respect to one another, provides the degree of opening of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thus, sanitary fittings of the type mentioned at the beginning are already known, which have a fitting housing in the form of a hollow body. The fitting housing has a housing interior, into which either a cartridge or a cartridge adapter is inserted, which cartridge adapter contains a cartridge provided in a cartridge receptacle of the cartridge adapter. Since the cartridge having the valve washers is produced as a standardized component, it is possible, with the aid of the cartridge adapter, to adapt the sanitary fitting to the standardized cartridge. In any case, the cartridge has at least one inlet opening which, for carrying at least one fluid through the cartridge, is connected to at least one outflow opening. In the housing interior of the fitting housing, at least one hose line is guided, which serves to carry the at least one fluid to the cartridge. This hose line has a hose connection element at least at its hose end remote from the cartridge. Via the hose line and its hose connection element, at least one fluid, in particular cold and/or hot water, is able to be passed through the cartridge from at least one inlet opening of the cartridge to at least one outflow opening, wherein the quantity or at least one property of the fluid, for example its temperature, can be adjusted in the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this case, the at least one fluid is carried to the cartridge of the previously known sanitary fitting via the at least one hose line. This hose line bears with a hose fitting or similar hose connection element of the hose line on the cartridge adapter such that the fluid carried in the at least one hose line can be guided into the cartridge via the hose connection element and the cartridge adapter. For this purpose, at least one hose retainer protrudes in the housing interior of the fitting housing, said hose retainer being integrally formed on the housing inner circumference of the fitting housing. This at least one hose retainer is passed through by at least one introduction opening, through which at least one introduction opening a respective hose line is able to be introduced. At the circumference of the hose connection element, an encircling retaining groove is provided, into which, after the hose line has been threaded into the introduction opening, a circlip, a retaining clip or similar axial securing means is insertable. This axial securing means secures the hose line and its hose connection element against being pulled out of the introduction opening. The hose connection element of the at least one hose line bears on the cartridge adapter in the region of the duct inflow opening of a flow-through duct, which flow-through duct leads to an inflow opening of the cartridge. The incorporation of the introduction openings into the fitting housing, and the sealing between the hose connection element and the cartridge adapter and between the cartridge adapter and the cartridge is associated with considerable effort.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO 2009/065435 A1 discloses a hose fastening element for a sanitary or kitchen fitting having at least two introduction channels which each extend as far as at least one receiving position at which a collar of a hose nipple is axially fixable to a connection hose, wherein the hose fastening element has an internal recess which is formed from a feed region and the introduction channels, wherein the introduction channels are set at an angle to one another and open into the common feed region.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">EP 1 457 607 A2 discloses a device for fastening a line, wherein the device, for fastening the end of a line to a sanitary fitting, contains, in the sanitary fitting, a receptacle for a nipple, which can be pushed into this receptacle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">DE 20 2017 100 423 U1 discloses a hose connection arrangement having a basic body on which at least two hose receptacles are formed, having at least two hoses which are plugged with their respective ends into in each case one of the at least two hose receptacles, wherein a retaining edge is formed on each of the at least two hoses, having a retaining plate in which, corresponding to the at least two hose receptacles, at least two recesses are formed, into which in each case one of the at least two hoses is insertable by way of an insertion movement oriented transversely to a longitudinal direction of the respective hose, such that the associated retaining edge engages over the retaining plate in order to prevent the hoses from being pulled out of the hose receptacles.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">EP 1 435 480 A2 discloses a sanitary fitting which contains, in its base, an adapter component which contains a through-channel for a water guide leading to a mixer valve in the sanitary fitting.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">WO 2019/002515 A1 discloses a chromatography system and couplings therefor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">EP 1 798 348 A2 discloses a mixer tap which has a tap body on which a water outlet pipe is arranged, wherein a receiving space for an insert piece having a mixer valve cartridge is provided in the tap body.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, the object is to create a sanitary fitting of the type mentioned at the beginning, the production of which is associated with much less effort.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">This object is achieved, according to the invention, in the case of the sanitary fitting of the type mentioned at the beginning in particular in that the hose connection element of the at least one hose line is retained in a secured manner in a retaining position on the cartridge or on the cartridge adapter so as to prevent the hose line from being pulled off, and bears with its free end face, bordering a hose opening, on the peripheral region, bordering the associated inlet opening, of the cartridge. The sanitary fitting according to the invention has a fitting housing which has a housing interior. Inserted into the cartridge interior of the fitting housing is either a cartridge or a cartridge adapter, in which a cartridge is provided in a cartridge receptacle. The cartridge receptacle of the cartridge adapter is intended for the insertion of a valve cartridge, mixer cartridge or the like. The cartridge has at least one inlet opening, which, for the passage of at least one fluid through the cartridge, is connected to at least one outflow opening. With the aid of the cartridge, the desired fluid can be selected, the required quantity can be adjusted and/or its temperature or similar fluid properties can be determined, for example by adding cold and hot water. In this case, the at least one fluid, which can be for example hot water, cold water, boiling water or carbonated water, i.e. water to which CO2 has been added, is carried to the cartridge in each case by means of a hose line. In order to carry the fluid coming from the at least one hose line to the cartridge, the hose connection element of the at least one hose line is retained in a secured manner in a retaining position on the cartridge or on the cartridge adapter so as to prevent the hose line from being pulled off. In this case, the hose connection element bears in a liquid-tight manner with its free end face, bordering a hose opening, on the peripheral region, bordering the associated inlet opening, of the cartridge. Since the hose connection element of the at least one hose line is retained in a secured manner in the retaining position on the cartridge or cartridge adapter so as to prevent the hose line from being pulled off, the hose connection element cannot unintentionally be pulled off the cartridge or the cartridge adapter. In the sanitary fitting according to the invention, the hose line is thus retained with its hose connection element on the cartridge or on the cartridge adapter and not on the fitting housing. This already simplifies the production of the fitting housing. Since the at least one hose line bears in a liquid-tight manner with the free end face, bordering a hose opening, of its hose connection element on the peripheral region, bordering an inlet opening, of the cartridge, it is possible to dispense with a further ring seal between the hose line and the cartridge adapter, thereby reducing the production complexity. If the sanitary fitting even requires a cartridge adapter, this cartridge adapter is passed through only by the hose line and long and optionally also crossing flow-through ducts do not need to be provided in the cartridge adapter. Since the at least one hose line bears in a liquid-tight manner on the cartridge, the cartridge adapter can be designed with a reduced installation length or it is possible to dispense with the cartridge adapter entirely, thereby entailing a saving of material both in relation to the cartridge adapter and in relation to the fitting housing that receives the cartridge adapter or the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a particularly advantageous development according to the invention, a passage opening is provided in the cartridge adapter or in the cartridge, a plug-in slot opens into the passage opening, said plug-in slot being formed so as to be open transversely toward the longitudinal axis of the cartridge adapter or of the cartridge at a plug-in opening, the at least one passage opening is assigned a hose-connection-element receptacle which has a receiving shoulder, bordering the passage opening, or a receiving bevel, and the hose line assigned to the passage opening is able to be introduced into the passage opening through the plug-in opening via the plug-in slot such that the hose connection element bears on the receiving shoulder or on the receiving bevel in a secured manner by way of a cross-sectional expansion so as to prevent the hose line from being pulled off. In order for it thus to be possible to fasten the at least one hose line to the cartridge adapter or the cartridge in a secured manner so as to be prevented from being pulled out of the passage opening provided in the cartridge adapter or in the cartridge, the hose connection element is passed through the plug-in opening into the plug-in slot arranged transversely to the longitudinal axis of the cartridge adapter or of the cartridge, in order to be transferred from there into the passage opening. In this passage opening, a receiving shoulder or a receiving bevel is provided. Thus, the at least one hose line assigned to the passage opening can be introduced into the passage opening through the plug-in opening via the plug-in slot such that the hose connection element bears on the receiving shoulder or on the receiving bevel in a secured manner by way of a cross-sectional expansion so as to prevent the hose line from being pulled off. The at least one hose line is thus introduced into the plug-in slot from the plug-in opening formed so as to be open transversely toward the longitudinal axis of the cartridge adapter or of the cartridge, said plug-in slot opening into the passage opening on its side remote from the plug-in opening. This passage opening is assigned the hose-connection-element receptacle in the cartridge adapter or in the cartridge, which has a receiving shoulder, bordering this passage opening, or a receiving bevel. The hose line introduced into the plug-in slot through the plug-in opening can thus be introduced into the assigned passage opening from the plug-in opening located on the inside or provided at the circumference of the cartridge adapter or of the cartridge such that the hose connection element, passing through the passage opening, of this at least one hose line bears on the receiving shoulder or on the receiving bevel in a secured manner by way of a cross-sectional expansion so as to prevent the hose line from being pulled off the cartridge or the cartridge adapter.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this embodiment, to be designed to be relatively space-saving, according to the invention, the hose line is secured effectively against being unintentionally pulled off in the direction away from the cartridge or the cartridge adapter.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a further proposal for achieving the object set out above, in a sanitary fitting of the type mentioned at the beginning, in which the hose connection element of the at least one hose line passes, in a retaining position, through a passage opening in the fitting housing, a plug-in slot opens into the at least one passage opening, said plug-in slot having, in a slot subregion or at a slot end spaced apart from the passage opening, a plug-in opening which has a larger opening cross section compared with the passage opening and/or is peripherally open, the at least one passage opening is assigned a hose-connection-element receptacle which has a receiving shoulder bordering the passage opening or a receiving bevel, and the hose line assigned to the passage opening is able to be introduced into the passage opening through the plug-in opening via the plug-in slot such that the hose connection element is retained on the receiving shoulder or on the receiving bevel in a secured manner by way of a cross-sectional expansion so as to prevent the hose line from being pulled off and bears with its free end face, bordering the hose opening, on the peripheral region, bordering the associated inlet opening, of the cartridge or of the cartridge adapter. The sanitary fitting configured according to this proposal of the invention also has a fitting housing which has a housing interior into which a cartridge or a cartridge adapter having a cartridge in a cartridge receptacle is inserted in an insertion direction as far as an insertion stop. This cartridge adapter has a cartridge receptacle which is intended for the insertion of a cartridge. At least one fluid is guided through the cartridge, said fluid flowing through the cartridge from at least one inlet opening to at least one outflow opening. With the aid of the cartridge, the desired fluid can be selected, the required quantity can be adjusted and/or its temperature or similar fluid properties can be determined, for example by adding cold and hot water. In this case, the at least one fluid is carried to the cartridge in each case by means of a hose line. In order to allow the fluid coming from the hose line to flow into the cartridge, which is optionally also located in a cartridge adapter, the at least one hose line bears on the cartridge adapter or on the cartridge with its hose connection element. In this case, the hose connection element of the at least one hose line passes, in a retaining position, through a passage opening which is provided in the fitting housing in the sanitary fitting according to this proposal of the invention. A plug-in slot opens into the at least one passage opening, said plug-in slot having, in a slot subregion or at a slot end spaced apart from the passage opening, a plug-in opening. This plug-in opening can have a larger opening cross section compared with the passage opening and additionally or alternatively be peripherally open. If the plug-in opening is, by contrast, formed in a closed manner and has only an opening cross section that is larger compared with the passage opening, this plug-in opening, the passage opening and the plug-in slot connecting to the two openings together are formed in a keyhole-shaped manner. The at least one passage opening is assigned a hose-connection-element receptacle which has a receiving shoulder bordering the passage opening or a receiving bevel. In this case, the hose line assigned to the passage opening is able to be introduced into the passage opening through the plug-in opening via the plug-in slot such that the hose connection element bears on the receiving shoulder or on the receiving bevel in a secured manner counter to the plugging direction by way of a cross-sectional expansion.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In order to form the at least one passage opening in the fitting housing, it is advantageous when at least one retaining flange protrudes into the housing interior from the housing inner circumference of the fitting housing, which retaining flange has at least one of the passage openings and the plug-in slot, assigned thereto, with a plug-in opening.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In this case, the cross-sectional expansion can be formed as an annular shoulder or as an annular flange on the hose connection element of at least one hose line.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In order also to secure the hose connection element retained on the cartridge adapter or on the cartridge against being unintentionally displaced in the region of the passage opening and in order to retain the hose connection element of the at least one hose line in the desired position on the cartridge adapter or on the cartridge, it is advantageous when the annular flange or similar cross-sectional expansion is dimensionally adapted with its outer contour to the clear cross section of the hose-connection-element receptacle.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this case, in a preferred embodiment according to the invention, the hose connection element is retained on the cartridge, on the cartridge adapter or on the retaining flange such that the end face, remote from the hose line, of the annular flange is arranged approximately in or beneath the plane formed by the inner side of the cartridge, of the cartridge adapter or of the retaining flange.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">By contrast, in another advantageous embodiment according to the invention, the hose connection element is formed in a spherical or drop-shaped manner at its free end. If the free end, bearing on an associated inlet opening of the cartridge, of the hose connection element is spherical or drop-shaped, certain misalignments of the hose connection element or manufacturing tolerances can be compensated in this joint-ball-like region between the hose connection element, for the one part, and the region, bordering the inlet opening, of the cartridge, for the other part.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Such compensation of misalignments or manufacturing tolerances is made even easier when the receiving bevel is in the form of a spherical cap in order to receive the spherical or drop-shaped hose connection element. In this way, the hose connection element, for the one part, and the receiving bevel of the hose-connection-element receptacle can cooperate in a ball-joint-like manner in the region of the passage opening.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In order for it to be possible to connect the hose opening, bordered by the hose connection element, for the one part, and the associated inlet opening on the cartridge, for the other part, together and in order to avoid unintentional leaks in this region of the sanitary fitting, it is advantageous when the hose connection element and the adjacent inlet opening of the cartridge are sealed off by means of a ring seal.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this case, the position of the ring seal can be fixed in a simple manner when this ring seal passes regionally into the associated hose-connection-element receptacle such that the ring seal is secured in the hose-connection-element receptacle.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">If fluids having different fluid properties are intended to withdrawn from the sanitary fitting according to the invention, and if either boiling water or carbonated water is intended to be withdrawn from the sanitary fitting according to the invention in addition to hot and cold water, it is advantageous when at least two hose lines are retained on the cartridge, on the cartridge adapter or on the fitting housing.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In order to configure the liquid passage between the hose connection element, for the one part, and the cartridge, for the other part, in a liquid-tight manner toward the outside, and in order to avoid leakage flows in the connection region between the hose connection element and the adjacent inlet opening of the cartridge, it may be advantageous when the hose connection element and the adjacent inlet opening of the cartridge are sealed off radially and/or axially by means of a ring seal.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Axial sealing between the hose connection element and the adjacent cartridge can be brought about in a simple manner when a sealing ring in the form of a ring seal is clamped in place between the free end face, bordering the hose opening, of the hose connection element and the adjacent peripheral region, bordering the associated inlet opening, of the cartridge. In this embodiment, the free end face of the hose connection element bears, with the aid of the sealing ring, on the adjacent peripheral region, bordering the associated inlet opening, of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In order additionally or alternatively to establish radial sealing between the hose connection element and the adjacent peripheral region, bordering the associated inlet opening, of the cartridge, in a further advantageous exemplary embodiment of the invention, the cartridge has a receiving cavity in the form of a hose-connection-element receptacle, and the ring seal is provided between the hose connection element, for the one part, and the circumferential wall, bordering the receiving cavity, of the cartridge, for the other part.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Developments according to the invention will become apparent from the following description of the figures in conjunction with the claims and the drawing.

The sanitary fitting <b>201</b> previously known from the prior art has a fitting housing <b>202</b> in the form of a hollow body, into the housing interior <b>203</b> of which a cartridge adapter <b>204</b> has been inserted in an insertion direction Pf<b>1</b> as far as an insertion stop <b>205</b>. The cartridge adapter <b>204</b> has a cartridge receptacle <b>206</b> in the form of a blind hole, which is intended for the insertion of a cartridge that is not illustrated in more detail here. Through the cartridge, at least one fluid, in particular cold and/or hot water, is able to be passed from at least one inlet opening of the cartridge to at least one outflow opening, wherein the quantity or at least one property of the fluid, for example its temperature, can be adjusted in the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this case, the at least one fluid is carried to the cartridge of the previously known sanitary fitting via at least one hose line <b>208</b>. This hose line <b>208</b> bears on the cartridge adapter <b>204</b> with a hose connection element <b>209</b> of the hose line <b>208</b> such that the fluid carried in the at least one hose line <b>208</b> can be conducted into the cartridge via the hose connection element <b>209</b> and the cartridge adapter <b>204</b>. To this end, at least one hose retainer <b>210</b> protrudes in the housing interior <b>203</b> of the fitting housing <b>202</b>, said hose retainer <b>210</b> being integrally formed on the housing inner circumference of the fitting housing <b>202</b>. This at least one hose retainer <b>210</b> is passed through by at least one introduction opening <b>211</b>, through which in each case one hose line <b>208</b> is able to be introduced.
