By combining a location determination system (e.g., the global positioning system (GPS)) data with on-board monitoring data, it is possible to record and map where a vehicle is located, how fast the vehicle is traveling or a rate of acceleration associated with the vehicle, how the vehicle is being driven (e.g., directly, based on indications of driver operation such as application of brake or gas pedals, or indirectly, e.g., high acceleration values may correlate to poor driving behavior), and, in some examples, cross reference that information with how the vehicle is operating internally.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Currently, comparing telematics data from one vehicle's turn through an intersection to other vehicles' turns through the same intersection (i.e., to determine how the vehicle's acceleration, speed, braking, cornering, etc., through the intersection compares to other vehicles' acceleration, speed, braking, cornering, etc. through the intersection) can be a processor-intensive task, especially when there are many vehicle trips and many intersections involved. Moreover, some of this processing is ultimately fruitless, as some vehicle trips that initially appear to include a turn through the intersection may actually be trips that do not include a traversal through the intersection at all, or trips that include a U-turn through the intersection or a turn into a parking lot prior to the intersection, i.e., such that comparison to other vehicles' actual turns through the intersection is not relevant.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an aspect, a computer-implemented method is provided, comprising: obtaining, by one or more processors, telematics data associated with a vehicle trip;

By eliminating vehicle trips that do not include the particular turn using less processor-intensive steps first, the overall processing power and time required for this method may be decreased, as only the vehicle trips that are most likely to include the particular turn through the particular intersection are subjected to the more processor-heavy steps.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an example, telematics data from a vehicle's trip may be obtained. In some examples, a simplified line may be generated based on the telematics data from the vehicle's trip. For example, the average simplified line may be generated using methods described by U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17/188,767, entitled &#x201c;SYSTEMS AND METHODS OF COLLAPSE OF DRIVING DATA TO DETERMINE SPATIAL AVERAGES OF VEHICLE PATHS WITHIN AN INTERSECTION,&#x201d; the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. The first step (i.e., the first &#x2018;test&#x201d;) involves applying a shape (e.g., box, circle, etc.) or other boundary representing the general area of the intersection to the telematics data from the vehicle to isolate vehicle telematics data points that are within the shape. That is, spatial data representative of a boundary associated with a particular intersection may be obtained and compared to simplified line to determine where the simplified line crosses (i.e., intersects with) the boundary. Generally speaking, if the telematics data from the vehicle's trip does not fall within the shape (i.e., if vehicle telematics data points are within the shape), the vehicle did not travel through the intersection, and no further steps are needed for analysis of that particular trip. Consequently, in some examples, if the telematics data from a particular vehicle trip fails this first &#x201c;test,&#x201d; there is no need to expend any further processing power to analyze the telematics data from that particular vehicle trip.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">If at least some of vehicle telematics data from the trip does fall within the boundary and/or shape associated with the intersection, the second step (i.e., the second &#x201c;test&#x201d;) involves comparing the isolated vehicle telematics data from the vehicle trip that is associated with the intersection (i.e., a simplified line generated based on the isolated vehicle telematics data from the vehicle trip that falls within the shape or boundary) to vector lines that are perpendicular to the flow of traffic and generally represent entrances and exits of the intersection. For instance, for a simple intersection in which two roads intersect, there may be four such vector lines, and for an intersection in which three roads intersect, there may be six such vector lines, etc. Furthermore, generally speaking, if the simplified line generated based on the isolated vehicle telematics data from the vehicle trip that falls within the shape or boundary does not intersect with two vector lines that represent a turn (i.e., if the simplified line does not intersect with any of the vector lines, if the simplified line only intersects with one vector line, etc.), then the vehicle likely did not turn through the intersection and no further steps are needed for analysis of that particular trip. Consequently, in some examples, even if the telematics data from a particular vehicle trip passes the first &#x201c;test&#x201d;, if this telematics data fails this second &#x201c;test,&#x201d; there is no need to expend any further processing power analyzing the telematics data from that particular vehicle trip.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Finally, if the simplified line generated based on the isolated vehicle telematics data from the vehicle trip that falls within the shape or boundary intersects with two vector lines that represent a turn, the final step involves comparing the telematics data from the vehicle trip to an average spatial path of turns that intersect the same two vector lines made by other vehicles. If a simplified line generated based on the isolated vehicle telematics data from the vehicle trip that falls within the shape or boundary differs from the average spatial path of the turn through the intersection by more than a threshold amount, then the vehicle's trip through the intersection may be flagged as invalid and may be accordingly excluded from analytics that focus on valid trips through the intersection.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Once it is determined that the vehicle made a valid trip through the intersection (e.g., the vehicle's line passes all three &#x201c;tests&#x201d; or &#x201c;checks&#x201d;), the telematics data from the vehicle's turn through the intersection can be effectively compared to average telematics data from other vehicles that made the same turn. In other words, the raw telematics data points over the same time period as the simplified line of the vehicle's traversal through the intersection, which indicate the vehicle's acceleration data, speed data, braking data, etc., through the intersection, may be compared to averages of these values from other vehicles that made the same turn through the same intersection. Specifically, once the simplified line is validated, indicating that the vehicle's trip through the intersection matches a particular turn, the raw data points from the vehicle's trip through the intersection may be isolated by extracting them from the full raw data table by time range associated with the simplified line, segment. These raw points may be further isolated by being within the shape of the bounding box of the intersection. These points may then be aggregated to determine the average, minimum and maximum acceleration values of the vehicle's trip through the intersection. These values may be compared to the corresponding average values of vehicles making that turn to identify outliers who may be a higher risk.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Advantageously, the processing power required for each &#x201c;test&#x201d; is only used when the vehicle telematics data from a particular vehicle trip &#x201c;passes&#x201d; all previous tests, and the processing power required for the analysis and comparison to other vehicles' turns through the intersection is only used when the telematics data from a particular vehicle trip passes all three &#x201c;tests.&#x201d; In this way, the processing power and processing time required for comparing telematics data from one vehicle's turn through an intersection to other vehicles' turns through the same intersection is greatly reduced because only relevant turns are ultimately compared to one another.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of an example system <b>100</b> for determining whether a vehicle has traversed an intersection, in accordance with some embodiments.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a shape or other boundary <b>202</b> representing the general area of an intersection of interest may be compared to the telematics data points associated with the vehicle trip, in order to isolate any vehicle telematics data points associated with the particular vehicle trip that fall within the shape or other boundary <b>202</b>. For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, all data points <b>205</b> are vehicle telematics data points from various vehicles that fall within the shape or other boundary <b>202</b>. If this attempt fails (i.e., if none of the telematics data points associated with the vehicle trip fall within the shape or other boundary <b>202</b>), then executing the intersection traversal determination application <b>116</b> may include ceasing the analysis of the vehicle trip with respect to the particular intersection of interest.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">If one or more vehicle telematics data points associated with the particular vehicle trip do fall within the shape or other boundary <b>202</b>, then executing the intersection traversal determination application <b>116</b> may include generating a simplified line using the vehicle telematics data points associated with the particular vehicle trip that fall within the shape or other boundary <b>202</b> and comparing this simplified line to vector lines <b>204</b> that represent possible entrances and/or exits of the intersection of interest. These vector lines <b>204</b> may be generally perpendicular (or close to perpendicular, i.e., 80-100 degrees) to the flow of traffic through the intersection, and comparing the simplified line to the vector lines <b>204</b> may include determining if the simplified line intersects with any of the vector lines <b>204</b>. If the simplified line does not intersect with at least one vector line <b>204</b> representing an entrance into the intersection and at least one vector line <b>204</b> representing an exit from the intersection, then executing the intersection traversal determination application <b>116</b> may include ceasing the analysis of the vehicle trip with respect to the particular intersection of interest.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">If the simplified line intersects with at least one vector line <b>204</b> representing an entrance into the intersection and at least one vector line <b>204</b> representing an exit from the intersection, then executing the intersection traversal determination application <b>116</b> may include comparing the simplified line to an average vehicle path <b>206</b> through the intersection using the same entrance and the same exit. For instance, if the simplified line intersects with a North entrance to the intersection and an East exit from the intersection, the simplified line may be compared to an average path of vehicles that enter the intersection via the North entrance and exit the intersection via the East exit. Comparing the simplified line to the average vehicle path <b>206</b> through the intersection using the same entrance and the same exit may include calculating a spatial distance between the simplified line and the average vehicle path <b>206</b> through the intersection using the same entrance and the same exit, and determining whether the spatial distance is greater than a threshold spatial distance. In some examples, calculating this spatial distance includes calculating a Hausdorff distance or a Fr&#xe9;chet distance between the two lines. Generally speaking, a Hausdorff distance, or Hausdorff metric, also called Pompeiu-Hausdorff distance, measures how far two subsets of a metric space are from each other, and a Fr&#xe9;chet distance is a measure of similarity between curves that takes into account the location and ordering of the points along the curves. In any case, if the spatial distance between the simplified line and the average vehicle path <b>206</b> through the intersection using a particular entrance and exit is greater than the threshold spatial distance, the vehicle likely did not make the turn of interest through the intersection using that particular entrance and exit. Accordingly, if the spatial distance between the simplified line and the average vehicle path <b>206</b> through the intersection using a particular entrance and exit is greater than the threshold spatial distance, then executing the intersection traversal determination application <b>116</b> may include ceasing the analysis of the vehicle trip with respect to the particular intersection of interest.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">If the spatial distance between the simplified line and the average vehicle path <b>206</b> through the intersection using a particular entrance and exit is less than the threshold spatial distance, then the vehicle likely made the turn of interest through the intersection using that particular entrance and exit. Accordingly, executing the intersection traversal determination application <b>116</b> may include comparing the isolated telematics data points from the vehicle trip that fall within the shape or boundary associated with the intersection to telematics data from other vehicles that traversed the intersection using the same entrance and exit. For instance, in this case, executing the intersection traversal determination application <b>116</b> may include comparing an average acceleration, speed, measure of braking, and/or measure of cornering associated with the isolated telematics data points from the vehicle trip that fall within the shape or boundary associated with the intersection to an average acceleration, speed, measure of braking, and/or measure of cornering of other vehicles through the same turn of the intersection.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">This comparison may be used to assess how the driver's acceleration, speed, braking, cornering, etc., through the intersection during that vehicle trip compares to that of other drivers that have made the same turn, i.e., to determine whether the driver operated the vehicle more or less safely on average compared to other drivers during that vehicle trip. For example, drivers who operate their vehicles more safely on average compared to other drivers who make the same maneuvers may be eligible for discounts. In some examples, executing the intersection traversal determination application <b>116</b> may include generating warnings, guidance, or other notifications to drivers who operate their vehicles less safely on average compared to other drivers who make the same maneuvers.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, the computer-readable instructions stored on the memory <b>114</b> may include instructions for carrying out any of the steps of the method <b>300</b>, described in greater detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a flow diagram of an example method <b>300</b> for determining whether a vehicle has traversed an intersection, in accordance with some embodiments.

For instance, obtaining the telematics data associated with a particular trip made by a particular vehicle may include accessing a vehicle telematics database <b>115</b> that stores telematics data associated with various trips made by various vehicles <b>102</b>. For example, as discussed above, vehicle computing devices <b>106</b> associated with vehicles <b>102</b> may send telematics data or other measurements captured by sensors <b>104</b> to a computing device <b>108</b> via the network <b>110</b>. The computing device <b>108</b> (i.e., the computing device executing the steps of the method <b>300</b>) may store this telematics data locally and/or may store the telematics data in the database <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A shape or other boundary representing an area associated with a particular intersection may be compared (block <b>304</b>) to the telematics data associated with the particular vehicle trip to attempt to isolate one or more telematics data points of the telematics data associated with the vehicle trip that fall within the intersection. In other words, if any portion of the vehicle trip that is associated with the particular intersection, the telematics data points associated with that portion of the vehicle trip may be isolated from the telematics data points from other portions of the vehicle trip. If none of the telematics data points associated with the vehicle trip fall within the shape or boundary representing the area associated with the particular intersection (block <b>306</b>, NO), then the vehicle trip likely did not include any traversals of that particular intersection, and the method <b>300</b> may end without any further processing steps.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In contrast, if at least one of the telematics data points associated with the vehicle trip falls within the shape or boundary representing the area associated with the particular intersection (block <b>306</b>, YES), then the vehicle trip may have included a traversal of that particular intersection. Any telematics data points associated with the vehicle trip that fall within the shape or boundary representing the area associated with the particular intersection may be isolated and compared (block <b>308</b>) to a plurality of vector lines representing entrances and exits of the intersection to attempt to identify both an entrance of the intersection and an exit of the intersection associated with the vehicle trip. For instance, the vector lines representing the entrances and exits of the intersection may generally be oriented perpendicular to the flow of traffic through the intersection. In some examples, comparing the isolated telematics data points that fall within the area of the particular intersection to the vector lines may include generating a simplified line based on the isolated telematics data points that fall within the area of the particular intersection, and determining whether the simplified line intersects with any of the vector lines representing the entrances and exits of the intersection. For instance, if the simplified line does not intersect any of the vector lines representing entrances and exits of the intersection, or if the simplified line only intersects with one of the vector lines representing entrances and exits of the intersection, then the vehicle trip likely did not include a traversal through that particular intersection (block <b>310</b>, NO), and the method <b>300</b> may end without any further processing steps.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In contrast, if the simplified line generated based on the isolated telematics data points that fall within the shape or boundary associated with the intersection intersects both a vector line representing an entrance of the intersection and a vector line representing an exit of the intersection (block <b>310</b>, YES), then the vehicle trip may include a traversal through that particular intersection. Based on identifying both an entrance of the intersection and an exit of the intersection associated with the vehicle trip, the simplified line generated based on the isolated telematics data points that fall within the shape or boundary associated with the intersection may be compared (block <b>312</b>) to an average simplified line representing trips of other vehicles through the same entrance and exit of the same intersection, i.e., to determine whether the particular vehicle turned through the particular intersection. For instance, if the simplified line generated based on the isolated telematics data points that fall within the shape or boundary associated with the intersection differs from the average simplified line representing the trips of other vehicles through the same entrance and exit of the same intersection by greater than a threshold degree, then the vehicle trip likely did not include a traversal through that entrance and exit of the intersection (block <b>314</b>, NO), and the method <b>300</b> may end without any further processing steps. For instance, in some examples, a discrepancy or deviation may indicate that the vehicle may have made a U-turn, or may have turned into a parking lot near the intersection. Moreover, in some examples, a discrepancy or deviation may indicate that the vehicle may be driving unsafely or erratically through the intersection. In any case, however, a large discrepancy or deviation may indicate that the simplified line may be difficult to compare to an average simplified line representing the trips of other vehicles through the same entrance and exit of the same intersection for the purposes of comparing the vehicle's telematics data to telematics data associated with other vehicles that traveled through the same intersection.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In contrast, if the simplified line generated based on the isolated telematics data points that fall within the shape or boundary associated with the intersection differs from the average simplified line representing the trips of other vehicles through the same entrance and exit of the same intersection by less than the threshold degree, the vehicle trip likely did include a traversal through that entrance and exit of the intersection (block <b>314</b>, YES). Based on determining that the vehicle trip likely did include a traversal through that entrance and exit of the intersection, the isolated telematics data points that fall within the shape or boundary associated with the intersection may be compared (block <b>316</b>) to telematics data associated with the trips of other vehicles through the same entrance and exit of the same intersection. For instance, an average acceleration, speed, measure of braking, and/or measure of cornering associated with the isolated telematics data points from the vehicle trip that fall within the shape or boundary associated with the intersection may be compared to an average acceleration, speed, measure of braking, and/or measure of cornering of other vehicles through the same turn of the intersection.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">This comparison may be used to assess how the driver's acceleration, speed, braking, cornering, etc., through the intersection during that vehicle trip compares to that of other drivers that have made the same turn, i.e., to determine whether the driver operated the vehicle more or less safely on average compared to other drivers during that vehicle trip. For example, drivers who operate their vehicles more safely on average compared to other drivers who make similar maneuvers may be eligible for discounts. As another example, the method <b>300</b> may include generating warnings, guidance, or other notifications to drivers who operate their vehicles less safely on average compared to other drivers who make similar maneuvers.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">With the foregoing, an insurance customer may opt-in to a rewards, insurance discount, or other type of program.

The detailed description is to be construed as exemplary only and does not describe every possible embodiment, as describing every possible embodiment would be impractical, if not impossible. One could implement numerous alternate embodiments, using either current technology or technology developed after the filing date of this patent, which would still fall within the scope of the claims.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Throughout this specification, plural instances may implement components, operations, or structures described as a single instance. Although individual operations of one or more methods are illustrated and described as separate operations, one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently, and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated. Structures and functionality presented as separate components in example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly, structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations, modifications, additions, and improvements fall within the scope of the subject matter herein.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Additionally, certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of routines, subroutines, applications, or instructions. These may constitute either software (e.g., code embodied on a non-transitory, machine-readable medium) or hardware. In hardware, the routines, etc., are tangible units capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more hardware modules of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In various embodiments, a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that may be permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that may be temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Accordingly, the term &#x201c;hardware module&#x201d; should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired), or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware modules comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor, for example, to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Hardware modules may provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware modules. Accordingly, the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connect the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example, one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it may be communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and may operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations.

The modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented modules.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Similarly, the methods or routines described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor-implemented hardware modules.

In some example embodiments, the processor or processors may be located in a single location (e.g., within an office environment, or as a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Unless specifically stated otherwise, discussions herein using words such as &#x201c;processing,&#x201d; &#x201c;computing,&#x201d; &#x201c;calculating,&#x201d; &#x201c;determining,&#x201d; &#x201c;presenting,&#x201d; &#x201c;displaying,&#x201d; or the like may refer to actions or processes of a machine (e.g., a computer) that manipulates or transforms data represented as physical (e.g., electronic, magnetic, or optical) quantities within one or more memories (e.g., volatile memory, non-volatile memory, or a combination thereof), registers, or other machine components that receive, store, transmit, or display information.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As used herein any reference to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; means that a particular element, feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment may be included in at least one embodiment.
