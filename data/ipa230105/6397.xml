No. 11,387,608), which claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/886,048, filed on Aug. 13, 2019, the entireties of which are incorporation herein by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to an electrical wiring device with a flexible terminal for eliminating connection to ground.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Standards governing the operation of load control circuits (e.g., dimmers, switches, etc.) electric wiring devices prohibit current introduction on equipment grounding conductors during normal operation. In this context, the electrical wiring device must instead be connected to the neutral wire. The standards, however, provide an exception for load control circuits installed in retrofit applications. Thus, under industry standards, load control circuits can only draw current from grounding conductors in retrofit applications.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Providing separate electrical wiring devices for different applications (i.e., retrofit/non-retrofit) is cumbersome and inefficient, requiring consumers to know beforehand which product to purchase and increasing the required expertise and planning order to purchase the correct device. Accordingly, there exists a need in the art for a single electrical wiring device that permits selective contact with a ground circuit, allowing a consumer to select between providing as a reference for the load control circuit, an earth ground in retrofit applications or the neutral wire in non-retrofit applications.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The various examples described in this disclosure can be combined in any technical way possible.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect, an electrical wiring system providing selectable referencing to earth ground, includes a housing comprising a first terminal for attachment to HOT, a second terminal for attachment to LOAD, and a flexible terminal comprising a first leg mounted to the electrical wiring device and a second leg connected to the first leg via a flexible joint, wherein the relative distance between the first leg and the second leg is adjustable between an extended position and a retracted position by flexing the flexible joint, the flexible joint being biased in the extended position, wherein the first leg defines a first aperture and the second leg defines a second aperture, a load control circuit disposed within the housing and receiving a line input from the first terminal and a reference input, the reference input being referenced to the electric potential of the flexible terminal; and a screw having a screw head, the screw being inserted through the first aperture and the second aperture, the screw, at least in part, maintaining the first leg and second leg in fixed relation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an example, the electrical wiring system further includes a pressure plate having a threaded aperture, the threaded aperture being engaged with the threads of the screw, the pressure plate and the screw head being disposed on opposite sides of the flexible terminal such that advancing the pressure plate along the threads of the screw toward the head of the screw draws the flexible terminal from the extended position toward the retracted position.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an example, one of the first aperture or second aperture is threaded.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an example, the electrical wiring system further includes a grounding circuit.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an example, the flexible terminal is positioned with respect to the grounding circuit such that adjusting the relative distance between the first leg and second leg away from the retracted position establishes contact between the grounding circuit and the second leg when the electrical wiring device is installed in a wall box.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an example, the flexible terminal is positioned with respect to the grounding circuit such that adjusting the relative distance between the first leg and second leg toward the retracted position establishes contact between the grounding circuit and the second leg when the electrical wiring device is installed in a wall box.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an example, the grounding circuit comprises one of a grounded frame or the wall box.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an example, the grounding circuit comprises a ground wire.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an example, the first leg is mounted to a PCB upon which the load control circuit is disposed.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an example, the electrical wiring system further includes a terminal for attachment to neutral.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another aspect, an electrical wiring device providing selectable referencing to earth ground, includes a housing comprising a first terminal for attachment to HOT, a second terminal for attachment to LOAD, and a flexible terminal comprising a first leg mounted to the electrical wiring device and a second leg connected to the first leg via a flexible joint, wherein the relative distance between the first leg and the second leg is adjustable between an extended position and a retracted position by flexing the flexible joint, the flexible joint being biased in the extended position, wherein the second leg defines an opening dimensioned to receive a conductor of a neutral wire such that a force applied through insertion of the neutral wire presses the flexible terminal through a predetermined path toward the retracted position; and a load control circuit disposed within the housing and receiving a line input from the first terminal and a reference input, the reference input being referenced to the electric potential of the flexible terminal.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an example, the opening is a slotted opening.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an example, the slotted opening is defined by a first interior surface of a first arm of the second leg and by a second interior surface of a second arm of the second leg, the first arm and second arm each twisting such that, at a free end of the second leg, the first interior surface and the second interior surface face outward with respect to the housing, wherein the force applied through insertion of the neutral wire causes the slot to narrow such that the first interior surface and the second interior surface grasp a surface of the conductor of the neutral wire.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an example, the electrical wiring device further includes a retaining lip arranged in the predetermined path of the second leg, the retaining lip comprising a ramped forward surface such that the distal end of the second leg is drawn across the ramped surface of the retaining lip as it progresses through the predetermined path and being captured behind a rear surface of the retaining lip, preventing the second leg from returning to the extended position.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to another aspect, a method for selecting an electrical reference of an electrical wiring device, includes the steps of: adjusting a relative distance between a first leg and a second leg of a flexible terminal, the first leg and second leg being joined by a flexible joint, so as to isolate the second leg from a grounding circuit when the electrical wiring device is installed in a wall box, wherein a load control circuit disposed within a housing of the electrical wiring device is electrically referenced to an electric potential of the flexible terminal; and establishing contact between a neutral wire and the flexible terminal such that the load control circuit is electrically referenced to the neutral wire.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an example, the method further includes adjusting the relative distance so as to isolate the second leg from the grounding circuit comprises increasing the relative distance between the first leg and the second leg.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an example, the method further includes adjusting the relative distance so as to isolate the second leg from the grounding circuit comprises decreasing the relative distance between the first leg and the second leg.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an example, the relative distance is maintained in fixed relation via a fastener.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an example, the fastener is one of a screw, a clamp, or a sleeve.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an example, the fastener comprises a screw and a pressure plate, the screw being inserted through a first aperture in the first leg and a second aperture in the second leg.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an example, a head of the screw and the pressure plate are disposed on opposing sides of the flexible terminal.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an example, the relative distance between the first leg and second leg is maintained in fixed relation through retaining the second leg against a retaining lip.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an example, an electrical wiring device permitting selective reference to earth ground includes: a flexible terminal comprising a first leg and second leg being joined by a flexible joint such that a relative distance between the first leg and the second leg is adjustable to permit selective isolation from or contact with a grounding circuit when the electrical wiring device is installed in a wall box; and a load control circuit disposed within a housing of the electrical wiring device, the load control circuit electrically referenced to an electric potential of the flexible terminal.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an example, the relative distance is maintained in

INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to the figures there is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> a flexible terminal <b>100</b> that can be disposed on an electrical wiring device, permitting selective contact with a ground circuit in retrofit applications, and, conversely, selective removal of contact with a ground circuit in non-retrofit applications. By selectively contacting the flexible terminal <b>100</b> with a ground circuit, the installer of the electrical wiring device can thus elect to electrically reference the electrical wiring device to ground circuit in retrofit applications. Furthermore, flexible terminal <b>100</b> permits selective contact with a neutral wire. In this manner, flexible terminal <b>100</b> functions as a single-pole double-throw switch permitting the user to optionally select whether to reference the load control circuit to earth ground to the neutral wire.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the flexible terminal <b>100</b> comprises a first leg <b>102</b> and a second leg <b>104</b>. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows, first leg <b>102</b> can be seated in the PCB <b>106</b> via, e.g., through-hole mounting (although any suitable mounting may be used), and can be in electrical communication with a load control circuit (e.g., a dimmer) disposed on the PCB <b>106</b>, so as to provide a voltage reference (by either the connected ground circuit or the neutral wire) to the load control circuit. The second leg <b>104</b> extends from and is connected to the first leg <b>102</b> by way of a flexible joint <b>108</b>, such that the first leg <b>102</b> and the second leg <b>104</b> can be drawn toward one another in a retracted position or away from one another in an extended position. In one example, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> discussed below, the first leg <b>102</b> and the second leg <b>104</b> can be drawn together such that they are in mutual contact. The ability to adjust the extension of the second leg <b>104</b> by flexing the flexible joint <b>108</b> permits the selective contact with the ground circuit.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, second leg <b>104</b> extends away from a housing <b>110</b> of the electrical wiring device in which PCB <b>106</b> is disposed. When installed in conjunction with a wall box and/or frame, second leg <b>104</b> can extend away from the housing <b>110</b> so as to contact a ground circuit (such as a grounding wire or a grounding frame) or be drawn toward the housing such that the second leg <b>104</b> ceases to contact the ground circuit. It should be understood that, in various alternative examples, first leg <b>102</b> need not be mounted to PCB <b>106</b>, but rather can be mounted to housing <b>110</b> or any structure disposed within housing <b>110</b>. In these alternative examples, the circuit disposed on PCB <b>106</b> is still in electrical communication with and referenced to the electric potential of the first leg.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As described above, the relative distance between the first leg <b>102</b> and the second leg <b>104</b>, and, consequently, the position of the second leg <b>104</b> with respect to the electrical wiring device (and the housing <b>110</b>) can be adjusted by flexing the flexible joint <b>108</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> depicts flexible terminal <b>100</b> as mounted on PCB <b>106</b> (with the housing <b>110</b> not shown) in contact with a ground circuit (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, the grounded frame <b>112</b>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> depicts flexible terminal <b>100</b> not in contact with a ground circuit. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> depicts the flexible terminal <b>100</b> in a position extended toward the extended position such that second leg <b>104</b> is in electrical contact with grounded frame <b>112</b>, thereby referencing the load control circuit to earth ground. In the retracted position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the flexible terminal <b>100</b> is retracted toward PCB <b>106</b> thus isolating flexible terminal <b>100</b> from electrical contact with the grounded frame <b>112</b> and removing grounded frame <b>112</b> as the electrical reference. In its place, the neutral wire in the wall box is placed in electrical contact with first leg <b>102</b>, thus referencing the load control circuit to the neutral wire. Thus, if a neutral wire <b>114</b> is available (e.g., during installations other than retrofitting a two-wire load control), the flexible terminal <b>100</b> is retracted from the ground circuit and placed in contact with the neutral wire; whereas, if a neutral wire is not available (e.g., retrofitting a two-wire load control) the flexible terminal <b>100</b> is placed in contact with the grounding circuit.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">It should be understood that the retracted position refers to the position of maximum retraction, that is the position in which second leg <b>104</b> is drawn nearest to first leg <b>102</b>. In some examples, in the retracted position, second leg <b>104</b> will be in contact with first leg <b>102</b>, although this is not true of all examples. Furthermore, the extended position refers to the natural position of extension as enacted by the bias of flexible terminal <b>100</b>. It should be understood that a range of positions exist between the retracted position and extended position.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">As will be described in more detail below, the relative distance between the first leg <b>102</b> and second <b>104</b> can be maintained in fixed relation through a fastener or retaining lip. This permits retaining of the flexible terminal, after installation, in contact with the grounding circuit, or, alternately, isolated from the grounding circuit. In various examples described throughout this disclosure, a fastener can be, for example, a screw (with or without a pressure plate), a clamp, or a sleeve. Similarly, a retaining lip can be any surface within or without the housing <b>110</b> positioned to abut and restrain movement of second leg <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">One such example of a fastener is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> as the combination of a pressure plate <b>116</b> and a screw <b>118</b> extending through a first aperture <b>122</b> in the first leg <b>102</b> and a second aperture <b>124</b> in the second leg <b>104</b>. The pressure plate <b>116</b> and screw head <b>120</b> may be disposed on opposite sides of the flexible terminal <b>100</b> in order to impart the mechanical force on the flexible terminal <b>100</b>. In other words, in an example, the screw <b>118</b> is inserted through the first aperture <b>122</b> and the second aperture <b>124</b> such that the screw head <b>120</b> is disposed at an outer surface of the second leg <b>104</b>, whereas the pressure plate <b>116</b>, which comprises a threaded aperture to receive the screw <b>118</b>, can be disposed at the outer surface of the first leg <b>102</b>. (In an alternative example, pressure plate <b>116</b> can be disposed at an outer surface of the second leg <b>104</b> and screw head <b>120</b> may be disposed at an outer surface of the first leg <b>102</b>.) As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, when the screw <b>118</b> and pressure plate <b>116</b> are apart (i.e., the pressure plate <b>116</b> is not advanced as far along the threads of the screw <b>118</b> toward screw head <b>120</b>), the flexible terminal <b>100</b> is permitted to extend, according to the bias, toward or into the extended position such that it contacts grounded frame <b>112</b>. Conversely, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> when the screw <b>118</b> and pressure plate <b>116</b> are drawn together by advancing the pressure plate <b>116</b> along the threads of screw <b>118</b> toward screw head <b>120</b>, second leg is retracted toward or into the retracted position, isolating flexible terminal <b>100</b> from contact with grounded frame <b>112</b>. Screw <b>118</b> and pressure plate <b>116</b> thus function to maintain the first leg <b>102</b> and second leg <b>104</b> in fixed relation, and, more specifically, in a position which either contacts the grounding circuit or isolates the flexible terminal <b>100</b> from the grounding circuit.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, neutral wire <b>114</b> can be brought into electrical contact with flexible terminal by grasping neutral wire <b>114</b> between pressure plate <b>116</b> and first leg <b>102</b>. Thus, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, where the electrical wiring device is installed in non-retrofit applications, neutral wire <b>114</b> and pressure plate <b>116</b> can be used to clamp neutral wire <b>114</b> against first leg <b>102</b>, thus referencing the load control circuit to the neutral wire <b>114</b> rather than grounded frame <b>112</b>. It should, however, be understood that, in alternative examples, neutral wire <b>114</b> can be placed in electrical contact with flexible terminal <b>100</b> in other ways. For example, neutral wire <b>114</b> can be positioned so that second leg <b>104</b> contacts it when being drawing into or toward the retracted position. In yet another example, electrical wiring device can include a dedicated neutral terminal, separate from flexible terminal <b>100</b>, that can receive neutral wire when one is available. In this example, two terminals are provided, one for selectively contacting grounded frame <b>112</b> and the other for attachment of a neutral wire <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">For the purposes of this disclosure, a screw is any threaded fastener with which the threaded aperture of pressure plate <b>116</b> can engage and be used to adjust the position of the second leg <b>104</b> with the first leg <b>102</b>. It should further be understood that the mechanical force to either place the flexible terminal <b>100</b> in the retracted position or in the extended position may be implemented by any suitable fastener. For example, in an alternative example, as mentioned above, the mechanical force to draw the flexible terminal <b>100</b> into the retracted positioned position can be implemented by a clamp or sleeve, rather than a screw <b>118</b> and pressure plate <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Furthermore, in alternative examples, the flexible terminal <b>100</b> can be biased in the retracted position and may be drawn apart by a separator rather than a screw <b>118</b> and pressure plate <b>116</b>. (In this example, there is no &#x201c;extended position&#x201d; as defined by the natural extension of flexible terminal <b>100</b> as enacted by a bias; rather the separator functions to extend the second leg away from the retracted position.) In one example, the separator can be implemented by a pressure plate, which is disposed between the first leg <b>102</b> and second leg <b>104</b>, such that advancing the pressure plate along the threads away from the screw head <b>120</b> separates the first leg <b>102</b> and second leg <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The example described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> depict flexible terminal contacting grounded frame <b>112</b>. This frame and the supporting structure is described in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 10,103,530 B2, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Grounded frame <b>112</b>, however, is only one example of a grounding circuit which flexible terminal <b>100</b> can contact. In other examples, as mentioned above, grounding circuit can be a grounding wire or other any grounded structure. In some examples, the grounding circuit can be part of a structure, such as grounded frame, that is sold or otherwise provided as part of an enclosure for the wiring device (e.g., a grounded wall box).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Furthermore, in alternative examples, the grounding circuit can be positioned with respect to the second leg <b>106</b> such that second leg is brought into contact with grounding circuit by retracting the second leg <b>106</b> toward or into the retracted position and out of contact with the grounding position by extending the second leg <b>104</b> toward or into the extended position (or beyond the extended position in the example in which a separator is used).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, flexible terminal <b>100</b> can be shaped to permit the opposing surfaces disposed about first aperture <b>120</b> and second aperture <b>124</b> to be in mutual contact without stressing the flexible joint <b>108</b>. This can be provided by fashioning the second leg <b>104</b> as, such that, in the retracted position, the second leg <b>104</b> features a lower portion that extends toward the first leg <b>102</b> from the flexible joint <b>108</b>. This portion of the second leg <b>104</b> can take a variety of forms. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref>, this lower portion of the second leg extends in a substantially straight length from arc of the flexible joint toward the first leg <b>102</b>; whereas in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> this lower portion forms a smooth arc from the flexible joint <b>108</b> toward the first leg <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>9</b></figref> depict alternative examples of flexible terminal <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>7</b></figref> depicts an alternative flexible terminal <b>100</b>, in which the lower portion of second leg <b>104</b> is not arced toward first leg <b>102</b>, but rather is planar, such that, in the extended position the first leg <b>102</b> and the second leg <b>104</b> are parallel with each other.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>9</b></figref> flexible terminal <b>100</b> includes a slot <b>126</b> located within the flexible joint <b>108</b> permitting the insertion and grasping of neutral wire <b>114</b> for when the second leg is disconnected from the grounding circuit in non-retrofit applications. Furthermore, the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>9</b></figref> omits the pressure plate, and instead employs threading of the first aperture to permit the screw, through advancement along the threads, to draw the flexible terminal into the retracted position or, conversely, to permit it to open into the extended position. The threading of the first aperture, together with screw <b>118</b>, in this example, functions to maintain a fixed relation between first leg <b>102</b> and second leg <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts an example load control circuit <b>1000</b>&#x2014;a 2-wire dimmer&#x2014;which can alternately be referenced to earth ground or neutral, depending on the context. HOT can be connected to T<b>3</b> (labeled LINE/LOAD) and load can be connected to T<b>1</b> or T<b>2</b>; alternatively, HOT can be connected to T<b>1</b>/T<b>2</b> and load can be connected to T<b>3</b>. As described above, ground is either the neutral wire in normal contexts, or the connected grounding circuit in retrofit applications. In this example, ground <b>1002</b> is used to draw less than 0.5 mA to power the microcontroller in the dead times of the output waveform, i.e., when the load is not drawing power.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">It should be understood that the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is only one example and that load control circuit disposed on the PCB may be any suitable load control circuit. Furthermore, it should be understood that the flexible terminal <b>100</b> may be used in connection with other types of circuits besides load control circuits (e.g., GFCI circuits, switches, dimmers, lighting controls). Indeed, the flexible terminal may be used in connection with any type of circuit for which it is advantageous to selectively contact one of two (or more) reference points.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>14</b></figref> show an alternative example of flexible terminal <b>100</b>, which includes an aperture <b>128</b> dimensioned to receive the conductive portion of the neutral wire <b>114</b>. In this example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, flexible terminal <b>100</b> is biased in an extended position, a portion of the second leg <b>104</b> extending from the housing such that it contacts the grounding circuit (here, grounded frame <b>112</b>). To isolate flexible terminal <b>100</b> from contact with the grounding circuit, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> (in perspective view) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> (in side view, without housing <b>110</b> shown), the conductive portion of the neutral wire <b>114</b> is inserted through and contacts the inner surface of the aperture <b>130</b>. Because the aperture <b>130</b> is only dimensioned to receive the conductor of neutral wire <b>114</b>&#x2014;that is, its width is greater than the diameter of the conductor but less than the diameter of the insulation&#x2014;continuing to press the neutral wire toward the interior of the housing will press the second leg <b>104</b> toward the retracted position, simultaneously breaking contact with the grounded frame <b>112</b> and establishing contact with the neutral wire <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B</figref>, a retaining lip <b>132</b> can be disposed within the housing <b>110</b>. The retaining lip <b>132</b> is positioned in the path of the free end <b>138</b> of the second leg <b>104</b>. The retaining lip <b>132</b> can include a ramped forward surface <b>133</b>, which free end <b>138</b> of the second leg <b>104</b> is drawn across as it moves toward the retracted position. Once the free end <b>138</b> of the second leg moves beyond the retaining lip <b>132</b>, it is prevented from returning toward the extended position, where it would again contact the grounding circuit, by the flat rear surface <b>135</b> of the retaining lip <b>132</b>. As a result, the flexible terminal <b>100</b> is prevented from assuming contact with the grounding circuit. (It should be understood that retaining lip <b>123</b> can assume any shape and be positioned any location suitable for (at the user's selection) abutting and restraining second leg <b>104</b>, and, consequently terminal <b>100</b>, from contacting the grounding circuit.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">While, in various examples, the aperture can assume any suitable shape for establishing contact with the neutral wire <b>114</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>14</b></figref> aperture <b>130</b> can be formed by a slot between arms <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> formed in second leg <b>104</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B</figref> (in which housing <b>110</b> and grounded frame <b>112</b> are not shown for the purpose of clarity), arms <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> twist outward from the fixed end <b>136</b> of second leg <b>104</b> toward the free end <b>138</b>, such that the interior surfaces <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> of the two arms <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>, respectively, face outward with respect to the housing <b>110</b> at the free end <b>138</b> of the second leg <b>104</b>. For the purposes of this disclosure, the fixed end <b>136</b> refers to the end of arms <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> that is fixed to the flexible joint <b>108</b> or to the remainder of the second leg <b>104</b>, and the free end refers to the end of arms <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> opposite the fixed end <b>136</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As the neutral wire <b>114</b> presses the second leg <b>104</b> toward the retracted position, the arms <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> untwist due to the force of the neutral wire on interior surfaces <b>140</b> and <b>142</b>, drawing interior surfaces <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> inward with respect to the housing and narrowing slotted aperture <b>130</b>. As a result of the narrowing of the slot, the interior surfaces <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> of the first arm <b>132</b> and second arm <b>134</b> grasp the neutral wire. Thus, when implemented with the retaining lip <b>132</b>, the effect is that the neutral wire is inserted into the slotted aperture <b>130</b> and used to press the second arm behind the retaining lip <b>132</b>, locking the second leg <b>104</b> in a position toward the retracted position and firmly grasping the neutral wire such that it does not easily come loose after installation.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In an alternative example, second leg <b>104</b> can be implemented without an aperture for receiving the neutral wire <b>114</b>, and simply be manually pressed behind retaining lip <b>132</b> for retaining the second arm toward the retracted position where the second arm <b>104</b> will not contact the grounding circuit.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">It should be understood that the slotted aperture <b>130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>14</b></figref> is only one type of aperture that can be defined in second arm <b>104</b>. In alternative examples, the aperture <b>130</b> can be circular or any other suitable shape for receiving the neutral wire. Furthermore, the twisting of the arms <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> of second leg <b>104</b> function to grasp the neutral as they are turned inward and effect a narrowing of the slot; however, other methods of grasping or otherwise retaining the neutral wire can be implemented.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">It should be understood that, because the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b> and <b>11</b>-<b>14</b></figref> depict a unitary flexible terminal <b>100</b>, the lines that distinguish first leg <b>102</b>, flexible joint <b>108</b>, and second leg <b>104</b> from each can vary. It is not necessary that the structures of these sections be perfectly defined. Indeed, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b> and <b>11</b>-<b>14</b></figref> the relative shapes of the first leg <b>102</b>, second leg <b>104</b>, and flexible joint <b>108</b> can vary between examples. Rather, what is required by these descriptions are two portions that can be drawn toward or away from each other by flexible a portion that connects them, the first portion being mounted to the electrical wiring device and the second portion that can be selectively contacted to the grounding circuit by flexing the flexible portion.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">While several inventive embodiments have been described and illustrated herein, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily envision a variety of other means and/or structures for performing the function and/or obtaining the results and/or one or more of the advantages described herein, and each of such variations and/or modifications is deemed to be within the scope of the inventive embodiments described herein.
