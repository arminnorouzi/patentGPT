function for automatically detecting an area appearing white from a captured image, calculating a white balance coefficient, and applying the calculated white balance coefficient to the entire image area. Some of imaging apparatuses available in markets have a plurality of automatic white balance modes arbitrarily selectable by a user. For example, the modes include a mode in which priority is given to adjusting a light source color to be white, a mode in which priority is given to adjusting a light source such as an incandescent lamp or the like with a reddish color to remain reddish thereby maintaining an original atmosphere of a place where an image is captured, thereby allowing a user to select a finish of an image.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a case where there is a difference between a color temperature of ambient light and a color temperature of a display, which may occur, for example, when a user views a display with a high color temperature while the user is adapted to ambient illumination light with a low color temperature, the user may feel that the blueness of the display is too strong. In view of the above, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2016-95487 discloses a method in which a white point of a display is adjusted to be similar to ambient light based on ambient light information such that a user is allowed to view the display with a preferable color tone.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in the technique disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2016-95487, nothing is considered about the case where there are a plurality of white balance modes that may change the final color tone of an image. Therefore, in this technique, for example, in the mode in which a reddish color is maintained for a light source such as an incandescent lamp, there is a possibility that the redness is too strong against the intention of a user.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an aspect, the disclosure provides an apparatus including at least one processor, and a memory that stores a program which, when executed by the at least one processor, causes the at least processor to function as: an imaging unit, a setting unit configured to set automatic modes which are different in adjustment methods, an adjustment unit configured to adjust a white balance of a signal based on an automatic mode set by the setting unit, a recording control unit configured to record the adjusted signal into a recording unit, a display control unit configured to display the adjusted signal on a display unit, and an acquisition unit configured to acquire ambient light information, wherein the display control unit further adjusts a color balance of the displayed signal based on the set automatic mode and the acquired ambient light information.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a basic configuration of an imaging apparatus.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram showing a white range.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram showing a dependence of a white tracking range on automatic white balance setting.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart of processing performed when an image is captured.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing processing performed when the automatic white balance mode is AWB<b>1</b> and the display mode is DISP<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing processing performed when the automatic white balance mode is AWB<b>2</b> and the display mode is DISP<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing processing performed when the automatic white balance mode is AWB<b>1</b> and the display mode is DISP<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing processing performed when the automatic white balance mode is AWB<b>2</b> and the display mode is DISP<b>2</b>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Embodiments of the present disclosure are described in detail below with reference to accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a basic configuration of an imaging apparatus according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The imaging apparatus <b>100</b> may be a camera such as a digital camera, a digital video camera or the like, or may be an electronic device having a camera function such as a mobile phone with a camera, a computer with a camera, or the like.

Note that at least a part of the functions of the image processing apparatus <b>105</b> may be realized by the CPU <b>103</b> by performing software processing. The image processing apparatus <b>105</b> also performs an automatic white balance adjustment process described later. There is no particular restriction on a manner of sharing roles among a plurality of pieces of hardware. One piece of hardware may function as a plurality of processing units, or a plurality pieces of hardware may cooperate to function as one processing unit.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Next, the automatic white balance adjustment process according to the present embodiment is described. The automatic white balance adjustment process according to the present embodiment is a process of calculating ambient light information from an image obtained by imaging, calculating a white balance adjustment value from the ambient light information, and applying the white balance adjustment value. The automatic white balance adjustment process according to the present embodiment has two control modes one of which is an automatic white balance mode <b>1</b> (hereinafter referred to as AWB<b>1</b>) and the other one of which is an automatic white balance mode <b>2</b> (hereinafter referred to as AWB<b>2</b>). These modes are different in the method of adjusting the white balance, and thus even when these modes are applied to the images captured for the same subject under the same ambient light, different adjustment results are obtained. AWB<b>1</b> is a mode that aims to adjust the light source color to be white (by having same values for RGB colors). On the other hand, AWB<b>2</b> aims to make setting such that a range to be made white by the automatic white balance adjustment is close to a color range to which human eyes are adaptable thereby reproducing a color as perceived by human eyes. When an image captured in the AWB<b>2</b> mode is displayed on a display apparatus adjusted such that a white point corresponds to a color temperate of 6500K, the resultant displayed image has a color tone close to a color perceived by human eyes.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Next, a method of acquiring ambient light information is described. In the present embodiment, the R/G value and B/G value of each pixel are acquired from an image signal value calculated by the image processing apparatus <b>105</b> from an image signal output from the image sensor device <b>102</b>, and average values of those values for pixels located within a predetermined white range are calculated and the resultant values are employed as the ambient light information indicating ambient light around the imaging apparatus. The R value, the G value, and the B value of the image signal of the determined ambient light are respectively denoted as RL, GL, and BL. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram conceptually representing a white range. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a color space in which an X-axis indicates the R/G value, a Y-axis indicates the B/G value, a solid line <b>200</b> indicates blackbody radiation axis, and the white range is given by a range surrounded by a broken line <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Next, a difference between AWB<b>1</b> and AWB<b>2</b> is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a region surrounded by a broken line <b>302</b> indicates a white tracking range of AWB<b>1</b>, and a region surrounded by a dotted line <b>303</b> indicates a white tracking range of AWB<b>2</b>. In the present embodiment, it is assumed that the white tracking range of AWB<b>1</b> is the same as the white range. The white tracking range is a range in which the white balance adjustment is performed. A light source in the white tracking range is reproduced as white, while a light source outside the white tracking range is not reproduced as white. In a case where values (RL/GL, BL/GL) calculated from the image signal values RL, GL, and BL of the ambient light are out of the white tracking range, white tracking coefficients KW_R and KW_B for adjusting the image signal values RL and BL of the ambient light are calculated.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Next, a method of calculating the white tracking coefficients KW_R and KW_B are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Here it is assumed that the automatic white balance mode is AWB<b>2</b>, and the R/G value and B/G value calculated from the calculated image signal values RL, GL, and BL of ambient light are located at a point X (R_X, B_X) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Since the point X is outside the white tracking range, a point Y which is closest, in the white tracking range, to the point X is calculated (wherein the R/G value and the B/G value of the point Y are respectively denoted as R_Y and B_Y). Then, the white tracking coefficients KW_R and KW_B are calculated according to following equations.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">KW_R=R_Y/R_X</heading><heading id="h-0009" level="2">KW_B=B_Y/B_X</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">When the R/G value and B/G value of the image signal values RL, GL, and BL of the ambient light are within the white tracking range, KW_R and KW_B are equal to 1. The white tracking range of AWB<b>2</b> is set to be closer to a color range to which human eyes are adaptable than to the white tracking range of AWB<b>1</b> is, and thus AWB<b>2</b> provides a color closer to a color perceived by the human</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">After the ambient light information is acquired, the white balance adjustment values are calculated according to equations shown below wherein WR, WG, and WB are white balance adjustment values by which the R value, the G value, and the B value are respectively multiplied, and MAX [RL, GL, BL] indicates the maximum value of RL, GL, and BL.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">WR=MAX[RL, GL, BL]/RL x KW_R</heading><heading id="h-0011" level="2">WG=MAX[RL, GL, BL]/GL</heading><heading id="h-0012" level="2">WB=MAX[RL, GL, BL]/BL x KW_B</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the present embodiment, as described above, ambient light information is acquired from a captured image. However, this is merely an example, and the ambient light information may be acquired in other ways. For example, in a case where a lighting system (a smart lighting system) has a capability of providing color information via a wireless communication, the color information acquired from the lighting system may be employed as the ambient light information. Another alternative method may be to acquire ambient light information from color information obtained from an image sensor device different from the image sensor device used to capture an image.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, display modes according to the present embodiment are described. The imaging apparatus <b>100</b> has two control modes for controlling the display unit <b>108</b>, one of which is a display mode <b>1</b> (hereinafter, referred to as DISP<b>1</b>) and the other one of which is a display mode <b>2</b> (hereinafter, referred to as DISP<b>2</b>). DISP<b>1</b> is a mode in which control is performed such that an image displayed on the display unit <b>108</b> has a color close to the color of the subject as seen by eyes of a user, regardless of the ambient light information or the automatic white balance setting. By controlling in the described manner, it is possible to achieve a reduction in artificiality felt by a user viewing the image displayed on the display unit <b>108</b>.
