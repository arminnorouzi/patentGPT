Moreover, the present invention relates to a distance controller, to a computer program, and to a memory unit.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">German Patent Application No. DE 10 2018 201 306 A1 describes a distance controller, which for determining the value of a target distance of a vehicle from a preceding reference vehicle reads in an accelerator pedal angle of an accelerator pedal of the vehicle. A target distance value is determined, using the read-in values. The target distance value is transmitted to an acceleration controller. An acceleration setpoint value is computed in a computing device of the acceleration controller, using the target distance value and the accelerator pedal angle. The setpoint acceleration value is read in by an activation device of the acceleration controller. In the activation device, the setpoint acceleration value is converted into a drive control signal for a drive of the vehicle, and/or into a brake signal for a braking system of the vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to an example embodiment of the present invention, a method for controlling an approach of a traveling vehicle to at least one preceding reference vehicle using an automated distance setting is provided. The automated distance setting for the approach process may thus better correspond to the expectations of the driver of the vehicle. The automated distance setting may take place more realistically and conveniently. The acceptance by the driver of the vehicle may increase, and the driving experience with the automated distance setting may be more natural. Via the operating position, the driver of the vehicle may appreciably influence the acceleration profile that may be applied to the distance setting in a more intuitive manner.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The vehicle may be a motor vehicle, a passenger car, a truck, a two-wheeled vehicle, or a comparable vehicle that moves on a roadway. The same applies for the reference vehicle. The reference vehicle may be traveling ahead of the vehicle in the same lane or in a lane adjacent to the lane of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">During use of the method, the vehicle, in particular also the reference vehicle, is/are in forward movement.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">&#x201c;Approach&#x201d; is preferably understood to mean a reduction in the distance between the vehicle and the reference vehicle along the travel direction.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The automated distance setting may involve an automated setting of the distance and/or an automated limitation of the distance between the vehicle and the reference vehicle in order to maintain at least a minimum distance. The automated distance setting may be associated with a driver-oriented assistance function, in particular dynamic distance assist (DDA). The function of a brake pedal of the vehicle for exerting the braking deceleration may be taken over at least partially, preferably completely, in the automated distance setting.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An acceleration profile is understood to mean a temporal profile of acceleration values of the vehicle. The acceleration profile may be the temporal profile of the acceleration of the vehicle during the approach. The maximum possible highest acceleration value may be reached in the acceleration profile during the approach. For a new approach to a next reference vehicle, a new acceleration profile may be present, with which a new maximum possible highest acceleration value is once again associated as a function of the operating position existing at that time.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The highest acceleration value may be variable during the approach, as a function of the operating position. The approach process, which has for example already begun, may thus be adapted to the driver intent as a function of the operating position.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The operating position may include a deflection position of the control element as well as a deflection speed of the control element. A larger operating position may request a greater traveling speed of the vehicle than a smaller operating position. A larger operating position may correspond to a greater deflection of the control element and/or to a greater deflection speed of the control element.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one preferred example embodiment of the present invention, it is advantageous if the acceleration is a braking deceleration, and the acceleration profile is a braking deceleration profile.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The braking deceleration corresponds to a negative acceleration. The approach may be carried out both by positive accelerations and by negative accelerations.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one preferred example embodiment of the present invention, it is advantageous if the highest acceleration value is a maximum acceleration and/or a maximum acceleration gradient of the acceleration. The maximum acceleration and/or the maximum acceleration gradient are/is preferably negative for implementing the braking deceleration.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one preferred example embodiment of the present invention, it is provided that the maximum possible highest acceleration value (am) is changed as a function of an assessment of a hazardous situation. The hazardous situation may occur during the approach. The hazardous situation may be a condition that impairs the driving safety of the vehicle and/or the safety of the surroundings of the vehicle on account of the vehicle. When a hazardous situation is recognized, the maximum possible highest acceleration value may be increased up to an extreme highest acceleration value for subsequently avoiding the hazardous situation. The assessment of the hazardous situation may take place during the approach and via the automated distance setting.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one advantageous example embodiment of the present invention, it is provided that the control element is an accelerator pedal, and the operating position is an accelerator pedal position. The control element may control a drive torque that is present at the vehicle wheels for moving the vehicle. The accelerator pedal position may be described by an accelerator pedal angle. The operating position may be a deflection of the control element and/or a temporal change of the deflection of the control element.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one particular example embodiment of the present invention, it is advantageous if an acceleration profile for a first operating position has a smaller acceleration at a first point in time, and at a subsequent, second point in time has a greater acceleration than for a second operating position in each case at the corresponding points in time. In this way, an acceleration profile for the approach may be adaptively set as a function of the operating position while still meeting the requirements for a minimum distance between the vehicle and the reference vehicle.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The maximum highest acceleration value of the acceleration profile may be greater the larger the operating position, and may be smaller the smaller the operating position. The maximum acceleration gradient of the acceleration profile may be smaller the smaller the operating position, and greater the larger the operating position. An operating position that is smaller during the approach may trigger a braking operation that begins early, in which a smaller maximum highest acceleration value is used which starts with an initially greater braking deceleration, but which overall has only a smaller maximum braking deceleration, corresponding to a smaller highest acceleration value, than when the operating position is larger.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">One preferred example embodiment of the present invention is advantageous in which the first operating position is larger than the second operating position, and the highest acceleration value is greater for the first operating position than for the second operating position. For example, an accelerator pedal that is actuated by the driver during the approach may trigger a temporally delayed braking operation, corresponding to the first operating position, which upon approaching a predefined minimum distance is also more intense, if necessary, due to the greater highest acceleration value. An accelerator pedal that is released during the approach may trigger a braking operation that begins early, in which a smaller highest acceleration value is used which starts with an initially greater braking deceleration, but which may also conclude only with a smaller maximum possible braking deceleration corresponding to the smaller highest acceleration value.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, according to an example embodiment of the present invention, a distance controller is provided which is configured to indirectly or directly carry out the method having at least one of the features stated above. The distance controller may be implemented in a control unit of the vehicle. The control unit may be situated in the vehicle. The distance controller may carry out the method directly, for example, if it controls the automated distance setting. The distance controller may carry out the method indirectly, for example, if an acceleration controller is provided downstream which controls the automated distance setting as a function of the output of the distance controller and optionally further parameters.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Driving properties of the vehicle when traveling on a curve may be additionally taken into account in the distance controller or a downstream adjustment device on the input side. Furthermore, the distance controller or the adjustment device, for example the acceleration controller, on the input side may take into account an actual speed of the vehicle, a differential speed between the vehicle and the reference vehicle, an actual distance between the vehicle and the reference vehicle, and/or a setpoint distance between the vehicle and the reference vehicle.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The automated distance setting may involve a detection of the surroundings by the vehicle. For example, a distance between the vehicle and the reference vehicle may be measured by a distance sensor, for example a radar sensor, a camera, and/or a LIDAR sensor.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Moreover, according to the present invention a computer program is provided that includes machine-readable instructions that are executable on at least one computer, the above-described method running when the instructions are executed.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition, according to the present invention a memory unit is provided which has a machine-readable design and that is accessible by at least one computer, and on which the described computer program is stored.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further advantages and advantageous embodiments of the present invention result from the description of the figures, and the figures.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention is described in greater detail below with reference to the figures.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a method for controlling an approach of a vehicle in one particular specific example embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a driving situation of a vehicle upon approaching a preceding reference vehicle.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a further driving situation of a vehicle upon approaching a preceding reference vehicle.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a vehicle including a distance controller in one particular specific example embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a method for controlling an approach of a vehicle in one particular specific embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Method <b>10</b> for controlling an approach of a traveling vehicle <b>12</b> to at least one preceding reference vehicle <b>14</b> is carried out using an automated distance setting of a distance <b>16</b> between vehicle <b>12</b> and reference vehicle <b>14</b>. The automated distance setting is implemented at an acceleration a that may be applied for vehicle <b>12</b>, via which distance <b>16</b> between vehicle <b>12</b> and reference vehicle <b>14</b> is influenced, for example decreased. Acceleration a may be negative and may act as braking deceleration. If traveling vehicle <b>12</b> approaches preceding reference vehicle <b>14</b> at a greater speed than that of reference vehicle <b>14</b>, via the automated distance setting a deceleration of vehicle <b>12</b> may take place via the braking deceleration for maintaining a smallest minimum distance <b>18</b> as a safety distance between vehicle <b>12</b> and reference vehicle <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In method <b>10</b>, a setpoint acceleration ar, here in particular the braking deceleration, that specifies an acceleration a to be applied for vehicle <b>12</b> for the automated distance setting is set as a function of an operating position <b>20</b> of a control element <b>22</b> of vehicle <b>12</b> that is actuatable by the driver of vehicle <b>12</b>.

Since the driver of vehicle <b>12</b> notices the veering operation of reference vehicle <b>14</b> and would like to preferably maintain or even increase his/her speed, the driver leaves accelerator pedal <b>24</b> actuated.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0038">The automated distance setting between vehicle <b>12</b> and reference vehicle <b>14</b>, which is still blocking lane <b>42</b> but is veering out of it, allows a braking deceleration that is initially set to be small during the approach, since the driver would like to reduce his/her speed as little as possible, which is detected as an operating position based on accelerator pedal position <b>26</b>, and in the method according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is used on the input side. At the same time, this accelerator pedal position <b>26</b> sets a highest acceleration value, for example a maximum acceleration and/or a maximum acceleration gradient, which allows the initially small braking deceleration, and allows a large maximum acceleration and/or a large maximum acceleration gradient of the braking deceleration upon a further or critical approach to reference vehicle <b>14</b>. For example, the maximum acceleration and/or the maximum acceleration gradient of the braking deceleration may be required if reference vehicle <b>14</b> instead returns to lane <b>42</b>, contrary to the indicated veering movement, or if the veering operation is carried out more slowly than indicated. However, due to the set highest acceleration value, the approach process could still be carried out safely, preferably to maintain the minimum distance. The braking operation for maintaining the minimum distance may thus begin later, but carried out more intensely if necessary, and thus temporally shortened overall.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0039">In comparison, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a driving situation in which it is apparent that a preceding reference vehicle <b>14</b> in neighboring lane <b>44</b> is veering into lane <b>42</b> that vehicle <b>12</b> is traveling in, and at a greater distance from the vehicle than the setpoint distance between the vehicle and the reference vehicle. If this movement of reference vehicle <b>14</b>, via which reference vehicle <b>14</b> travels in front of vehicle <b>12</b> in lane <b>42</b>, and blocking lane <b>42</b>, is recognized early by the driver of vehicle <b>12</b>, the typical behavior is to let up on accelerator pedal <b>24</b>. Due to the dependency of the highest acceleration value, in particular the maximum acceleration gradient, on the operating position of accelerator pedal <b>24</b>, at the start of the approach of vehicle <b>12</b> to reference vehicle <b>14</b>, an earlier and greater braking deceleration may thus be set than in the driving situation from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. This is because for this accelerator pedal position, which corresponds to a smaller operating position than in the driving situation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the highest acceleration value, in particular the maximum acceleration gradient, is set to be smaller, and for the braking deceleration profile that arises, allows a smaller braking deceleration and/or a smaller acceleration gradient of the braking deceleration in order to increase the driving comfort and allow a more natural driving experience with the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0040">A braking operation that takes place at short notice and just before the minimum distance may be carried out with a greater braking deceleration when the control element is released. By letting up on the accelerator pedal, the driver intent for a braking deceleration is confirmed, and this may also be carried out via an increased maximum braking deceleration to prevent running up on a vehicle that is veering in a short distance ahead.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0041">Thus, in order to not fall below the minimum distance between vehicle <b>12</b> and reference vehicle <b>14</b>, the approach is initiated with a braking deceleration that is greater than for the driving situation from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The desired acceleration gradient of the braking deceleration is smaller than for the driving situation from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Upon an advancing approach and reaching a minimum distance, the automated distance setting is more greatly limited with regard to the highest acceleration value than for the driving situation from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. This control of the approach with a prolonged and weaker braking operation also corresponds to natural driving behavior, in which the speed of vehicle <b>12</b> is reduced early if an obstacle moving at a slower speed should appear in lane <b>42</b>. However, for hazardous situations with the vehicle, a smaller operating position, for example releasing the control element, may trigger a greater braking deceleration, corresponding to the driver intent after a braking deceleration.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a vehicle including a distance controller in one particular specific embodiment of the present invention. Vehicle <b>12</b> includes a control unit <b>46</b> with which distance controller <b>32</b> is associated for computing the setpoint acceleration, in particular the braking deceleration and the highest acceleration value, during approach of vehicle <b>12</b> to a preceding reference vehicle by applying an automated distance setting. On the input side, distance controller <b>32</b> may take into account an actual speed of vehicle <b>12</b>, a differential speed between vehicle <b>12</b> and the reference vehicle, an actual distance between vehicle <b>12</b> and the reference vehicle, and/or a setpoint distance between vehicle <b>12</b> and the reference vehicle. The actual distance may be measured by a distance sensor <b>47</b>, for example a radar sensor, a camera, and/or a LIDAR sensor.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0043">The setpoint acceleration that is output by distance controller <b>32</b> may be output to a control unit <b>48</b> that controls a braking device <b>50</b> which provides the braking action to vehicle wheels <b>52</b> for the braking deceleration.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230001925A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="5.67mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230001925A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00002" nb-file="US20230001925A1-20230105-M00002.NB"><img id="EMI-M00002" he="5.67mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230001925A1-20230105-M00002.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
