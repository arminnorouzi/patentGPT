Although, the illustrations include a drill bit <b>14</b> and tool <b>10</b> is often referred to as a drill <b>10</b>, tool assembly <b>10</b> can perform other rotational tasks, such as the installation of screws or other rotational uses in surgery.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">An X-ray source focal spot <b>18</b> can be moved left or right behind drill bit <b>14</b>, which is done by moving the entire removable X-ray source module <b>12</b>. When source <b>12</b> is shifted to the side, the image looks like the viewer is looking down the side of the bit, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>6</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> the source is centered, or coaxial with drill bit <b>14</b>, which is viewed on a display D as a central circular representation <b>20</b>C. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> the source is left shifted relative to drill bit <b>14</b> so that the image is viewed as looking along the left side of drill bit <b>14</b> with a shifted image <b>20</b>L of bit <b>14</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> the source is right shifted relative to drill bit <b>14</b> so that the image is viewed as looking along the right side of drill bit <b>14</b> with a shifted image <b>20</b>R of drill bit <b>14</b>. By viewing the images <b>20</b>C, <b>20</b>L, <b>20</b>R with the source in the left, center and/or right positions, the user can easily judge whether or not drill bit <b>14</b> is aimed at the center of the target for a hole. While in the illustrated embodiment the movement of X-ray source <b>12</b> is left/right, other directions are also contemplated, such as up/down or any other combination of positions which provides the perspective of in the visual image of the tip of drill bit <b>14</b> relative to the target hole.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">An actuator <b>16</b>, shown as a forward handle <b>16</b> in the form of a handgrip <b>16</b> is used to actuate the movement of X-ray source <b>12</b>, by twisting handgrip <b>16</b> about an axis A. A linkage system between hand grip <b>16</b> and X-ray source <b>12</b> causes the shifting of source <b>12</b>. The linkage system can be in the form of a gear train so that X-ray source module <b>12</b> is moved by twisting hand grip <b>16</b> to the right (clockwise about axis A as viewed from the operator's perspective) and to the left (counterclockwise about axis A as viewed from the operator's perspective) to effect the right and left shifting.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The installed X-ray source module <b>12</b> clips firmly into a collimator member <b>22</b> such that the entire module <b>12</b> is translated when collimator member <b>22</b> is moved. Twistable handgrip <b>16</b> allows the surgeon to keep one hand on handle <b>24</b> of drill <b>10</b> and stabilize the forward portion of the assembly with the other hand on handgrip <b>16</b>, while still allowing the first hand to control the drill and the second hand to control the X-ray source focus spot movement, all at the same time. Being able to change the position of X-ray source <b>12</b> while guiding drill bit <b>14</b> provides the user with increased visibility and the ability to confirm the path of drill bit<b>14</b> as it is moved toward the target. Tool <b>10</b> rotates drill bit <b>14</b> about axis A and X-ray source <b>12</b> is moved relative to axis A such that X-ray source <b>12</b> can be positioned coaxial with axis A, or to one side or the other of axis A, while the X-ray beam emanating from source <b>12</b> remains parallel or substantially parallel to axis A (the movements of X-ray source <b>12</b> being perpendicular to axis A), so that the practice of the method of the present invention can be carried out. It is also contemplated that the collimator could be part of the X-ray source assembly, and the retention features could be part of tool assembly <b>10</b>. One advantage of using this alternate construct is that the rest of the tool could be made disposable, eliminating reprocessing/sterilization issues.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Other embodiments to move the X-ray source <b>12</b> are also contemplated. The user could move a lever, turn a knob or rotate a wheel to move source <b>12</b>. Actuator <b>16</b> could be positioned so that the user's hand that holds the surgical handpiece <b>24</b> (rotary power unit) could be used to move the source via a grip, knob or lever, without removing the hand from handpiece <b>24</b>. This would free up the other hand for important tasks such as maintaining reduction of a bone fracture.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Furthermore, the movement of source <b>12</b> could be motorized. A small electric motor connected to a gear train (linear translator) could move collimator <b>22</b> and X-ray source <b>12</b> as an assembly. The electric motor could be controlled using buttons, either on the hand grip and/or in reach of the hand holding the handpiece.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is further contemplated that a shifting of X-ray source <b>12</b> from side-to-side can be done by a dithering source <b>12</b> between two or more positions. The output of X-ray source <b>12</b> can be continuous, or it can be pulsed at each position to remove artifacts of movement. The resulting output images could be displayed without alteration or could be processed to show the scene in an optimal way, removing the &#x201c;shadow&#x201d; of the bit in each image to give a clearer image of the bit tip in relation to the hole or where the hole is targeted to be. The positions of the focal source could be in any pattern, such as triangle, square or any polygon. The movement of the focus spot could be actuated by a mechanical movement that physically moves the X-ray tube assembly. Or it could be moved electronically by applying a varying electric field to the X-ray tube.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">X-ray source <b>12</b> is a single removable module as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, which respectively show X-ray source <b>12</b> being inserted into tool <b>10</b>, and X-ray source <b>12</b> being fully engaged in tool <b>10</b>. X-ray source module <b>12</b> contains an X-ray source component, electronics, a battery and a connector to a wiring harness. Several features of X-ray source module <b>12</b> are designed for it to be easily installed and removed from tool <b>10</b> to allow the drill attachment unit to be sterilized separately. The exterior of module <b>12</b> is designed such that it can be inserted and removed from the drill attachment via a smooth motion in one direction (opposite to the direction illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">X-ray source <b>12</b> being a single removable module <b>12</b> is key to both moving the X-ray focal spot, and to making the system capable of being used within the sterile field of a surgical procedure. X-ray source <b>12</b> and collimator <b>22</b> have features for alignment and retention, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref> are a two-part illustration of the same elements, with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> illustrating the cone of X-ray source <b>12</b> approaching collimator <b>22</b> with bag <b>34</b> in an unpierced state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> shows these same components with X-ray source <b>12</b> being fully mated with collimator <b>22</b>, with a portion of bag <b>34</b> being situated between X-ray source <b>12</b> and collimator <b>22</b>, while pins from connector <b>38</b> have pierced bag <b>34</b> and connected with connector <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Retaining features <b>26</b> in the front of module <b>12</b> interface with collimator <b>22</b> to firmly clip source module <b>12</b> into position, allowing source <b>12</b> and collimator <b>22</b> to move as one unit. Retaining features <b>26</b> are illustrated as movable protrusions <b>28</b> that interact with groove <b>30</b> of collimator <b>22</b>. As module <b>12</b> is inserted into collimator <b>22</b> retaining features <b>26</b> move outwardly and then rest in groove <b>30</b> to thereby couple X-ray source <b>12</b> to collimator <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, the cone on the front of X-ray source <b>12</b> is a reference surface to locate the focal spot relative to collimator <b>22</b>. Collimator <b>22</b> is conical and is complimentary, so as to match and mate to the cone of X-ray source <b>12</b>, ensuring that the focus spot is as close to a center axis of collimator <b>22</b> and as near as possible to the optimal position along the center axis.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Having collimator <b>22</b> move with X-ray source <b>12</b> simplifies the collimator design and reduces the amount of material required, which reduces mass and cost. It also allows the shape of collimator <b>22</b> to conform closely to the shape of the nosecone of X-ray source <b>12</b>, ensuring that stray ra/diation is minimized.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">An X-ray source imaging mode is selected using a button assembly <b>32</b> on handgrip <b>16</b>. System <b>10</b> can be used in a single shot or a live video mode, as selected with button assembly <b>32</b>. The user can select the imaging mode using the two switches of button assembly <b>32</b> on handgrip <b>16</b>. A single-shot imaging button commands X-ray source <b>12</b> to turn on and then off after a preselected exposure time has elapsed. The button also commands source module <b>12</b> to send information to system <b>10</b> indicating that a single image has been selected. System <b>10</b> then instructs an imager unit to acquire a single image for display on display D with the set exposure time and presents it to the user on display D.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the live video mode button is pressed and held, X-ray source <b>12</b> turns on and remains on until the button is released. The imager unit sends a steady stream of images to the system for display on display D, until the intensity of X-ray signals falls below a pre-determined threshold, then X-ray source <b>12</b> is deactivated.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Imaging mode switches are also on the drill attachment body B, also known as housing B, close to a drill trigger T, on both sides, which can be reached by the hand that is operating tool <b>10</b>, regardless of whether the user is using their left or right hand.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Other possible methods for controlling the imaging mode are via a surgeon-operated foot pedal switch and/or an audio sensor connected to a processor that recognizes voice commands.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">X-ray source module <b>12</b> is enclosed in a bag <b>34</b> or a barrier <b>34</b> to maintain the sterile field. Steam sterilization (autoclaving) is the most common method of instrument sterilization in hospitals. However, X-ray source module <b>12</b> is not steam sterilizable because the lifetime and performance of the electronics and battery are easily degraded by high temperature and moisture. Before it is inserted into housing B of tool <b>10</b>, X-ray source module <b>12</b> is enclosed in a sterile plastic bag <b>34</b> using an aseptic transfer procedure. The bagged module <b>12</b> is inserted into tool <b>10</b> and is secured in the correct position by pressing the module into the housing until the retainer features <b>26</b> hold X-ray source <b>12</b> in place relative to collimator <b>22</b>. Plastic bag <b>34</b> is flexible and thin, such that it does not interfere with X-ray transmission or retaining features <b>26</b> of X-ray source <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A female electrical connector <b>36</b> of X-ray source <b>12</b> is contained within bag <b>34</b>, and a male electrical connector <b>38</b> is part of drill attachment housing B. As connectors <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> are seated, the sharp male pins of connector <b>38</b> pierce through plastic bag <b>34</b> and contact the female receptacles of connector <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The electrical connection between X-ray module <b>12</b> and the wiring harness for buttons <b>32</b> is made when the male connector on the drill attachment housing punctures through the plastic and mates with female connector <b>36</b> of X-ray module <b>12</b>. The sterility of tool <b>10</b> outside of module <b>12</b> is maintained because the connections are made completely inside the drill attachment housing B. Finally, the back of the drill attachment housing B is enclosed by installing a cap or closing a door on the housing B.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Collimator <b>22</b> is designed to minimize stray radiation, since collimator <b>22</b> surrounds the nose cone of X-ray source module <b>12</b>. Collimator <b>22</b> is made of a tungsten heavy alloy (HA) to minimize transmission of X-rays. Tungsten HA is commonly used for X-ray shielding and is known in the X-ray imaging field. The thickness of each of collimator <b>22</b> features is chosen to minimize collimator mass while also minimizing stray radiation.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The perimeter shape of the beam falling on the imager is defined by a collimator aperture <b>40</b>. The aperture shape is chosen to facilitate perspective distortion correction. The perspective distortion correction algorithm uses the expected shape of aperture <b>40</b> to correct the perspective distortion in the image. Many shapes of aperture <b>40</b> can be used, including round, square or any polygon, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C</figref>. shapes of aperture <b>40</b> include circular (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>), square with a notch (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>), and hexagonal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">While this invention has been described with respect to at least one embodiment, the present invention can be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure. This application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention using its general principles.
