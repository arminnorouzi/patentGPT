In order to transfer the sample gas generated in the sample gas generator to the separation column, a carrier gas is supplied to the sample gas generator.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the gas chromatograph, an analysis is performed while controlling the temperature of the separation column. However, if the temperature control of the separation column is stopped during the standby state in which no analysis is performed, it takes a long time to stabilize the temperature of the separation column at a predetermined temperature for the subsequent sample analysis. Therefore, it is a common practice to continuously perform the temperature control of the separation column even during the standby state. On the other hand, when the separation column is temperature-controlled at a high temperature in a state in which no fluid is flowing through the separation column, there is a problem that the deterioration of the stationary phase filled in the separation column is accelerated, thereby shortening the life of the separation column. Therefore, it is a common practice to keep the carrier gas flowing even during the standby state in which no sample analysis is performed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Helium gas is generally used as the carrier gas, but it is required to reduce the consumption of the helium gas due to an increase in the price of helium gas or the like. For this reason, it has been proposed that one of two gases is selectively supplied to the sample gas generator, a helium gas is used as the carrier gas during the sample analysis, and a gas other than the helium gas, such as, e.g., a nitrogen gas, is used as a column protective gas during the standby state (see Patent Document 1).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2013-044647</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As described above, even in a case where the analysis by the gas chromatograph is in either the analysis state or the standby state, the carrier gas is continuously supplied to the separation column. For this reason, during the standby state between an analysis and the subsequent analysis, during successive analyses at night, etc., there may happen that the gas supply source supplying a carrier gas may run out of gas in a state in which the user is absent. When the out of gas has occurred in the gas supply source supplying the carrier gas, the carrier gas is not supplied to the separation column, and a state in which the separation column is heated to a high temperature occurs in a state in which no fluid flows through the separation column, causing the deterioration of the separation column. Therefore, it is conceivable to stop the temperature control of the separation column at the time point when it is detected that the carrier gas is not supplied to the separation column. However, in such a case, it takes a long time to resume the state in which analysis can be performed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been made in view of the above-described circumstances.

In the operation processor <b>20</b>, it is possible to set the parameters required for the controller <b>18</b> to perform the operation control. Analysis data acquired by the detector <b>8</b> is inputted to the operation processor <b>20</b> via the controller <b>18</b>, and the operation processor <b>20</b> is equipped with a function of performing various arithmetic processing based on the analysis data. The input device <b>22</b> realized by a keyboard or the like and the display device <b>24</b> realized by a liquid crystal display or the like are electrically connected to the operation processor <b>20</b>.

The gas type storage unit <b>36</b>, the condition storage unit <b>38</b>, and the standby time storage unit <b>40</b> are functions realized by the storage area which is a part of the storage device.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The gas type of the carrier gas supplied from each of the gas supply sources <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B is determined by the type of the supplied gas of the gas cylinder to which the user connects each port of the switching unit <b>14</b>. Therefore, there is a case in which the same type of gas is supplied, in addition to a case in which one of different types of gases is selectively supplied from the gas supply sources <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B. The gas type setting unit <b>42</b> of the operation processor <b>20</b> is configured to set the gas type of the carrier gas supplied from the gas supply source <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B by making the user input the type of supply gas from the gas cylinders connected to the respective ports of the switching unit <b>14</b>. The information about the gas types of the respective gas supply sources <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B set by the gas type setting unit <b>42</b> is transmitted to the controller <b>18</b> and stored in the gas type storage unit <b>36</b>. With this, the controller <b>18</b> recognizes the gas type of the carrier gas supplied from each of the gas supply sources <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The gas type identification unit <b>32</b> of the controller <b>18</b> is configured to recognize the connection state between the ports in the switching unit <b>14</b> and identify the gas type of the carrier gas which is being supplied to the sample gas generator <b>2</b> based on the state of the switching unit <b>14</b> and the information stored in the gas type storage unit <b>36</b>. The function of the gas type identification unit <b>32</b> enables the controller <b>18</b> to automatically recognize the gas type of the carrier gas.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the gas chromatograph of this example, the gas type of the carrier gas can be set for a standby condition in a standby state in which no analysis is performed and for an analysis condition for sample analysis. The condition setting unit <b>44</b> of the operation processor <b>20</b> is configured to make the user input the gas type of the carrier gas as one of the respective parameters of the standby condition and the analysis condition to set the standby condition and the analysis condition. The standby condition and the analysis condition set by the condition setting unit <b>44</b> are transmitted to the controller <b>18</b> and held in the condition storage unit <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a case where a gas supply source supplying the carrier gas to the sample gas generator <b>2</b> is switched, in particular in a case where the gas type of the carrier gas is changed thereby, it requires a certain standby time. That is, it is not possible to initiate the subsequent analysis until all of the gas in the carrier gas flow path, specifically, all of the gas in the flow path from the gas supply source <b>12</b>A or <b>12</b>B to the detector <b>8</b> via the sample gas generator <b>2</b> and the separation column <b>6</b>, is replaced with the gas supplied after the switching. Therefore, a certain standby time is required.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this example, it is configured such that a user can arbitrarily set the standby time from when the gas supply source is switched to when the standby state in which the subsequent sample analysis can be performed is established. The standby time setting unit <b>46</b> of the operation processor <b>20</b> is configured to set the standby time by having the user input an arbitrary numerical value. The standby time set by the standby time setting unit <b>46</b> is transmitted to the controller <b>18</b> and stored in the standby time storage unit <b>40</b>. Note that the default value of the standby time may be stored in the standby time storage unit <b>46</b>. In this case, the default value can be used as a standby time.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The control unit <b>30</b> is configured to perform the operation control of the auto-sampler <b>4</b>, the detector <b>8</b>, the switching unit <b>14</b>, the regulator <b>16</b>, and the heater <b>26</b>, based on the standby conditions and the analysis conditions stored in the condition storage unit <b>38</b>. In the standby state, the control unit <b>30</b> supplies the carrier gas of the set gas type to the sample gas generator <b>2</b> at the set supply pressure and flow rate and controls the temperature of the separation column <b>6</b> to the set temperature, in accordance with the standby conditions stored in the condition storage unit <b>38</b>. Further, in the analysis state, in accordance with the analysis conditions stored in the condition storage unit <b>38</b>, the control unit <b>30</b> supplies the carrier gas of the set gas type to the sample gas generator <b>2</b> at the set supply pressure and flow rate and controls the temperature of the separation column <b>6</b> to a set temperature. When shifting to the standby state in which the subsequent sample analysis can be performed, the controller controls the gas type of the carrier gas, the supply pressure and the flow rate of the carrier gas, and the temperature of the separation column <b>6</b> so as to bring the state of the gas chromatograph to the initial state of the subsequent sample analysis.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Note that since the viscosity differs depending on the gas type of the carrier gas, the relational expression for calculating the control quantity of the regulator <b>16</b> differs for each gas type of the carrier gas. Although not shown, in this example, the controller <b>18</b> stores the relational expression for each gas type of the carrier gas, and the relational expression corresponding to the gas type of the selected gas supply source <b>12</b>A or <b>12</b>B is used, thereby accurately controlling the regulator <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the switching of the gas supply source has been performed to change to the standby state in which the subsequent sample analysis can be performed, the control unit <b>30</b> applies the standby time stored in the standby time storage unit <b>40</b> after switching the gas supply source.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The control unit <b>30</b> is configured to control the operation of the regulator <b>16</b> to perform the replacement promotion operation during the standby time. The replacement promotion operation is an operation for making the supply pressure or the flow rate of the carrier gas to a state different from the standby state in order to facilitate the replacement of the gas in the distribution flow path of the carrier gas.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">One example of the replacement promotion operation is to change the supply pressure of the carrier gas as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. As the replacement promotion operation, in place of or in addition to the gas supply pressure, the supply flow rate of the carrier gas may be changed.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The present inventors found that the reason why the replacement of the carrier gas in the distribution flow path takes a long time is due to the stagnation of the gas in the dead volume present in the distribution flow path of the carrier gas. The present inventors obtained a knowledge that when at least one of the supply pressure and the supply flow rate of the carrier gas is changed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the substitution of the gas stagnated in the dead volume is prompted by the turbulence generated in the distribution path, thereby improving the substitution efficiency of the gas.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, immediately after changing the gas type of the carrier gas, the supply pressure of the carrier gas is changed between P1 (e.g., 500 kPa) and P2 (e.g., 400 kPa) at regular cycles (at 10-second intervals to at 60-second intervals). Although when the carrier gas was constantly supplied under the initial condition of the analysis, it took about 2 hours for the replacement of the gas, it was confirmed that the replacement of the gas could be completed in about 15 minutes by performing such a replacement promotion operation. In this replacement promotion operation, it is not required to increase the flow rate of the carrier gas than that in the standby state. For this reason, by performing the replacement promotion operation, not only the shortening of the standby time can be attained, but also the reduction of the carrier gas consumption can be attained by the amount corresponding to the shortened standby time.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further, as another example of the replacement promotion operation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an example in which the supply flow rate of the carrier gas in the standby time is increased than that in the initial state of the analysis. As described above, by making the supply flow rate of the carrier gas larger than that in the standby state, the replacement of the gas in the distribution flow path of the carrier gas is promoted, thereby shortening the standby time.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">With reference to the flowcharts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an example of the operation at the time of switching the gas supply source will be described.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the switching of the gas supply source is performed to transfer to the standby state in which analysis can be performed, the control unit <b>30</b> starts the replacement promotion operation (Step <b>101</b>). When a standby time stored in the standby time storage unit <b>40</b> has elapsed since the gas supply source was switched, the replacement promotion operation is terminated (Steps <b>102</b> and <b>103</b>). After completing the replacement promotion operation, it becomes a standby state when another analysis condition has been adjusted to the condition stored in the condition storage unit <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, when the gas supply source is switched, it may be configured such that the control unit <b>30</b> determines whether or not the gas type of the carrier gas has been changed (Step <b>201</b>) based on the information stored in the gas type storage unit <b>36</b> and executes a replacement promotion operation only in a case where the gas type of carrier gas has been changed (Step <b>202</b>). Also in this case, similarly to the operation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the replacement promotion operation is continued until the preset standby time has elapse (Step <b>203</b>), and when the standby time has elapsed, the replacement promotion operation is terminated and becomes a standby state (Step <b>204</b>).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">After establishing the standby state, the control unit <b>30</b> may be configured to automatically perform the sample injection into the sample gas generator <b>2</b> by the auto-sampler <b>4</b> to initiate the analysis. Further, when the standby state is set, a notification indicating that the standby state has been established may be made to the user. The notification unit <b>48</b> of the operation processor <b>20</b> realizes the function of notifying the user. The notification to the user can be made by displaying on the display device <b>24</b>, lighting of a predetermined lamp, a predetermined alarm sound or the like.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Note that it may be configured such that the user can set that an analysis is automatically initiated or a notification to the user is performed when a standby state has been established.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the out of gas determination unit <b>34</b> of the controller <b>18</b> is configured to determine whether or not the out of gas of the gas supply source <b>12</b>A or <b>12</b>B supplying the carrier gas has occurred. The switching unit <b>14</b> or the regulator <b>16</b> constantly detects the gas supply pressure from the gas supply source <b>12</b>A or <b>12</b>B (in a minute-time period). When the remaining quantity of the gas supply source <b>12</b>A or <b>12</b>B supplying the carrier gas decrease, the gas supply pressure does not reach the set pressure even if the valve opening is increased so that the regulator <b>16</b> increases the gas supply pressure. The out of gas determination unit <b>34</b> determines that the out of gas of the gas supply source <b>12</b>A or <b>12</b>B currently supplying the carrier gas has occurred when a state in which the gas supply pressure is equal to or less than the preset threshold has continued for a predetermined time. The threshold for the out of gas determination is set based on a set value of a gas supply pressure. For example, the threshold can be set as follows: threshold=set value-&#x3b1; (&#x3b1; is a real number); threshold=set value&#xd7;&#x3b2; (&#x3b2;&#x3c;1); etc.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Note that the out of gas determination unit <b>34</b> may be configured to determine the out of gas of the gas supply source <b>12</b>A or <b>12</b>B based on the supply flow rate of the carrier gas.

For example, the threshold can be set as follows: threshold=set value-&#x3b1; (&#x3b1; is a real number); threshold=set value&#xd7;&#x3b2; (&#x3b2;&#x3c;1); etc.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">When it is determined by the out of gas determination unit <b>34</b> that the out of gas has occurred in the gas supply source <b>12</b>A or <b>12</b>B, the notification unit <b>48</b> notifies the user that the out of gas has occurred, and the column protection operation is performed. The column protection operation is an operation of switching the gas supply source by the switching unit <b>14</b> to prevent the interruption of the supplying of the carrier gas to the separation column <b>6</b> when the out of gas of the gas supply source is detected. Thus, by supplying the carrier gas with the other gas supply source when the gas supply source supplying the carrier gas runs out of gas, it is prevented that the separation column <b>6</b> is heated in a state in which no fluid is following through the separation column <b>6</b>. The notification unit <b>48</b> notifies the user that the gas supply source has been switched by the column protection operation.

On the other hand, in a case where the gas supply pressure is equal to or less than the threshold (Step <b>302</b>, Yes), when the state has continued for a predetermined time (for a predetermined number of times) (Step <b>303</b>, Yes), the out of gas determination unit <b>34</b> determines that the gas supply source <b>12</b>A or <b>12</b>B runs out of gas, and the switching unit <b>14</b> performs the switching of the gas supply source based on the determination result (Step <b>304</b>).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In a case where the gas supply source has been switched based on the determination result of the out of gas determination unit <b>34</b>, the notification unit <b>48</b> notifies the user that the gas supply source has been switched (Step <b>305</b>).
