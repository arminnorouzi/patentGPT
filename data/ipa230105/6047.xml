When the high-voltage transistor device is operated at high temperature or high current density, the high temperature or high current density may cause the Si-H bonds that are disposed at the interface between the gate and gate dielectric layer being broken, and may result in dangling bonds and oxide layers formed at the interface to fix positive charges; and this may cause the threshold voltage of the high-voltage transistor device shifted, so as to adversely affect the service life thereof, or event make it failed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is currently known that increasing the thickness of the gate dielectric layer can reduce the influence of NBTI of the high-voltage transistor device. However, the thickness of the gate dielectric layer is inversely proportional to the driving current (Ion) of the high-voltage transistor device. Increasing the thickness of the gate dielectric layer may reduce the driving current of the high-voltage transistor device, so as to adversely affect its efficiency. How to reduce the NBTI of the high-voltage transistor device while taking into account the performance of the devices that is proportional to their driving current has become one of the important issues in this technical field.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is a need of providing a high voltage transistor and the method for fabricating the same.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a high-voltage transistor device, wherein the high-voltage transistor device includes a semiconductor substrate, an isolation structure, a gate dielectric layer, a gate, a source region and a drain region. The semiconductor substrate has a plurality of grooves extending downward from a surface of the semiconductor substrate to form a sawtooth sectional profile. The isolation structure is disposed on the outside of the plurality of grooves, and extends from the surface downwards into the semiconductor substrate to define a high-voltage area. The gate dielectric layer is disposed on the high-voltage area and partially filled in the plurality of grooves. The gate is disposed on the gate dielectric layer. The source region and the drain region are respectively disposed in the semiconductor substrate and isolated from each other.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a method for fabricating a high-voltage transistor device, wherein the method includes steps as follows: Firstly, a semiconductor substrate is provided. The semiconductor substrate is then etched by using a first patterned mask to form a plurality of grooves extending downward from a surface of the substrate to form a sawtooth sectional profile. Next, an isolation structure is formed on the outside of the plurality of grooves, and extending downwards from the surface into the semiconductor substrate, thereby defining a high-voltage area. Thereafter, the high-voltage area is etched by using a second patterned mask. A gate dielectric layer is formed on the high-voltage area and partially filled in the plurality of grooves. A gate is formed on the gate dielectric layer. A source region and a drain region are respectively formed in the semiconductor substrate and isolated from each other.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with the aforementioned embodiments of the present disclosure, a high-voltage transistor device and the method for fabricating the same are provided. Before the isolation structure that is formed to define the doped well (portion of which serves as the channel of the high-voltage transistor device), a high-voltage area of the substrate used to form the high-voltage transistor device can be etched by an etching process used for forming other device (such as, a logic device), wherein the etching process uses a first patterned mask to make the high-voltage area of substrate having a plurality of grooves substantially parallel to the direction extending along the channel length (perpendicular to the channel width direction). After the doped well of the high-voltage transistor device is formed, another etching process using a second patterned mask is performed to remove a portion of the doped well. Whereby a sawtooth structure substantially parallel to the direction of the channel width can be formed on the interface between the doped well and the gate dielectric layer of the high-voltage transistor device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, the channel width of the high-voltage transistor device can be lengthened without reducing the thickness of the gate dielectric layer, so as to reduce (or not induce) the NBTI and improve the driving current and the efficacy of the high-voltage transistor device.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The above objects and advantages of the present disclosure will become more readily apparent to those ordinarily skilled in the art after reviewing the following detailed description and accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a schematic top view illustrating a partial structure of a semiconductor substrate after a plurality of grooves are formed therein, according to one embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating a partial structure of the semiconductor substrate taken along the section line S<b>11</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating a partial structure of the semiconductor substrate taken along the section line S<b>12</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a schematic top view illustrating the result after an isolation structure is formed in the high-voltage area of the semiconductor substrate;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating the structure taken along the section line S<b>21</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating the structure taken along the section line S<b>22</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a schematic top view illustrating the result after the high-voltage area is etched by a second etching process;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating the structure taken along the section line S<b>31</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating the structure taken along the section line S<b>32</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a schematic top view illustrating a partial structure of a high-voltage transistor device in one embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating the structure taken along the section line S<b>41</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>; and</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating the structure taken along the section line S<b>42</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present disclosure as illustrated below provide a high-voltage transistor device and the method for fabricating the same, which can reduce the NBTI and improve the driving current and the efficacy of the high-voltage transistor device.

By this approach, the NBTI problems occurred in the prior art high-voltage transistor device can be improved, and the service life of the high-voltage transistor element <b>100</b> can be prolong.
