For example, autonomous vehicle navigation requires accurate and precise positioning information to avoid the vehicle impacting with other vehicles, pedestrians, and/or structures. Similarly, navigating a vessel through a specified maritime channel requires accurate position information to avoid shallow areas, underwater wrecks, etc. Spoofing and/or jamming attacks on GNSS receivers have become a serious threat to these critical applications of GNSS position information.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As used herein, a jamming attack is generally defined as the broadcasting of signals on GNSS frequencies that overwhelm the legitimate GNSS signals and aim to prevent a GNSS receiver from determining a position. Similarly, as used herein, a spoofing attack is generally defined as the broadcasting of fake GNSS signals that are designed to cause a receiver to determine an incorrect position. Both attacks may occur simultaneously, i.e., spoofing signals may be transmitted with such a high power that they initially cause a receiver to lose tracking of the satellite signals, thereby resulting in a jamming attack. The spoofing signals may then be reduced in power so that the receiver locks onto the spoofing signal and utilizes the spoofing signal to calculate position.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is desirous for GNSS receivers to be capable of identifying when a spoofing attack is occurring so that the GNSS receiver, or another component that is using the GNSS position information, may perform appropriate remediation. For example, if a receiver determines that it is receiving spoofed signals, it may cease to output position information, thereby preventing incorrect position information from being utilized in a manner that could cause harm. Additionally, should a receiver determine that it is being spoofed, appropriate countermeasures may be utilized to reduce the impact of the spoofer.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The disadvantages of the prior art are overcome by providing a system and method for detecting spoofing of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) systems using a plurality of antennas. A GNSS receiver that is connected to a plurality of antennas performs one or more authentication procedures using signals received at particular pairs of the plurality of antennas. Illustratively, the system may perform the authentication procedure using a variety of differing pairs of antennas for added accuracy and precision in determining whether received signals are spoofing signals or authentic signals.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an illustrative embodiment, the received GNSS signals are utilized in one or more of a carrier phase-based authentication procedure, a signal power-based authentication procedure, and/or a channel distortion-based authentication procedure. Each of the procedures may be performed in any order, and/or may be performed in parallel.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a carrier phase-based authentication procedure, in the spoofing case where all of the spoofing signals are transmitted from a single source, the phase difference between two spatially separated antennas will be the same and hence will result in a zero double difference of carrier phase measurements. However, authentic signals will arrive to the antennas from different directions, the phase difference between two antenna elements are different and as such will result in different double difference of carrier phase measurements for each pair of signals. In this exemplary method, the system calculates the double difference of the carrier phase measurements and determines if the double difference is greater than a predefined threshold. If it is, the procedure determines that the received signals are authentic.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the signal power-based authentication procedure, the system calculates the double difference of the carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N<sub>0</sub>). In the spoofing case, as all the PRNs are generated from a single source, all the PRNs are experiencing the same multipath channel and antenna gain pattern and hence the double difference of the C/N<sub>0 </sub>will be around zero whereas in the authentic case each PRN experiences different paths and hence will have different double difference of the C/N<sub>0 </sub>values. In this method, the calculated double difference is compared to a predefined threshold. If the double difference exceeds the predefined threshold, the system determines that the received signals are authentic.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the next possible spoofing authentic signal classification method, the system calculates the double difference of the pseudorange measurements (PSR). In the spoofing case, as all spoofing PRNs are sourced from a single antenna, all the PRNs experience the same wireless channel distortion and hence the double difference of the PSR measurement will be around zero, whereas this is not the case for authentic signals. The calculated double difference is compared to a predefined threshold. If the double difference exceeds the predefined threshold, the system determines that the received signals are authentic.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In alternative embodiments, any of the described techniques may be used for signal authentication. Further, in alternative embodiments, should any of the authentication procedures determine that the signals are authentic, the remaining authentication procedures are not performed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The above and further advantages of the present invention are described herein in conjunction with the accompanying figures in which like reference numerals indicate identical or functionally similar elements, of which:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an exemplary Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) environment in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart detailing the steps of a procedure for performing spoofing detection using a plurality of antennas in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart detailing the steps of a procedure for performing carrier phase-based authentication in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is an exemplary graph illustrating a double differencing of carrier phase measurements in an authentic case in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is an exemplary graph illustrating a double differencing of carrier phase measurements in a spoofing case in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> is an exemplary graph illustrating a double differencing of carrier phase measurements in a spoofing case with an expanded scale to show differences in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart detailing the steps of a procedure for performing signal power-based authentication in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is an exemplary graph illustrating a double differencing of carrier to noise ratio (C/N<sub>0</sub>) measurements in an authentic case in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> is an exemplary graph illustrating a double differencing of carrier to noise ratio (C/N<sub>0</sub>) measurements in a spoofing case in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> is an exemplary graph illustrating a double differencing of carrier to noise ratio (C/N<sub>0</sub>) measurements in a spoofing case with an expanded scale to show differences in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart detailing the steps of a procedure for performing channel distortion-based authentication in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is an exemplary graph illustrating a double differencing of pseudorange measurements in an authentic case in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> is an exemplary graph illustrating a double differencing of pseudorange measurements in a spoofing case in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention; and</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> is an exemplary graph illustrating a double differencing of pseudorange measurements in a spoofing case with an expanded scale to show differences in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram of an exemplary Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) environment <b>100</b> in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. Environment <b>100</b> illustratively comprises of a GNSS receiver <b>105</b>, a plurality of GNSS satellites <b>140</b>A,<b>140</b>B, and an exemplary jammer/spoofer <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A plurality of GNSS systems are currently in operation, e.g., GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, and Galileo. The illustrative GNSS satellites <b>140</b> transmit exemplary GNSS signals <b>145</b>. Typically, the GNSS satellites <b>140</b> broadcast the GNSS signals <b>145</b> on a plurality of frequencies, e.g., L1, L2, L5, etc. Illustratively, the carriers of signals <b>145</b> are modulated by ranging codes, which are pseudorandom noise (PRNs). A unique PRN is selected for transmission by each satellite, <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B. A satellite may change which PRN code it transmits over time, but only one satellite transmits a particular PRN code at a given time. GNSS signals <b>145</b> also include navigational data, which may include data on the satellite health status, ephemeris (i.e., satellite position and velocity), clock bias parameters, and an almanac giving data on all satellites in the GNSS constellation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A typical GNSS receiver receives a composite signal consisting of several signals <b>145</b> transmitted by the satellites, as well as any noise and interfering signals, such as spoofing signal <b>160</b>, described further below. A receiver may recover one of the transmitted signals <b>145</b> by correlating the composite received signal with a locally generated reference version of the PRN code signal assigned to the particular satellite of interest. If the locally generated PRN reference signal is properly timed, the digital data from that satellite may then be properly detected.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Exemplary jammer/spoofer <b>150</b> utilizes an antenna <b>155</b> to broadcast a set of spoofing signals <b>160</b>. The spoofing signals <b>160</b> may modulate the carrier with information that conforms to a GNSS standard. However, the spoofing signals may include falsified PRNs and/or incorrect navigation data, e.g., almanac and/or ephemeris data. The purpose of spoofing signals <b>160</b> is to cause receiver <b>105</b> to determine an incorrect position and/or time. A determination of a position/time that is incorrect may have severe safety of life consequences if, e.g., a crash occurs due to the incorrect position. For example, in an aircraft navigation environment, spoofing signals <b>160</b> may cause a receiver <b>105</b> to determine an incorrect position. An aircraft relying on such incorrect position information may impact with terrain.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The illustrative receiver <b>105</b> includes one or more exemplary antennas <b>110</b>A, B that are utilized by the receiver <b>105</b> for receiving GNSS signals <b>145</b>A, B from the various GNSS satellites <b>140</b>A, B. Further, if a jammer/spoofing <b>150</b> is broadcasting a spoofing signal <b>160</b>, antennas <b>110</b> may also receive the spoofing signal <b>160</b>. The antennas <b>110</b> may also receive other signals, such as interference, noise, etc. Illustratively, the receiver <b>105</b> receives GNSS signals <b>145</b> at antennas <b>110</b> and utilizes well-known techniques to calculate various navigation information including, e.g., position, velocity, etc.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In accordance with various illustrative embodiments of the present invention, a plurality of antennas <b>110</b> may be utilized.

The techniques described below may be performed a plurality of times, using various pairs of antennas <b>110</b>. For example, if three antennas <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B, and <b>110</b>C (not shown) are connected to receiver <b>105</b>, the procedure may be performed using <b>110</b>A and <b>110</b>B, then using <b>110</b>A and <b>110</b>C, and finally using <b>110</b>B and <b>110</b>C. In alternative embodiments, not every possible combination may be performed. Further, certain antennas may not receive the signals. It is expressly contemplated that any number of combinations may be utilized in accordance with alternative embodiments of the present invention.

The detection software <b>125</b> may interact with GNSS software <b>122</b> that illustratively implements conventional position determination functionality.

As noted above, prior to the initiation of procedure <b>300</b>, the receiver <b>105</b> will have received signals from two antennas <b>110</b>. If there are more than two antennas, the signals received from two of the antennas will be utilized in performing procedure <b>300</b>.

The single and double differences may be calculated using conventional techniques as is well known to those skilled in the art. Then, in step <b>315</b>, the integer part of the measured single and double difference of the carrier phase measurements are removed.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In step <b>320</b> determination is made whether the double difference of the carrier phase measurement exceeds a predefined threshold. As spoofing signals will typically have a double difference of their carrier phase measurements be equal to zero, the predefined threshold is typically set to a very small value, e.g., 0.05 cycle which is a function of the carrier phase measurements' standard deviation. However, in accordance with alternative embodiments of the present invention, other predefined thresholds may be utilized. Therefore, the description of a predefined threshold of 0.05 cycle should be taken as exemplary only. The predefined threshold may be set based on properties of the receiver <b>105</b>, antennas <b>110</b>, etc.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">If the double difference of the carrier phase measurement does exceed the predefined threshold, the procedure branches to step <b>325</b> where the system determines that the signal is authentic.

That is, a plurality of single and double differences of the carrier phase measurement are reviewed to determine if they vary over time. If the single or double difference of the carrier phase measurement is determined to be time variant, the procedure branches to step <b>325</b> and determines that the signal is authentic.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">However, if in step <b>335</b> it is determined that the single or double difference of the carrier phase measurement are not time variant, the procedure branches to step <b>340</b> and determines if the predefined observation period has elapsed.

If the double difference of the carrier phase measurements do not exceed the predefined threshold or the single/double difference of the carrier phase measurements are not determined to be time variant within the observation time period, the system determines that the signals are spoofing signals. It should be noted that the determination of an authentic signal in step <b>325</b> or a spoofing signal in step <b>345</b> may be an intermediate determination. For example, if the determination is made that the signal is authentic in step <b>325</b>, procedure <b>200</b> may still proceed from step <b>300</b> to step <b>500</b> to perform further tests to determine whether the signal is authentic or not.
