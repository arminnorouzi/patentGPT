And because electric motors can be designed to be very compact and efficient, especially as compared to combustion engines, they are also being used as in-wheel or hub motors, with an electric motor mounted in or very close to each of the wheels of the vehicle. Some of the newer, more innovative designs for vehicle drive systems are not only capable of rotating the wheel but are also capable of moving the wheel in directions that are transverse to the rotational axis. That is, they are capable of producing movement with two degrees of freedom, namely, rotation to propel the vehicle along the road and translation to provide an active suspension for the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One example of such a system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,519,575 and is based on the use of Lorentz-force, linear actuators. To achieve the two degrees of freedom, it uses two opposed linear actuators and a linear-to-rotary converter that is made up of an arrangement of cam followers interfacing with a cam assembly that supports a wheel rim. The linear actuators are opposed to each other in that they lie on opposite sides of the rotational axis of the wheel. When the two opposed linear actuators are operated to move the cam followers towards each other or away from each other in synchronization, the linear-to-rotary converter converts that movement to pure rotation of the wheel. When the two linear actuators are operated to move the cam followers in the same direction (i.e., one moving towards the rotational axis and the other away), this causes the cam assembly and the wheel to which it is attached to translate in a direction that is transverse to the axis of rotation of the wheel.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, in one aspect, an example embodiment of the invention features an electric drive system including a rotary motor system and a multi-bar linkage mechanism.

Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A description of example embodiments follows.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a Watt's linkage <b>100</b>. A Watt's linkage is a mechanical linkage arrangement in which a central point <b>105</b> of one of the linkages is constrained, by virtue of the linkages, to travel along a pre-defined path, a significant portion of which is substantially-straight, as indicated by line <b>110</b>. A Watt's linkage includes three movable rods, in this particular example, two longer rods <b>115</b> and <b>120</b> of equal length connected together by a shorter rod <b>125</b>, the mid-point of which is point <b>105</b>. The ends of the three rods are hinged so that they can rotate about the hinge point. On end of rod <b>115</b> is connected to stationary mount <b>126</b> at hinge point <b>127</b> and the other end of rod <b>115</b> is connected to one end of shorter rod <b>125</b> at hinge point <b>128</b>. One end of rod <b>120</b> is connected to another end of shorter rod <b>125</b> at hinge point <b>129</b> and the other end of rod <b>120</b> is connected to a second stationary mount <b>130</b> at another hinge point <b>131</b>. The stationary mounts <b>126</b> and <b>130</b> are fixed in place relative to each other by, for example, being coupled to a common base or common structure. Though there are only three movable rods in this example, the Watt's linkage is also generally referred to as a four-bar linkage because of the fact that the connection between the two stationary mounts is considered to be the fourth bar.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As should be apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, even though the end points of the rods are constrained by virtue of being connected to each other, the orientation of the rods can be changed. So, for example, assume the initial position of the rods is as shown by the elements depicted with solid lines. As rod <b>115</b> is rotated counterclockwise relative to hinge point <b>127</b> to another position, indicated in the figure by the dashed lines labeled A, that will cause rod <b>120</b> to rotate about its hinge point <b>131</b> in a clockwise direction and will cause short rod <b>125</b> to rotate relative to its center point in a clockwise direction. Alternatively, if rod <b>115</b> is rotated in a clockwise direction to another position, indicated in the figure by the dashed lines labeled B, that will cause rod <b>120</b> to rotate in a counterclockwise direction and will cause short rod <b>125</b> to also rotate relative to its center point in a counter clockwise direction. A characteristic of the Watt's linkage is that as the orientation of the rods are changed in this manner to cover all possible orientations that are permitted by the linkage arrangement, the center point <b>105</b> of the short rod <b>125</b> will trace out a defined path and the Watt's linkage arrangement will constrain that center point to always lie on that defined path. As illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the shape of that defined path is a figure eight of which significant portion is substantially linear.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">An embodiment illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> uses the Watt's linkage in combination with two electric motors to construct a drive system <b>300</b> that is capable of both driving a wheel (not shown) rotationally and controllably translating the wheel in a direction that is transverse to the wheel's axis of rotation. In other words, it is a drive system that has two degrees of freedom.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The drive system <b>300</b> includes two electric motors <b>340</b> and <b>345</b> fixed in position relative to each other (illustrated by the two triangular-shaped objects). It also includes a linkage arrangement made up of two equal-length swing arms <b>315</b> and <b>320</b> and a shorter crank arm <b>325</b>. These correspond, respectively, to the previously discussed rods <b>115</b>, <b>120</b> and <b>125</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. There is a pulley <b>350</b> at one end of swing arm <b>315</b> that is driven by electric motor <b>340</b> and there is another pulley <b>355</b> at the far end of swing arm <b>320</b> that is driven by electric motor <b>345</b>. At the other end of swing arm <b>315</b>, opposite the end with pulley <b>350</b>, there is a second pulley <b>358</b>. Attached to that pulley <b>358</b> is a coaxially aligned elbow gear <b>360</b>. Similarly, at the other end of swing arm <b>320</b>, opposite the end with pulley <b>355</b>, there is also a pulley <b>363</b> with another attached, coaxially aligned elbow gear <b>365</b>, which is the same size as elbow gear <b>360</b> and <b>365</b>. Located at the center point of crank arm <b>325</b> there is a crank gear <b>370</b> that is also the same size as and meshes with the two elbow gears <b>360</b> and <b>365</b>. On swing arm <b>315</b>, a drive belt <b>375</b> couples pulley <b>350</b> to pulley <b>358</b> and on swing arm <b>320</b>, another drive belt <b>380</b> couples pulley <b>355</b> to pulley <b>363</b>. Pulleys <b>350</b> and <b>358</b> have the same drive ratio as pulleys <b>355</b> and <b>363</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">To understand how the linkage drive system <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> operates, consider a case in which the two motors <b>340</b> and <b>345</b> turn their attached pulleys <b>350</b> and <b>355</b> at the same rate and in the some direction (e.g., clockwise). In that case, belt <b>375</b> will also drive pulley <b>360</b> in a clockwise direction and at a speed that is determined by the ratio of the sizes of the two pulleys <b>350</b> and <b>358</b>. Similarly, belt <b>380</b> will drive pulley <b>365</b> in a clockwise direction and at a speed that is determined by the ratio of the sizes of those two pulleys <b>355</b> and <b>363</b>. Assuming both sets of pulleys (i.e., pulleys <b>350</b> and <b>358</b> and pulleys <b>355</b> and <b>363</b>) have a ratio of 1:2, when motor <b>340</b> drives pulley <b>350</b> in a clockwise direction at a rotational speed of 2&#x3c9;, then pulley <b>358</b> will turn in a clockwise direction at half that speed, namely, w. Since the gears <b>360</b>, <b>365</b>, and <b>370</b> are of the same ratio, gear <b>370</b> and the drive shaft <b>373</b> to which it is attached will want to turn in a counterclockwise direction at a speed of w. Similarly, when motor <b>345</b> drives pulley <b>355</b> in a clockwise direction at a rotational speed of 2&#x3c9;, then pulley <b>363</b> will turn in a clockwise direction at half that speed, namely, w and gear <b>370</b> and the drive shaft <b>373</b> to which it is attached will again want to turn in a counterclockwise direction at a speed of w. Notice that this operating condition, namely, both motors operating at the same speed, results in both motors causing gear <b>370</b> to rotate at w and this results in zero torque applied to the crank arm <b>325</b> which supports crank gear <b>370</b>. That is, operating both motors <b>340</b> and <b>345</b> at the same speed and in the same direction will result in the drive system producing pure rotational movement of the drive shaft. Since no torque is being applied to any of the linkages, they will not change their orientations or positions. Thus, under those drive conditions, the swing arms <b>315</b> and <b>320</b> will remain stationary and &#x201c;locked&#x201d; in position.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">It should be apparent from the above discussion that a different situation arises if the motors are operated at different speeds. In that case, a torque will be imposed on the crank arm and that torque will cause the orientation of linkages to change. To see why, consider what happens in the above situation when motor <b>345</b> increases its speed slightly above 2&#x3c9;. When that happens, gear <b>365</b> will be forced to rotate at a speed that is greater than the speed at which crank gear <b>370</b> is rotating. The only way that can happen is if gear <b>365</b>, besides rotating, also &#x201c;walks&#x201d; around crank gear <b>370</b>. This will, in turn, result in a torque being applied to crank <b>325</b> causing the linkages to alter their orientation with respect to each other and causing the drive shaft to move along the defined path imposed by Watt's linkage. In other words, this will cause the drive shaft <b>372</b> to move or translate in a direction that is transverse to the axis of the drive shaft. In addition, as long as the speeds of the two motors are different, the linkages will continue to change orientation and the axis of drive shaft will continue to move along that predefined path.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Assuming the two motors are operating at the same speed to produce purely rotary movement of the drive shaft, changing the position of the drive shaft from one point to another point is accomplished by changing the phase relationship of the two motors. The speed at which that change in phase is accomplished determines the speed at which the drive shaft translates to its new location as determined by the Watt's linkage.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the foregoing description, it was assumed for simplicity that the pulleys were the same size and that the gears were the same size and had the same ratios. This need not be the case. The pulley sizes can be different, as can the gear sizes. In any case, a key operating condition for achieving purely rotational movement is that both gear <b>365</b> and gear <b>360</b> rotate the crank gear <b>370</b> at the same speed. Then, any change in speed of one motor or the other will cause translational movement of the drive shaft <b>372</b>. Stated differently, any shift in phase of either motor <b>340</b> or motor <b>345</b> will cause a corresponding translation movement of the drive shaft <b>372</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">If the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is used as drive system for the wheels of a vehicle, the motors <b>340</b> and <b>345</b> would, for example, be attached to the frame or chassis of the vehicle and the wheel rim and tire would be attached to the drive shaft <b>372</b>. Such an arrangement, because it is capable of two degrees of freedom, could be used to both propel the vehicle as well as actively control the height of the chassis above the road surface (which capability could serve to provide a active shock absorber function).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Another embodiment of the multi-bar linkage drive system combines the two motors of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> into a single electric motor with a rotational axis located at the center of the crank. A schematic representation of this other embodiment of multi-bar linkage drive system <b>500</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The drive system <b>500</b> includes two swing arms <b>515</b> and <b>520</b> and crank assembly <b>534</b> that connects between corresponding ends of the two swing arms <b>515</b> and <b>520</b>. Crank assembly <b>534</b> includes a crankshaft <b>535</b><i>c </i>with two crank arms <b>535</b><i>a </i>and <b>535</b><i>b</i>, one at each end of the crankshaft <b>535</b><i>c</i>, each extending transversely with respect to the rotational axis of the crankshaft <b>535</b><i>c </i>and oriented 180&#xb0; with respect to each other. One end of swing arm <b>520</b> pivotably connects to crank arm <b>535</b><i>a </i>through a bearing while the other end of swing arm <b>520</b> pivotably connects to a mount structure <b>570</b><i>a </i>through another bearing. Similarly, one end of swing arm <b>515</b> pivotably connects to crank arm <b>535</b><i>b </i>(not visible in the figures) through its own bearing while the other end of swing arm <b>515</b> pivotably connects to a mount structure <b>570</b><i>b </i>through yet another bearing. This combination of elements constitutes a four-bar linkage arrangement similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and it constrains the rotational axis of the crankshaft to follow a defined path as the orientations of the linkages changes.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The electric motor in drive system <b>500</b> includes two stator assemblies <b>540</b> and <b>545</b> and a rotor assembly <b>530</b>, each of which is mounted on the crankshaft <b>535</b><i>c </i>using bearings so that it can rotate independently of the other two components. Rotor assembly <b>530</b> includes a ring of bolts <b>550</b> around its periphery for mounting a wheel rim and a tire (not shown) onto the rotor assembly <b>530</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Note that the bearings are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> so as to simplify the drawings. They are, however, explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, which is discussed later. In addition, as will also be made clear in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the motors in the described embodiment are electric, axial-flux motors, in which the stator assemblies are coil stator assemblies, and the rotor assembly is a magnetic rotor assembly. Also, note that the word &#x201c;stator,&#x201d; which may sometimes be interpreted to imply that the component being referred to is stationary and does not rotate, is not meant to be so limited in the present context. The stator assemblies described herein are capable of rotating about a rotational axis, which may or may not be the same as the rotational axis of the rotor assembly. This capability is an important feature because, at least in some embodiments, it enables the drive system to produce two degrees of freedom, namely, rotation and translation.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, each swing arm <b>515</b> and <b>520</b> is mechanically connected to its corresponding stator assembly <b>530</b> and <b>540</b>. Swing arm <b>520</b> has two wing extensions <b>536</b><i>a </i>and <b>536</b><i>b</i>. Torque links <b>539</b><i>a </i>and <b>539</b><i>b </i>connect wing extensions <b>536</b><i>a </i>and <b>536</b><i>b</i>, respectively, to stator assembly <b>545</b>. Similarly, on the other side of the drive system, swing arm <b>515</b> also has two wing extensions <b>537</b><i>a </i>and <b>537</b><i>b </i>(not visible in the figures). And torque links <b>538</b><i>a </i>and <b>538</b><i>b </i>connect wing extensions <b>537</b><i>a </i>and <b>537</b><i>b</i>, respectively, to stator assembly <b>540</b>. The torque links <b>539</b><i>a </i>and <b>539</b><i>b </i>are for transferring the torque generated by the stator assembly <b>545</b> to the swing arm <b>520</b>, and the torque links <b>538</b><i>a </i>and <b>538</b><i>b </i>are for transferring a torque generated by the stator assembly <b>540</b> to the swing arm <b>515</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Though each the stator assembly <b>515</b> and <b>520</b> is free to rotate about the axis of the crankshaft <b>535</b><i>c </i>by virtue of being mounted on the crankshaft with bearings, the torque links connecting them to the multi-bar linkage constrain that motion, preventing them from freely rotating without limit. In fact, the torque links limit the rotation of the stator assemblies to within a narrow range of permitted rotations. This limitation range of rotation enables one to use a wire harness to connect the drive signals to the coils in the stator assemblies rather than having to use commutation or some other means to provide drive signals to the coils on the coil stator assembly.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Note that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, there are four points labeled points A, B, C, and D. These points define four distances, namely: AB, AC, CD, and BD. AB represents the length of the torque link, CD represents the length of the crank arm, AC represents a radial distance between the axis of the crankshaft and the attachment point of the torque link to the stator assembly, and BD represents the distance between the point at which the crank arm connects to the swing arm and the point at which the torque link connects to the extension wing of the swing arm. In the described embodiment, these lengths are designed to have the following relationship to each other: AB=CD and AC=BD. This defines a parallelogram. As a consequence of this arrangement, a rotation of the stator assembly with respect to the vertical translates into a corresponding and equal rotation of the swing arm about its point of coupling to the mount structure and in the same direction. In other words, if stator assembly <b>545</b> rotates in a clockwise direction, this will urge swing arm <b>520</b> in an upward direction, which also corresponds to a rotation of swing arm <b>520</b> about the mounting structure <b>570</b><i>a </i>in a clockwise direction.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The multi-bar linkage drive system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A</figref> and B works in a manner similar to the way the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> works. When a drive signal is applied to each of the stator assemblies <b>540</b> and <b>545</b> so that both drive signals produce the same torque and urge the rotor assembly <b>530</b> to rotate in a clockwise direction, then pure rotational motion of the rotor assembly <b>530</b> results. (Note: the direction of rotation is viewed from the perspective of one side of the motor, in this case, the side on which stator assembly <b>545</b> is located. This will be the convention used throughout the rest of the description.) The orientation of the swing arms <b>515</b> and <b>520</b> will remain fixed and the crankshaft <b>535</b><i>c </i>will not move in a transverse direction. This is because the torque imposed on the crankshaft <b>535</b><i>c </i>by the stator assembly <b>540</b> is counteracted by the torque imposed on the crankshaft <b>535</b><i>c </i>by the stator assembly <b>545</b>. The torques on the linkages, being equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, produce no net torque on any of the linkages.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">On the other hand, if the drive signal on one stator assembly is changed relative to the other drive signal, there will be a net torque on the crank assembly and that will cause it to change its orientation/position. As a result the crankshaft, while it is rotating, will also move along the path defined by the multi-bar linkage.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">To understand how the multi-bar linkage drive system can be operated to translate the crankshaft consider the case in which the magnetic rotor assembly is prevented by something from rotating and the swing arms are moved. This can be visualized with the aid of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A through <b>6</b>F</figref> which show the various relative positions of the drive system elements as the crankshaft <b>535</b><i>c </i>and the rotor assembly <b>530</b> (on which a wheel would be mounted) are moved (or translated) from an up position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>) to a down position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>F</figref>). The downward pointing arrow in each of the figures indicates the direction in which the rotor assembly and crank assembly is being moved. As the rotor assembly <b>540</b> moves downward from the location depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the crank assembly and the swing arms <b>515</b> and <b>520</b> will follow it down. At the same time, the torque links <b>538</b> and <b>539</b> will cause the stator assemblies <b>540</b> and <b>545</b> to rotate in the same direction as the swing arm <b>515</b> and <b>420</b> are rotating about their respective mounts <b>570</b><i>a </i>and <b>570</b><i>b</i>. The downward movement of swing arm <b>520</b> represents a counterclockwise rotation about its mount <b>570</b><i>b</i>. So, stator assembly <b>545</b> will be forced to rotate in a counterclockwise direction about the crankshaft <b>535</b><i>c </i>by an equal amount. On the other side of the multi-bar linkage drive system, the downward movement of swing arm <b>515</b> represents a clockwise rotation about its mount <b>570</b><i>a</i>. So, stator assembly <b>540</b> will be forced to rotate in a clockwise direction about the crankshaft <b>535</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As indicated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>C-F</figref>, this relative movement of the elements continues as the axis of the rotor assembly <b>530</b> is moved further down the path defined by the multi-bar linkage for the axis of the crankshaft <b>535</b><i>c</i>. Note that the stator assemblies <b>540</b> and <b>545</b> depicted in the drawings have reference slots which should be helpful in visualizing the rotation of these elements as the rotor assembly <b>530</b> is moved towards its down position indicated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>F</figref>. Also note that there are arrows identifying the direction of rotation of the stator assemblies.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">It should be apparent, that the movements that are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-F</figref> can be produced by applying the appropriate drive signals to the stator assemblies <b>540</b> and <b>545</b>. The drive signals need to be such that they apply a net torque on the rotor assembly <b>530</b> that is zero, resulting on no rotation of the rotor assembly <b>530</b>, while at the same time urging the stator assemblies <b>540</b> and <b>545</b> to rotate in opposite directions of rotation relative to each other. For example, if stator <b>545</b> applies torque (via electromagnetic force on the rotor assembly <b>530</b>) to turn itself counterclockwise (and in turn, urging the rotor assembly to rotate in a clockwise direction), it also exerts force on swing arm <b>520</b> via the torque links <b>539</b><i>a </i>and <b>539</b><i>b </i>that pushes up on the swing arm <b>520</b>. There must then also be a balancing force at the crank assembly <b>534</b> that pushes down on the crank assembly <b>534</b> in a downward direction (because at small accelerations, the sum of forces is zero). The crank assembly <b>534</b>, in turn, pushes down on the swing arm <b>520</b>. As a consequence, the swing arm <b>520</b> has a force pushing it down where it connects to the crank assembly <b>534</b> and up where it connects to the torque links <b>539</b><i>a </i>and <b>539</b><i>b</i>. In effect, a rotating torque is applied to swing arm <b>520</b> causing the swing arm <b>520</b> to start to rotate in a counterclockwise direction, i.e., the same direction in which the stator assembly <b>545</b> is rotating. A similar action occurs on the other side of the rotor assembly <b>530</b> at stator assembly <b>540</b> and swing arm <b>515</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">If both stator assemblies <b>540</b> and <b>545</b> are rotated in a way that rotates the corresponding swing arms <b>515</b> and <b>520</b> in an upward direction, then the swing arms <b>515</b> and <b>520</b> (and drive shaft <b>530</b>) move up. If both stator assemblies <b>540</b> and <b>545</b> rotate the swing arms <b>515</b> and <b>520</b> in a downward direction, the swing arms <b>515</b> and <b>520</b> (and wheel <b>530</b>) move down. If one swing arm is being rotated down while the other swing arm is being rotated up, and if the torques are balanced, the swing arms <b>515</b> and <b>520</b> do not move.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In summary, to rotate the wheel <b>530</b> without translation, equal torques are applied to both stator assemblies <b>540</b> and <b>545</b> in the same direction. In that case, the moments applied to each swing arm cancel and the rotor assembly rotates. To translate the wheel <b>530</b>, equal but opposite torques are applied to both stator assemblies <b>540</b> and <b>45</b>. This causes the swing arms <b>515</b> and <b>520</b> move in the same direction.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Since the multi-bar linkage drive system is a linear system both rotation of the rotor assembly <b>530</b> and translational movement of the crankshaft <b>535</b><i>c </i>(and rotor assembly <b>530</b>) can be achieved by adding the signals that are required to produce each type of motion separately. In other words, through the use of appropriate drive signals, the rotor assembly can be made to rotate while at the same time it is also caused to translate up or down.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the above discussions inertial effects are ignored. When inertial effects are added in, they change the magnitudes of the torques and forces needed but they do not change the general principles of how the multi-bar linkage drive system operates. In addition, in the above discussion it was explained that rotations occurs when the torques are equal with the same sign and motion (or translation) occurs when the torques are equal but of opposite signs. This is true at some but not all points along the defined path of translational movement (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). In general, at other locations, there is some small amount of &#x201c;cross-talk&#x201d; or &#x201c;non-orthogonality.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">An example of the structure of an electric drive motor <b>600</b> that can be used in the previously described embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.

These axially-directed magnetic fields produced by the arrays of magnets intersect radially-oriented windings of the coils <b>612</b> on the coil assembly <b>608</b>. When currents are passed through the coil windings, the interaction of the currents with the magnetic fields produces a Lorentz force on the magnetic rotor assembly <b>608</b> and the coil stator assembly <b>606</b>. That force, which is tangentially-directed, applies a torque to the disks causing them to rotate, with the disk of the magnetic rotor assembly <b>608</b> urged to rotate in one direction about the crankshaft <b>603</b><i>a </i>and the disk of the coil stator assemblies urged to rotate in the opposite direction about the crankshaft <b>603</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the electric drive motor is coupled to the arrangement of linkages as previously described, the magnetic rotor assemblies are free to spin about the crankshaft; however, each coil stator assembly is limited by the linkages to operate only within a limited range of rotation.

This will, by virtue of the linkages <b>1030</b><i>a </i>and <b>1030</b><i>b</i>, push the spindle <b>1106</b>, and the attached tire, downward or conversely; it will push the vehicle, to which the suspension arms are attached, upward.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Now consider another mode of operation, which will be described with the help of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>. In this case, assume the drive currents applied to the coil stator assemblies <b>1102</b><i>a </i>and <b>1102</b><i>b </i>are such that they both urge the magnetic rotor assembly to rotate in the same direction. More specifically, the drive currents applied to coil stator assembly <b>1102</b><i>a </i>urge the magnetic rotor assembly to rotate in a clockwise direction while they also urge the coil stator assembly <b>1102</b><i>a </i>to rotate in a counterclockwise direction (as illustrated by the arrow identified by letter E). And, the drive currents applied to the coil stator assembly <b>1102</b><i>b </i>urge the magnetic rotor assembly to rotate in a clockwise direction while they also urge the coil stator assembly <b>1102</b><i>b </i>to rotate in a counterclockwise direction (as illustrated by the arrow identified by letter E). The linkage <b>1030</b><i>a </i>will transfer the torque applied by coil stator assembly <b>1102</b><i>a </i>to the spindle <b>1106</b> urging it to move downward; while the linkage <b>1030</b><i>b </i>will transfer the torque applied by coil stator assembly <b>1102</b><i>b </i>to the spindle <b>1106</b> urging it to move upward. Assuming the drive currents applied to the coil stator assemblies <b>1102</b><i>a </i>and <b>1102</b><i>b </i>are selected so as to produce the same magnitude torques, the forces imposed on the spindle <b>1106</b> will exactly counterbalance each other and the spindle <b>1106</b> will remain stationary (i.e., it will move neither up nor down). On the other hand, since both coil stator assemblies <b>1102</b><i>a </i>and <b>1102</b><i>b </i>are urging the magnetic rotor assembly to rotate in the same direction, the wheel will turn in that direction.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In summary, there are two modes of operation: one that will be called a common mode of operation and another that be called a differential mode of operation. In the common mode, the drive signals applied to the two coil stator assemblies produce torques on the magnetic rotor assembly that are equal and have the same sign. During purely common mode operation, the wheel rotates but there is no translational (up and down) movement of the wheel. In the differential mode, the drive signals applied to the two coil stator assemblies produce torques on the magnetic rotor assembly that are equal and have opposite signs. During purely differential mode operation the wheel does not rotate but there is a translational (up and down) movement of the wheel. By appropriately selecting the drive currents to the coil stator assemblies, a combination of both types of movement can be produced simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Conceptually, the system of linkages just described can be viewed as two mechanical systems that work together to produce the translational movement of the wheel. One system is formed by the suspension fork and internal linear bearings that constrain the spindle to move along a predefined path, which in this case is a linear path. The other system is formed by an arrangement of linkages which converts the relative rotational movement of the two coil stator assemblies with respect to each other into translational movement of the spindle (or rotational element) along the predefined path defined by the suspension fork. Note that in the illustrated embodiment, the arrangement of linkages corresponds to a four-bar linkage arrangement.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The two mechanical systems are illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B</figref>. The linear bearing <b>1140</b><i>b </i>inside arm <b>1020</b><i>b </i>constrains the axis of the spindle <b>1106</b> to move up and down along a linear path defined by the guide within the linear bearing. The arrangement of linkages that moves the spindle along that path in response to torques generated by the electric motor is a multi-bar linkage mechanism that includes four bars or links <b>1180</b><i>a</i>, <b>1180</b><i>b</i>, <b>1182</b><i>a</i>, and <b>1182</b><i>b</i>. Two of the four links are represented by the elements connecting the coil stator assemblies to fixed locations on the suspension arms. On one side, there is the link <b>1180</b><i>b </i>between a point on the coil stator assembly <b>1102</b><i>b </i>that is located at a fixed distance from the axis of rotation of the coil stator assembly <b>1102</b><i>b </i>(represented by bearing mount <b>1144</b><i>b</i>) to an anchor point <b>1142</b><i>b </i>on the arm <b>1020</b><i>b</i>. On the other side (which is partly concealed in the side view presented in the figures), there is the link <b>1180</b><i>a </i>between a point on coil stator assembly <b>1102</b><i>a </i>that is located at a fixed distance from the axis of rotation of the coil stator assembly <b>1102</b><i>a </i>(represented by bearing mount <b>1144</b><i>a</i>) to anchor point <b>1142</b><i>a </i>on the arm <b>1020</b><i>a</i>. The remaining two links <b>1182</b><i>a </i>and <b>1182</b><i>b </i>are represented by the connections between the spindle <b>1106</b> and the bearing mounts <b>1144</b><i>b </i>and <b>1144</b><i>a </i>on the coil stator assemblies <b>1102</b><i>b </i>and <b>1102</b><i>a</i>, respectively. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B</figref>, these two links are represented by the elements <b>1182</b><i>b </i>and <b>1182</b><i>a</i>. Note that the four links effectively have their ends connected together at hinged points. The coil stator assemblies <b>1102</b><i>a </i>and <b>1102</b><i>b </i>change the physical arrangement of the four links by applying appropriate torques to the links <b>1182</b><i>a </i>and <b>1182</b><i>b</i>, causing them to rotate thereby reconfiguring the links. The reconfiguration of the links forces the spindle to move along the linear path defined by the linear bearing.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> depicts a vehicle <b>1200</b> that includes four electric motor drive systems <b>1202</b>, one driving each of the four wheels (only two drive systems are shown in the side view). Each electric motor drive system <b>1202</b> occupies the space that would normally be occupied by a typical wheel and suspension assembly and is attached to the frame or body of the vehicle. Although the described embodiment includes four drive systems <b>1202</b>, one for each wheel, the vehicle could employ the drive systems on only the front wheels (or on the rear wheels). Other embodiments include one, two and three-wheeled vehicles or personal transport systems with one or more wheels being driven by the electric motor drive system described herein.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the embodiments described above, the linkages had a crescent shape and were anchored to points on suspension arms that aligned with each other. But the shape of the linkages and their anchor points are not particularly important. In the described embodiment, the crescent shape was chosen to satisfy certain physical constraints imposed by the illustrated design. Other shapes and/or arrangements are certainly possible. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, straight bar linkages <b>1160</b><i>a </i>and <b>1160</b><i>b </i>are used and each of the linkages is anchored on a tab <b>1162</b><i>a </i>and <b>1162</b><i>b</i>, respectively, that extends away from the fork suspension member.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Note that in the described embodiment, each of the coil stator assemblies is connected to an anchor point on the support structure (i.e., suspension arms) by a corresponding linkage and the axle of the wheel is constrained to only move along a path defined by the linear bearing that slides within the suspension arm. The linear bearing is a specific example of a slide mechanism other embodiments of which could also be used. There are other ways that could be used besides slide mechanisms to constrain the movement of the axle to be along a predefined transverse path. For example, a simple swing arm or arrangement of swing arms could be used between the frame of the vehicle and the axel of the wheel. In that case, the up and down movement of the wheel would not be along a strictly linear path but rather the path would be curved with a radius defined by the length of the swing arm.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>A-C</figref> show an example of an embodiment that employs swing arms <b>1194</b> to define the path over which the axle <b>1106</b> is able to move, namely, an arc the radius of which is determined by the length of the swing arms <b>1194</b><i>a </i>and <b>1194</b><i>b </i>(which is visually obstructed by swing arm <b>1194</b><i>a </i>in the figures). The frame of the vehicle or the support to which the drive system is connected is represented by block <b>1188</b>. The arrangement of linkages that moves the spindle <b>1106</b> along that path in response to torques generated by the electric motor is a multi-bar linkage mechanism that includes four bars or links <b>1190</b><i>a</i>, <b>1190</b><i>b</i>, <b>1192</b><i>a</i>, and <b>1192</b><i>b</i>. Two of the four links are represented by the elements connecting the coil stator assemblies to fixed locations on the frame <b>1188</b>. On one side, there is the link <b>1190</b><i>b </i>between a point on the coil stator assembly <b>1102</b><i>b </i>that is located at a fixed distance from the axis of rotation of the coil stator assembly <b>1102</b><i>b </i>(represented by bearing mount <b>1194</b><i>b</i>) to an anchor point <b>1196</b><i>b </i>on the frame <b>1188</b>. On the other side of the motor (which is partly concealed in the side view presented in the figures), there is the link <b>1190</b><i>a </i>between a point on coil stator assembly <b>1102</b><i>a </i>that is located at a fixed distance from the axis of rotation of the coil stator assembly <b>1102</b><i>a </i>(represented by bearing mount <b>1194</b><i>a</i>) to anchor point <b>1196</b><i>a </i>on the frame <b>1188</b>. (Note that the two anchor points <b>1196</b><i>a </i>and <b>1196</b><i>b </i>on the frame <b>1188</b> are collinear and the same distance from the spindle <b>1106</b>.) The remaining two links are represented by the connections between the spindle <b>1106</b> and the bearing mounts <b>1196</b><i>b </i>and <b>1196</b><i>a </i>on the coil stator assemblies <b>1102</b><i>b </i>and <b>1102</b><i>a</i>, respectively. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>A-C</figref>, these two links are represented by the elements <b>1192</b><i>b </i>and <b>1192</b><i>a</i>. Note that the four links effectively have their ends connected together at hinged points. The coil stator assemblies <b>1102</b><i>a </i>and <b>1102</b><i>b </i>change the physical arrangement of the four links by applying appropriate torques to the links <b>1192</b><i>a </i>and <b>1192</b><i>b</i>, causing them to rotate thereby reconfiguring the links. The reconfiguration of the links forces the spindle to move along the curved path defined by the swing arms <b>1194</b><i>a </i>and <b>1194</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the sequence shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>A-C</figref>, as coil stator assembly <b>1102</b><i>b </i>rotates clockwise (as shown by the solid curved arrow) and coil stator assembly <b>1102</b><i>a </i>rotates counterclockwise (as shown by the dashed, curved arrow), the distance between the spindle <b>1106</b> and the anchor points of the links <b>1190</b><i>a </i>and <b>1190</b><i>b </i>increases and the wheel is pushed in a downward direction. Rotation of the coil stator assemblies in the opposite directions pulls the wheel up.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Still other well-known approaches are also possible. There are also multi-bar linkages that could be used, examples of which are well known to persons skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Also, it should be apparent from the foregoing description that the use of the word &#x201c;stator,&#x201d; as for example in the case of the coil stator assembly, is not meant to imply that the element is stationary and incapable of rotation or movement. Often the word may be given this more limited meaning but that is not the intention when it is used herein. This should be apparent from the above description in which the coil stator assemblies also rotate about the rotational axis of the motor assembly.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">It should be understood that the arrangement of bearings that are used in the described embodiment is just one of many alternatives that could be used and which enables the two coil stator assemblies and the magnetic rotor assembly to rotate about a rotational axis independently of each other. They need not all use the spindle as one of the bearing surfaces. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> shows an alternative arrangement in which bearings <b>1209</b><i>a </i>and <b>1209</b><i>b </i>rotatably mount the coil stator assemblies on the magnetic rotor assembly. In addition, the hub assembly was represented by the spindle <b>1106</b> but it could be another arrangement that supports the two motors along their rotational axes.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Though the described embodiment referred specifically to using the second degree of freedom that is available from the drive system to provide an active suspension for a vehicle, that second degree of freedom could be used for other purposes depending on the application in which the drive system is used. For example, the drive system could be used as the motor for an airplane or other aircraft in which case the second degree of freedom could be used, for example, to control the pitch of the blades. If the drive system is used in machine equipment, the second degree of freedom could be used for other purposes requiring linear or translational movement of a part.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Other embodiments are within the claims. For example, though a specific four-bar linkage, namely, the Watt's linkage, was described, there are many other multi-bar linkage arrangements that exhibit similar behavior and that could be used in place of the Watt's linkage. Without intending to be limiting, other examples include multi-bar linkages having a number of linking bars that is different from four, the Chebyshev's linkage, and the Peaucellier-Lipkin linkage. In addition, electric motors other than axial flux motors could be used including, for example, other types of electrical motors that have magnetic rotors and coil stator assemblies, or coil rotors and magnetic stator assemblies, or electric motors that are based on switched reluctance technology, or commutators, or single or multi-phased drives, or DC drives, etc.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">While example embodiments have been particularly shown and described, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the scope of the embodiments encompassed by the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
