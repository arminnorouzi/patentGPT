This may allow Charger/Inverter <b>110</b> to receive AC power from the grid for charging the Storage Batteries <b>102</b> via Distributor <b>104</b>. Charger/Inverter <b>110</b> may also be coupled to a Remote Monitoring Interface <b>114</b>, thereby allowing for remote monitoring and management of System <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, Remote Monitoring Interface <b>114</b> may also be connected to Visual Monitors <b>116</b>, such as to indicate the state of charge of Storage Batteries <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">System <b>100</b> may be connected to Battery Chargers <b>118</b> via the Charger/Inverter <b>110</b> if Battery Chargers <b>118</b> are powered by AC or via Distributor <b>104</b> if Battery Chargers <b>118</b> are powered by DC.

For example, Exhaust Fans <b>202</b> may be mounted to the underside of the vehicle to extract air from compartments enclosing heat-generating elements of System <b>100</b>. In addition, Deflectors <b>204</b> may be mounted at the output of Exhaust Fans <b>202</b> to minimize any water or other debris entering Vehicle <b>202</b>. Compartments enclosing heat-generating elements of System <b>100</b> may also be coupled to Vehicle <b>200</b>'s air-conditioning system to provide further cooling to System <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, this may be implemented by allowing cold air from the air conditioning system to flow into the compartments enclosing heat-generating elements of System <b>100</b>. In other embodiments, this may be implemented by passing cold refrigerant through the compartments enclosing heat-generating elements of System <b>100</b>, which then allows fans to circulate cold air throughout the compartment without need of any exhaust.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, an example is shown of Solar Panels <b>108</b> mounted on a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is shown an integrated ramp/door for allowing the loading and unloading of tools or equipment from Vehicle <b>200</b>. The integrated ramp/door is preferably hinged at the bottom to allow it to function as both a ramp and a door.

In some embodiments, the ramp/door may be electrically driven by motors connected to System <b>100</b> for raising and lowering the ramp/door or to lock/unlock the ramp door.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the ramp/door may include a camera for detecting obstacles near or on the ramp/door. Accordingly, if System <b>100</b> detects any potential obstruction near the ramp/door via its camera, it may prohibit lowering or raising the ramp door until the obstacle is removed.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is shown a system <b>400</b> for implementing Battery Chargers <b>118</b>. System <b>400</b> may utilize DC power from Storage Batteries <b>102</b> to directly charge Batteries <b>402</b>. Each Battery <b>402</b> may include a Unique Identifier <b>404</b>, such as an RFID tag, a barcode, an NFC chip, a Q-code label, and so on. Based on Unique Identifier <b>404</b>, System <b>100</b> may record for each Battery <b>402</b> a history of its charging status. For example, System <b>100</b> may record each time that a Battery <b>402</b> was connected to System <b>400</b> for charging, the length of time required to charge the battery, the battery's state of charge over time as charging commenced, any period in which the battery was held at a threshold below full charge, the time of day at which the battery should be fully charged and if it succeeded or failed to do so, a current estimate of remaining battery life, and so on.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, system <b>100</b> may further include cameras <b>406</b> or scanners <b>408</b> for detecting tools or equipment that may include a Unique Identifier <b>404</b>. For example, a user may identify a tool via cameras <b>406</b> or scanners <b>408</b> and then be presented with several options, including recording the need for service or replacement, ordering spare parts or consumables, associating the tool with one or more Batteries <b>402</b>, reassigning the tool to a different location or vehicle, and so on. In addition, <b>406</b> or scanners <b>408</b> may also be used for measuring the contents of bins, containers, or other storage vessels. For example, system <b>100</b> may record the amount of chemicals, fertilizers, mulch, or materials being stored. In addition, system <b>100</b> may automatically record the amount of materials used at a location, make a notation for the need of replenishment or replacement, and so on.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, system <b>100</b> may further interoperate with a cloud-based server system <b>500</b>. In respect to the cloud-based server system <b>500</b>, each vehicle or platform implementing the systems or methods described herein may interact with system <b>500</b>. For example, electric vehicles <b>502</b> may be monitored or managed via System <b>100</b> locally, which then communicates via Network <b>506</b> to System <b>500</b> residing on Servers <b>504</b> or <b>512</b>. In addition, System <b>500</b> may communicate with apps on a Tablet or Phone <b>508</b> or other vehicles/platforms, such as electric vehicle <b>510</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, system <b>500</b> may receive information regarding the performance of vehicle or platform in terms of solar charging, such as the current charging rate or the average charge rate obtained at a location for a period of time. If system <b>500</b> determines that the solar charging is insufficient to for a vehicle or platform, it may send a notification to a user indicating the need for corrective action. In further embodiments, system <b>500</b> may take into consideration past charging history at or nearby a location, weather, or other variables to determine an optimal location for the vehicle to relocate to for better solar charging. In some instances, where system <b>500</b> may determine that a location for sufficient charging is not available, system <b>500</b> may send a request to a user to deliver supplemental power to a location (e.g., a trailer with additional battery storage to connect with system <b>100</b>). As another alternative, system <b>500</b> may send instructions for the nearest charging location that the user can access power from a charging station.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, system <b>100</b> may have a wireless component in communication with tools, equipment, or batteries. If such tools, equipment, or batteries are unable to communicate with system <b>100</b>, such devices may then be instructed to cease operation until as such time as communication is re-established. In some instances, a timer may be used to allow for a period of operation before such communication must be re-established to prevent the termination of operation.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, system <b>100</b> may have a drone that has a camera for recording work activity, which is then forwarded to system <b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, system <b>500</b> may receive information from a user that charging of vehicle or platform using system <b>100</b> is occurring via a customer's electrical connection. In such an instance, system <b>500</b> may record the amount of kilowatt-hours consumed during such an occasion. Further, system <b>500</b> may receive information regarding the current cost of electricity at that location and determine an appropriate credit to be applied to that customer's account.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, system <b>500</b> may determine based on the charging history of Batteries <b>402</b> a metric demonstrating cost savings, fuel elimination, or carbon emissions reduction was achieved by using electric tools or equipment. For example, in terms of joules one gallon of gas is equivalent to 33.41 kwh. Thus, for every 33.41 kwh of energy usage at a location, system <b>500</b> may report that one gallon of gas was conserved. Such calculations can further be improved by further refinements taking into account the services performed, the tools or equipment used, the typical fuel efficiency of gasoline tools relative to electric tools, and so on. Accordingly, system <b>500</b> may be able to demonstrate to a customer the benefits of an electric service over an equivalent gas-powered service.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition, system <b>500</b> may also use such information regarding solar charging history at a location, its distance relative to other locations, or the typical amount of energy consumed at such a location to determine the dispatch or routes of vehicles or platforms. In addition, system <b>500</b> may determine instances where a route or location is better served by a gas-powered service instead of an electrical-powered service, such as where there are insufficient charging opportunities to adequately support the electrical-powered service.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">System <b>500</b> may also be used to coordinate advertising on electronic displays on vehicles or platforms. For example, System <b>500</b> may receive information for advertising to be displayed on electronic displays mounted on vehicles or platforms in motion versus when parked. System <b>500</b> may then communication said advertising information to System <b>100</b> associated with that vehicle or platform. System <b>100</b> may then update the displays based on GPS information it receives from components within the platform or vehicle or from other sources, such as System <b>500</b>, via a cellular connection.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, System <b>500</b> may receive via a vehicle or platform information from wearable devices, such as Apple Watch. In such instances, System <b>500</b> may receive information from such a device such as heartbeat activity over time. Based on such activity, System <b>500</b> may determine an estimate of caloric consumption and schedule activity breaks for the user of the wearable device. In addition, system <b>500</b> may also utilize other information from wearable devices, such as hydration sensor information, to instruct users to take a specific action (e.g., drinking water).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, System <b>500</b> may use adverse weather information to adjust routes or send warnings to users of system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a method <b>600</b> for tracking batteries is shown. At step <b>602</b>, a battery may be inserted into the battery charger. At step <b>604</b>, a unique identifier for the battery may be directed. At step <b>606</b>, information regarding the batteries characteristics, such as state of charge, charging rate, voltage, temperature, number of cycles, or other aspects may be recorded. At step <b>608</b>, the battery may be charged to a specified state of charge. For example, the battery may be hold at a lower threshold (e.g., 70&#x2dc;80%) when not expected to be in use. The battery may then be further charged to full capacity based on a specified time, an estimated time of arrival at a location, or based on the number of batteries that are at full charge (e.g., a requirement that five fully charged tool or equipment batteries be available in a vehicle). At step <b>610</b>, an instruction may be sent requesting or initiating replacement of a battery. For example, if it is determined that a battery has exceeded a certain number of cycles, has difficulty achieving a full state of charge, or other impairments, a replacement battery may be ordered.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The previous description of the disclosed embodiments is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the invention disclosed herein.
