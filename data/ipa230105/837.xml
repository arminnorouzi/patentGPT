Patients suffering from sickle cell disease possess either two alleles of the &#x3b2;-globin gene with the mutation resulting in HbS (single substitution A to T in the codon for amino acid 6 of &#x3b2;-globin), one allele of the &#x3b2;-globin gene with the mutation resulting in HbS and the other allele with a mutation resulting in another hemoglobin variant (such as HbC, HbD, HbE or HbO), or one allele of the &#x3b2;-globin gene with the mutation resulting in HbS and the other allele with a mutation resulting in the partial or total loss of &#x3b2;-globin (Hb&#x3b2;<sup>+</sup> or Hb&#x3b2;<sup>0</sup>, respectively).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Depending on their genotype, sickle cell disease patients exhibit symptoms of varying severity, with the most affected patients being patients HbSHbS (also referred as HbSS or SS in short) or HbSHb&#x3b2;<sup>0 </sup>(also referred to as HbS&#x3b2;<sup>0 </sup>or S&#x3b2;<sup>0 </sup>in short). In patients with</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">HbSHbS, sickle cell disease is also referred to as sickle cell anemia or hemoglobin SS disease. In patients with HbSHb&#x3b2; (i.e., either Hb&#x3b2;<sup>+</sup> or Hb&#x3b2;<sup>0</sup>), sickle cell disease is also referred to as HbSHb&#x3b2; thalassemia, sickle beta thalassemia, or hemoglobin S&#x3b2; disease.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The HbS hemoglobin variant forms polymers under conditions of low oxygen tension, which result in the presence of stiff rods within the red blood cells. The red blood cells are thus deformed and acquire a crescent, or sickle, shape. Sickle-shaped red blood cells are more rigid and sticky, compared to normal red blood cells, and this may cause a blockage that slows, or stops the flow of blood, and thus obstructs the microcirculation in a vaso-occlusive episode, also referred to as vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) or acute painful crisis. Vaso-occlusive crises result in oxygen deprivation in the affected tissues and organs which may cause pain, stroke, leg ulcers, spontaneous abortion and renal insufficiency.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other symptoms or complications of sickle cell disease include chronic anemia, acute chest syndrome, splenic and/or renal dysfunction, aplastic crisis, splenic sequestration crisis, hyperhemolytic crisis, hepatic crisis, dactylitis and susceptibility to bacterial infections. Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is characterized by chest pain, fever, respiratory symptoms, and/or pulmonary infiltrates. ACS is caused by an initial insult or inciting event, such as, for example, a pulmonary infection, bone marrow or fat embolism, and/or pulmonary infarction, which causes a fall in alveolar oxygenation tension, which in sickle cell disease patients causes HbS polymerization. This, in turn, leads to decreased pulmonary blood flow resulting in further vaso-occlusion and tissue hypoxia. In patients with sickle cell disease, ACS may develop during a vaso-occlusive crisis or as a single event unrelated to a vaso-occlusive crisis. Patients with sickle cell disease may also suffer from a sickle cell crisis (SCC) defined as the presence of at least one complication, including in particular, without being limited to, vaso-occlusive crisis, aplastic crisis, splenic sequestration crisis, hyperhemolytic crisis, hepatic crisis, dactylitis, and acute chest syndrome. During a sickle cell crisis, each of the complication may occur independently or concurrently.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Currently, the only cure for sickle cell disease are stem cell or bone marrow transplants. However, considering the associated risks, the difficulty to find good matches and the costs, such transplants are not frequently carried out. The management of sickle cell disease mainly aims at preventing and managing painful vaso-occlusive crises and includes preventive measures (such as, for example, high fluid intake, avoidance of extreme temperatures, avoidance of high altitudes, avoidance of very strenuous exercise), chronic blood transfusion and pain medications.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The only commonly available treatment for sickle cell disease, aiming in particular at preventing vaso-occlusive crises, consists in the administration of hydroxyurea. Hydroxyurea induces the production of hemoglobin F which in turn reduces hemoglobin S polymerization and subsequent sickling. More recently, new treatments have been or are developed, including the administration of L-glutamine to prevent oxidative stress, the administration of crizanlizumab to prevent adhesion of the sickle red cells to the vessel surface, and the administration of voxelotor (also known as GBT-440 or GBT440) to prevent HbS polymerization.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To date, only hydroxyurea has been granted approval by both the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) and the EMA (European Medicine Agency) for use in the treatment of sickle cell disease. However, hydroxyurea is not suitable for all SCD patients, and not all SCD patients treated with hydroxyurea will respond to the treatment. L-glutamine has been granted approval by the FDA but not by the EMA, which currently considers that it has not been shown that L-glutamine is effective at reducing the number of sickle cell crises or hospital visits. Crizanlizumab has recently been granted approval by the FDA, and a positive opinion has been issued by the EMA in July 2020, recommending a conditional marketing authorization.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, there is still a need for effective treatments for sickle cell disease, and in particular for treatments effective in preventing and/or treating acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease patients.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As illustrated hereinafter, in a mouse model of sickle cell disease, the Applicant showed that a 2-aminoarylthiazole derivative such as masitinib is able to prevent vaso-occlusive crises and acute chest syndrome.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention thus relates to a 2-aminoarylthiazole derivative, in particular a 2-aminoarylthiazole derivative of formula (II) as defined hereinafter, preferably masitinib, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, for use in the treatment of sickle cell disease in a patient in need thereof.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention thus relates to a 2-aminoarylthiazole derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, for use in the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) in a patient in need thereof.
