Such wounds often happen in patients with diabetes or circulatory impairment. The circulatory impairment can manifest as lymphedema, venous insufficiency, or elevated pressure which can compromise localized microvasculature, as examples. Lymphedema and venous insufficiency are a result of fluid not being returned to the heart properly. Localized elevated pressure, which results in pressure ulcers, can result from flow being stopped through the microvasculature, where nutrients are exchanged between the blood and tissue.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Venous ulcers often accompany varicose veins and most often affect the distal leg and ankle. They are usually painful, large in size, and exudative. Venous ulcers may become recurrent at times and can have varying depths. They occur from blood pooling in the ankle which creates a chronic tension on the delicate skin of the ankle. Such wounds typically occur on the sides of the ankle. Recommended ways for preventing venous ulcers include elevating the extremity and also applying graduated compressive stockings. Elevating the extremity requires applying a force to the underside of the heel. Unfortunately this can create areas of localized pressure on the heel. To prevent this, heel pillows have been developed. Compressive stockings can also create a risk of creating a pressure ulcer over any of the bony prominences of the foot should the localized pressure created exceed the capillary pressure and thus create localized regions of ischemia.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Pressure ulcers can occur anywhere following prolonged periods of sustained pressure. Such pressure ulcers can become life/limb threatening. In elderly patients, the skin on the distal extremity can be extremely fragile and thin. Further, the foot and ankle has several bony prominences which may create areas of increased pressures when the foot is wrapped or when the patient lies in bed for a prolonged period of time. When a patient is confined to bed rest after a medical procedure, tissue necrosis may occur due to various externally applied forces to the lower extremities of the patient. For example, simple pressure from the patient's foot resting on a mattress can lead to tissue necrosis in the bony areas of the foot. In order to prevent pressure ulcers, heel pillows (noted above) and gel filled bandages have been developed. Heel pillows distribute forces thereby effectively reducing localized pressure but are associated with certain disadvantages. For example, heel pillows are not intended for use during the act of walking and only protect the heel region. Because of the difficulty of walking with a heel pillow, patient compliance with heel pillows is typically very poor. The gel in bandages offloads force from bony prominences and also helps to reduce shear stress and friction on the skin that often lead to wound formation. Hospitals also develop protocols for periodically turning patients to prevent prolonged localized regions of pressure and ultimately pressure ulcers that may result.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Wounds of the local extremities can often be multifactorial with both arterial and venous contributing factors. The inventor recognized that compression may be needed but is ill-advised if there is some arterial compromise or tissue fragility. Accordingly, the invention described herein provides an apparatus that may be used to distribute forces over these areas to effectively reduce regions of high pressure and prevent pressure ulcers. For example, the disclosed garment is configured to be worn on a distal extremity to encourage the distribution of forces and reduction of pressure over the bony prominences of the body.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">More specifically, as mentioned above, if local applied pressure exceeds the capillary pressure of a patient due to confined bed rest or compressive bandages, for example, localized ischemia may result and tissue necrosis may follow. To address this, a contact point reduction garment is provided herein to address tissue necrosis in the extremities. In one example, the contact point reduction garment is a wearable garment that may include one or more relief zones positioned over the bony areas of the foot to help to move some of the pressure of the bandage away from the bony area and transfer it to the softer tissue areas of the foot. Thus, the invention may take the form of a compression sock or hose that has padding built into these relief zones, thereby reducing the occurrence of tissue necrosis in bedridden or ambulatory individuals. In another example, the wearable garment described herein may be used in the region of the knee and may prevent excess pressure around the hamstring tendon or gracilis muscle, for example. In yet another example, the wearable garment described herein may be used in the region of the elbow and may prevent excess pressure around the elbow.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, in one aspect, the present disclosure provides a wearable garment comprising (a) a sheath having a first end and a second, wherein the sheath defines a cavity in a wearable position, wherein the sheath has a first opening at the first end, and wherein the sheath comprises a first material, and (b) one or more relief zones coupled to the sheath, wherein the relief zones comprise a second material, wherein a pressure distribution of the second material is greater than a pressure distribution of the first material.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">These as well as other aspects, advantages, and alternatives, will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reading the following detailed description, with reference where appropriate to the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a medial perspective view of a wearable garment, according to an example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a lateral perspective view of the wearable garment, according to the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> a posterior view of the wearable garment, according to the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an anterior view of the wearable garment, according to the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a medial side view of a wearable garment, according to an example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a lateral side view of the wearable garment, according to the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a lateral side view and bottom view of a wearable garment, according to an example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a lateral side view of the wearable garment, according to the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a lateral side view and medial side view of the wearable garment, according to the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a bottom view of the wearable garment, according to the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a medial perspective view of a wearable garment, according to an example embodiment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a top view of the wearable garment, according to the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Exemplary devices and methods are described herein.

The second material may be encapsulated by an encapsulating material that is deformable, biocompatible and capable of compatibility with the gel, liquid, plasma, and/or gas. In such an example, a volume of the second material may be variable via injection or extraction of a gel, a liquid, a plasma or a gas into or out of the encapsulating material. Further, the encapsulating material may be self-sealing such that the encapsulating material may be externally accessed by an instrument (e.g., punctured by a needle) and then remain sealed upon removal of the instrument (e.g., needle). In addition, the wearable garment <b>100</b> may further include a one-way valve or a two-way valve coupled to the one or more relief zones <b>114</b> to permit an instrument to access the second material and thereby adjust a volume of the second material via injection or extraction. Other example arrangements are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In various embodiments, the first and second materials, respectively, may comprise a breathable matrix and a polyurethane foam, a breathable matrix and an encapsulated gel, a breathable matrix and an encapsulated liquid, a breathable matrix and a polymer, a breathable matrix and an encapsulated plasma, a breathable matrix and an encapsulated gas, a cotton material and a polyurethane foam, a cotton material and an encapsulated gel, a cotton material and an encapsulated liquid, a cotton material and a polymer, a cotton material and an encapsulated plasma, a cotton material and an encapsulated gas, Polytetrafluoroethylene (&#x201c;PTFE&#x201d;)vand a polyurethane foam, PTFE and an encapsulated gel, PTFE and an encapsulated liquid, PTFE and a polymer, PTFE and an encapsulated plasma, PTFE and an encapsulated gas, polyester and a polyurethane foam, polyester and an encapsulated gel, polyester and an encapsulated liquid, polyester and a polymer, polyester and an encapsulated plasma, polyester and an encapsulated gas, an elastic material and a polyurethane foam, an elastic material and an encapsulated gel, an elastic material and an encapsulated liquid, an elastic material and a polymer, an elastic material and an encapsulated plasma, or an elastic material and an encapsulated gas, among other possibilities.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As discussed above, the first material of the sheath <b>102</b> is different from the second material of the one or more relief zones <b>114</b> such that a pressure distribution of the second material is greater than a pressure distribution of the first material. The respective pressure distributions of the first and second materials may be controlled by the material properties, respective thicknesses of those materials or volume (in the case of an encapsulated second material) and/or thread count. The pressure distribution properties of a given material may be defined by a maximum localized pressure value experienced in response to a force applied to the given material. A peak localized pressure of the first material in response to an externally applied force is greater than a peak localized pressure of the second material in response to the externally applied force. Thus, the second material may distribute the applied force on the tissue of the user so as to reduce the peak localized pressure in response to the externally applied force to be less than a mean capillary perfusion pressure. In addition, the first material's peak localized pressure helps to maintain the wearable garment <b>100</b> in place on the respective body part on which the wearable garment <b>100</b> was disposed.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one example, the wearable garment <b>100</b> further includes at least one second opening <b>116</b> in the second end <b>106</b> of the sheath <b>102</b>. The at least one second opening <b>116</b> may include five openings each configured to receive a toe of a user. In another example, the at least one second opening <b>116</b> may be a single opening. In one example, the single opening may be configured to receive five toes of a user or to accommodate an appendage disposed through the cavity of the sheath, such as an arm or a leg. In yet another example, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b>, and <b>11</b></figref>, the at least one second opening <b>116</b> is a single opening arranged adjacent to a medial side of the wearable garment <b>100</b> and configured to receive a hallux toe of a user. In yet another embodiment, the second end <b>106</b> of the sheath <b>102</b> is closed such that the sheath <b>102</b> is configured to cover the toes of a user, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The one or more relief zones <b>114</b> may take a variety of forms.

Though the edges of the second material may overlap with the first material for coupling. The second material is at a size and thickness necessary to adequately distribute the applied external force on the tissue of the user so as to reduce the localized pressure to be less than the mean capillary perfusion pressure, thereby reducing the risk of tissue necrosis. Further, the interior surface <b>136</b> of the sheath <b>102</b> may include an adhesive material to prevent the wearable garment <b>100</b> from slipping down the anterior shin of the user, for example. Such an adhesive material may include silicone, or any material with a moderate bio-adhesive nature, particularly a material that does not need to be wet to exhibit the bio-adhesive properties.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In another example, the first end <b>104</b> of the sheath <b>102</b> is configured to lie above a knee joint of a user, and the second end <b>106</b> of the sheath <b>102</b> is configured to lie below the knee joint of the user. In such an example, the one or more relief zones <b>114</b> comprise at least one of an anterior side, a posterior side, a medial side or a lateral side of a thigh region, a posterior side, a medial side or a lateral side of a calf region, a shin region, a knee cap region or a popliteal fossa region. In yet another example, the first end <b>104</b> of the sheath <b>102</b> is configured to lie above an elbow joint of a user, and the second end <b>106</b> of the sheath <b>102</b> is configured to lie below the elbow joint of the user.

In another example, the second material may be layered between additional materials in the one or more relief zones <b>114</b>. For example, the one or more relief zones <b>114</b> may be arranged such that the second material is disposed between two layers of the first material. In another example, the one or more relief zones <b>114</b> may include a layer of the first material having an inner surface coupled to a layer of the second material, where an inner surface of the second material is coupled to a layer of a bio-adhesive material arranged to interface with a user's appendage. In yet another example, the one or more relief zones <b>114</b> may include a layer of the first material having an inner surface coupled to a layer of the second material arranged to interface with the user's appendage. Other examples are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one example, the one or more relief zones <b>114</b> may be removably coupled to the interior surface <b>136</b> of the first material. In another example, the one or more relief zones <b>114</b> may be removably coupled to an exterior surface <b>138</b> of the first material. In such examples, the one or more relief zones <b>114</b> may include a plurality of hooks configured to removably couple with a plurality of loops on the first material. In another example, the one or more relief zones <b>114</b> may be removably coupled to the first material using one or more magnets, zippers, mechanical fasteners, buttons, an inferior glue, or any other nonpermanent reusable mechanical connection. Such embodiments may enable a medical professional to move the one or more relief zones <b>114</b> based on the particular patient. Further, such one or more relief zones <b>114</b> may be customizable such that the one or more relief zones <b>114</b> comprising the second material may be cut to allow for user specific customization. Such an embodiment may enable a medical professional to specifically tailor the size, shape, and/or thickness of the one or more relief zones <b>114</b> based on the particular patient.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, the sheath <b>102</b> may include a foot region <b>140</b>, a heel region <b>142</b>, and a shin region <b>144</b>.
