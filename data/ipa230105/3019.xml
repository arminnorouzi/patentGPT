Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Over time, camping trailers can develop roof leaks. The main reason they do is because their roof is flat so water can settle in and find its way through cracks in the joints between metal sheets making up the outer skin of the trailer. Some owners of trailers who stay in one place for the season take the time to install a makeshift sloping roof. Others build more elaborate structures that make the trailer look as if it is inside a hanger. Some of those structures are not so pretty and some campgrounds simply won't allow them to be built because they don't make the campground look good.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is a main object of the present disclosure to provide for a disassemblable roof framing structure for use on camping trailers and motor-homes, and the likes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to do so, there is provided a disassemblable roof framing structure for use on camping habitations comprising structural attachment brackets for connecting a transverse beam with an existing frame on the habitation.

Various modifications, however, will remain readily apparent to those skilled in the art, since the general principles of the present invention have been defined herein.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, there is provided a disassemblable roof framing structure (<b>10</b>) for use on most types of camper habitations (<b>12</b>) such as trailers, fifth wheels and motor homes, for example. The structure (<b>10</b>) is comprised of structural attachment brackets (<b>14</b>) for connecting a transverse beam (<b>16</b>) with an existing frame (<b>18</b>) on the habitation (<b>12</b>). At each end of the transverse beam (<b>16</b>) is an extension member (<b>20</b>), one for each end of the transverse beam (<b>16</b>). The extension members (<b>20</b>) adjust to the width of the habitation (<b>12</b>) by extending out of the transverse beam (<b>16</b>). The attachment brackets (<b>14</b>) adjust to the width of the existing frame (<b>18</b>) by sliding along the length of the transverse beam (<b>16</b>) and then being tightened thereto. The extension members (<b>18</b>), have attachment brackets (<b>19</b>) at their distal ends from which perpendicularly extend vertical studs (<b>22</b>) that run upwardly along the side walls of the habitation and up towards the roof. Each stud (<b>22</b>) is capped by an interface bracket (<b>24</b>). As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which shows a non limiting example, each of the two sets of interface bracket pairs (<b>24</b>) takes on one top beam (<b>26</b>) for a total of two top beams (<b>26</b>), one for each longitudinal side of the habitation (<b>12</b>). On each top beam (<b>26</b>) are attached triangular rafter frames (<b>28</b>), and rafter connector brackets (<b>38</b>). Once this is done, a simple tarpaulin (not shown) can be fitted over the structure (<b>10</b>).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0027">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, the attachment brackets (<b>14</b>) are comprised of a bottom cover (<b>30</b>), a top cover (<b>32</b>) and an existing frame connecting plate (<b>34</b>) which is mechanically fastened to the frame (<b>18</b>). The bottom and top covers (<b>30</b>, <b>32</b>) sandwich the transverse beam (<b>16</b>) by being mechanically fastened to each other by way of lag bolts (<b>36</b>). Regular mechanical fasteners (<b>40</b>) take care of the rest of the mechanical fastening as known in the art.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0028">The frame connecting plate (<b>34</b>) is itself further comprised of a pair of oppositely placed connector members (<b>35</b>) that hold by compression a connection bracket (<b>37</b>). Illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a 1 sided bracket but a &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped bracket (not shown) clasping both sides of the existing frame (<b>18</b>) could be used and other shaped brackets could be used without departing from the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0029">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the rafter frames (<b>28</b>) consist in generally scalene triangular shapes so as to give a nice slope on two sides of the roof wherein one side is longer than the other.
