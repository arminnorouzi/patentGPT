During use, a valve in the main machine is opened with the pedal switch to transport a gas such as carbon dioxide from the large gas cylinder to the main machine and then to an inner portion of the flexible cryoprobe, and finally, refrigeration is performed at a needle to cause adhesion with a tissue.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, a cryoadhesion surgery is usually performed with the assistance of an endoscope (soft), and a doctor holds the endoscope in the left hand and operates a cryoadhesion device with the right hand. The flexible cryoprobe is connected to the main machine, which is connected to the pedal switch and the gas cylinder, and therefore many cables or pipelines need to be added in an operating room. Once a cable or a pipeline causes snagging or is snapped accidentally, potential safety hazards may be caused for a patient and a doctor. In addition, the doctor is required to use both hands and feet, which results in complexity and inconvenience of the surgery. For example, during endoscope operating, a doctor usually needs to move or change a body position, which is apt to lead to an unclear position of the pedal switch. Therefore, the doctor often bows the head to look for the position of the pedal switch.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a cryoadhesion apparatus, to solve the problems of potential safety hazards and difficult operations.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect of the present invention, a cryoadhesion apparatus is provided, including a remote control assembly, a valve assembly, a needle catheter assembly, and a gas cylinder, where the remote control assembly includes a sheath structure and a remote control mounted in the sheath structure, the sheath structure is provided with a catheter channel for the needle catheter assembly to pass through, and two ends of the valve assembly are respectively connected to the needle catheter assembly and the gas cylinder;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">the sheath structure is capable of squeezing the needle catheter assembly, where when squeezing is maintained, the needle catheter assembly is capable of moving along with the sheath structure under a frictional force between an inner wall of the catheter channel and the needle catheter assembly;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">the remote control is configured to, when triggered, send a trigger signal to the valve assembly;

Apparently, the embodiments described are merely some embodiments, other than all embodiments, of the present invention.

The following specific embodiments may be combined with each other, and the same or similar concepts or processes may not be repeated in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a configuration of a cryoadhesion apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is schematic structural diagram <b>1</b> of a cryoadhesion apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is schematic structural diagram <b>2</b> of a cryoadhesion apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0132">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the cryoadhesion apparatus includes: a remote control assembly <b>2</b>, a valve assembly <b>1</b>, a needle catheter assembly <b>3</b>, and a gas cylinder <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0133">The remote control assembly <b>2</b> includes a sheath structure <b>21</b> and a remote control <b>22</b> mounted in the sheath structure <b>21</b>, the sheath structure <b>21</b> is provided with a catheter channel for the needle catheter assembly to pass through, and two ends of the valve assembly <b>1</b> are respectively connected to the needle catheter assembly <b>3</b> and the gas bottle <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0134">The sheath structure <b>21</b> is capable of squeezing the needle catheter assembly <b>3</b> (for example, the sheath structure <b>21</b> may be controlled to perform squeezing when an operator performs manipulation or the squeezing occurs when the sheath structure <b>21</b> is not manipulated). When the squeezing is maintained, the needle catheter assembly <b>3</b> is capable of moving along with the sheath structure <b>21</b> under a frictional force between an inner wall of the catheter channel and the needle catheter assembly <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0135">It can be seen that the squeezing can be understood as squeezing in which the frictional force generated by the squeezing can cause the two to move together, and a generating principle and mode of the squeezing can be arbitrary. For example, the squeezing may be generated due to deformation in at least part of the sheath structure <b>21</b>, or may be generated due to a movement of at least part of the sheath structure <b>21</b>. In any case, the solution does not depart from the description of this embodiment.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0136">The remote control <b>22</b> is configured to, when triggered, send a trigger signal to the valve assembly <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0137">The valve assembly <b>1</b> is configured to transport, when receiving the trigger signal, a gas from the gas cylinder to the needle catheter assembly <b>3</b>, to enable the needle catheter assembly <b>3</b> to perform freezing.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0138">The performing of freezing can be understood as generating a refrigeration capacity by throttling through a Joule-Thomson effect in a case in which a gas is transported to perform cryoadhesion of tissues outside an outer portion of the needle in the needle catheter assembly <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0139">The trigger signal may be a signal of any form and content and does not depart from the description of this embodiment, so long as the valve assembly <b>1</b> can recognize and perform transporting of a gas in response to the signal to achieve freezing. The trigger signal may be transmitted wirelessly, for example, transmitted in a wireless manner, but a wired transmission solution is not completely excluded. Either way, the use of both hands and feet for joint operation can be avoided, and it is convenient to implement the control of freezing and the push-in and pull-out of a catheter with one hand.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0140">It can be seen that, in the solutions mentioned in this embodiment, the needle catheter assembly passes through the catheter channel of the remote control assembly, and further the control of freezing and the push-in/pull-out of the catheter can both be achieved based on the remote control assembly, thereby making it convenient for an operator to achieve the control of freezing and the push-in/pull-out of the catheter with one hand. Therefore, the operation of a transluminal cryoadhesion surgery is simplified, and the convenience and safety of the surgery are improved. In addition, in a case in which no parts such as a pedal switch are configured while an electromagnetic valve is used, space can be effectively saved.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0141"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a valve assembly according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an electromagnetic valve according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a pin according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0142">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the valve assembly <b>1</b> includes an electromagnetic valve <b>11</b> and a receiving circuit board <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0143">The electromagnetic valve <b>11</b> includes a pin <b>111</b>, a pin tube <b>113</b>, a pin reset part <b>114</b>, a seat <b>112</b>, and a pin driving structure. An intake channel <b>1111</b> is provided inside the pin <b>111</b>, the pin <b>111</b> passes through the pin tube <b>113</b>, an end of the pin tube <b>113</b> is configured to be connected to the needle catheter assembly <b>3</b>, another end of the pin tube <b>113</b> is connected to a side of the seat <b>112</b>, and another side of the seat <b>112</b> is connected to the gas bottle <b>5</b>. An end of the pin <b>111</b> is connected to the needle catheter assembly <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0144">The pin driving structure is configured to, when the receiving circuit board <b>12</b> receives the trigger signal, drive the pin <b>111</b> to be in an intake position.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0145">The driving herein may specifically indicate: in a case in which the trigger signal is received, if the pin <b>111</b> is located at the intake position, the pin driving structure may drive the pin <b>111</b> to be kept in the intake position, or if the pin <b>111</b> is not located at the intake position, the pin driving structure may drive the pin <b>111</b> to move to the intake position. In addition, the pin driving structure may perform the foregoing driving under the control of the receiving circuit board <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0146">The intake position herein can be understood as: a position at which the pin <b>111</b> is capable of being inserted into the gas cylinder <b>5</b>, so that the gas from the gas cylinder <b>5</b> enters the intake channel <b>1111</b> and is transported through the intake channel to the needle catheter assembly.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0147">The pin reset part is configured to, when the pin driving structure does not drive the pin <b>111</b>, drive the pin <b>111</b> to reset from the intake position to a non-intake position, at which the pin is not inserted into the gas cylinder.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0148">Further, a sealing structure (for example, a rear sealing structure <b>512</b>) for sealing off a gas cylinder outlet may be disposed in the gas cylinder <b>5</b>, so that the sealing structure no longer seals off the gas cylinder outlet when the pin <b>111</b> enters the gas cylinder <b>5</b> and further the pin <b>111</b> can be inserted into the gas cylinder <b>5</b> to obtain the gas from the gas cylinder and to transmit the gas, and that the seal structure may alternatively again seal off the gas cylinder outlet under the driving of a corresponding reset part when the pin <b>111</b> is reset.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0149">The above-mentioned non-intake position can be understood as any position at which the pin <b>111</b> is not inserted into the gas cylinder, or the pin <b>111</b> does not forces open a sealing.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0150">The electromagnetic valve <b>11</b> and/or the receiving circuit board <b>12</b> may be powered by a battery pack <b>4</b>. The battery pack <b>4</b> may be a rechargeable battery pack, which may then be detached and charged separately, or the battery pack <b>4</b> may be a non-rechargeable battery pack.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0151">In an implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a movement of the pin <b>111</b> is a linear movement, and the pin <b>111</b> may move in an axial direction of the pin tube <b>113</b>. In other optional implementations, a movement of the pin <b>111</b> may alternatively be an arc movement, a curved movement, or the like.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0152">The electromagnetic valve <b>11</b> is used in the implementation shown in the figure, and therefore the pin driving structure may include an electromagnetic coil <b>116</b> which can generate a required electromagnetic force when energized, and further, the pin <b>111</b> may move under the driving of the electromagnetic force (for example a movement from the left to the right as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The electromagnetic coil <b>116</b> may be mounted in a corresponding electromagnetic valve housing <b>117</b>, a position of which may be secured relative to the seat <b>112</b> and the pin tube <b>113</b>. For example, the electromagnetic valve housing <b>117</b> may be secured to the seat <b>112</b> by screwing a fixing nut <b>118</b> to a threaded portion of an outer side at a front end of the pin tube <b>113</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0153">In other optional implementations, valve devices employing other principles other than the electromagnetic valve <b>11</b> are not excluded.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0154">The pin reset part can be understood as any part capable of being deformed (for example, curved, pulled up, compressed, or bent) by an external force and capable of generating a reset force when the external force is removed. In an example, the pin reset part can adopt a spring. When the pin enters an intake position, the spring may be expanded or compressed, and then when a force (such as an electromagnetic force) that drives the pin in the intake position disappears, the pin reset part may drive the pin out of the intake position and into the non-intake position.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0155">In an implementation, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the pin <b>111</b> includes a first pin section <b>1115</b>, a second pin section <b>1116</b>, a third pin section <b>1117</b>, and a fourth pin section <b>1118</b> that are sequentially connected, which may be the four sections of different diameters in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0156">The first pin section <b>1115</b> is inserted into an intake chamber <b>372</b> of the needle catheter assembly <b>3</b>, and in addition, a dynamic sealing may be achieved between the first pin section <b>1115</b> and the intake chamber <b>372</b>. In an example, an outer side of the first pin section <b>1115</b> may be provided with a sealing ring <b>119</b>. The sealing ring <b>119</b> may be disposed in an annular sealing ring groove <b>1114</b> on an outer side of the first pin section <b>1115</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0157">Optionally, the fourth pin section <b>1118</b> is configured to be inserted into the gas cylinder <b>5</b>, where a side wall of the fourth pin section <b>1118</b> is provided with an intake vent <b>1112</b>, and when the pin <b>111</b> is inserted into the gas cylinder <b>5</b>, gas is capable of entering the intake channel <b>1111</b> from the intake vent <b>1112</b>. The number, dimension, and arrangement of the intake vent <b>1112</b> may be arbitrary without being limited to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0158">An outer diameter of the third pin section <b>1117</b> matches an inner diameter of the pin tube <b>113</b>, and further the pin <b>111</b> moves along an inner wall of the pin tube <b>113</b> through the third pin section <b>1117</b>, thereby achieving a guiding function.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0159">An outer diameter of the second pin section <b>1116</b> is less than the outer diameter of the third pin section <b>1117</b>, and the pin reset part <b>114</b> is disposed on an outer side of the second pin section <b>1116</b>. It can be seen that by using the second pin section <b>1116</b>, space can be provided for a movement of the pin reset part <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0160">A dimensional relationship of the pin sections (such as lengths and the outer diameters) may be shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, or may be other dimensional relationships and shapes, as long as the above requirements can be met, all of which do not depart from the description of this embodiment.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0161">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in one of the implementations, an inner side of the pin tube <b>113</b> is fixedly provided with a pin limit portion <b>1131</b>, and the pin reset part <b>114</b> is connected to the pin limit portion <b>1131</b>. For example, when the pin reset part <b>114</b> is a spring, an end of the spring may be connected to the pin limit portion <b>1131</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0162">The pin limit portion <b>1131</b> is capable of blocking an end of the third pin section <b>1117</b> that is far away from the gas bottle <b>5</b>, and the pin reset part <b>1131</b> is located at the outer side of the second pin section to limit a motion position of the pin when reset.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0163">Specifically, by way of example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, under an action of an electromagnetic force, the pin <b>111</b> moves to the right in the figure and enters the intake position, in which case, the spring may be compressed. After the electromagnetic force disappears, the spring may generate a leftward force acting on the pin to enable the pin to move leftward. When the pin moves to a limit position, a front end of the third pin section <b>1117</b> may press against the pin limit portion <b>1131</b> so that the pin limit portion <b>1131</b> is limited.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0164">In a specific implementation process, the pin limit portion <b>1131</b> includes at least two fan-shaped limit portions, which are arranged at an interval along a circumferential direction of the pinto form a pressure relief gap between two adjacent fan-shaped limit portions.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0165">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in a specific implementation process, the third pin section <b>1117</b> is provided with a pressure relief groove <b>1113</b> running through two ends of the third pin section <b>1117</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0166">When the pin <b>111</b> is not inserted into the gas cylinder <b>5</b>, that is, when the pin <b>111</b> is not in the intake position, the gas in the intake channel <b>1111</b> is capable of sequentially flowing through the intake vent <b>1112</b>, the pressure relief groove <b>1113</b>, and the pressure relief gap to be discharged to a compartment between the second pin section <b>1116</b> and an inner wall of the pin tube <b>113</b>, where the compartment may form part of a passage for rapid gas discharge.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0167">Through the foregoing electromagnetic valve, rapid opening and rapid intake pressure relief of the gas bottle can be implemented by using the pin. For example, when the remote control is pressed, freezing is achieved, and when released, gas discharge is implemented, to implement gas discharge and rewarming.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0168">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in one of the implementations, an outer side of the second pin section <b>1116</b> is provided with pin outer threads, which match and are connected to a limit nut <b>115</b>, and the pin reset part <b>114</b> is connected to the limit nut <b>115</b>.
