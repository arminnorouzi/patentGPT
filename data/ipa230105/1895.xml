Generally, the emergency braking control unit <b>103</b> is developed according to EN50128 and EN50129 SIL&#x2265;3, while the service braking control unit <b>108</b> is developed according to EN50128 and EN50129 SIL&#x2264;2.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0038">The continuous and ever-increasing attention to the safety of railway systems for passenger trains has recently led to re-discussing the SIL safety integrity levels of some additional functions associated with the braking systems, said functions being currently developed according to SIL&#x2264;2 safety integrity levels.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0039">A first function is known to those skilled in the art as the Holding Brake. This function consists in the automatic application of the braking force by the braking system when the speed of the train falls below a predetermined value, typically in the range between 1km/h and 3 km/h.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0040">This level of speed is reached when the railway vehicle is about to stop, for example at a platform for passengers to get on and off.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0041">The object of the holding brake function is to prevent the vehicle from moving in either of the two possible directions due to inclination of the rail, while passengers are getting on and off.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0042">In the normal mode of operation of the vehicle, the holding brake is maintained applied for at least the entire period wherein the doors of the railway vehicle remain open.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0043">The holding brake is automatically removed from the braking system only when an appropriate safety signal indicates that the doors of the railway vehicle have closed and when a signal from the traction system indicates that traction torque sufficient to move the vehicle in the direction of travel has been applied by the traction motors.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0044">This last measure is necessary to prevent the train from moving opposite to the direction of travel during the release of the holding brake in the event of an uphill slope. For this reason, in some cases, the holding brake function is also known as the anti-rollback function.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0045">Currently the holding brake function is managed automatically by the service braking control unit <b>108</b>, according to SIL&#x2264;2 safety levels.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0046">In order to be able to carry out the holding brake function as previously described, the service braking control unit <b>108</b> receives one or more speed signals <b>200</b>, coming for example but not exclusively from speed sensors, or from other modules generating a signal reference speed of the railway vehicle, not shown in the figure. By means of the rail vehicle speed information, the service brake control unit <b>108</b> determines the instant at which the holding brake function is to be activated. Further, the service braking control unit <b>108</b> receives one or more traction signals <b>201</b> generated by the traction systems. Such one or more traction signals <b>201</b> are indicative of the fact that the traction torque is or is not sufficient to prevent the defined rollback situation described above. Further, the service braking control unit <b>108</b> may receive one or more door status signals <b>202</b> from the vehicle door management system, indicating the open/closed status of the doors.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0047">By observing said one or more traction signals <b>201</b> and one or more door status signals <b>202</b>, the service braking control unit <b>108</b> determines the instant wherein the holding brake function is deactivated.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0048">The service braking control unit <b>108</b> performs the holding brake function by driving the electro-pneumatic service braking unit <b>107</b>, so as to obtain a holding braking pressure at the one or more outputs <b>111</b>, . . . , <b>114</b> of the electro-pneumatic service braking unit <b>107</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0049">This holding brake pressure is often determined by the service braking control unit <b>108</b>, as a function of the one or more weight signals <b>104</b> indicative of the weight to be braked by the braking system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0050">Functional and operational analyses of the holding brake function have shown how a possible malfunction of the service braking control unit <b>108</b>, typically an error caused by software, could for example release the holding brake while passengers are getting on/off the railway vehicle. Especially in cases wherein there is a space between the platform and the boarding/alighting plane of the train, a passenger could inadvertently place a foot into said space. If the railway vehicle were on a slope, given the preceding conditions, such a railway vehicle would have an undue movement which could cause serious physical injury to the passenger.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0051">It is known to those skilled in the art that some railway operators require engine drivers to systematically activate the holding brake at each stop, regardless of the presence of the automatic holding brake function, to manually ensure that the railway vehicle does not have undue movements during the passenger boarding/alighting stage.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0052">In other cases, the precaution of applying the emergency brake is entrusted only to the attention of the engine driver if the railway vehicle has undue movements while passengers are boarding/alighting due to the occurrence of a malfunction of the holding brake function.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0053">The foregoing considerations lead to the consideration that a development of the holding brake function according to SIL&#x2265;3 levels would be adequate to mitigate the potential risks of serious injury to passengers, avoiding the systematic intervention of the engine driver at each stop.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054">A second function is known as &#x201c;Distributor Emulation.&#x201d; This function emulates the functional behavior of a distributor valve through software functions. It is known that the distributor valve performs both the service braking function, which would require a development limited to an SIL&#x2264;2 safety level, and the emergency braking function, which requires development to an SIL&#x2265;3 safety level.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0055">Currently the &#x201c;Distributor Emulation&#x201d; function is performed exclusively according to an SIL&#x2264;2 safety level by the service braking control unit <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0056">In order to carry out the &#x201c;Distributor Emulation&#x201d; function, the service braking control unit <b>108</b> receives a pressure signal <b>202</b> indicative of the main brake pipe pressure. The pressure signal <b>202</b> is typically generated by a pressure transducer not shown in the figure and pneumatically connected to the main brake pipe.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0057">The patent WO2018189693 describes the distributor emulation function and claims a possible realization of the &#x201c;Distributor Emulation&#x201d; function according to an architecture developed completely at an SIL&#x2265;3 level.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0058">An additional high-safety braking function is envisaged by those skilled in the art: said function consists of a braking that may be modulated by the signaling system, such as ERTMS/ETCS, or by self-driving systems ATO (Automatic Train Operation) or further, by systems defined as Virtual Coupling of several trains.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0059">Currently the linearly modulated braking is represented by Service Braking, the current safety level of which is assumed to be SIL<b>2</b>, which is not sufficient for the requirements of the autonomous driving systems mentioned above. At the same time the emergency braking function, despite being classified SIL<b>4</b>, acts in a binary on/off manner, which is not adequate for the functional requirements of the autonomous driving systems mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0060">It is known to those skilled in the art that the aforementioned self-driving systems will need to control the braking system in a linear manner with safety levels higher than the safety level of the current service braking. This means raising the service braking to SIL<b>4</b> level, or making the emergency braking modulated.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0061">As previously described, the complete implementation of complex functions, such as for example but not exclusively the &#x201c;Holding Brake&#x201d; function or the &#x201c;Distributor Emulation&#x201d; function or the &#x201c;modulated braking by the signaling system&#x201d; function according to an SIL&#x2265;3 safety level, is a source of substantial development, certification and maintenance costs.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0058" num="0062">An object of the present invention is therefore to propose a braking system for at least one bogie or railway vehicle, which allows the safety integrity level of any additional braking functions of the braking system to be increased, for example, but not exclusively, from SIL&#x2264;2 levels to SIL&#x2265;3 levels, limiting the complexity and overall development, certification and maintenance cost of the system, by making use of the existing units of said braking system.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0063">The aforesaid and other objects and advantages are achieved, according to an aspect of the invention, by braking systems for a bogie or a railway vehicle, having the features defined in the respective independent claims.
