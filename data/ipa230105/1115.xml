treatment, prevention and amelioration of respiratory-related disorders. The present technology also relates to medical devices or apparatus, and their use. The present technology also relates to methods of detecting user interaction with respiratory therapy devices.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2.2 Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">2.2.1 Human Respiratory System and its Disorders</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The respiratory system of the body facilitates gas exchange. The nose and mouth form the entrance to the airways of a patient.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The airways include a series of branching tubes, which become narrower, shorter and more numerous as they penetrate deeper into the lung. The prime function of the lung is gas exchange, allowing oxygen to move from the inhaled air into the venous blood and carbon dioxide to move in the opposite direction. The trachea divides into right and left main bronchi, which further divide eventually into terminal bronchioles. The bronchi make up the conducting airways, and do not take part in gas exchange. Further divisions of the airways lead to the respiratory bronchioles, and eventually to the alveoli. The alveolated region of the lung is where the gas exchange takes place, and is referred to as the respiratory zone. See &#x201c;<i>Respiratory Physiology</i>&#x201d;, by John B. West, Lippincott Williams &#x26; Wilkins, 9th edition published 2012.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A range of respiratory disorders exist. Certain disorders may be characterised by particular events, e.g. apneas, hypopneas, and hyperpneas.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Examples of respiratory disorders include Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), Cheyne-Stokes Respiration (CSR), respiratory insufficiency, Obesity Hyperventilation Syndrome (OHS), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Neuromuscular Disease (NMD) and Chest wall disorders.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), a form of Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB), is characterised by events including occlusion or obstruction of the upper air passage during sleep. It results from a combination of an abnormally small upper airway and the normal loss of muscle tone in the region of the tongue, soft palate and posterior oropharyngeal wall during sleep. The condition causes the affected patient to stop breathing for periods typically of 30 to 120 seconds in duration, sometimes 200 to 300 times per night. It often causes excessive daytime somnolence, and it may cause cardiovascular disease and brain damage. The syndrome is a common disorder, particularly in middle aged overweight males, although a person affected may have no awareness of the problem. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,944,310 (Sullivan).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Cheyne-Stokes Respiration (CSR) is another form of sleep disordered breathing. CSR is a disorder of a patient's respiratory controller in which there are rhythmic alternating periods of waxing and waning ventilation known as CSR cycles. CSR is characterised by repetitive de-oxygenation and re-oxygenation of the arterial blood. It is possible that CSR is harmful because of the repetitive hypoxia. In some patients CSR is associated with repetitive arousal from sleep, which causes severe sleep disruption, increased sympathetic activity, and increased afterload. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,532,959 (Berthon-Jones).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Respiratory failure is an umbrella term for respiratory disorders in which the lungs are unable to inspire sufficient oxygen or exhale sufficient CO<sub>2 </sub>to meet the patient's needs. Respiratory failure may encompass some or all of the following disorders.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A patient with respiratory insufficiency (a form of respiratory failure) may experience abnormal shortness of breath on exercise.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Obesity Hyperventilation Syndrome (OHS) is defined as the combination of severe obesity and awake chronic hypercapnia, in the absence of other known causes for hypoventilation. Symptoms include dyspnea, morning headache and excessive daytime sleepiness.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) encompasses any of a group of lower airway diseases that have certain characteristics in common. These include increased resistance to air movement, extended expiratory phase of respiration, and loss of the normal elasticity of the lung. Examples of COPD are emphysema and chronic bronchitis. COPD is caused by chronic tobacco smoking (primary risk factor), occupational exposures, air pollution and genetic factors. Symptoms include: dyspnea on exertion, chronic cough and sputum production.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Neuromuscular Disease (NMD) is a broad term that encompasses many diseases and ailments that impair the functioning of the muscles either directly via intrinsic muscle pathology, or indirectly via nerve pathology. Some NMD patients are characterised by progressive muscular impairment leading to loss of ambulation, being wheelchair-bound, swallowing difficulties, respiratory muscle weakness and, eventually, death from respiratory failure. Neuromuscular disorders can be divided into rapidly progressive and slowly progressive: (i) Rapidly progressive disorders: Characterised by muscle impairment that worsens over months and results in death within a few years (e.g. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in teenagers); (ii) Variable or slowly progressive disorders: Characterised by muscle impairment that worsens over years and only mildly reduces life expectancy (e.g. Limb girdle, Facioscapulohumeral and Myotonic muscular dystrophy). Symptoms of respiratory failure in NMD include: increasing generalised weakness, dysphagia, dyspnea on exertion and at rest, fatigue, sleepiness, morning headache, and difficulties with concentration and mood changes.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Chest wall disorders are a group of thoracic deformities that result in inefficient coupling between the respiratory muscles and the thoracic cage. The disorders are usually characterised by a restrictive defect and share the potential of long term hypercapnic respiratory failure. Scoliosis and/or kyphoscoliosis may cause severe respiratory failure. Symptoms of respiratory failure include: dyspnea on exertion, peripheral oedema, orthopnea, repeated chest infections, morning headaches, fatigue, poor sleep quality and loss of appetite.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A range of therapies have been used to treat or ameliorate such conditions. Furthermore, otherwise healthy individuals may take advantage of such therapies to prevent respiratory disorders from arising. However, these have a number of shortcomings.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">2.2.2 Therapies</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Various respiratory therapies, such as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy, Non-invasive ventilation (NIV), Invasive ventilation (IV), High Flow Therapy (HFT) and long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) have been used to treat one or more of the above respiratory disorders.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">2.2.2.1 Respiratory Pressure Therapies</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Respiratory pressure therapy is the application of a supply of air to an entrance to the airways at a controlled target pressure that is nominally positive with respect to atmosphere throughout the patient's breathing cycle (in contrast to negative pressure therapies such as the tank ventilator or cuirass).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy has been used to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). The mechanism of action is that continuous positive airway pressure acts as a pneumatic splint and may prevent upper airway occlusion, such as by pushing the soft palate and tongue forward and away from the posterior oropharyngeal wall. Treatment of OSA by CPAP therapy may be voluntary, and hence patients may elect not to comply with therapy if they find devices used to provide such therapy one or more of: uncomfortable, difficult to use, expensive and aesthetically unappealing.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) provides ventilatory support to a patient through the upper airways to assist the patient breathing and/or maintain adequate oxygen levels in the body by doing some or all of the work of breathing. The ventilatory support is provided via a non-invasive patient interface. NIV has been used to treat CSR and respiratory failure, in forms such as OHS, COPD, NMD and Chest Wall disorders. In some forms, the comfort and effectiveness of these therapies may be improved.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Invasive ventilation (IV) provides ventilatory support to patients that are no longer able to effectively breathe themselves and may be provided using a tracheostomy tube. In some forms, the comfort and effectiveness of these therapies may be improved.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">2.2.2.2 Flow Therapies</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Not all respiratory therapies aim to deliver a prescribed therapeutic pressure. Some respiratory therapies aim to deliver a prescribed respiratory volume, by delivering an inspiratory flow rate profile over a targeted duration, possibly superimposed on a positive baseline pressure. In other cases, the interface to the patient's airways is &#x2018;open&#x2019; (unsealed) and the respiratory therapy may only supplement the patient's own spontaneous breathing with a flow of conditioned or enriched gas. In one example, High Flow therapy (HFT) is the provision of a continuous, heated, humidified flow of air to an entrance to the airway through an unsealed or open patient interface at a &#x201c;treatment flow rate&#x201d; that is held approximately constant throughout the respiratory cycle. The treatment flow rate is nominally set to exceed the patient's peak inspiratory flow rate. HFT has been used to treat OSA, CSR, respiratory failure, COPD, and other respiratory disorders. One mechanism of action is that the high flow rate of air at the airway entrance improves ventilation efficiency by flushing, or washing out, expired CO<sub>2 </sub>from the patient's anatomical deadspace. Hence, HFT is thus sometimes referred to as a deadspace therapy (DST). Other benefits may include the elevated warmth and humidification (possibly of benefit in secretion management) and the potential for modest elevation of airway pressures. As an alternative to constant flow rate, the treatment flow rate may follow a profile that varies over the respiratory cycle.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Another form of flow therapy is long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) or supplemental oxygen therapy. Doctors may prescribe a continuous flow of oxygen enriched gas at a specified oxygen concentration (from 21%, the oxygen fraction in ambient air, to 100%) at a specified flow rate (e.g., 1 litre per minute (LPM), 2 LPM, 3 LPM, etc.) to be delivered to the patient's airway.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">2.2.2.3 Supplementary Oxygen</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For certain patients, oxygen therapy may be combined with a respiratory pressure therapy or HFT by adding supplementary oxygen to the pressurised flow of air. When oxygen is added to respiratory pressure therapy, this is referred to as RPT with supplementary oxygen. When oxygen is added to HFT, the resulting therapy is referred to as HFT with supplementary oxygen.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">2.2.3 Respiratory Therapy Systems</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">These respiratory therapies may be provided by a respiratory therapy system or device. Such systems and devices may also be used to screen, diagnose, or monitor a condition without treating it.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A respiratory therapy system may comprise a Respiratory Pressure Therapy Device (RPT device), an air circuit, a humidifier, a patient interface, an oxygen source, and data management.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Another form of therapy system is a mandibular repositioning device.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">2.2.3.1 Patient Interface</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A patient interface may be used to interface respiratory equipment to its wearer, for example by providing a flow of air to an entrance to the airways. The flow of air may be provided via a mask to the nose and/or mouth, a tube to the mouth or a tracheostomy tube to the trachea of a patient. Depending upon the therapy to be applied, the patient interface may form a seal, e.g., with a region of the patient's face, to facilitate the delivery of gas at a pressure at sufficient variance with ambient pressure to effect therapy, e.g., at a positive pressure of about 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O relative to ambient pressure. For other forms of therapy, such as the delivery of oxygen, the patient interface may not include a seal sufficient to facilitate delivery to the airways of a supply of gas at a positive pressure of about 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. For flow therapies such as nasal HFT, the patient interface is configured to insufflate the nares but specifically to avoid a complete seal. One example of such a patient interface is a nasal cannula.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Certain other mask systems may be functionally unsuitable for the present field. For example, purely ornamental masks may be unable to maintain a suitable pressure. Mask systems used for underwater swimming or diving may be configured to guard against ingress of water from an external higher pressure, but not to maintain air internally at a higher pressure than ambient.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Certain masks may be clinically unfavourable for the present technology e.g. if they block airflow via the nose and only allow it via the mouth.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Certain masks may be uncomfortable or impractical for the present technology if they require a patient to insert a portion of a mask structure in their mouth to create and maintain a seal via their lips.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Certain masks may be impractical for use while sleeping, e.g. for sleeping while lying on one's side in bed with a head on a pillow.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">While a mask for other applications (e.g. aviators) may not be suitable for use in treating sleep disordered breathing, a mask designed for use in treating sleep disordered breathing may be suitable for other applications.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For these reasons, patient interfaces for delivery of CPAP during sleep, NIV or IV form a distinct field.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">2.2.3.1.1 Seal-Forming Structure</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Patient interfaces may include a seal-forming structure. Since it is in direct contact with the patient's face, the shape and configuration of the seal-forming structure can have a direct impact the effectiveness and comfort of the patient interface.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A patient interface may be partly characterised according to the design intent of where the seal-forming structure is to engage with the face in use. In one form of patient interface, a seal-forming structure may comprise a first sub-portion to form a seal around the left naris and a second sub-portion to form a seal around the right naris. In one form of patient interface, a seal-forming structure may comprise a single element that surrounds both nares in use. Such single element may be designed to for example overlay an upper lip region and a nasal bridge region of a face. In one form of patient interface a seal-forming structure may comprise an element that surrounds a mouth region in use, e.g. by forming a seal on a lower lip region of a face. In one form of patient interface, a seal-forming structure may comprise a single element that surrounds both nares and a mouth region in use. These different types of patient interfaces may be known by a variety of names by their manufacturer including nasal masks, full-face masks, nasal pillows, nasal puffs and oro-nasal masks.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">2.2.3.1.2 Positioning and Stabilising</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A seal-forming structure of a patient interface used for positive air pressure therapy is subject to the corresponding force of the air pressure to disrupt a seal. Thus a variety of techniques have been used to position the seal-forming structure, and to maintain it in sealing relation with the appropriate portion of the face.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">One technique is the use of adhesives. See for example US Patent Application Publication No. US 2010/0000534. However, the use of adhesives may be uncomfortable for some.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Another technique is the use of one or more straps and/or stabilising harnesses.

The flow of air may be pressure-controlled (for respiratory pressure therapies) or flow-controlled (for flow therapies such as HFT). Thus RPT devices may also act as flow therapy devices. Examples of RPT devices include a CPAP device and a ventilator.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Air pressure generators are known in a range of applications, e.g. industrial-scale ventilation systems.

Another example of an RPT device is a ventilator. Ventilators such as the ResMed Stellar&#x2122; Series of Adult and Paediatric Ventilators may provide support for invasive and non-invasive non-dependent ventilation for a range of patients for treating a number of conditions such as but not limited to NMD, OHS and COPD. Other examples of ventilators include the ResMed Lumis&#x2122; Series of non-invasive ventilators and the ResMed Astral&#x2122; series of life support ventilators.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">The ResMed Elis&#xe9;e&#x2122; 150 ventilator and ResMed VS III&#x2122; ventilator may provide support for invasive and non-invasive dependent ventilation suitable for adult or paediatric patients for treating a number of conditions. These ventilators provide volumetric and barometric ventilation modes with a single or double limb circuit. RPT devices typically comprise a pressure generator, such as a motor-driven blower or a compressed gas reservoir, and are configured to supply a flow of air to the airway of a patient. In some cases, the flow of air may be supplied to the airway of the patient at positive pressure. The outlet of the RPT device is connected via an air circuit to a patient interface such as those described above.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">The designer of a device may be presented with an infinite number of choices to make. Design criteria often conflict, meaning that certain design choices are far from routine or inevitable. Furthermore, the comfort and efficacy of certain aspects may be highly sensitive to small, subtle changes in one or more parameters.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">2.2.3.3 Air Circuit</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0046">An air circuit is a conduit or a tube constructed and arranged to allow, in use, a flow of air to travel between two components of a respiratory therapy system such as the RPT device and the patient interface. In some cases, there may be separate limbs of the air circuit for inhalation and exhalation. In other cases, a single limb air circuit is used for both inhalation and exhalation.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">2.2.3.4 Humidifier</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0047">Delivery of a flow of air without humidification may cause drying of airways. The use of a humidifier with an RPT device and the patient interface produces humidified gas that minimizes drying of the nasal mucosa and increases patient airway comfort. In addition, in cooler climates, warm air applied generally to the face area in and about the patient interface is more comfortable than cold air. Humidifiers therefore often have the capacity to heat the flow of air was well as humidifying it.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">A range of artificial humidification devices and systems are known; however, they may not fulfil the specialised requirements of a medical humidifier.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">Medical humidifiers are used to increase humidity and/or temperature of the flow of air in relation to ambient air when required, typically where the patient may be asleep or resting (e.g. at a hospital). A medical humidifier for bedside placement may be small. A medical humidifier may be configured to only humidify and/or heat the flow of air delivered to the patient without humidifying and/or heating the patient's surroundings. Room-based systems (e.g. a sauna, an air conditioner, or an evaporative cooler), for example, may also humidify air that is breathed in by the patient, however those systems would also humidify and/or heat the entire room, which may cause discomfort to the occupants. Furthermore, medical humidifiers may have more stringent safety constraints than industrial humidifiers</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">While a number of medical humidifiers are known, they can suffer from one or more shortcomings. Some medical humidifiers may provide inadequate humidification, while some are difficult or inconvenient to use by patients.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">2.2.3.5 Oxygen Source</heading><p id="p-0053" num="0051">Experts in this field have recognized that exercise for respiratory failure patients provides long term benefits that slow the progression of the disease, improve quality of life and extend patient longevity. Most stationary forms of exercise like tread mills and stationary bicycles, however, are too strenuous for these patients. As a result, the need for mobility has long been recognized. Until recently, this mobility has been facilitated by the use of small compressed oxygen tanks or cylinders mounted on a cart with dolly wheels. The disadvantage of these tanks is that they contain a finite amount of oxygen and are heavy, weighing about 50 pounds when mounted.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">Oxygen concentrators have been in use for about 50 years to supply oxygen for respiratory therapy. Traditional oxygen concentrators have been bulky and heavy making ordinary ambulatory activities with them difficult and impractical. Recently, companies that manufacture large stationary oxygen concentrators began developing portable oxygen concentrators (POCs). The advantage of POCs is that they can produce a theoretically endless supply of oxygen. In order to make these devices small for mobility, the various systems necessary for the production of oxygen enriched gas are condensed. POCs seek to utilize their produced oxygen as efficiently as possible, in order to minimise weight, size, and power consumption. This may be achieved by delivering the oxygen as series of pulses or &#x201c;boli&#x201d;, each bolus timed to coincide with the start of inspiration. This therapy mode is known as pulsed or demand (oxygen) delivery (POD), in contrast with traditional continuous flow delivery more suited to stationary oxygen concentrators.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">2.2.3.6 Data Management</heading><p id="p-0055" num="0053">There may be clinical reasons to obtain data to determine whether the patient prescribed with respiratory therapy has been &#x201c;compliant&#x201d;, e.g. that the patient has used their RPT device according to one or more &#x201c;compliance rules&#x201d;. One example of a compliance rule for CPAP therapy is that a patient, in order to be deemed compliant, is required to use the RPT device for at least four hours a night for at least 21 of 30 consecutive days. In order to determine a patient's compliance, a provider of the RPT device, such as a health care provider, may manually obtain data describing the patient's therapy using the RPT device, calculate the usage over a predetermined time period, and compare with the compliance rule. Once the health care provider has determined that the patient has used their RPT device according to the compliance rule, the health care provider may notify a third party that the patient is compliant.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">There may be other aspects of a patient's therapy that would benefit from communication of therapy data to a third party or external system.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">Existing processes to communicate and manage such data can be one or more of costly, time-consuming, and error-prone.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="2">2.2.3.7 Vent Technologies</heading><p id="p-0058" num="0056">Some forms of treatment systems may include a vent to allow the washout of exhaled carbon dioxide.

PSG typically involves the placement of 15 to 20 contact sensors on a patient in order to record various bodily signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), electrooculograpy (EOG), electromyography (EMG), etc. PSG for sleep disordered breathing has involved two nights of observation of a patient in a clinic, one night of pure diagnosis and a second night of titration of treatment parameters by a clinician. PSG is therefore expensive and inconvenient. In particular, it is unsuitable for home screening/diagnosis/monitoring of sleep disordered breathing.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">Screening and diagnosis generally describe the identification of a condition from its signs and symptoms. Screening typically gives a true/false result indicating whether or not a patient's SDB is severe enough to warrant further investigation, while diagnosis may result in clinically actionable information. Screening and diagnosis tend to be one-off processes, whereas monitoring the progress of a condition can continue indefinitely. Some screening/diagnosis systems are suitable only for screening/diagnosis, whereas some may also be used for monitoring.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">Clinical experts may be able to screen, diagnose, or monitor patients adequately based on visual observation of PSG signals. However, there are circumstances where a clinical expert may not be available, or a clinical expert may not be affordable. Different clinical experts may disagree on a patient's condition. In addition, a given clinical expert may apply a different standard at different times.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">3 BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE TECHNOLOGY</heading><p id="p-0064" num="0062">The present technology is directed towards providing medical devices used in the screening, diagnosis, monitoring, amelioration, treatment, or prevention of respiratory disorders having one or more of improved comfort, cost, efficacy, ease of use and manufacturability.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">A first aspect of the present technology relates to apparatus used in the screening, diagnosis, monitoring, amelioration, treatment or prevention of a respiratory disorder.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">Another aspect of the present technology relates to methods used in the screening, diagnosis, monitoring, amelioration, treatment or prevention of a respiratory disorder.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">An aspect of certain forms of the present technology is to provide methods and/or apparatus that improve the compliance of patients with respiratory therapy.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">An aspect of one form of the present technology is to provide a method of detecting user interaction with a respiratory therapy device.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">An aspect of one form of the present technology is a respiratory therapy device for treatment of sleep disordered breathing, the device comprising:</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">at least one sensor, configured to detect the presence of a user, wherein, on detection of the user, the device is configured to effect an action.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">Another aspect of one form of the present technology is a device for supplying a flow of breathable gas at a positive pressure for respiratory therapy, the device comprising:</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">a pressure generator for generating the flow of breathable gas and supplying the flow to an outlet; and</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">a sensor configured to detect the presence of a user in proximity to the device,</p><p id="p-0074" num="0000">wherein, on detection of the user by the sensor, the device is configured to effect an action.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0072">In examples, the device may comprise a contact portion.

For example, the sensor may comprise capacitive, inductive, optical, radar, sonar, ultrasonic, or magnetic sensing technologies as should be known to those skilled in the art. Use of a proximity sensor may advantageously allow for detection of a user as they approach, or a part of their body approaches, the contact portion(s) of the respiratory therapy device. For example, the sensor may be able to detect a user as they approach the device and effect an action accordingly.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0078">In some examples, the proximity sensor may be configured to effect an action once motion of the patient's body, including specific gestures of part of the patient's body, or a sequence of motions or gestures, are detected.

For example, the sensor may comprise a mechanical activation mechanism (such as a button), electrical contacts, capacitive, inductive, piezo-electric resistive sensors, including touch-screen technologies. The use of a contact sensor may advantageously provide a lower cost sensing solution compared to a proximity sensor, for example. Additional potential advantages include reduced potential for false detections.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0088">In examples, where the sensor is a contact sensor, one or more components of the sensor may be positioned externally to the housing. For example, the contact sensor may comprise one or more contact surfaces on an external surface of the housing.

In other words, the humidifier may be releasably connected to the device.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0094">In examples, the device may be configured to communicate with one or more remote, or secondary devices or systems. For example, using a wireless network such as WiFi or Bluetooth.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0095">In examples, the sensor is configured to detect a user interacting with the contact portion of the device.

Indirect contact by the user may include, for example the user holding a tool that contacts the device, or wearing a garment that contacts the device.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0243">In the illustrated form the handle <b>4018</b> is configured such that the part of the handle <b>4018</b> to be gripped by a user is separated from a body of the RPT device <b>4000</b> by an aperture <b>6090</b> which is configured to receive the fingers or hand of a user in use. However, this should not be seen as limiting on the technology, and in other forms the contact portion <b>6070</b> may be a region of the device which is textured or substantially smooth, the contact portion may also comprise one or more protrusions, knobs, ribs surfaces configured to facilitate user detection, motion detection, gesture detection or movement of the device. In other forms, the contact portion may comprise a recess in the external housing <b>4010</b> or a recess formed by a protrusion in the housing.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0244">According to one form of the technology, the device <b>4000</b> includes one or more sensors (not shown) configured to detect the presence of a user in proximity to, the device <b>4000</b>. For example, the user may be contacting the device <b>4000</b>, or the contact portion <b>6070</b> thereof, or may be within the sensing range of the sensor. For example, the sensor may be a proximity sensor such as a capacitive, inductive, optical, radar, sonar, ultrasonic, or magnetic sensor. In other forms of the technology, the sensor may be a contact sensor. For example, the sensor may comprise a mechanical activation mechanism (such as a button), electrical contacts, capacitive, inductive or resistive touch technologies.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0245">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the sensor is located within the external housing <b>4010</b> of the device <b>4000</b>. For example, the sensor may be located within the handle <b>4018</b> such that the sensor is arranged to detect the presence of a user's hand within the cavity or aperture <b>6090</b>. In one form the sensor may be mounted on or adjacent to a back wall of the handle <b>4018</b> (where &#x201c;back wall&#x201d; in this context is intended to mean a wall of the handle <b>4018</b> immediately adjacent the aperture <b>6090</b> and facing towards the body of the RPT device), however this should not be seen as limiting on the technology, for example the sensor may be mounted on a side or front wall of the handle <b>4018</b> (the &#x201c;front wall&#x201d; in this context being the wall of the handle <b>4018</b> on the opposite side of the handle to the back wall and the side walls being in between the front and back walls). In other forms the sensor may be mounted within the handle <b>4018</b>, with the sensing elements directed away from the cavity or aperture <b>6090</b>. This arrangement may advantageously enable the sensor to better detect the user's hand prior to contact with the contact portion.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0246">In other forms of the technology the sensor is positioned in a region <b>6080</b> of the housing <b>4010</b> which is adjacent to or opposite to the contact portion <b>6070</b>, for example the region indicated by the dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. For example, a proximity sensor may be provided to the housing <b>4010</b> in region <b>6080</b>. Use of a proximity sensor allows for detection of a user's hand near or on the contact portion <b>6070</b> without requiring the sensor to be directly mounted within or on the contact portion <b>6070</b>. For example, the sensor could be used to detect a user's hand as it enters the cavity or aperture <b>6090</b> between the contact portion <b>6070</b> and the external housing <b>4010</b> of the device <b>4000</b>.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0247">In other forms of the technology at least part of the sensor may be mounted to an external or outer surface of the housing <b>4010</b>. For example, the sensor may be a contact sensor provided to an external surface of the housing <b>4010</b>. In one form of the technology, the contact sensor may be comprised as part of an adhesive label which is adhered to an outer surface of the housing <b>4010</b>, such as on the handle <b>4018</b> of the device <b>4000</b>. In other forms the contact sensor may comprise one or more contact surfaces which is configured to move relative to the housing <b>4010</b> when engaged by the user.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0248">In forms of the technology, the device <b>4000</b> may include additional or alternative contact portions <b>6070</b> having different forms and/or positions to the contact portion <b>6070</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. For example, additional/alternative contact portion(s) <b>6070</b> may be provided to one or more sides <b>6110</b> or ends <b>6120</b> of the body of device <b>4000</b> to facilitate detection of a user attempting to move (e.g. lift) the device by holding the sides <b>6110</b>.</p><heading id="h-0070" level="2">5.7.2 Gesture Detection</heading><p id="p-0242" num="0249">In forms of the technology, the sensor may be configured to detect user movement, for example motion of the patient's body, specific gestures of a part of the user's body, or a sequence of motions or gestures. For example, a proximity sensor may be provided which is able to detect movement of the user relative to the device <b>4000</b>.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0250">In forms of the technology the sensor may be configured to detect a user moving towards the device <b>4000</b>, away from the device <b>4000</b> or gesturing near the device <b>4000</b>. For example, the sensor may be configured to detect a user gesturing near the device <b>4000</b>, such as waving, moving their hand laterally or longitudinally across the device <b>4000</b> (or a contact portion <b>6070</b>, or sensor of the device), in circular motions, or any other suitable gestures such as pinching, pointing or rotating their hands or fingers.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0251">In forms of the technology where the device <b>4000</b> is configured to detect specific motions, the present technology may have greater immunity to false activations, and/or allow for a greater number of actions to be effected. In examples, the device <b>4000</b> may be configured to enable one or more output devices <b>4290</b> (for example a display) as a user approaches the device <b>4000</b> and disable one or more output devices <b>4290</b> as the user moves away from the device <b>4000</b>. That is the device <b>4000</b> may be configured to effect a plurality of actions, where each action is effected in response to a different gesture. In other words, the device <b>4000</b> may be configured to distinguish between a plurality of motions or gestures by the user detected by the sensor, and effect a first action in response to detection of a first motion or gesture by the sensor and a second action in response to detection of a second motion or gesture by the sensor. In examples the first action may be different to the second action, however this should not be seen as limiting on the technology and in some forms the same action may be triggered by multiple different gestures.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0252">Detection of motion or gestures may be used to effect one or more actions in the device <b>4000</b> such as increasing or decreasing volume, brightness, humidity, pressure or flow settings, dismissing notifications, silencing alerts or alarms, or changing operating modes of the device <b>4000</b> such as starting or stopping the delivery of breathable gas at a therapy pressure.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0253">Use of gesture detection in a respiratory therapy device <b>4000</b> may advantageously enable users to interact with and/or control the device <b>4000</b> more easily. Particularly where the user is elderly, unwell or lacks the fine motor skills required to control traditional input devices <b>4220</b> such as buttons, dials and touchscreens.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0254">In forms of the technology, the sensor may facilitate user engagement or interaction with the device <b>4000</b>. This detection may be provided in one or more directions relative to the sensor or device <b>4000</b>, such as in front of the device, above the device, behind the device, or proximate to one or more sides of the device. In forms of the technology, the device <b>4000</b> may comprise one or more markings or structures defining or indicating to the user a region proximate the device within which the user's movements are detected by the sensor. For example, the device may include one or more icons, contoured surfaces or protrusions on the outer surface of the housing which indicate to the user an approximate region proximate to the device where gestures may be detected by the sensor. These markings or structures may further provide a reference for the user to provide gestures relative to. For example, a user may gesture as if they are rotating a dial mounted within the marked region or on the structure in order to effect an action in the device <b>4000</b>.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0255">In forms of the technology, the sensor may comprise one or more processors configured to detect and/or distinguish between movements or gestures performed by the user. For example, the sensor may be configured to communicate specific gesture information (e.g. data representative of specific gestures) to the central controller <b>4230</b>, which the central controller <b>4230</b> then uses to effect one or more actions as described herein. For example, the specific gesture information may include information that a swiping motion, stop gesture, or rotational gesture was detected. This specific gesture information may further comprise information relating to each gesture, such as the direction of movement, speed and or distance from the sensor. In this way the central controller <b>4230</b> may be able to determine whether an action should be effected in response to the gesture, for example if a gesture is detected at a distance which is beyond a pre-defined limit then the central controller <b>4230</b> may decide to not effect an action in response to the gesture.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0256">In other forms of the technology, the sensor may communicate information regarding detected objects, such as distance, size, speed, direction of movement etc. to one or more processors or controllers (such as the central controller <b>4230</b>). The processor or controller may then process the information in order to identify movement or gestures by a user. The information communicated from the sensor to the processor/controller may be data representative of movement in the sensor's field of view.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0257">In a yet further form of the technology, the sensor may be configured to communicate substantially raw sensor data to a processor or controller, and the processor or controller may process this data to determine if a user is in proximity to the device or gesturing to the device. For example, the data may comprise data representative of distance of detected object(s) from the sensor, which the processor or controller processes in order to determine whether a user or gesture is detected and whether an action should be effected.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0258">In certain forms of the technology, the processor that processes the data generated by the sensor (which may be central controller <b>4230</b>, or another controller/processor, for example a processor forming part of the sensor itself) is configured to detect movements and/or gestures of the user, and optionally to distinguish between such movements and/or gestures, by applying one or more predetermined algorithms to the data, where the predetermined algorithms are configured to analyse the data in order to identify the appropriate movements and/or gestures.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0259">In a yet further form of the technology, a controller or processor may be configured with a processing architecture that allows machine learning and/or artificial intelligence algorithms to be utilised in order to process one or more pieces of information from a sensor (such as raw data, object information, or gesture data). For example, a controller or processor may be configured with a processing architecture in the form of an artificial neural network which is pre-programmed or trained with a database of gesture information and/or is configured to undergo a learning routine in order to learn how to distinguish between data which is representative of a user gesturing and data which is not. The controller or processor may be configured to further learn during use of the device in order to account for variations in the way in which various users interact with or gesture to the device. Further adaptation of the processing architecture, for example the machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithms, may be automatic as the device is used, or updated in response to a specific learning routine. For example, the device may be configured to prompt a user to perform one or more prescribed gestures, sensed data from which the processor can apply to the processing architecture as reference gestures for re-configuring the processing architecture and improving the accuracy of detection of any subsequent gestures that are detected. This prompting of the user may be performed during the initial set-up of the device, on a regular basis (such as 3-monthly), as required (for example when the device detects movement but is unable to determine any specific gestures) or when a learning routine is manually activated by the user (such as by selecting to activate the learning routine on the user interface).</p><p id="p-0253" num="0260">In forms of the technology, the controller or processor may be configured to receive feedback on the accuracy of the gesture detection by analysis of data generated by sensing subsequent actions performed by the user. For example, the controller or processor may determine that a gesture to stop the flow of pressurised air is detected and effect an action accordingly (i.e. stop the flow of pressurised air). If subsequently the user reactivates the flow of pressurised air within a predetermined period of time (for example 10 seconds) then this may be interpreted by the controller or processor that that an incorrect gesture was identified or that an incorrect action was effected. In response to identifying one or more incorrect gestures or actions the device may be configured to prompt the user to perform a learning routine as described herein, or otherwise automatically update the device's behaviour to ignore or action similar gestures in a different manner in the future.</p><heading id="h-0071" level="2">5.7.3 Actions</heading><p id="p-0254" num="0261">On detection of a user, the device <b>4000</b> may be configured to effect one or more actions either in the device <b>4000</b> itself or in a secondary device. For example, the device <b>4000</b> may be configured to effect one or more of the following actions:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0262">Disabling one or more features of an input device <b>4220</b>.

For example, the display <b>4294</b> may be turned off to save power if a user is detected moving away from the device, or if no user is detected in proximity to the device. The device <b>4000</b> may further be configured to enable one or more features of the output device <b>4290</b>, such as enabling the display, or a backlight of the display when a user is detected moving towards, or otherwise in proximity to the device <b>4000</b>. Alternatively, or additionally the device <b>4000</b> may be configured to silence an alarm condition when a user is detected interacting or gesturing to the device <b>4000</b> or contact portion <b>6070</b> of the device <b>4000</b> i.e. the indicator light <b>6040</b> and/or any audible alarms may be silenced/disabled;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0264">Providing one or more messages, alerts or other feedback to the user indicating to the user that the device is active. For example, the user may be informed that the device <b>4000</b> should not be moved while in use. For example, the device may alert the user via one or more output device(s) of the device such as the display, an indicator light or a speaker. In other examples, the device may alert the user via one or more secondary, for example peripheral or remote devices. For example, the device may be configured to cause an audible, visual or tactile alert to be played via the user's cell phone. Such an action may be effected by the sensor sending a signal to a controller to indicate that the user has been detected, and the controller being configured to cause a transmitting device to send an actuation signal to a remote device such as a cell phone. In some forms the messages, alerts or other feedback may be provided through a combination of devices. In some forms the feedback may take the form of a message having text informing the user that the device should not be moved while in use. In other forms the feedback may take the form of an alert that implies this to the user, for example by illuminating a light associated with a warning message or symbol understood to be indicating not to move the device in use.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0265">Providing one or more messages, alerts or other feedback to the user concerning one or more releasable components connected to the device <b>4000</b>.

Control system <b>7000</b> is configured to effect one or more actions upon detection of a user in proximity to the device <b>4000</b>.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0269">An RPT device <b>4000</b> includes a sensor <b>4005</b> which is operatively connected to a controller, i.e. by a wired or wireless connection. For the sake of simplicity, reference herein will be made to the central controller <b>4230</b>, however this should not be seen as limiting on the technology, and any suitable controller may be used. For example, a dedicated sensing controller may be used to determine the presence of an object, and/or distinguish between users and non-user objects such as walls in the manner described elsewhere in this specification. Central controller <b>4230</b> may comprise one or more discrete processing units.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0270">In use, the sensor <b>4005</b>, detects the presence of an object in proximity to the device, such as contacting the device or being proximate to the device <b>4000</b>. For example, the sensor <b>4005</b> may be configured to detect objects within approximately 5 cm of a surface of the device <b>4000</b>. In other forms of the technology it may be advantageous to configure the sensor <b>4005</b> to detect objects within approximately 1 cm of a surface of the device <b>4000</b>. Limiting the range of the sensor <b>4005</b> may reduce the amount of data (such as information regarding nearby objects) the sensor or controller needs to process, potentially reducing the processing power required, and reducing the likelihood that a detection of an object other than a user could occur.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0271">In further forms of the technology, it may be advantageous to configure the sensor <b>4005</b> to detect objects at a range which is greater than 5 cm from the device <b>4000</b>. For example, the sensor <b>4005</b> may be configured to detect objects within approximately 2 metres of the device. Providing a sensing range greater than 5 cm may advantageously enable the device to detect a user as they approach or walk away from the device <b>4000</b>.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0272">In further forms of the technology, it may be advantageous to configure the sensor <b>4005</b> to detect objects between approximately 1 cm and 50 cm of the device <b>4000</b>. Providing a range of between approximately 1 cm 50 cm may advantageously support gesture detection or motion detection without requiring the user to gesture too closely to the device, while reducing the likelihood that false activations could occur. It should be appreciated that the aforementioned ranges are provided by way of example only, and other suitable ranges may be used in accordance with the present technology.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0273">In forms of the technology, the aforementioned distances and ranges may be measured relative to one or more contact portion(s) <b>6070</b> of the device <b>4000</b>. For example, it may be advantageous to detect a user in proximity to a contact portion <b>6070</b> of the device <b>4000</b> in order to determine whether the user intends to move the device <b>4000</b>.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0274">The range and/or sensitivity of the sensor <b>4005</b> may also be adjustable. In one form the range of the sensor <b>4005</b> is manually adjustable i.e. adjustable by a technician or user. For example, the range may be adjusted using one of the input devices <b>4220</b> (such as a touch screen interface) or by manually adjusting a component of the sensor <b>4005</b> (such as a potentiometer). In another form, the range of the sensor is automatically adjustable, for example the sensor range may adjust based on the ambient conditions (i.e. time of day, temperature, moisture, ambient light levels etc.). In other words, the central controller <b>4230</b> may monitor one or more ambient conditions, and in response to changes in the ambient conditions, send a signal to the sensor <b>4005</b> in order to adjust the sensitivity or range.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0275">In forms of the technology, the sensor <b>4005</b> may be configured to continuously scan or monitor the surrounding environment for changes. For example, changes in the sensor's field or the amplitude of a signal reflected to the sensor may be indicative of a user approaching the device <b>4000</b>, or contact portion(s) <b>6070</b> thereof. In other forms, the sensor <b>4005</b> may scan or monitor the surrounding environment on an intermittent basis. For example, once every second, or once every 5 seconds. Reducing the rate at which the sensor <b>4005</b> scans the surrounding environment may advantageously reduce the total power consumption of the device <b>4000</b>. In yet further forms of the technology, the sensor <b>4005</b> may scan the surrounding environment at a variable rate. For example, the scan rate may be based on the number of proximate objects detected or the level or mode of use of the RPT device <b>4000</b>. For example, the scan rate may be reduced when no proximate objects have been detected for a period of time, when the device is in use, or at night-time when users are less likely to be engaging with the device <b>4000</b>.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0276">In other forms, the sensor <b>4005</b> may be a contact sensor as described herein, i.e. the sensor may detect when a user touches the device <b>4000</b> or a contact portion <b>6070</b> thereof.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0277">In use when the sensor <b>4005</b> and central controller <b>4230</b> determine that a user has touched, or is in proximity to, the device <b>4000</b> or contact portion <b>6070</b> thereof the controller may effect an action. For example, the controller may send a signal to one or both of the input device <b>4220</b> or output device <b>4290</b> to effect an action as described above. Alternatively, the controller may be configured to send a signal to a secondary device <b>7010</b> to effect an action in the secondary device <b>7010</b>.

In principle the inspiratory volume Vi (the volume of air inhaled) is equal to the expiratory volume Ve (the volume of air exhaled), and therefore a single tidal volume Vt may be defined as equal to either quantity. In practice the tidal volume Vt is estimated as some combination, e.g. the mean, of the inspiratory volume Vi and the expiratory volume Ve.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0359">(inhalation) Time (Ti): The duration of the inspiratory portion of the respiratory flow rate waveform.</p><p id="p-0343" num="0360">(exhalation) Time (Te): The duration of the expiratory portion of the respiratory flow rate waveform.</p><p id="p-0344" num="0361">(total) Time (Ttot): The total duration between the start of one inspiratory portion of a respiratory flow rate waveform and the start of the following inspiratory portion of the respiratory flow rate waveform.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0362">Typical recent ventilation: The value of ventilation around which recent values of ventilation Vent over some predetermined timescale tend to cluster, that is, a measure of the central tendency of the recent values of ventilation.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0363">Upper airway obstruction (UAO): includes both partial and total upper airway obstruction.

If the pressure waveform template &#x3a0;(&#x3a6;) is zero-valued at the end of expiration, i.e. &#x3a0;(&#x3a6;)=0 when &#x3a6;=1, the EEP is equal to the EPAP.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0370">Inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP): Maximum desired interface pressure which the ventilator will attempt to achieve during the inspiratory portion of the breath.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0371">Pressure support: A number that is indicative of the increase in pressure during ventilator inspiration over that during ventilator expiration, and generally means the difference in pressure between the maximum value during inspiration and the base pressure (e.g., PS=IPAP&#x2212;EPAP). In some contexts, pressure support means the difference which the ventilator aims to achieve, rather than what it actually achieves.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0372">Servo-ventilator: A ventilator that measures patient ventilation, has a target ventilation, and which adjusts the level of pressure support to bring the patient ventilation towards the target ventilation.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0373">Spontaneous/Timed (S/T): A mode of a ventilator or other device that attempts to detect the initiation of a breath of a spontaneously breathing patient.
