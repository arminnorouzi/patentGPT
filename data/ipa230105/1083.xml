This statistic would be much greater if deaths caused by illicit drugs were included. There exists an FDA-approved anti-overdose drug such as naloxone to counteract the action of opioids. Although naloxone availability has improved in recent years with legislation allowing for over-the-counter purchase of the drug, patients often are incapacitated to administer the potentially lifesaving drug to themselves in a timely manner. Therefore, there is a need for drug delivery devices and methods by which a person can quickly administer, and in some cases automatically or self-administer, an antidote to combat the effects of an overdose.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides implantable drug delivery devices and drug delivery methods suitable for a delivering drug to a living body in which the device is implanted.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one aspect of the invention, an implantable drug delivery device for delivering a drug to a living body includes a housing having at least one opening, a reservoir within the housing adapted to contain a drug, a temporary seal closing the opening of the housing, and a heating element in thermal contact with the temporary seal.

It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation to the scope of the invention is thereby intended. Furthermore, any dimensions or relative scaling within or among any of the drawings is by way of example and not to be construed as limiting.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The following describes a drug delivery device capable of be implanted into a living body (hereinafter, &#x201c;recipient&#x201d;) and distributing a drug into the tissue or bloodstream of the recipient, in some cases instantly distributing the drug, as a result of the device being triggered or activated in response to an overdose, and in some cases automatically triggered or activated by the detection of an overdose. As used herein, the term &#x201c;implantable&#x201d; is understood to mean a device having an appropriate size, construction, and composition to be able to be surgically placed in a recipient and remain within that recipient over an extended period, for example, thirty days or more, and potentially for the life of the recipient in which it is implanted. Particular but nonlimiting examples of drugs that can be delivered include antidotes such as naloxone, known for its use in the treatment of overdoses due to opioids, though the device could be used to deliver a wide variety of drugs, including emergency drugs (e.g., epinephrine for allergic reaction) and slow-release drugs (e.g., naltrexone for drug recovery treatment). The triggering event used to trigger or activate the device can be based on one or more normal reactions of the human body that may be observable or measurable. For example, when an overdose occurs, the human body reacts with a sudden increase in temperature and other abrupt changes to normal body functions. These sudden changes can be automatically sensed and used to automatically trigger the device, or observed to enable the recipient or others to manually trigger the device. Because the device is already implanted in the recipient, the device is able to immediately release the drug into the recipient to diffuse the overdose before lethal effects occur. The drug delivery device can be configured for subcutaneous implantation via a minimally invasive surgical procedure. Through such a device, it may be possible to eliminate the symptoms and effects of an overdose altogether.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> schematically represent a drug delivery device <b>10</b> adapted to deliver an antidote to combat the effects of an overdose. The device <b>10</b> is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as comprising a housing <b>12</b> that defines a fluid-tight chamber or reservoir <b>18</b> (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) within the device <b>10</b> that is capable of reliably containing a drug until its intended release from the device <b>10</b>. The reservoir <b>18</b> is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> as a single compartment that contains a single dose of a single drug, though it is within the scope of the invention to compartmentalize the reservoir <b>18</b> to enable it to contain multiple doses of one or more drugs. Drugs contained within the reservoir <b>18</b> may be in liquid form, solid (e.g., powder) form, or a combination thereof. The housing <b>12</b> is represented as having oppositely-disposed ends, each closed to define the reservoir <b>18</b> within the housing <b>12</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, a first end of the housing <b>12</b> has an opening that is closed with a permanent or persistent seal <b>14</b>, though it is foreseeable that the housing <b>12</b> could be fabricated so that the first end is closed by an integral wall of the housing <b>12</b>. The oppositely-disposed second end of the housing <b>12</b> has an opening <b>22</b> (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that is closed with a temporary seal <b>16</b> (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), such that in combination the housing <b>12</b>, the seal <b>14</b> (if present), and the temporary seal <b>16</b> define the fluid-tight reservoir <b>18</b>. In any event, a drug within the reservoir <b>18</b> is not released unless, in the case of the particular embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the temporary seal <b>16</b> sufficiently degrades to allow the drug to exit the reservoir <b>18</b> through the opening <b>22</b> in the housing <b>12</b>. A heating element <b>20</b> (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is incorporated into the housing <b>12</b> so as to be in thermal contact or communication with the temporary seal <b>16</b>, for example, embedded in the temporary seal <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), or a tubular-shaped heating element within the reservoir <b>18</b> adjacent the persistent seal <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) or adjacent the temporary seal <b>16</b>. In each case, physical degradation of the seal <b>16</b> is the result of the seal <b>16</b> being sufficiently heated to soften or melt to the extent that the drug is able to exit the reservoir <b>18</b> through the opening <b>22</b> that had been previously closed by the seal <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> schematically represents steps by which the drug delivery device <b>10</b> can be triggered to release a drug contained in its reservoir <b>18</b>. After the device <b>10</b> is subcutaneously implanted in a recipient, the device <b>10</b> remains dormant until such time as a physiological symptom of an overdose is observed or sensed, for example, as a result of an abrupt change in the recipient's body temperature as sensed by a temperature sensor (not shown) attached to or carried in proximity to the recipient's body. The detected or observed change serves as the basis for energizing the heating element <b>20</b>. The heating element <b>20</b> sufficiently heats the temporary seal <b>16</b> to cause the seal <b>16</b> to physically degrade, for example, melt, and become at least partially dislodged from the end of the housing <b>12</b>. The resulting opening <b>22</b> at the end of the housing <b>12</b> exposes the reservoir <b>18</b>, allowing or forcing the drug to exit the reservoir <b>18</b>. The heating element <b>20</b> may be heated to completely or only partially remove the seal <b>16</b> to regulate the release of the drug and, in some cases, heating may be discontinued to allow the seal <b>16</b> to resolidify and reseal the opening <b>22</b>. These aspects of the invention may be promoted by choosing materials for the seal <b>16</b> that exhibit changes in permeability or porosity in response to the thermal stimulus provided by the heating element <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Suitable materials for the temporary seal <b>16</b> include, but are not limited to, biocompatible thermosensitive polymers, for example, cross-linked polymers such as waxes that have melting points above the normal body temperature of the recipient (e.g., about 40 to about 42&#xb0; C.), enabling the seal <b>16</b> to at least partially melt into liquid form at a temperature well above normal for the human body and yet sufficiently low to not damage the tissue in which the device <b>10</b> is implanted. The drug may be contained within the reservoir <b>18</b> under pressure, such that the drug is forcibly ejected from the reservoir <b>18</b> once the seal <b>16</b> has sufficiently degraded.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The housing <b>12</b> and persistent seal <b>14</b> of the device <b>10</b> can be formed of materials having much higher melting or degradation temperatures than the seal <b>16</b>. As nonlimiting examples, the housing <b>12</b> may be in the form of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube and the seal <b>14</b> formed of a PTFE body placed in one end of the PTFE tube of the housing <b>12</b>. Alternatively, other materials can be used, or the housing <b>12</b> and seal <b>14</b> may be a unitary member formed of a single material. In one experimental embodiment, the housing <b>12</b> had a cylindrical shape with a length of about 10 mm and an outer diameter of about 4 mm to facilitate subcutaneous implantation of the device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Examples of suitable devices for use as the heating element <b>20</b> include, but are not limited to, one or more ferrous (e.g., stainless steel) elements that can be heated by induction heating, and/or one or more ferrite elements with LC circuitry that enable the element to be heated by magnetic hysteresis. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the heating element <b>20</b> is represented as being subjected to an oscillating magnetic field generated by a radio frequency (RF) generator <b>24</b>, such that the heating element <b>20</b> can be wirelessly energized with RF waves at a resonant frequency of its circuitry. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> generically represents the heating element <b>20</b> as inductively coupled to the generator <b>24</b>, for example, as a result of the heating element <b>20</b> being a stainless steel element. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> represents an embodiment utilizing a ferrite heating element <b>20</b>, in which an impedance-matched primary and secondary coil design is used to achieve inductively coupled power transfer between circuitry of an RF generator (lefthand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) and the LC circuitry (righthand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of the ferrite heating element <b>20</b>. The generator <b>24</b> may be in the possession of the recipient, a caregiver or emergency responders, or may be attached to or carried by the recipient. In any case, the generator <b>24</b> is utilized to externally generate an emission capable of wirelessly energizing the heating element <b>20</b> to heat the temporary seal <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">On the basis of the above, the delivery device <b>10</b> is adapted to be implanted in a human recipient (or other living body) to deliver one or more drugs to the recipient by releasing the drug contained in the reservoir <b>18</b> as a result of the heating element <b>20</b> generating heat in response to means that will typically be located outside the recipient's body. In the case of an overdose, the heating element <b>20</b> is energized upon the detection of physiological indications that can be observed, sensed, or otherwise detected in the recipient. The device <b>10</b> can be implanted under the skin of an at-risk patient of opioid misuse to enable immediate delivery of an antidote to the patient. In some cases, the device <b>10</b> may be triggered by others, such as a caregiver or emergency responder, though it is also foreseeable that the patient may be able to trigger the device <b>10</b> without assistance. As previously noted, it is also foreseeable that one or more sensors can be utilized to provide feedback control to automatically release the drug when overdose is detected.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In experiments leading to the present invention, a test drug (powdered acetaminophen) was placed in the reservoir of a drug delivery device configured similar to the representations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> and closed by a seal formed of a thermosensitive wax. The drug was released by melting the seal with heat generated by an inductively-coupled heating element. Spectrophotometric analysis was performed to measure the concentration of drug released. Results of the experiments evidenced that the experimental device was able to successfully diffuse the drug to the surroundings of the device when current was supplied to the heating element via a generator. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> contains a calibration curve for acetaminophen and preliminary data. The concentrations of the diffused drug were found by comparing the data against the calibration curve of absorbance versus known concentrations. The spectrophotometer reading was obtained using &#x3bb;=243 nm (maximum for acetaminophen). The data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is presented as average +standard deviation, and the investigation showed that approximately 1 A was sufficient to melt the seal in a timely manner (less than 10 seconds). The device was determined to deliver a drug dose of about 2 to 5 mg.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another investigation, the time required to heat stainless steel heating elements sized for use in a device of the type represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. The heating elements were inductively heated from a typical human body temperature of 37&#xb0; C. to a temperature of 42&#xb0; C., and observed with an infrared (IR) camera. The average time for the five heating elements was about 10 seconds.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preliminary in vivo investigations were also carried out to verify successful activation and passive diffusion of a drug from devices of the type represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. For these investigations, incisions were made in the backs and down the necks of three male mice (C57BL). The skin was lifted and separated from the underlying tissue using forceps and surgical scissors, followed by implantation of the devices. Subcutaneous space was created within each incision to provide space surrounding each device for diffusion of indocyanine green (ICG) dye placed in the reservoirs of the devices. The mice were imaged every minute for forty minutes prior to activation of the devices, which were activated using a magnetic field generated by a coil placed above the skin of each mouse. The coil was supplied with 250 kHz 25 mVpp with a gain of 10 for sixty seconds to minimize the heating of the outer coil. The mice were then imaged for forty minutes post-activation. The normalized radiance values from fluorescent images of the mice are plotted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, and evidence that no leakage occurred from the devices in the first forty minutes after implantation and prior to activation. Post-activation, the radiance of the drug signal exponentially increased and stabilized in about ten minutes, evidencing that the devices exhibited a burst release profile as a result of the rapid melting of their temporary seals, contrary to slow-release profiles usually observed with drug delivery implants.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">While the invention has been described in terms of particular embodiments and investigations, it should be apparent that alternatives could be adopted by one skilled in the art.
