end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Hereinafter, examples of the present disclosure will be described.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to an example of the present disclosure, a configuration is employable that adjusts timing of a gate signal that is input to a switching element based on a measurement result of a load signal generated in association with a switching operation of switching elements that form a bridge circuit for driving a load.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">It is noted that, in a case where a bridge circuit such as an inverter drives a motor, for example, a surge voltage generated by switching of a switching element changes at high speed. Further, a large amount of noise is generally generated in an environment in which a motor is driven and controlled. Therefore, it is inevitable that the environment is affected by the noise.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In such an environment, for example, in order to measure a period during which the surge voltage exceeds a certain reference voltage, one may assume that such a period may be detectable by detecting edges of pulse signals generated by comparing the voltage signal with a reference voltage. However, the edge interval is in an order of nanosecond. Therefore, it becomes difficult to detect the edge interval. Further, when edge detection is performed by an analog circuit, the circuit area size may become large, and when the edge detection is performed by a digital circuit, it is difficult to implement a high-speed clock signal when the circuit is formed by using a high breakdown voltage process. That is, it is still difficult to detect the edges.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to an example of a pulse edge detection circuit, one of a rise edge and a fall edge of a pulse signal output by a comparator comparing a voltage signal with a threshold voltage is designated as a first edge, and an other of a rise edge and a fall edge of a pulse signal is designated as a second edge. A first and second edge detection units output a first and second edge detection signals, respectively at timings when first and second edges are generated. Regarding such a detection, in the second edge detection unit, a timing at which the second edge can be detected is controlled by the first edge detection signal.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a pulse signal, one edge is generated followed by the other edge. Therefore, the timing at which the second edge detection unit can detect the second edge is controlled by the first edge detection signal output by the first edge detection unit at the timing at which the first edge is generated. As a result, even when the generation interval between the two edges is short because the pulse signal is at a high speed, the second edge detection unit is enabled to detect the second edge without using a high speed clock signal.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to an example, the pulse edge detection circuit includes first and second clock synchronization circuits that output the first and second edge detection signals in synchronization with the clock signal, respectively. With such a configuration, the generation timing of the first and second edges detected by the first and second edge detection units can be represented by using a cycle of the synchronization clock signal, which serves as a unit of minimum duration of time.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Hereinafter, the first embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>5</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a series circuit of the N-channel MOSFETs <b>1</b>P and <b>1</b>N constitutes one phase of a three-phase inverter circuit <b>2</b>, and is connected to a DC power supply <b>3</b>. The inverter circuit <b>2</b> drives, for example, a three-phase motor (not shown). A measurement circuit <b>4</b> composed of a comparator is connected at a position between a drain and a source of the FET <b>1</b>N. The measurement circuit <b>4</b> compares a drain-source voltage Vds of the FET <b>1</b>N with a reference voltage, which is a threshold voltage, and outputs a pulse signal Vin.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, for example, when the voltage of the DC power supply <b>3</b> is about 12 V, at a timing of turning off of the FET <b>1</b>N, a surge voltage exceeding 18 V is generated between the drain and the source. By comparing this surge voltage Vds with a reference voltage of about 12 V, the pulse signal Vin is generated.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A detection circuit <b>5</b> of the present embodiment detects (i) a rise edge of the pulse signal Vin corresponding to a timing at which the surge voltage Vds first exceeds the reference voltage, and (ii) a fall edge of the pulse signal Vin corresponding to a timing at which the surge voltage Vds firstly falls below the reference voltage thereafter.

On the other hand, when the reset of the RSFF <b>13</b> is released immediately after the voltage Vds first falls below the reference voltage, the signal OUT<b>2</b> changes to a high level at a late timing.
