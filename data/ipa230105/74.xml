The method of application of this formulation is by means of an aerosol spray and by means of visible light irradiation the photoactive effects are activated, thus inhibiting the growth of fungi of the genera <i>Botritys, Penicillium </i>and <i>Rhizopus</i>, by the generation of singlet oxygen.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Agriculture is the fundamental basis for the sustainability of food security on the planet, as it represents the main source of food and is part of the economy of developing countries. Demand for food has now increased, so there is a need to optimize agricultural production. To minimize losses in agricultural production, different biological control agents are used in order to minimize losses caused by different pathogens both pre- and post-harvest.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Two approaches to controlling post-harvest diseases have been described: The use and management of beneficial microflora that already exists in fruits and vegetable surfaces, or the introduction of artificial antagonists. The state of art teaches that methods to manipulate populations of microorganisms in a beneficial manner are not widely used due mainly to the limited knowledge of how these populations of microorganisms grow in the different food matrix. At present the most commonly used method of biological control is the use of different antagonists.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Within this approach the elimination or reduction of pathogenic microorganisms is typically carried out by surfactants, irradiation, exposure to solvents or exposure to agents that cause oxidative damage to biological macromolecules of microorganisms. These latter treatments include gases such as ethylene oxide and chlorine dioxide. In environments where humans are present, the use of gamma-ray or high-intensity UV radiation is undesirable, as is exposure of humans to organic solvents and harmful gases.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, the use of biodegradable substances that do not harm the environment and are safe for human health is one of the challenges of both agriculture and the post-harvest fruit and vegetable industry. Poli-(BGA-AGA), also known generically as chitosan (although this name covers a wider family of biopolymer with different proportions between the monomers 2-amino-2-deoxi-D-glucopyranose and 2-acetamide-2-deoxi-D-glucopyranose), is a biopolymer formed from the organic or polymeric units (polymeric). of &#x3b2;(1-4)-2-acetamide-2-deoxy-D-glucose and monomers of &#x3b2;(1-4)-2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose, where the first monomer predominates the second in at least a 2:1 ratio. Selective interaction of Poli-(BGA-AGA) with trace metals inhibits toxin production and microbial growth.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Poli-(BGA-AGA) has antifungal and antibacterial activity that can be bactericidal or bacteriostatic, depending on the strains and the specific characteristics of Poli-(BGA-AGA). The antimicrobial activity of Poli-(BGA-AGA), is influenced by the nature and/or the physico-chemical structure of each polymer. Thus, the degree of deacetylation (GD) and the length of the molecule are related to the intensity of the antifungal action. In general, the higher Gd, the greater the antimicrobial capacity. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of Poli-(BGA-AGA) depends on some factors inherent to the substrate on which it acts, such as environmental conditions (temperature and humidity), nutrient composition, pH and water activity.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The use of Poli-(BGA-AGA) has reached a progressive and sustained interest in recent years, since its use prevents the accumulation of slowly degrading waste such as chitin. In addition, since Poli-(BGA-AGA) has antimicrobial properties, its application constitutes an alternative to synthetic chemicals for the conservation of edible fruits and vegetables.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, the state of the technique teaches that certain compounds such as dyes, porphyrins, fluorescenes, phenothiaziniums and phthalocyanins generate high-energy singlet oxygen, a potent antimicrobial agent, when exposed to light and air. These materials are often referred to as &#x201c;light-activated antimicrobial materials&#x201d; (LAAM). However, in order for these LAAM compounds to exercise their antimicrobial activity, they have to be activated very close to the microorganisms against which they are desired to act. These are inefficient if there is not an appropriate method of addressing these agents to the cell walls of pathogenic microorganisms.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It has been described that one of the main problems suffered by fruit exporters is the scrap losses on arrival in the country of destination, and in the case of grapes it has been estimated that the percentage of loss reaches 15 per cent. The main agent causing rejection in the exported grapes corresponds to the development of gray rot, caused by the fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. This fungus not only causes problems in grape production but also affects a number of economically important crops such as berries, tomatoes, pears, almonds, avocado, Etc. Although different compounds have been evaluated in terms of their activity against this fungus, there are currently no effective treatments. Additionally, fungi of the genus <i>Penicillium </i>and <i>Rhizopus </i>are important pathogens of different fruits and vegetables of great economic importance, such as citrus.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The problem of the technique is therefore to provide efficient products for the control of these pathogens in the post-harvest stage, and in particular there are no products on the market that efficiently direct antimicrobial agents to the cell walls of the white pathogenic microorganisms.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">To assess the merits of the invention described in this document, a brief summary of the most relevant documents present in the technique is presented for the present invention. The search focused on documents related to antimicrobial formulations that inhibit the growth of pathogens of agronomic interest. More specifically, the search focused on formulations comprising chitosan and a photoactivable antimicrobial compound, to be used as an antimicrobial agent of pathogens of the genus <i>Penicillium, Botrytis </i>and <i>Rhizopus</i>. In general, the analysis carried out suggests that there is no formulation that can be used as an antimicrobial having the same characteristics, composition and/or excipients as compared to the formulation described in the present invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The document that may be considered the closest to the present invention is document WO2010017386A2, which teaches a composition comprising a light-activated antimicrobial material that has one or more singlet oxygen generating groups, it also includes a mediator polymer capable of bonding the microbial agent to a surface. However, the use of chitosan as a polymer is not mentioned, nor is the use of a composition to combat fungal infections such as <i>Botrytis, Penicillium </i>and <i>Rhizopus </i>described. Additionally, none of these documents describe that chitosan can be linked to a photoactivable antimicrobial agent, to surprisingly inhibit the growth of each of the microorganisms identified above.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to better illustrate the invention, this document describes the present invention considering some cases in which it may be applied, however, these examples should not be considered as limiting the invention.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The invention describes a chemical formulation comprising a nanometer biopolymer, a linker and a photoactive agent, which are at a percentage of 1% in the formulation.
