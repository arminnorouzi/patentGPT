It will be apparent to a person skilled in the pertinent art that the present disclosure can also be employed in a variety of other applications.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">It is noted that references in the specification to &#x201c;one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an example embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;some embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;certain embodiments,&#x201d; etc., indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it would be within the knowledge of a person skilled in the pertinent art to effect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In general, terminology may be understood at least in part from usage in context. For example, the term &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; as used herein, depending at least in part upon context, may be used to describe any feature, structure, or characteristic in a singular sense or may be used to describe combinations of features, structures or characteristics in a plural sense. Similarly, terms, such as &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; or &#x201c;the,&#x201d; again, may be understood to convey a singular usage or to convey a plural usage, depending at least in part upon context. In addition, the term &#x201c;based on&#x201d; may be understood as not necessarily intended to convey an exclusive set of factors and may, instead, allow for existence of additional factors not necessarily expressly described, again, depending at least in part on context.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Various aspects of wireless communication systems will now be described with reference to various apparatus and methods. These apparatus and methods will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks, modules, units, components, circuits, steps, operations, processes, algorithms, etc. (collectively referred to as &#x201c;elements&#x201d;). These elements may be implemented using electronic hardware, firmware, computer software, or any combination thereof. Whether such elements are implemented as hardware, firmware, or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The techniques described herein may be used for various wireless communication networks, such as code division multiple access (CDMA) system, time division multiple access (TDMA) system, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) system, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) system, and other networks. The terms &#x201c;network&#x201d; and &#x201c;system&#x201d; are often used interchangeably. A CDMA network may implement a radio access technology (RAT), such as Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA), CDMA 2000, etc. A TDMA network may implement a RAT, such as Global System for Mobile communication (GSM). An OFDMA network may implement a RAT, such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE) or New Radio (NR). The techniques described herein may be used for the wireless networks and RATs mentioned above, as well as other wireless networks and RATs.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a 5G cellular wireless modem, the user equipment can initiate a random access procedure to establish connection and synchronization with the Base Station (BS). Contention-free random access can be done with a two-message sequence, while a contention-based random access procedure can be done with a four-message sequence, where each message or stage is respectively labeled, Msg1, Msg2, Msg3, and Msg4.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an overview diagram of 5G random access contention resolution procedures. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates message flows of 5G random access contention resolution procedures.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">There are at least two types of random access (RA): contention-free random access and contention-based random access. In a contention-free random access procedure, the preamble index, which determines the preamble sequence, can be pre-assigned by the base station to the user equipment (UE). Hence it can be guaranteed that there are no conflicts with the surrounding UEs, and the user equipment can be guaranteed the resource at the base station. In this approach, the user equipment can simply send Msg1 and Msg2 to complete the random access procedure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In contention-based random access, the preamble Index may not be pre-allocated. Thus, the user equipment may perform logic to select a random access preamble index (RAPID). In this case, the random access procedures may require four messages to complete the random access procedure: Msg1, Msg2, Msg3, and Msg4.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Msg1 may be communicated over PRACH and may include an RA radio network temporary identifier (RA-RNTI) and a RAPID. Msg2 may be communicated over physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH), may be a random access response (RAR), and may include a RAPID matching the RAPID from Msg1. Msg3 may be communicated over PDSCH and may include CCCH or DCCH/DTCH and may also include a C-RNTI MAC CE. Msg4 may be communicated over PDSCH and may include CR MAC CE with a value to match Msg3 or may be communicated over PDCCH, and success may be achieved if C-RNTI can be successfully decoded by the user equipment.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The user equipment can first select the RAPID and then can select a physical random access channel (PRACH) channel with corresponding transmission parameters (for example, slot, symbol, frequency, and carrier), and can then send Msg1 to the base station.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Group X in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a case where the base station may receive multiple user equipment requests with the same PRACH, but with different RAPID. In the cases illustrated by Group X, there may be no conflict among user equipment. As a result, the base station can include the RAPID and uplink (UL) grant into Msg2, which is a random access response message for each different user equipment with different RAPID. Then each user equipment that decodes the physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) with a RA-RNTI (corresponding to the PRACH transmission parameters) would continue to decode the RAR and look for the matching RAPID for further random access steps.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Group Y in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a case where the base station may receive multiple access Msg1 messages on the same PRACH with the exact same RAPID. Each user equipment in such a case is now in conflict with the other UEs that have the same RAPID. However, the UEs do not know about this conflict, and consequently, each user equipment may continue by sending its own Msg3 on a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH), with the given UL grant in Msg2 under the same RAPID.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In order to resolve this contention, the base station can select a winning user equipment and can send contention resolution information in Msg4. This can be in the form of a contention resolution medium access control (MAC) control element (CE) or encoding the PDCCH with the cell radio network temporary identifier (C-RNTI) that the winning user equipment sent.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the user equipment receives Msg4, there may be two different cases, as illustrated more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For a common control channel (CCCH) message trigger, the user equipment may compare the CR-MAC CE. For a dedicated control channel (DCCH) or dedicated traffic channel (DTCH) message trigger, the user equipment may determine if the PDCCH decode is successful with the user equipment's own C-RNTI. Under either option, the processing of Msg4 can conclude the random access procedure, the user equipment can declare random access success, and can continue normal data sending/receiving.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A challenge in 5G UL MAC contention-based random access transmission is in the complexity, long delay, and inefficiency of the message procedure to resolve the contention.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The contention-resolution logic can be spread across different layers and functions for CCCH-based and DCCH/DTCH-based random access, where the former may require matching of CCCH contents, which is the responsibility of the MAC layer, while the latter may require the successful decode of PDCCH corresponding to a present RNTI, which is typically done by the physical (PHY) layer.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Such approaches may require complex random access logic that spans multiple layers of involvement including radio resource control (RRC), MAC, and PHY layers. The contention-resolution logic may be inconsistent between CCCH-based and DCCH/DTCH based random access, where the former may require inefficient matching of CCCH contents, while the latter may require the successful decoding of PDCCH, which may be done by separate functions such as the PHY layer. There can also be inefficient resource usage in the user equipment, such as requiring the user equipment to use four messages for random access contention resolution.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">These complexities and inefficiencies may also lead to further issues. For example, there may be increased power usage in the user equipment, causing interference in the network. There may also be delayed random access success results. Furthermore, there may be delayed random access failure results, which may result in wastage of time and memory space. Furthermore, there may be a slower response to random access, delaying connection setup and handoff establishment.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For low latency applications such as ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), a minimum delay fast scheduling scheme is required, which needs to be able to adapt to different traffic types.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In certain embodiments of the present disclosure, a 5G UL MAC layer method is provided, which may optimize random access contention resolution to enhance low latency applications such as ultra-reliable low-latency communication.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A method of certain embodiments of the present disclosure may complete the contention resolution with two messages and may also streamline the contention resolution method to be performed at one entity.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Certain embodiments may include any of the following aspects. The user equipment may send a trigger message and unique identifier in Msg1. The base station may then acknowledge the user equipment in Msg2 using the user equipment's unique identifier. Thus, in certain embodiments of the present disclosure, contention resolution can be accomplished with only two messages: Msg1 and Msg2.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">More particularly, with respect to sending the trigger message and a unique identifier in Msg1, the user equipment can trigger a contention-based random access procedure by including a trigger message and a unique identifier in Msg1, the first message in the access attempt. In order for the base station to acknowledge the user equipment in Msg2 with the user equipment's unique identifier, given multiple user equipment access attempts with the same PRACH and preamble index, the base station can select a winning user equipment and can then use the unique identifier to acknowledge the user equipment in Msg2.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus, in certain embodiments of the present disclosure, the contention can be resolved with only two messages: Msg1 and Msg2.

Hence it needs to randomly select a Preamble Index (RAPID) from a pool of common resources within the cell it is attached. This RAPID determines the preamble sequence the user equipment transmits in the Msg1 access channel message to start the Random Access procedure.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The base station may receive many such PRACH access channel requests from multiple UEs. Within the same PRACH, several UEs may use different PRACH PreambleID (RAPID) (Group X); hence there is no conflict. However, some UEs may select and use the same RAPID, which is in conflict with the current user equipment (Group Y). The base station then has to choose one user equipment for this PRACH and PreambleID (RAPID). Such contention-based random access requires a contention resolution scheme in order to allocate the resource to one winning user equipment access request.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In order to expedite the random access procedure for contention-based random access, in certain embodiments of the present disclosure, the Msg1 of the contention-based random access can include the trigger message (for example, CCCH/DCCH/DTCH message or data), as well as a unique identifier: a hash identifier (HashID) can be included in a RACH MAC CE, if CCCH message, or a C-RNTI can be included in a C-RNTI MAC CE if DCCH/DTCH message. The HashID can be generated from a 24-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) of the CCCH message, using a hash function.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">If the base station accepts this user equipment and allocates resources to it, the base station can send the unique identifier back in Msg2 to acknowledge the user equipment immediately, instead of two additional messages exchange of Msg3 and Msg4 in other approaches.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Thus, the winning user equipment may only require Msg1 and Msg2 to resolve a contention-based random access and declare success quickly, enhancing random access performance in a way that may be particularly beneficial for low latency applications, such as URLLC applications.

For example, in an RRC connection setup, if an RRCSetupRequest message was sent in Msg1, then an RRCSetup message may be sent in Msg2.
