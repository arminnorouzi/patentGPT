BACKGROUND</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As the mainstream technology of flat panel display, high economic benefits have been achieved in TFT-LCD production, but meanwhile, a large amount of high-concentration polymer organic waste liquid has been produced. Therefore, environmental protection should be considered while achieving good economic benefits, so this part of production waste water must be treated considering its water quality characteristics.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the organic waste liquid of TFT-LCD, there are many organic solvents that can be recycled, such as n-methylpyrrolidone (NMF), 2-(2-n-butoxyethoxy) ethanol (BDG), 1-amino-2-hydroxyethane, monoethanolamine (MEA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 1-Methoxy-2-propyl acetate (PGMEA), Tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH), etc., all of which have high economic recovery value.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In TFT-LCD organic waste liquid treatment technology, adsorption is a common treatment method, and activated carbon particles are commonly used as adsorbents. However, in the prior art, when activated carbon particles are used for adsorption, activated carbon is concentrated into filter bags or filter tubes. When adsorption is saturated, the activated carbon filter bags and filter tubes need to be manually replaced. In order to further recycle the organic solvent in the organic waste liquid of TFT-LCD, the saturated activated carbon bags should be treated. In the prior art, after the activated carbon adsorption is saturated or nearly saturated, the production efficiency of the saturated or nearly saturated activated carbon replacement and organic separation process is low, and there is human intervention, and some toxic and harmful organic waste liquid may be harmful to human body.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The objective of the disclosure is to provide a system and method for regulating and absorbing TFT-LCD organic solvent waste liquid in countercurrent.
