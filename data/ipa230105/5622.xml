The likelihood of their participation in those danger-prone behaviors and activities has been found to relate at least partially to their perception of various risks that they face in their daily lives. Further, those perceptions of the risks that they face in their lives are shaped by their own cultural and social environments and interactions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, it has been found that when approaching emerging adults with respect to HIV-risk behaviors and perceptions, even with the best of incentives, emerging adults in certain urban populations were not testing for HIV and did not perceive communicable disease as a concern, and did not consider themselves at risk of contracting a communicable disease. It has been found that an individual's perception of these and other risks shapes that individuals' activities, and in fact perceptions about certain risks may tend to induce high-risk behaviors in certain individuals. For instance, it has been found that youth and emerging adults' perception of health risk or severity is attenuated by what they perceive as more imminent and immediate risks, such as matters of personal safety, danger, and perceived survival expectations. As a result, the individual's perceived risk hierarchy can influence the individual's likelihood of engaging in negative behaviors, such as: (1) indifference to sexually transmitted infections (STI), HIV and HCV prevention screening that have been made significantly more convenient and accessible compared to traditional testing and screening modalities; (2) a low perception of STI, HIV and HCV risk despite engagement in high-risk behaviors, and (3) knowingly engaging in these behaviors despite knowledge of perils and potential detrimental outcomes. Additionally, it has been found that the individual's survival expectations are linked to a range of authentic concerns (e.g., internalized symptoms such as depression, anxiety, fear, and hopelessness) and externalizing behaviors, such as aggression. The inventors herein have found that certain populations live each day on high alert for perceived threats and are in a constant state of mobilizing for fight, flight, or suspense as they anticipate the next assault, such that it becomes less likely for them to concentrate, learn, recall, do well in school, consider employment, perceive a future orientation, and delay immediate gratification. As a result, they are more likely to absorb and trivialize health and other risks that are otherwise real and can have deleterious impact. However, intervention by health and other professionals may likewise modify the individual's perceptions regarding risk, and in turn modify their behavior to move away from high risk behaviors. Nonetheless, given the difficulty in reaching large numbers of at-risk populations, there is only limited success in achieving behavior modification in this way.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As an individual's perceived risk hierarchy may impact the likelihood that they will engage in certain dangerous behaviors, and as intervention tools do exist (such as counseling, education, etc.) that can help to adjust the individual's perceptions of the risks they face in daily life, it would be advantageous to provide systems and methods by which data may be collected from larger portions of at-risk populations to evaluate their perceived risk hierarchy, and by which intervention tools may be automatically suggested for use by intervention service providers (e.g., counselors, medical professionals, etc.) and their successes tracked in order to reduce the likelihood that such individuals will engage in the negative activities.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Disclosed herein is a system and method for predictive risk assessment and intervention that avoids one or more disadvantages of the prior art. A system is described herein having a computer-implemented predictive risk assessment unit that receives survey data from a remotely connected survey device. The survey data comprises information about the social and cultural environment of one or more members of a risk population to create a digital perceived risk hierarchy inventory for each surveyed population member, which may include data such as the member's perceptions of their social and environmental factors (e.g., police contact, community violence, experience with substance abuse, exposure to sexually transmitted diseases, etc.), the member's demographic data (e.g., age, gender, education level, etc.), and publicly available data associated with the member's geographic environment (e.g., local homelessness, drug treatment, arrests, etc.). The digital perceived risk hierarchy is transmitted from the remote survey device to the predictive risk assessment unit, where a risk determination engine analyzes each such perceived risk hierarchy inventory to generate a risk portfolio for each surveyed member of the population, which risk portfolio may include a risk predictive quotient profile for each such member assigning a numeric value indicating a likelihood of that member engaging in certain negative activities, a recommendation of interventions that are determined to reduce the likelihood of such member engaging in those negative activities, and preferably a record of success and/or failure of various interventions in reducing that risk. At least a portion of the risk portfolio (including at least the recommendation of interventions) is then transmitted from the predictive risk assessment unit to one or more intervention partners who administer the interventions to the surveyed members, record the success or failure of such intervention in preventing the identified dangerous behavior, and transmit an intervention effectiveness report to the predictive risk assessment unit. The predictive risk assessment unit may then modify and recalibrate the survey instrument (and particularly weights assigned to various elements of the digital perceived risk hierarchy inventory) and the associated recommended intervention products and tools using various analytical methods to maximize the successes of interventions, particularly as evidenced in further intervention effectiveness reports received form intervention partners.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Systems and methods configured in accordance with certain aspects of the invention provide a snapshot of the cultural and social environment of the member of the risk population, and provide an insight into the future possibility of that population member engaging in at-risk behaviors or activities. Thus, such systems and methods may provide strong indications of where intervention planning can be employed to mitigate such behaviors. Likewise, the results of actual interventions may suggest whether refinement of the survey or the analytic methods performed by the predictive risk assessment unit is necessary or warranted.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with certain aspects of an embodiment of the invention, a computer method is disclosed for predictive risk assessment and intervention, comprising the steps of: providing a predictive risk assessment unit having a processor and a memory; providing a survey device in data communication with the predictive risk assessment unit; receiving at the predictive risk assessment unit from the survey device a digital perceived risk hierarchy inventory associated with a human risk population member; analyzing at the processor of the predictive risk assessment unit the digital perceived risk hierarchy inventory to identify one or more intervention products that are calculated to mitigate one or more negative or harmful behaviors associated with the perceived risk hierarchy inventory; and storing in the memory an individual risk portfolio associated with the human risk population member, the individual risk portfolio including the one or more intervention products.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with further aspects of an embodiment of the invention, a computer system is disclosed for predictive assessment and intervention, comprising: a predictive risk assessment unit having a processor and a memory; and a survey device in data communication with the predictive risk assessment unit; wherein the processor of the predictive risk assessment unit includes computer instructions configured to: receive from the survey device a digital perceived risk hierarchy inventory associated with a human risk population member; analyze the digital perceived risk hierarchy inventory to identify one or more intervention products that are calculated to mitigate one or more negative or harmful behaviors associated with the perceived risk hierarchy inventory; and store in the memory an individual risk portfolio associated with the human risk population member, the individual risk portfolio including the one or more intervention products.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Still other aspects, features and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention.

The systems and methods employed herein are based upon a finding that emerging adults prioritize risk within their own framework for survival and success. The priority risk should be acknowledged, addressed, and satisfied so that the emerging adults can proceed to practice prevention, observe proper practices and behaviors, focus on positive short and long term goals, increase academic performance and attain educational goals, as well as maintain a positive orientation going forward. As disclosed in greater detail below, the perceived risk hierarchy inventory of a surveyed emerging adult member of the risk population is analyzed at a predictive risk assessment unit to develop a behavior risk profile and assessment and, based upon such behavior risk profile and assessment, automatically assign recommended intervention products that are determined to reduce the member's risk of engaging in harmful behavior. Such recommended intervention products (and preferably other elements of the risk population member's behavior risk profile and assessment) are transmitted to at least one intervention partner (e.g., educational institutions, community centers, hospitals, counselors, physician's offices, etc.) to allow that partner to use and track the success of intervention measures, and transmit back to the predictive risk assessment unit an intervention effectiveness report which may be used to further refine the automated analytical tools used to evaluate the member's risk of engaging in harmful behavior.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exemplary schematic representation of a system for predictive risk assessment and intervention (shown generally at <b>100</b>) including a predictive risk assessment unit <b>110</b>, one or more computer implemented remote survey devices <b>150</b> in remote data communication with predictive risk assessment unit <b>110</b>, and one or more intervention partner computers <b>180</b> in data communication with predictive risk assessment unit <b>110</b>.

The weighted values of the risk population member's risk predictive quotient matrix <b>156</b> may then be run through a combination or menu of statistical tests and/or a Bayesian or comparable mathematical methods (which statistical methods are well known to those skilled in the art) applied by risk determination engine <b>118</b> to single out the greatest areas of risk and those interrelationships that would benefit from intervention, such as through application of intervention products and tools <b>119</b>.
