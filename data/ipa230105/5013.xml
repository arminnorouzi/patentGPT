Thus, a media asset includes television programming or advertisements, radio programming or advertisements, movies, web sites, streaming media, etc. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;credit&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;crediting&#x201d; is defined as assigning exposure measurements (e.g., numbers of audience members that have been exposed to the media for a predefined period of time) and/or consumption measurements to a media source, such as a media service, an advertisement service, a particular media asset (e.g., a program, show, commercial, etc.), etc.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some examples, watermarking is used to identify media (e.g., a media asset) such as television broadcasts, radio broadcasts, advertisements (television and/or radio), downloaded media, streaming media, prepackaged media, etc., for crediting. Existing watermarking techniques identify media assets by embedding one or more codes (e.g., one or more watermarks), such as media identifying information and/or an identifier that may be mapped to media identifying information, into an audio and/or video component of the media asset. In some examples, the watermark is embedded in the audio and/or video component so that the watermark is hidden.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;code&#x201d; or &#x201c;watermark&#x201d; are used interchangeably and are defined to mean any identification information (e.g., an identifier) that may be inserted or embedded in the audio and/or video of media assets (e.g., a program or advertisement) for the purpose of identifying the media assets and/or for another purpose such as tuning (e.g., a packet identifying header). A watermark identifier (ID) may be any type of numerical value assigned by media entity, a media source, etc.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some examples, to identify watermarked media, the watermark(s) are extracted and used to access a table of reference watermarks that are mapped to media identifying information. In some examples, media monitoring companies provide watermarks and watermarking devices to media providers with which to encode their media source feeds. In some examples, if a media provider provides multiple media source feeds (e.g., ESPN and ESPN 2, etc.), a media provider can provide a different watermark for each media source feed. In some examples, a media provider could encode a media source feed with an incorrect watermark (e.g., a watermark meant for ESPN could accidentally be encoded on ESPN2, etc.). In such an example, crediting using only watermarking could result in the wrong media source feed being credited.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some examples, signature matching is used to identify media assets. Unlike media monitoring techniques based on codes and/or watermarks included with and/or embedded in the monitored media, fingerprint or signature-based media monitoring techniques generally use one or more inherent characteristics of a monitored media asset during a monitoring time interval to generate a substantially unique proxy for the media asset. Such a proxy is referred to as a signature or fingerprint, and can take any form (e.g., a series of digital values, a waveform, etc.) representative of any aspect(s) of the media signal(s) (e.g., the audio and/or video signals forming the media presentation being monitored). A signature may be a series of signatures collected in series over a time interval. Accordingly, the terms &#x201c;fingerprint&#x201d; and &#x201c;signature&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein and are defined herein to mean a proxy for identifying a media asset that is generated from one or more inherent characteristics of the media.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Signature-based media monitoring generally involves determining (e.g., generating and/or collecting) signature(s) representative of a media signal (e.g., an audio signal and/or a video signal) output by a monitored media device and comparing the monitored signature(s) to one or more references signatures corresponding to known (e.g., reference) media source feeds. Various comparison criteria, such as a cross-correlation value, a Hamming distance, etc., can be evaluated to determine whether a monitored signature matches a particular reference signature. When a match between the monitored signature and a reference signature is found, the monitored media asset can be identified as corresponding to the particular reference media asset represented by the reference signature that matched with the monitored signature. Example systems for identifying media assets based on codes and/or signatures are long known and were first disclosed in Thomas, U.S. Pat. No. 5,481,294, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. As used herein, a signature, a fingerprint, a code, and/or a watermark that has been obtained, generated, processed, and/or more generally, monitored by a meter and/or any type of media monitoring device is referred to as a monitored media resource. As used herein, a reference signature, a reference fingerprint, a reference code, and/or a reference watermark that has been generated at a back office, at a media monitoring site (MMS), and/or at a facility that &#x201c;knows&#x201d; the media asset is referred to as a reference media resource.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some examples, time triggers are used to enable matching between monitored media resources (e.g., monitored signatures, monitored watermarks, etc.) and reference media resources (e.g., reference signatures, reference watermarks, etc.). For example, meters that monitor media assets presented to panelists may be configured to send monitored media resources (e.g., monitored signatures, monitored watermarks, etc.) to a central facility at specific time periods. Also, in some examples, a reference site (e.g., associated with a media monitoring company) may be configured to send reference media resources corresponding to known media assets to the central facility at specific time periods to enable identification of the monitored media resources. Examples of such specific time periods include, but are not limited to, every thirtieth minute of the hour, every fifteenth minute of the hour, every 10 minute of the hour, etc.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some examples, the time triggers enable live matching and/or live mapping between monitored media resources and reference media resources. Live matching includes matching monitored media resources (e.g., monitored signatures) to reference media resources (e.g., reference signatures) for identifying a media asset that is broadcasted/streamed in real time. Live mapping includes mapping reference media resources (e.g., reference watermarks) to known information (e.g., channel, title, time, etc.) as they are live streaming. In some examples, live matching and/or live mapping is accurate (e.g., the matching and/or mapping produces desirable results) when a reference site generates reference media resources at the time reference media assets are broadcasted by respective media sources. For example, a meter sends monitored media resources to a back office (e.g., the central facility) every 10 minutes corresponding to a live broadcasting of a particular media asset. In such an example, a reference site that monitors the media source broadcasting the same media asset, sends known reference media resources to the back office every 10 minutes for the back office to utilize when performing live matching and/or live mapping.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">To generate reference media resources, reference sites obtain information from the media sources to be monitored. Such information includes program titles, intended time of airing, channel information, etc. In some examples, the reference sites utilize this information to determine when to collect and/or generate reference media resources, when to send reference media resources to the central facility, etc. In some examples, reference sites may be delayed in sending reference media resources to the central facility. For example, errors may occur at reference sites, such as network access to the central facility being down, a clock at the reference site being offset from a correct time, etc. In such examples, live matching and/or live mapping becomes less accurate due to the unavailability of and/or lack of reference media resources.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some examples, a reference site can be used by the central facility for detecting watermarks. For example, the reference site may decode watermarks from media as the media undergoes live airing/streaming. Then, the reference site may map the decoded watermarks to a channel that the reference site knows the watermark came from and timestamp the watermark with extra information, such as a title, a distribution source ID, etc. The example reference site may load the central facility with the decoded reference watermarks, which can then be used in case a meter did not have enough information from a monitored watermark to actually identify who broadcasted and encoded the watermark in the channel. In some examples, a watermark may not contain enough information to identify the media source encoding the watermark in the media asset due to syndication. For example, syndication is the sale or licensing of media for broadcasting by a number of media sources. Therefore, some watermarks may not identify an original distributor (e.g., the media source that actually broadcasted the media) and instead, only include a source identifier (e.g., corresponding to a final distributor of the media). In such examples, the central facility can utilize the reference watermark to identify the original distributor. In examples where the reference site fails to map reference watermarks to media identifying data (e.g., the original distributor, etc.), the central facility may obtain a number of monitored watermarks that cannot be further identified for additional media identifying information.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture disclosed herein determine when to execute a crediting process to credit media. Examples disclosed herein do not follow a time-based trigger to begin crediting monitored media resources. Instead, examples disclosed herein generate a list of monitored media resources and determine whether a threshold amount of reference media resources are available to use for crediting. In some examples disclosed herein, if the threshold amount of reference media resources are not available, examples disclosed herein do not process the monitored media resources but, instead, generate a report including a number of reference media resources that were missing at the time the monitored media resources were sent. In some examples, a number of monitored media resources and corresponding timestamps are used to determine whether reference media resources are available for those corresponding timestamps. For example, if the central facility cannot identify matching timestamps between the reference media resources and the monitored media resources for a threshold amount of the monitored media resources, examples disclosed herein do not execute the crediting process. As such, examples disclosed herein can increase the accuracy and quality of identifying media assets in monitored media resources by delaying execution of the crediting process until a threshold amount of reference data is available.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example system <b>100</b> to credit media consumption.

The example media environment <b>102</b> includes media devices to present media to the panelist and media monitoring devices (also referred to as monitoring devices, media meters, device meters, meters, etc.) to collect the media presented to the panelist. In some examples, the media devices are consumer electronics. For example, one of the devices may be a personal computer such as a laptop computer, and thus, is capable of directly presenting media (e.g., via an integrated and/or connected display and speakers). Additionally and/or alternatively, any other type(s) and/or number(s) of device(s) may additionally or alternatively be used. For example, Internet-enabled mobile handsets (e.g., a smartphone, an iPod&#xae;, etc.), video game consoles (e.g., Xbox&#xae;, PlayStation 3, etc.), tablet computers (e.g., an iPad&#xae;, a Motorola&#x2122; Xoom&#x2122;, etc.), digital media players (e.g., a Roku&#xae; media player, a Slingbox&#xae;, a Tivo&#xae;, etc.), smart televisions, desktop computers, laptop computers, servers, IoT devices, watches (e.g., smartwatches), fitness trackers, headsets, vehicle control units (e.g., an engine control unit, an electronic control unit, etc.), edge devices, etc. may additionally or alternatively be used. In some examples, the media monitoring devices are meters used to monitor exposure to media by collecting monitored media resources (e.g., monitored media signatures, monitored media watermarks, etc.) representative of the presented media. In examples disclosed herein, exposure of media corresponds to media consumption. The monitored media resources are transmitted by a media monitoring device to the example central facility <b>110</b> via the example network device <b>106</b>.

In some examples, the reference site <b>108</b> is a Media Monitoring Site (MMS) located at a media market. An MMS may generate, collect, and/or process data from a variety of media providers and/or media sources within a physical range of the site. For example, an MMS located in Chicago, Ill. may generate reference signatures and/or decode and map reference watermarks by collecting network traffic occurring between a device at the media environment <b>102</b> and a broadcast station or Internet Service Provider (ISP) located in Chicago, Ill. In some examples, the reference site <b>108</b> may be implemented by the central facility <b>110</b>.

The example meter data controller <b>202</b> obtains monitored media resources from the example media environment <b>102</b> via the network <b>106</b>. In some examples, the meter data controller <b>202</b> obtains monitored media resources in intervals of time and/or at specific times of a day. The example meter data controller <b>202</b> is coupled to or otherwise communicates with an example data store <b>206</b> to store (e.g., cache) monitored media resources as they are obtained from the example media environment <b>102</b>. In some examples, the meter data controller <b>202</b> stores monitored media resources with corresponding timestamps to use for subsequent processing. For example, a meter of the media environment <b>102</b> may provide monitored watermark identifiers (IDs) with a timestamp corresponding to the time of collection (e.g., a time of access by and/or presentation of and/or exposure to the media). As used herein, the timestamp stored with the monitored media resources and reference media resources is referred to herein as a collection timestamp. In some examples, the timestamp included in monitored media resources and reference media resources is referred to herein as an embedded timestamp. Embedded timestamps can be extracted from the monitored media resources to use during the crediting process and is indicative of a position in the monitored media asset that is represented by the ID included in the monitored media resource. The collection timestamps of monitored media resources can be used to determine a duration of exposure. As used herein, a duration of exposure corresponds to a period of time that a panelist member is and/or was exposed to the media corresponding to the monitored media resource. For example, if five monitored media resources having time stamps of 9:00, 9:01, 9:02, 9:03, and 9:04, were obtained by the meter and were associated with the same media source (e.g., channel A), the meter data controller <b>202</b> determines that the media source has a duration of exposure corresponding to four minutes. In some examples, the meter of the media environment <b>102</b> may provide the duration of exposure for each media source viewed in the period of time that the meter monitored the media devices. In such an example, the meter data controller <b>202</b> can determine a total duration of exposure based on each duration provided for the different media sources. For example, the meter data controller <b>202</b> obtains five monitored media resources corresponding to channel A and four minutes of exposure, obtains fifteen monitored media resources corresponding to a channel B and 15 minutes of exposure, and obtains 11 monitored media resources corresponding to a channel C and 11 minutes of exposure. The example meter data controller <b>202</b> determines that the total duration of exposure is 30 minutes based on the durations associated with the monitored media resources.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some examples, the meter data controller <b>202</b> generates and/or compiles a list of monitored media resources and their corresponding durations.

In some examples, the meter data controller <b>202</b> stores such a list, table, array, etc., in the data store <b>206</b>. The example list of information describing the monitored media resources is described in further detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The example meter data controller <b>202</b> generates a chart that maps the durations of the monitored media resources to percentages of total exposure. For example, the meter data controller <b>202</b> generates a Pareto chart with the list of monitored media resources and exposure durations. Additionally and/or alternatively, the example meter data controller <b>202</b> generates a graph, a diagram, a plot, and/or any type of statistical data structure describing the percentages of total exposure of the monitored media resources. A Pareto chart is a type of chart that contains both bars and a line graph, where individual values (e.g., monitored media resource values) are represented in descending order by bars, and a cumulative total (e.g., the total duration of exposure) is represented by the line. The example meter data controller <b>202</b> can utilize any graphing algorithms and/or any statistical algorithms to generate the chart that maps the durations of the monitored media resources to percentages of total exposure.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an example list <b>300</b> of monitored media resources identifiers and corresponding durations of exposure.

The example meter data controller <b>202</b> stores the example list <b>300</b> in the data store <b>206</b> to be accessible by the example source ID mapping controller <b>208</b>, the example reference data controller <b>204</b>, the example crediting controller <b>212</b>, and the example report generation controller <b>214</b>. The example list <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> includes a first column of data <b>302</b> and a second column of data <b>304</b>. The example first column of data <b>302</b> illustrates monitored media resource identifiers of the monitored media resources. The monitored media resource identifiers of the monitored media resources are numerical values representative of media sources. For example, a first row <b>306</b> includes monitored media resource ID <b>1010</b>, which may be representative of channel A and a second row <b>308</b> includes monitored media resource ID <b>2015</b>, which may be representative of channel B. In some examples, each monitored media resource ID has a corresponding source identifier. As used herein, a &#x201c;source identifier&#x201d; is an identifier distributed to a media provider and/or media source for identifying the media provider and/or media source. In some examples, the source identifier is different than the monitored media resource identifier.

In some examples, the meter data controller <b>202</b> calculates the threshold percent based on summing the exposure durations to determine the total exposure duration of the monitored media resources, then determining a percentage of that total exposure that corresponds to the threshold. In some examples, the meter data controller <b>202</b> determines which monitored media resources make up the threshold percentage of total exposure based on the chart. Although the example list <b>300</b> illustrates monitored media resources sorted based on durations, the example list <b>300</b> may illustrate the monitored media resources in any type of way (e.g., based on the values of the monitored media resource ID, based on the time at which they were collected, etc.).

For example, the meter data controller <b>202</b> may process decoded watermarks. As such, the decoded watermarks may include identifiers (e.g., included in a header of the payload of the watermark, etc.) that can be mapped to source identifiers which are indicative of a media source. In some examples, the monitored media resource identifiers are source identifiers and are to be mapped to media identifying information corresponding to the source identifier. In some examples, the meter data controller <b>202</b> utilizes the source identifiers to search the data store <b>206</b> for similar source identifiers of reference media resources. In some examples, the reference media resources are decoded watermarks having source identifiers that are mapped to a number of media identifying information, such as original distribution identifiers, channel information, media asset titles, etc. As such, the meter data controller <b>202</b> can determine, based on the source identifiers of the monitored media resources, whether reference media resources are available for a threshold percentage of the total exposure duration. In some examples, the meter data controller <b>202</b> may skip mapping the monitored media resource IDs to source identifiers.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some examples, the meter data controller <b>202</b> implements means for determining, means for identifying media, means for mapping, means for controlling meter data, and/or meter data controlling means.
