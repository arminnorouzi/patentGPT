Method</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an embodiment of a method <b>100</b> for providing electrical stimulation to a brain region of a user comprises: providing a set of tasks to the user within a time window S<b>110</b>; providing an electrical stimulation treatment to the brain region of the user in association with the time window S<b>120</b>; as the user performs each task of the set of tasks: at a biosignal detection module, receiving a signal stream characterizing a neurological state of the user S<b>130</b>; from the signal stream, identifying a neurological signature characterizing the neurological state S<b>140</b> associated with the task of the set of tasks; and modulating the electrical stimulation treatment to the user based upon the neurological signature S<b>160</b>, wherein an aggregated parameter of the electrical stimulation treatment provided to the user during the time window does not exceed a maximum limit. The method <b>100</b> can additionally comprise: generating a comparison between a neurological metric derived from the neurological signature and a condition S<b>150</b> for each task in the set of tasks; providing the set of tasks to the user in a modified sequence, based upon at least one neurological signature S<b>170</b> identified in Block S<b>150</b>; and providing a task-bounding stimulus to the user S<b>180</b> configured to facilitate consolidation of learned information and/or behavior.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some variations, the method <b>100</b> can substantially omit Block S<b>130</b>, such that modulation of the electrical stimulation treatment in Block S<b>160</b> is based upon a portion of a task of the set of tasks, or the user's performance of a portion of a task of the set of tasks, without consideration of a neurological state of the user detected by a biosignal detection module. Furthermore, in some variations, the method <b>100</b> can substantially omit modulating the electrical stimulation treatment according to a maximum limit constraint, such that modulation is based solely upon a stage of a task and/or a neurological state of the user, without a maximum limit constraint. In still other variations, as described in Section 1.2 below, the method <b>100</b> can entirely omit provision of electrical stimulation to the user relative to a set of provided tasks, such that provision and/or modulation of an electrical stimulation treatment is primarily based upon a detected neurological state of the user.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The method <b>100</b> functions to strategically control provision of an electrical stimulation treatment delivered to a user as the user performs a set of tasks, wherein the electrical stimulation treatment is provided within specified treatment limits (e.g., for safety, in consideration of maximizing efficacy of the electrical stimulation treatment, etc.). However, the method <b>100</b> can additionally or alternatively function to increase an effect of an electrical stimulation treatment provided to the user by modulating the treatment according to a specific stage of a task and/or a neurological state of the user, without a maximum limit constraint. The method <b>100</b> can further optimize provision of a limited amount of electrical stimulation to the user, such that the user only receives electrical stimulation when an actual or anticipated neurological state of the user could be improved by receipt of electrical stimulation. In some variations, the method can be used to rehabilitate users diagnosed with neurological pathologies and/or users with neurological conditions that can be improved or treated by electrical stimulation. As such, the method <b>100</b> can be used to facilitate management of the user's neurological condition by reversing damage resulting from the neurological condition, halting damage resulting from the neurological condition, and/or by enabling the user to cope with the neurological condition. In other variations, the method <b>100</b> can be used to improve a neurological state of a user as the user performs a task of interest, in order to enhance cognitive ability (e.g., mathematical ability), learning (e.g., language learning, speech learning), memory (e.g., working memory, declarative memory), motor ability (e.g., dexterity, coordination), focus, attention, and/or creativity. Thus, the user can be someone who is diagnosed or undiagnosed with a neurological condition.

Additionally, the set of tasks is preferably configured to enhance neural plasticity; as such, the set of tasks can comprise games inducing a high level of emotional involvement (e.g., interpersonal emotional content, intrapersonal emotional content), which can enhance neural plasticity. In some variations, the set of tasks can be configured to enhance training for mental activities (e.g., test preparation) and/or physical activities (e.g., athletic activities). In other variations, the set of tasks can be configured to facilitate cognitive therapy or other psychotherapy.

The stage(s) can be one or more delivered stage(s) (e.g., if a task is being deterministically delivered by a computing module or a trainer), and/or can be one or more stage(s) governed by the user (e.g., if a task is done at the user's leisure). As such, the set of tasks can comprise multiple tasks, each with multiple stages of activity or a single stage of activity, or can alternatively comprise a single task with multiple stages of activity or a single stage of activity.

The set of tasks can, however, include any other suitable games or tasks. For instance, in some variations, the set of tasks can include tasks that the user performs regularly (e.g., daily, weekly), within his or her natural environment, such that the method <b>100</b> can facilitate tracking of progress in the user's performance of regularly encountered tasks.

In one example, the set of tasks can be presented through an application executing on a tablet device of the user, wherein the sensors of the tablet device are used to detect performance of the set of tasks by the user. In the example, a touch screen of the tablet device can be used to detect performance of finger stroking in a task configured to rehabilitate a stroke-affected hand of a user, an accelerometer of the tablet device can be used to sense vibration indicative of finger tapping in a task configured to rehabilitate the stroke-affected hand of the user, and a camera of the tablet device can be used to capture physical movement of objects performed by the user with a stroke-affected hand. In the example, feedback can additionally be provided using audio, visual, and/or haptic modules of the tablet device, in order to indicate successful and/or unsuccessful performance of any task. In relation to a set of tasks including tasks that the user regularly performs in his/her natural environment, one or more sensors of the electronic device can further facilitate automatic detection of performance of a task of the set of tasks.

In one such variation, the electrical stimulation can additionally or alternatively comprise peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), which provides stimulation of the peripheral nerves of an extremity (e.g., a hand of the user) and can increase neural plasticity. In some applications, PNS and other stimulation treatments can interact synergistically with TES (e.g., tDCS) and potentiate effects of TES stimulation. Similar to the TES treatment, the PNS can be characterized by a set of treatment parameters (e.g., duration, intensity, amplitude, frequency, waveform, modulation, etc). Furthermore, the PNS can be provided using electrodes placed near peripheral nerves of the user at an extremity (e.g., limb, hand, wrist, leg, ankle, etc.) of the user.

However, in some variations, the method <b>100</b> can substantially omit Block S<b>130</b>, such that modulation of the electrical stimulation treatment in Block S<b>160</b> is based solely upon a stage of a task of the set of tasks, or the user's performance of a stage of a task of the set of tasks, without consideration of a neurological state of the user detected by a biosignal detection module. In variations wherein modulation of the electrical stimulation treatment in Block S<b>160</b> is based upon a neurological state of the user detected by a biosignal module, the biosignal module can be an embodiment of the biosignal detection module described in Section 2 below, or can alternatively be any other suitable biosignal detection module. The signal stream received in Block S<b>130</b> preferably comprises bioelectrical signals, including electroencephalograph (EEG) signals, which can be reflective of cognitive and/or mental states of the user.

The set of signals can alternatively comprise a single signal (e.g., from a single channel or as a composite of multiple multiplexed channels), or a plurality of composite signals, each of which is a composite of multiple multiplexed channels. In one example, the set of signals can comprise a channel of multiplexed signals from one region of the user, and another channel of multiplexed signals from another region of the user. The set of signals can also be a compressed, filtered, conditioned, amplified, or otherwise processed version of raw signals from one or more sensors.

For example, signals of the signal stream can be received at one or more time points during the user's performance of each task in the set of tasks (e.g., in sequence with key events during each task in the set of tasks, at time points relative to different stages of a task). Additionally, signals of the signal stream are preferably received substantially in real time, in order to facilitate real time or near-real time identification of neurological signatures, generation of neurological metrics, and/or generation of comparisons between metrics and threshold conditions in Blocks S<b>140</b> and S<b>150</b>, respectively, and/or real time or near-real time stimulation modulation in Block S<b>160</b>.

As such, training data can be used to improve detection and identification of neurological signatures, in order to improve provision and modulation of the electrical stimulation treatment relative to identified neurological signatures.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In variations wherein identifying the neurological signature in Block S<b>140</b> includes generation of a neurological metric, the method <b>100</b> can further include Block S<b>150</b>, which recites: generating a comparison between a neurological metric derived from the neurological signature and a condition for each task in the set of tasks.

The condition in Block S<b>150</b> can indicate that the user should receive a higher degree (e.g., intensity) of electrical stimulation, which would improve the user's neurological state. Additionally or alternatively, the condition in Block S<b>150</b> can indicate that the user should receive a lower degree (e.g., intensity) of electrical stimulation, which would improve the user's neurological state (e.g., plasticity state, emotional state, motor-response state, sensation awareness, etc.).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one variation of Block S<b>150</b>, wherein the user's neurological state of interest is related to neural plasticity, the comparison between the neurological metric and the condition can indicate that the user's attentiveness/engagement during the task has placed him or her in a state of high neural plasticity, thus requiring either a lower level of electrical stimulation (e.g., if the user is already in a state known to produce neural plasticity and therefore does not need additional electrical stimulation) or a higher level of electrical stimulation (e.g., if it is desirable to cause periods of maximal plasticity by delivering electrical stimulation when endogenous plasticity is already high). Conversely, the comparison between the neurological metric and the condition can indicate that the user's attentiveness/engagement during the task has placed him or her in a state of low neural plasticity, thus warranting a higher level of electrical stimulation (e.g., if it is desirable to maintain a constant level of plasticity by delivering more stimulation when endogenous plasticity is low) or a lower level of electrical stimulation (e.g., if it is desirable to cause intermittent periods of minimal plasticity). The condition can additionally or alternatively indicate that modulated stimulation should or should not be provided with a delay relative to a stage of activity of a task associated with a neurological state captured in the neurological metric/signature.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The condition can be identical for all tasks of the set of tasks, or alternatively, each task of the set of tasks can have a corresponding condition that may or may not be identical to a condition for another task of the set of tasks. The condition can be based solely upon a stage of activity of the set of tasks (e.g., a timing relative to a task or a stage of activity of the set of tasks), or can comprise a threshold condition. In variations comprising a comparison to a threshold condition, the threshold condition can involve a threshold value or a threshold range of values, including at least one limiting value (e.g., upper limiting value, lower limiting value). As such, generation of the comparison can be performed in a manner that is inclusive of a limiting value, such that the threshold condition is satisfied even if the neurological metric is substantially equivalent to the limiting value of the threshold range of values. Alternatively, generation of the comparison can be performed in a manner that is exclusive of a limiting value, such the threshold condition is not satisfied if the neurological metric is substantially equivalent to the limiting value of the threshold range of values. The comparison between the threshold condition and the neurological metric can, however, be performed in any other suitable manner.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Block S<b>160</b> recites: modulating the electrical stimulation treatment provided to the user based upon the neurological signature, which functions to increase an effect of the electrical stimulation treatment provided by targeting neurological states/stages of activity of the user wherein the user would receive greater benefit from stimulation or modulation of stimulation. Block S<b>160</b> can additionally function to decrease habituation of the user's brain to the electrical stimulation treatment, by delivering stimulation that has a temporally varying component, for instance, as provided by the set of portions (e.g., active periods, non-active periods) of the electrical stimulation treatment. Furthermore, Block S<b>160</b> can additionally function to facilitate desirable long-term effects, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), and short-term effects, such as neural depolarization, excitation, hyperpolarization, and inhibition, by delivering electrical stimulation that tends to excite populations of neural cells where excitation is desirable, tends to inhibit populations of neural cells where inhibition is desirable, and/or tends not to affect populations of neural cells where neuromodulation is undesirable.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Modulation in Block S<b>160</b> preferably comprises delivering a portion (e.g., active period, non-active period) of the set of portions of the electrical stimulation treatment to the brain region of the user, while maintaining an aggregate amount of the stimulation parameter of the electrical stimulation treatment provided to the user during the time window below a maximum limit. Modulation can, however, omit consideration of maintaining an aggregate amount of the stimulation parameter below a maximum limit, and can additionally or alternatively include maintaining any other suitable value of the stimulation parameter above or below any suitable limit. In some variations, modulating in Block S<b>160</b> can additionally or alternatively comprise increasing a value of a stimulation parameter of the electrical stimulation treatment, decreasing a stimulation parameter, or substantially eliminating stimulation based upon an output of Block S<b>150</b>. In variations, modulation can include increasing excitatory stimulation during specific neurological states/stages of activity identified in Blocks S<b>130</b>-S<b>150</b>, such as periods of greater attention (i.e., in order to potentiate a desirable activity further). In variations, modulation can additionally or alternatively include increasing inhibitory stimulation during specific neurological states/stages of activity identified in Blocks S<b>130</b>-S<b>150</b>, such as periods of greater attention (i.e., in order to inhibit an undesirable activity, such as phobic or craving response). In variations, modulation can additionally or alternatively include decreasing stimulation in order to reserve stimulation for specific neurological states/stages of activity for the user identified in Blocks S<b>130</b>-S<b>150</b>, such as periods of less attention wherein less endogenous plastic activity is occurring.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some variations of Block S<b>160</b>, modulation of the electrical stimulation treatment can comprise modulation of at least one of the current amplitude, the voltage amplitude, the stimulation duration, the duty cycle, the stimulation localization/current path of the electrical stimulation treatment, a waveform of the stimulation (e.g., direct current alone, random noise stimulation, variable frequency stimulation, etc.), an on/off status of the stimulation, a polarity of the stimulation (e.g., anodal, cathodal), and any other suitable stimulation parameter. In any of these variations, modulation can include a minimum and a maximum parameter limit (e.g., a duration of one portion of stimulation will not exceed a certain amount of time regardless of the length of a stage of activity, or a duration of one portion of stimulation will not be less than a certain amount of time even if a portion of activity is terminated early). Furthermore, modulation can comprise maintaining a first subset of stimulation parameters at desired levels, while modulating a second subset of stimulation parameters (e.g., a first waveform could be applied during a first activity stage of a task and a second waveform could be applied during a non-activity stage of a task while maintaining current amplitude constant, or tVFS stimulation could be applied during a first activity stage and tDCS stimulation could be applied prior to and/or after a second activity stage). Additionally, in variations in which multiple forms of stimulation are provided, modulation can additionally or alternatively comprise modulation of ratios of stimulation parameters for different forms of stimulation (e.g., modulation of a ratio between current amplitude for TES and for PNS). The modulation can be performed in real-time, such that the electrical stimulation provided to the user is modulated in real-time during performance of a task of the set of tasks. Thus, in the examples described above, the user can receive more electrical stimulation in real-time during a period of low engagement and neural plasticity while performing a task, and receive less electrical stimulation in real-time during a period of high engagement and neural plasticity while performing a task. Additionally or alternatively, outputs of Block S<b>130</b>-S<b>150</b> can be used to modulate electrical stimulation while the user performs a repeat instance of the task at a later timepoint (e.g., if the set of tasks is provided to the user repeatedly during therapy), such that modulation is based upon earlier comparisons between the user's neurological state and conditions such as threshold conditions for each task in the set of tasks.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The modulation of the electrical stimulation treatment in Block S<b>160</b> can additionally be performed with any suitable timing relative to a stage of activity for each task in the set of tasks. In some variations, providing and/or modulating the electrical stimulation treatment can thus be performed with a certain temporal relationship relative to a task (or stage of activity of a task), and/or a neurological state of the user, based upon an anticipated task (or stage of activity of a task), and/or an anticipated neurological state of the user. As such, provision and/or modulation of the electrical stimulation treatment can be configured to frontload electrical stimulation provided to the user in relation to the set of tasks, backload electrical stimulation provided to the user in relation to the set of tasks, provide stimulation to the user during a task or a stage of activity, provide stimulation to the user prior to a task or a stage of activity, and/or provide stimulation to the user after a task or a stage of activity. Provision of stimulation prior to a task or stage of activity can facilitate future neural changes due to a future execution of a task or activity, and provision of stimulation after a task or a phase of activity can augment consolidation of changes induced by a task or phase of activity. In one example, modulation can include delivering one or more portions of stimulation according to a schedule that front-loads stimulation during a user session of a task/stage of activity to increase a likelihood that a desired amount of stimulation will be provided (e.g., a high minimum duration of stimulation can be provided early in an task and a lower duration of stimulation can be provided later in a task). Furthermore, in this example, modulation can take advantage of &#x201c;priming&#x201d; characteristics of stimulation, wherein stimulation provided early in a task is more effective than stimulation provided later in a task, and stimulation has a holdover effect that affects a subsequent task. In another example, stimulation can be modulated only during periods where the user is actively performing a stage of an activity. In yet another example, provision or modulation of stimulation can occur prior to (e.g., 5 minutes prior to) an anticipated task (or stage of activity of a task) such that the stimulation has a lingering effect (e.g., a 5-10 minute carry-over) on the user's neural plasticity, which would increase the effectiveness of the user's therapy, In yet another example, a portion of stimulation can be provided at substantially an intermediate time point (e.g., middle time point) of a task or stage of activity, and in another example, a first portion of stimulation can be provided prior to onset of a stage of activity and a second portion of stimulation can be provided after completion of the stage of activity.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some variations, multiple forms of electrical stimulation treatment can be temporally synchronized with each other (e.g., simultaneous modulation of both tDCS and PNS provision). In these variations, a first form of electrical stimulation (e.g., tDCS) could facilitate a response by the user to a second form of electrical stimulation (e.g., PNS); furthermore, the second form of electrical stimulation could facilitate a response by the user to the first form of electrical stimulation (e.g., PNS could cause neural cells to fire, increasing a response to tDCS). Additionally or alternatively, in some variations, electrical stimulation treatment can be synchronized with an audio or visual aspect of gameplay in a provided task (e.g., music tempo and/or visual presentation tempo within a provided task can be synchronized with a frequency of a PNS and/or TES parameter to increase treatment effectiveness) in order to enhance neural remapping. In a specific example for a user with tinnitis, audio media can be filtered to eliminate frequencies that are undesirable (i.e., frequencies near a pathologically re-mapped audio frequency, whose cortical representation should not be expanded) for tinnitus treatment.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, in some variations of Block S<b>160</b>, the electrical stimulation treatment can be modulated/synchronized with neurological states aside from plasticity related states. For example, electrical stimulation can be provided and modulated according to EEG oscillations, as observed in theta positive and negative states, which can effectively excite or de-excite neurons and promote or inhibit long-term potentiation (LTP). In still other variations, modulation of the electrical stimulation treatment or synchronization of the electrical stimulation treatment with any other factor can be performed with any suitable offset relative to a corresponding task (or stage of activity) of the set of tasks. For instance, stimulation can be modulated a few seconds prior to provision of a corresponding task to increase effectiveness or a few seconds after a stage of activity is identified in order to increase effectiveness). The offset can function to increase effectiveness of a parameter of stimulation that would otherwise have a negligible effect on the user (e.g., 1 Hz sequence of TMS can be enhanced with delivery of anodal tDCS provided with an offset). Modulation prior to an onset of a stage of activity can be performed based upon a prediction of an onset of a neurological state of the user corresponding to the stage of the activity (e.g., based upon an estimate of a duration to complete a task). Modulation prior to an onset of a stage of activity can additionally or alternatively be performed by explicitly requesting notice from the user prior to performing a task, and/or instructing the user to pause action prior to the task in order to modulate stimulation with a desired time-relationship to the task. The electrical stimulation treatment provided can, however, be modulated or synchronized with respect to any other suitable factor in any other suitable manner.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some applications of the method <b>100</b>, it may be desirable that an aggregated amount of at least one stimulation parameter of the electrical stimulation treatment (e.g., TES) provided during a time window does not exceed a maximum limit, for example, for safety reasons. As such, a maximum limit for an aggregated value of a stimulation parameter as related to Block S<b>160</b> can be any one or more of: a maximum dosage (e.g., duration of stimulation, aggregated charge, aggregated charge density etc.) per day, a maximum dosage per shorter unit of time (e.g., minutes, hours), and any other suitable maximum dosage. In one example, a daily dosage of 30 minutes is an acceptable dosage of tDCS, with higher doses increasing chances of skin irritation for the user and/or other side effects. Furthermore, a remaining allowable stimulation can be tracked in relation to the maximum limit as an accumulated amount of stimulation subtracted from a maximum dosage of stimulation. Here, the accumulated dosage can be increased by additional electrical stimulation, and decreased (e.g., according to a logarithmic decay) when stimulation is not occurring. Thus, maximizing an effect of electrical stimulation treatment given a maximum acceptable limit of treatment can significantly benefit a user's recovery/rehabilitation rate. In variations wherein the electrical stimulation treatment includes TES, the maximum limit is preferably a maximum amount of charge or charge density (e.g., determined based upon current amplitude, duration, duty cycle, and electrode path) that can be delivered to the user per unit time (e.g., the time window). Additionally or alternatively, the electrical stimulation provided within the time window can be transmitted and modulated such that at least a minimum amount of stimulation (i.e., defined as an amount below which stimulation has no effect) is always provided to the user within the time window. For example, a minimum duration and/or duty cycle of tDCS can always be provided to the user within the time window so that the electrical stimulation treatment provided to the user always has a measureable effect on the user's neural plasticity. As such, the method <b>100</b> enables transmission of a limited amount of electrical stimulation treatment to the user in a manner that automatically provides the user with electrical stimulation when the user needs electrical stimulation the most, and in a manner that has a measureable effect on the user's neurological condition. Again, in some variations, the method <b>100</b> can substantially omit modulating the electrical stimulation treatment according to a maximum limit constraint, such that modulation is based solely upon a stage of a task and/or a neurological state of the user, without a maximum limit constraint.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the method <b>100</b> can additionally comprise Block S<b>170</b>, which recites: providing the set of tasks to the user in a modified sequence in a subsequent time window, based upon at least one identified neurological signature S<b>170</b> generated in Block S<b>140</b> and an outcome of modulating the electrical stimulation treatment. Block S<b>170</b> functions to affect distribution of the electrical stimulation treatment provided, based upon the user's detected neurological state for each task in the set of tasks, which can increase the effectiveness of the electrical stimulation treatment provided. In one variation, involving modulation based upon user attentiveness as an indicator of neural plasticity, more &#x201c;interesting&#x201d; tasks can be interleaved with less interesting tasks and provided to the user in this modified sequence, such that the user receives electrical stimulation with cyclic modulations (e.g., modulated upward for the less interesting tasks and modulated downward for the more interesting tasks, modulated upward for 10 minutes and modulated downward for 10 minutes in repeating cycles corresponding to transitions between tasks of the set of tasks), which can increase treatment effectiveness. Furthermore, in this variation, residual effects of electrical stimulation modulated upward during less interesting tasks can carry over to periods in which the user is performing more interesting tasks, to increase effectiveness. In another variation, involving modulation based upon user attentiveness as an indicator of neural plasticity, more &#x201c;interesting&#x201d; tasks can be grouped together and less interesting tasks can be grouped together and provided to the user in this modified sequence, such that the user receives at least one consolidated period of electrical stimulation due to the state-based modulation in Block S<b>160</b>. In other variations, the set of tasks, however, can be provided to the user in any other suitable sequence or configuration based upon at least one identified neurological signature/neurological metric generated in Blocks S<b>140</b>-S<b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the method <b>110</b> can further comprise Block S<b>180</b>, which recites: providing a task-bounding stimulus to the user. Block S<b>180</b> functions to facilitate consolidation of learned information and/or behavior resulting from the user's interactions with the set of tasks and the modulated electrical stimulation treatment. Similar to Block S<b>110</b>, the task-bounding stimulus is preferably provided to the user at an application executing on an electronic device of the user; however, the task-bounding stimulus can be provided in any other suitable manner. In some variations, the task-bounding stimulus can be a visual stimulus, and in other variations, the task-bounding stimulus can be configured to stimulate any other sensory pathway (e.g., auditory pathway, olfactory pathway, tactile sensation pathway, etc.) of the user. In an example, after the set of tasks is provided to the user, the task-bounding stimulus can comprise a video of a similar user repeating a task that the user has just performed, which can stimulate mirror neurons and allow consolidation of information learned from the task that the user has just performed.

Similar to Block S<b>120</b>, Block S<b>190</b> functions to improve a neurological state of the user; however, Block S<b>190</b> can supplement an effect of electrical stimulation provided in Block S<b>120</b> and modulated in Block S<b>160</b> and accelerate neurological remapping in a manner that does not require excess electrical stimulation to be provided to the user. In relation to stroke, which typically affects one side of the body more than the other, virtual constraint therapy can force a stroke patient to use his/her affected limb (or other body portion) by constraining the contralateral, more healthy limb (or other body portion). As such, the virtual constraint therapy preferably includes constraining motion of the user during performance of a task in a beneficial manner (e.g., constraining motion of a contralateral side of a stroke patient, such that the patient is forced to use his/her weaker side during implementation of the method), and can additionally or alternatively comprise any other suitable target of virtual constraint. The virtual constraint therapy provided in Block S<b>190</b> is preferably facilitated with a sensor subsystem configured to detect motion (e.g., absolute motion, relative motion) of one or more body parts of the user, which can be used to provide feedback to the user in discouraging motion of the body part(s) of the user. In variations, the sensor subsystem can include one or more of: an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a compass, a pressure sensor, a global positioning system, and any other suitable sensor. The virtual constraint therapy can be supplemented with a physical restraint (e.g., sling or mitt configured to constrain motion of a limb), or can alternatively be provided without a physical restraint. Furthermore, the virtual constraint can be reinforced with positive reinforcement and/or negative reinforcement. Additionally, the virtual constraint of Block S<b>190</b> can be dynamically modulated, such that a virtual &#x201c;envelope&#x201d; around a constrained body region of the user can be dynamically varied in size according to the user's progress, by using a sensor subsystem configured to detect motion of the user with an adjustable envelope of detection. In variations, the virtual envelope can be adjusted in real-time by changing thresholds on an amount of allowable movement prior to provision of positive reinforcement and/or negative reinforcement to the user. Dynamic modulation of the virtual constraint thus allows the user to gradually build up an ability for self-restraint of a less affected region of his/her body in order to strengthen an affected body region.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one example of Block S<b>190</b>, wherein the user's hand is the target of the virtual constraint therapy, a negative sound can be configured to play at a mobile device of the user whenever the user moves his/her virtually constrained hand while performing a task of the set of tasks provided in Block S<b>110</b>. The user is thus incentivized to maintain virtual constraint of his/her hand, which can improve the user's response to rehabilitation. In another example of Block S<b>190</b>, wherein the user's hand is the target of the virtual constraint therapy, points can be deducted from the user whenever the user moves his/her virtually constrained hand during performance of a provided task. Similarly, the user is thus incentivized to maintain virtual constraint of his/her hand, which can improve a response to rehabilitation. In either example, detection of motion of the user can be enabled by use of at least one accelerometer of a system for implementing the method <b>100</b>. Furthermore, in either example, the accelerometer can be incorporated into an element of the system for providing PNS, or can be a standalone component configured to primarily facilitate the virtual constraint therapy.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Variations of the method <b>100</b> can additionally or alternatively include any other suitable blocks or steps configured to facilitate provision of an electrical stimulation treatment for improving or enhancing cognitive functions of a user.

In this variation, NREM sleep states can further comprise NREM stage 1 sleep, NREM stage 2 sleep, and NREM stage 3 sleep. REM sleep is characterized in signals by rapid low-voltage EEG signals defined by high frequency saw-tooth waves, along with ocular motion, which can be detected and received using an EEG sensor, an EMG sensor, and/or an EOG sensor of the biosignal detection module. NREM stage 1 sleep is characterized in signals by a transition from alpha wave neural oscillations to theta wave neural oscillations (e.g., with a frequency of 4-7 Hz), along with muscle twitching (e.g., myoclonus), and/or hallucinations, which can be detected and received using an EEG sensor, an EMG sensor, and/or an MEG sensor.

NREM stage 3 sleep is physiologically characterized by neurons in multiple brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and visual cortex) firing in a pattern that is similar to, but accelerated in comparison to a pattern in which the neurons fired during learning of a day's events.

Furthermore, multiple neurological states can be selected as neurological signatures, such that the method <b>300</b> can provide electrical stimulation matched to multiple neurological state signatures of the user. In one variation, a portion of a neurological state can be a selected target for electrical stimulation, and in another variation, a transition between neurological states can be a selected target for electrical stimulation. In yet another variation, a combination of targets can be selected as a trigger for electrical stimulation (e.g., a transition between neurological states, followed by a neurological state event can be a selected target). Other variations of Block S<b>330</b> can, however, can comprise identification of any suitable neurological state signature, target portion of a neurological state, target transition between neurological states, and/or any characteristic target (or combination of targets) for target-matched electrical stimulation.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In one example of Block S<b>330</b> for sleep state-matched stimulation, identifying a neurological state signature can comprise a NREM stage 3 (i.e., slow-wave sleep) neurological state, characterized by an entry, an exit, and a duration. Such characteristics of the target NREM stage 3 neurological state can then be used in an example of Block S<b>140</b>, in order to create a trigger that automatically initiates provision and/or termination of an electrical stimulation treatment in examples of Block S<b>150</b> and/or Block S<b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In another example of Block S<b>330</b> for stimulation matched with states of a large amplitude oscillation, identifying a neurological state signature can comprise identifying a down state of a large amplitude oscillation, characterized by oscillation trough features (e.g., minimum signal voltage). The down state can further be characterized by an entry and an exit (e.g., inflection points that bound the minimum signal voltage), as well as a duration (e.g., spacing between inflection points that bound the minimum signal voltage). Such characteristics of the target down state can then be used in an example of Block S<b>140</b>, in order to create a trigger that automatically initiates provision and/or termination of an electrical stimulation treatment in examples of Block S<b>350</b> and/or Block S<b>355</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In another example of Block S<b>330</b> for stimulation matched with states of a large amplitude oscillation, identifying a neurological state signature can comprise identifying an up state of a large amplitude oscillation, characterized by oscillation peaks (e.g., maximum signal voltage).

Such characteristics of the target up state can then be used in an example of Block S<b>340</b>, in order to create a trigger that automatically initiates provision and/or termination of an electrical stimulation treatment in examples of Block S<b>350</b> and/or Block S<b>355</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some variations, Blocks S<b>310</b> through S<b>330</b> can function to calibrate a biosignal detection module-processing subsystem unit, such as the one described in Section 2 below, thus preparing the unit to automatically perform neurological state-matched electrical stimulation treatments in Blocks S<b>340</b> and S<b>350</b>. Furthermore, Blocks S<b>310</b>-S<b>330</b> can additionally or alternatively be performed in an iterative pattern to collect, identify, and refine identification of neurological state signature(s) for target-matched electrical stimulation.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Block S<b>340</b> recites: detecting an entry of the neurological signature, wherein the entry of the neurological signature is characterized by a first timepoint. Block S<b>340</b> functions to create a trigger whenever a characteristic of the neurological state signature (e.g., entry of the neurological state, transition into the neurological state) is detected. Preferably, the characteristic of the neurological state signature is detected at the biosignal detection module of one embodiment of Block S<b>210</b>; however, the characteristic of the neurological state signature can be detected in any other suitable manner. The entry of the neurological state signature is preferably a bioelectrical signal (e.g., EEG signal, EOG signal, EMG signal, MEG signal) event that defines an initiation of the neurological state signature event; however, the entry of the neurological state signature event can additionally or alternatively comprise any other suitable physiological signal event (e.g., respiratory event, galvanic skin impedance event, heart rate event, etc.). The first timepoint is thus an initiation timepoint of a time window spanning the entire neurological state signature event. In a first variation, the first timepoint can define the first occurrence of an EEG signal peak-to-peak amplitude greater than 75 microvolts, characteristic of an entry of a slow-wave sleep state. In a second variation, the first timepoint can define an inflection point prior to a trough of an EEG signal, characterizing an entry of a down state of a large amplitude oscillation. In a third variation, the first timepoint can define an inflection point prior to a peak of an EEG signal, characterizing an entry of an up state of a large amplitude oscillation. In a fourth variation, the first timepoint can define an entry of heightened heart rate coupled with increased neurological activity (e.g., a high frequency and high amplitude EEG signal set), characteristic of an entry of a stress state. Other variations of Block S<b>140</b> can, however, comprise automatically detecting an entry of any other suitable neurological state signature, using any suitable system.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Block S<b>350</b> recites: automatically providing an electrical stimulation treatment to the user in association with the first timepoint, and functions to deliver an electrical stimulation treatment temporally matched with a neurological state signature experienced by the user. Block S<b>350</b> is preferably performed at an electrical stimulation module, such as the electrical stimulation module described in Section 2 below; however, Block S<b>350</b> can alternatively be performed using any other suitable electrical stimulation module. Similar to the methods <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> described above, the electrical stimulation treatment is preferably transcranial electrical stimulation (TES); however, the stimulation treatment can additionally or alternatively comprise any other form of electrical stimulation configured to stimulate any other suitable region of the user's body, with any suitable penetration depth, and/or any suitable target tissue structure (e.g., neural, musculoskeletal). The electrical stimulation treatment can be similarly characterized by at least one stimulation parameter and a set of phases. Furthermore, the electrical stimulation treatment can comprise multiple forms, wherein the forms can be performed simultaneously and/or in sequence.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The electrical stimulation treatment automatically provided in Block S<b>350</b> can be uniform (e.g., characterized by a regular pattern or waveform, characterized by a constant intensity, characterized by a constant frequency). However, the electrical stimulation treatment provided can alternatively be non-uniform. Furthermore, in variations, the electrical stimulation treatment can comprise using multiple treatments at different locations, in order to stimulate formation of neural connections in synchronization with a target neurological state (e.g., by Hebb's rule). The multiple treatments in these variations can be identical, can be provided at two or more anodal electrodes positioned at different locations on the user's skull (with cathodal electrodes positioned elsewhere), and can be provided with a delay between treatments (e.g., up to a 10 ms delay). Alternatively the multiple treatments can be non-identical (e.g., comprise different forms of electrical stimulation, can comprise different treatment parameters), can be provided using any suitable electrode configuration, and/or can be provided without any substantial delay between treatments. Modulation of a delay between treatments can modulate the strength of formed neural connections.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In a first example, the electrical stimulation treatment can comprise a tDCS treatment and can be delivered to the user upon detection of an entry of slow-wave sleep (i.e., NREM stage 3) at a first timepoint, which can function to improve declarative memory. The tDCS treatment can target the user's prefrontal cortex (e.g., by way of a electrode system configured to stimulate the prefrontal cortex) during replaying of recent memory sequences in the prefrontal cortex during slow-wave sleep. The tDCS treatment can additionally or alternatively target the user's visual cortex and/or hippocampus, the latter e.g. by stimulating neocortical structures that project to the hippocampus via entorhinal cortex, during replaying of recent memory sequences in the visual cortex and/or hippocampus during slow-wave sleep. In the first example, delivering the tDCS treatment while the user is sleeping can allow the user to be in a non-motile, restful state, can take advantage of compressed replay of neural activity during sleep, and can enhance declarative memory of the user while the user is in a potentially less stressful state. The electrical stimulation treatment in the first example can be delivered in a clinical or research setting, or can alternatively be delivered in a non-clinical setting (e.g., at a portable, wearable system). In a variation of the first example, the electrical stimulation treatment can alternatively be provided upon detection of an entry of REM sleep, which can function to enhance non-declarative memory of the user.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In a second example, the electrical stimulation treatment can comprise a TES treatment and can be delivered to the user upon detection of an entry of an up state of a large amplitude oscillation at a first timepoint, which can function to selectively induce long term potentiation (LTP) of neural synaptic activity in the user. The TES treatment can be provided at the motor cortex of the user (e.g., using a sensor system configured to selectively provide TES to the motor cortex), where inducing LTP can enhance or modulate recent motor learning. The user in the second example can be a stroke patient or other user with a neurological derived impairment of motor function, or can be any other suitable user who desires modulation of motor learning. In a variation of the second example, the electrical stimulation treatment can comprise a TES treatment and can be delivered to the user upon detection of an entry of a down state of a large amplitude oscillation at a first timepoint, which can function to selectively induce long term depression (LTD) of neural synaptic activity. In other variations of the second example, the TES treatment can be provided to the user sequentially upon detection of an entry of an up state and upon detection of an entry of a down state, such that LTP and LTD are cyclically induced in the user.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In a third example, the electrical stimulation treatment can comprise a TES treatment and can be delivered to the user upon detection of an entry of a stressed or alert state, which can function to increase working memory and/or declarative memory in the user. The TES treatment can be an anodal tDCS treatment provided at the prefrontal cortex of the user (e.g., using a sensor system configured to selectively provide tDCS to the prefrontal cortex), where stimulation can enhance or modulate attention, focus, cognitive control, or working memory. The TES treatment can additionally or alternatively be provided at the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the user, where stimulation can enhance or modulate attention, focus, cognitive control, or declarative memory. In variations of the third example, the electrical stimulation treatment can be provided, upon detection of the stress state, at regions of the brain known to modulate stress, such that a stress response of the user can be modulated (e.g., decreased, stabilized, etc.). As such, the third example can increase focus during stress states, or can function to modulate a stress response in the user.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In a fourth example, a first electrical stimulation treatment can be provided at a first region of the user's brain, and a second electrical stimulation treatment can be provided at a second region of the user's brain, upon detection of an entry of a neurological state signature. The first electrical stimulation treatment can comprise a tVFS treatment characterized by a first stimulation waveform, and the second electrical stimulation treatment can be identical to the first electrical stimulation treatment, delivered 10 ms after the first electrical stimulation treatment. In the fourth example, the first region can comprise Broca's area, and the second region can comprise Wernicke's area, such that the method <b>100</b> functions to automatically promote growth of neurological connections between Broca's area and Wernicke's area upon detection of a neurological state signature at which stimulation would be most effective. The fourth example can thus provide treatment of Broca's aphasia, by stimulating neural connections between severed brain regions. Variations of the fourth example can comprise stimulating any other suitable combination of multiple brain regions, with or without a delay, in order to promote growth of neural connections upon detection of a neurological state signature.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the method <b>100</b> can further comprise Block S<b>355</b>, which recites: detecting an exit of the neurological signature by the user, wherein the exit of the neurological state signature is characterized by a second timepoint. Block S<b>160</b> functions to establish a second trigger that can be used to terminate provision of an electrical stimulation treatment, such that the electrical stimulation treatment is isolated to a given time window characterized a first timepoint and a second timepoint. Similar to Block S<b>140</b>, the exit of the neurological state signature is preferably a bioelectrical signal (e.g., EEG signal, EOG signal, EMG signal, MEG signal) event that defines an end of the neurological state signature event; however, the end of the neurological state signature event can additionally or alternatively comprise any other suitable physiological signal event (e.g., respiratory event, galvanic skin impedance event, heart rate event, etc.). In a first variation, the second timepoint can define the last occurrence of an EEG signal peak-to-peak amplitude greater than 75 microvolts, characteristic of an end of a slow-wave sleep state. In a second variation, the second timepoint can define an inflection point after a trough of an EEG signal, characterizing an exit of a down state of a large amplitude oscillation. In a third variation, the second timepoint can define an inflection point after a peak of an EEG signal, characterizing an exit of an up state of a large amplitude oscillation.

Modulation of the electrical stimulation treatment to produce an improved learning rate can be performed according to Block S<b>160</b>, wherein a controller modulates an amount and/or a duration of a portion of the electrical stimulation treatment to produce the improved learning rate of the user. In the example, if a rate of learning (e.g., as assessed by an analysis of performance of the task by the user, as assessed by biosignals detection) is within desired limits, the controller can be configured to deliver stimulation or intermittent stimulation without any adjustment, under an assumption that the electrical stimulation treatment being supplied is effective. However, if the rate of learning is above an upper limit, the controller can be configured to reduce a parameter (e.g., current amplitude, duration) of the electrical stimulation treatment, and if the rate of learning is below a lower limit, the controller can be configured to increase or to decrease (e.g., to facilitate re-normalization of homeostatic mechanisms counteracting neural plasticity) a parameter of the electrical stimulation treatment.
