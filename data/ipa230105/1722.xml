Imprint lithography is understood to mean a method, wherein micro- and/or nanometre-size structures are embossed in a material by means of a stamp. The material is an embossing material applied on a substrate. Such imprint processes have increasingly gained in importance in recent years, since they can be carried out more quickly, more effectively and at a lower cost than many photolithographic processes. Furthermore, it has been shown that the attainable resolution by means of imprint-lithographic processes is by no means inferior to the resolution that can be attained with the aid of photolithography.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The apparatuses used in the prior art have a number of drawbacks. The apparatuses are designed for a size that does not permit processing of substrates above a certain diameter, in particular of more than 300 mm, or only does so with difficulty. In principle, a distinction can be made between two different types of imprint apparatuses in the prior art.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Most embodiments are incorporated in so-called mask aligners or are designed as an independent apparatus, which however cannot process substrates larger than 300 mm. In particular, mask aligners are suitable for special imprint apparatuses, since they have already experienced widespread use for photolithography in the semiconductor industry. It has therefore been expedient for suppliers to offer extensions or add-ons that were able to build on already known mask aligner technology or to expand the latter. The advantage of mask aligners lies primarily in the fact that in most cases they already offer optical systems, in particular lamp houses, for the in particular full-area illumination of the substrates and therefore the embossed embossing materials.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Apart from modified or extended mask aligners, there are also dedicated imprint apparatuses which have been designed on and for special embodiments. These apparatuses are usually highly precise alignment apparatuses, which can align a stamp with ever higher precision relative to the substrate. Furthermore, these apparatuses have the capability of generating a vacuum, a special dispensing system etc. Such imprint apparatuses only rarely have the capability of embossing an embossing material on a substrate of more than 300 mm.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The aforementioned circumstances give rise to the problem that the embossing of large-format, in particular rectangular, substrates, such as are required for example for flat screen production, cannot be implemented or can only be so with great difficulty. Sometimes, a structure is to be embossed even on substrates with a size which is such that a plurality of individual large screen parts are formed from the substrate. An extreme increase in throughput would thus result according to the invention, which would have a favourable effect on costs.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, there is also the problem of suitably illuminating the embossed areas. The illumination systems would have to be designed extremely large, which would lead to an apparatus that could not be implemented for technical reasons.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further problem is the removal of the very large stamp from the large areas. The stamp release must be controlled and monitored in a highly precise manner and, in particular, must take place in such a way that the embossed structure and the stamp do not suffer any damage during the removal of the stamp.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present prior art for the micro- and/or nanostructuring of surfaces primarily comprises photolithography and the various embossing techniques. The embossing techniques operate either with hard or soft stamps. In recent times, embossing lithography techniques have chiefly become established and are replacing the conventional photolithography techniques. Among the photolithography techniques, the use of so-called soft stamps is in particular becoming increasingly more popular. The reason lies in the easy production of the stamps, efficient embossing processes, very good surface properties of the given stamp materials, low costs, the reproducibility of the embossed product and in particular the possibility of the elastic deformation of the stamp during the embossing and the removal. A stamp made in an elastomer with a micro- or nanostructured surface is used in soft lithography in order to produce structures in the range from 20 nm to &#x3e;1000 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">There are six known techniques:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0012">micro- and/or nano-contact printing (&#x3bc;/nCP)</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0013">replica moulding (REM)</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0014">micro-transfer moulding (&#x3bc;TM) or nanoimprint lithography (NIL)</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0015">micro-moulding in capillaries (MIMIC)</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0016">solvent-assisted micro-moulding (SAMIM) and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0017">phase-shift lithography</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0013" num="0018">Elastomer stamps are produced as a negative of a master. The master stamp is a hard stamp made of metal, plastic and/or a ceramic, which is produced as a one-off by correspondingly costly processes. An arbitrary number of elastomer stamps can then be produced from the master. The elastomer stamps enable a conformal, uniform contact over large surfaces. They can easily be separated from their master stamp, as well as from the embossed products. Furthermore, elastomer stamps have a low surface energy for an easy and simple separation of stamp and substrate. For the automated implementation of soft-lithographic processes, it is necessary to support the elastomer stamp by means of a carrier. Glass carrier substrates with varying thicknesses are currently used. As a result of using thick glass substrates, however, the elastomer stamp loses its flexibility, at least in part.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0019">A master can in particular be produced by a step-and-repeat process (S&#x26;R process). This is mainly advantageous when very large masters have to be produced. The master is thereby produced by a further master-master. In the technical language, however, the master from which the soft stamps are moulded are usually referred to as sub-masters and the master for producing the sub-master is referred to as a master. The definitions may vary. It is however disclosed that an in particular large-area master (or sub-master) that is used to mould soft stamps can be produced by a repeated embossing process (step-and-repeat process), which is characterised in that embossing is carried out at a first point, then the master-master (or master) is moved and then embossing is carried out at least one further time.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0020">Furthermore, it is conceivable for a master to be used in a step-and-repeat process in order to emboss the elastomer stamp directly. This is mainly advantageous when the elastomer stamp is very large. The master is moved to a first position, embosses the elastomer stamp there, then moves to a second position different from the first position and embosses again.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0021">This process can be continued until such time as an elastomer stamp of arbitrary size has been produced.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0022">The use of rigid carriers generally makes the automatic separation of stamp and substrate difficult after the embossing process, as a result of which process automation and industrial exploitation of imprint lithography can be implemented only with difficulty.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0023">A further general problem of stamps is the fact that they usually have only a limited size. It is thus not readily possible to emboss large areas. An option for continuous embossing is represented by roller stamps, which however will not be dealt with further here. For the embossing of micro- and/or nanometer-size structures on large substrates, in particular plates, only very few apparatuses or methods and in particular no fully developed apparatuses or methods exist in the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0024">It is an objective of the invention to provide an improved apparatus and an improved method for embossing micro- and/or nanostructures, which no longer have the drawbacks of the prior art and with which in particular automation and more rapid processing of large-format substrates can be ensured.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0025">This problem is solved by the subject-matter of the independent claims. Advantageous developments of the invention are given in the sub-claims. All combinations of at least two features given in the description, the claims and/or the drawings also fall within the scope of the invention. In stated value ranges, values lying inside the stated limits are also deemed to be disclosed as limiting values and can be claimed in any combination.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0026">The invention relates to an apparatus for embossing micro- and/or nanostructures with a module, wherein the module comprises a structured stamp and at least one mobile embossing element, wherein the module can preferably comprise a lamp house capable of tracking the embossing element.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0027">The lamp house moves, in particular parallel to the substrate surface, at a speed between 1 mm/s and 1000 mm/s, preferably between 5 mm/s and 750 mm/s, still more preferably between 7.5 mm/s and 500 mm/s, most preferably between 10 mm/s and 250 mm/s, with utmost preference at 100 mm/s.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0028">Moreover, the invention relates to a method for embossing micro- and/or nanostructures on a substrate, wherein a mobile embossing element, by the action of a force on a structured stamp, embosses the micro- and/or nanostructures on the substrate, wherein a lamp house can preferably track the embossing element.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0029">The embossing element moves, in particular parallel to the substrate surface, at a speed between 1 mm/s and 1000 mm/s, preferably between 5 mm/s and 750 mm/s, still more preferably between 7.5 mm/s and 500 mm/s, most preferably between 10 mm/s and 250 mm/s, with utmost preference at 100 mm/s. In particular, the embossing element and the lamp house move at the same speed.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0030">As an embossing element or embossing elements, use can be made of all components or assemblies, with the aid of which a generally inhomogeneous, i.e. not constant as a function of location, but preferably homogeneous, i.e. constant as a function of location, linear and/or planar force can be exerted on the structured stamp.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0031">In the remainder of the specification, mention will be made only of a linear force. However, the planar force is always intended to be included.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0032">The structured stamp can on the one hand be pressed into the embossing material by means of the embossing element or the embossing elements. On the other hand, the process of removing the structured stamp from the embossing material can be controlled and monitored in a targeted manner with the aid of the embossing element.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0033">The embossing element or embossing elements may take the form of the following:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0034">solids, in particular        <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0035">rollers</li>            <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0036">cutting edges</li>            <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0037">blades</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0038">fluid jets, in particular        <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0039">compressed air</li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0029" num="0040">In the remainder of the specification, the embossing element will be described and represented primarily as a roller by way of example.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0041">Moreover, the invention relates to the use of the apparatus according to the invention for embossing micro- and/or nanostructures on a substrate as well as a substrate with micro- and/or nanostructures embossed with an apparatus according to the invention or a method according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0042">Furthermore, the invention relates, in particular as an independent aspect, to a stamp system, comprising a structured stamp (also referred to in the following solely as a stamp), in particular a soft stamp, for embossing micro- and/or nanostructures, and an optional carrier, in particular of glass, connected to the stamp, in particular in a planar manner, wherein the stamp and the optional carrier are constituted elastically, in such a way that they can be deformed by an embossing element. The optional carrier and the stamp are connected to one another in particular by an adhesive layer.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0043">Furthermore, the invention relates, in particular as an independent aspect, to a removal means for separating a structured stamp from an embossing material, in particular for an apparatus according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0044">The removal means is an assembly. The first component of the assembly is the embossing element, with the aid of which the withdrawal of the structured stamp from the embossing material can be controlled in a targeted manner. The second component is the embossing element suspension system, with which the embossing element can be controlled.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0045">The third component of the assembly is a clamping bar, with which the structured stamp can be fixed. The fourth component of the assembly is a lifting system for the clamping bar, which lifting system can move the clamping bar along the Z-direction, whilst it can itself be moved in a second direction, in particular a direction normal to the Z-direction.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0046">Furthermore, the invention relates, in particular as an independent aspect, to an embossing element suspension system (also referred to in the following as an embossing element suspension device) for suspending an embossing element of an apparatus, in particular according to the invention, which is constituted such that a force applied to a structured stamp and/or a carrier of the structured stamp can be adjusted by a counterforce in a targeted manner. In the case of the use of nozzles for the application of force on the structured stamp with the aid of a fluid, the embossing element suspension system involves all the components that are used for the targeted fluid control. In particular, this is understood to mean a nozzle, in particular a nozzle which can allow a gas to flow out at a regulatable pressure along a line.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0047">Furthermore, the invention relates, in particular as an independent aspect, to an embossing element suspension device for suspending an embossing element of an apparatus, in particular according to the invention, which is constituted such that the force of the embossing element on the structured stamp can be applied not only uniformly, but also asymmetrically. This is brought about very simply by the fact that the embossing element can be applied with variably controllable forces on the left-hand side and/or the right-hand side by means of the embossing element suspension device.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0048">A targeted control of the force that acts on the structured stamp is thus enabled by the embossing element during the embossing and/or the removal assistance.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0049">Furthermore, the invention in particular describes an apparatus and a method for the controlled, highly precise, fault-free removal of the structured stamp from the embossing surface, in particular by a combined use of removal elements.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0050">Provision is preferably made such that an advancing movement of the lamp house takes place with a translational movement of the embossing element. The advancing movement can take place either simultaneously, i.e. synchronously, with the movement of the embossing element or with a time lag. According to the invention, it is important that the lamp house always illuminates only a section of the embossing material. By means of this embodiment according to the invention, a limitation of the size of the lamp house, in particular the light source, is advantageously made possible. If a tracking lamp house is not expedient, the entire structured stamp, and therefore the embossing material, can be illuminated over the entire area with a correspondingly large light source or a suitable optical system.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0051">The stamp is preferably fixed on a carrier (engl.: backplane), in particular a plate, most preferably a glass carrier. Further conceivable materials for the carrier are polymers and/or metals. The polymers are preferably used as plastic films and/or thin plastic sheets, the metals preferably as metal foils and/or thin metal sheets. The carrier has a thickness between 10 &#x3bc;m and 1000 &#x3bc;m, preferably between 50 &#x3bc;m and 800 &#x3bc;m, still more preferably between 100 &#x3bc;m and 600 &#x3bc;m, most preferably between 150 &#x3bc;m and 400 &#x3bc;m, with utmost preference 200 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0052">The stamp is acted upon on a force-application side according to the invention along its entire length, in particular in a continuous process, with a linear force, which in particular extends perpendicular to the length and is homogeneous in particular along the entire length, in order to press the structures into the embossing material. The application preferably takes place with the aid of an embossing element, in particular a preferably rigid embossing roller. The corresponding structure is in principle already known from publication WO 2014037044 A1. The inventive aspect of the present invention includes in particular the description of an apparatus and a method, wherein the embodiment for large-format embossing mentioned in publication WO 2014037044 A1 can be used. According to the invention, however, the frame mentioned in publication WO 2014037044 A1 is dispensed with so that the structured stamp can be withdrawn.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0053">The linear force can also be inhomogeneous in a development of the embodiment according to the invention. An inhomogeneous linear force can be achieved in particular by the fact that the embossing element is acted upon on its left-hand suspension point with a force which is different from the force in the right-hand suspension point. As a result of the possibility of generating an inhomogeneous linear force, structured stamps with a high density of nanostructures on the right-hand side, for example, can also be subjected to a greater load there in order to ensure homogeneous embossing of the entire embossing material.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0054">In the subsequent text, a stamp is understood to mean any kind of component which has corresponding structured elements at its surface and has the inventive flexibility during the embossing process. A stamp can be a single component or a combined component. If the stamp is constituted solely as a single component, the stamp is made of a film a flexible sheet, in which the corresponding structured elements have been produced. In the case of a combined stamp, i.e. a stamp system, the latter comprises a carrier and a corresponding stamp component comprising the structured elements. In this case, the carrier and/or the stamp component must, as an assembly, have the required flexibility in order to be duly deformed by the embossing element. The carrier is made in particular from one of the following materials.<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0055">semiconductor        <ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0056">Ge, Si, alpha-Sn, B, Se, Te</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0057">metal        <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0058">Cu, Ag, Au, Al, Fe, Ni, Co, Pt, W, Cr, Pb, Ti, Ta, Zn, Sn</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0059">compound semiconductor        <ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0060">GaAs, GaN, InP, InxGa1&#x2212;xN, InSb, InAs, GaSb, AlN, InN, GaP, BeTe, ZnO, CuInGaSe<sub>2</sub>, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdS, CdSe, CdTe, Hg(1&#x2212;x)Cd(x)Te, BeSe, HgS, AIxGa1&#x2212;xAs, GaS, GaSe, GaTe, InS, InSe, InTe, CuInSe<sub>2</sub>, CuInS<sub>2</sub>, CuInGaS<sub>2</sub>, SiC, SiGe</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0061">glass        <ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0062">metallic glasses</li>            <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0063">Non-metallic glasses, in particular            <ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">                <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0064">organic non-metallic glasses</li>                <li id="ul0013-0002" num="0065">inorganic non-metallic glasses, in particular                <ul id="ul0014" list-style="none">                    <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0066">non-oxidic glasses, in particular</li>                    <li id="ul0014-0002" num="0000">&#x2003;halide glasses</li>                    <li id="ul0014-0003" num="0000">&#x2003;chalcogenide glasses</li>                    <li id="ul0014-0004" num="0067">oxidic glasses, in particular</li>                    <li id="ul0014-0005" num="0000">&#x2003;phosphatic glasses</li>                    <li id="ul0014-0006" num="0000">&#x2003;silicate glasses, in particular</li>                    <li id="ul0014-0007" num="0000">&#x2003;alumosilicate glasses</li>                    <li id="ul0014-0008" num="0000">&#x2003;lead silicate glasses</li>                    <li id="ul0014-0009" num="0000">&#x2003;alkali silicate glasses, in particular</li>                    <li id="ul0014-0010" num="0000">&#x2003;alkaline earth silicate glasses</li>                    <li id="ul0014-0011" num="0000">&#x2003;borosilicate glasses</li>                    <li id="ul0014-0012" num="0000">&#x2003;borate glasses, in particular</li>                    <li id="ul0014-0013" num="0000">&#x2003;alkali borate glasses</li>                </ul>                </li>            </ul>            </li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0008-0005" num="0068">plastics, in particular        <ul id="ul0015" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0069">elastomers, in particular            <ul id="ul0016" list-style="none">                <li id="ul0016-0001" num="0070">Viton (material) and/or</li>                <li id="ul0016-0002" num="0071">polyurethane and/or</li>                <li id="ul0016-0003" num="0072">hypalon (material) and/or</li>                <li id="ul0016-0004" num="0073">isoprene rubber (material) and/or</li>                <li id="ul0016-0005" num="0074">nitrile rubber (material) and/or</li>                <li id="ul0016-0006" num="0075">perfluorinated rubber (material) and/or</li>                <li id="ul0016-0007" num="0076">polyisobutene (material) and/or</li>                <li id="ul0016-0008" num="0077">polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and/or</li>                <li id="ul0016-0009" num="0078">polycarbonate (PC) and/or</li>                <li id="ul0016-0010" num="0079">polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and/or</li>                <li id="ul0016-0011" num="0080">Kapton (material)</li>            </ul>            </li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0044" num="0081">A linear force according to the present invention means that the application of force takes place at least predominantly, in particular completely, in a first direction, in particular perpendicular to the movement of an embossing element along the stamp (i.e. for example encompasses the entire effective width of the stamp), whilst in a second direction (in particular perpendicular to the first direction) only a comparatively very small region (in particular in the ratio 1 to 5, preferably 1 to 10, still more preferably 1 to 20, still more preferably 1 to 100 to the first direction) is at the same time acted on. A comparatively small application area in comparison with the entire area of the stamp thus results that is simultaneously acted on. Not only is a very defined application thus enabled, but also very homogeneous embossing is achieved. In the case of an inhomogeneous distribution of structured elements on the stamp, an inhomogeneous linear force may especially be required for homogeneous embossing.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0082">The stamp and all the necessary parts for performing a process according to the invention are referred to in the subsequent text as a module. The module includes in particular the stamp, the embossing element with the embossing element suspension system, the lamp house and the removal means.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0083">A first embodiment according to the invention includes embossing large substrates, the diameter whereof still lies however within the order of magnitude of the stamp. The film stamp is thus still able to emboss a substrate in a single complete step, without having to be placed at a further position by a step-and-repeat process. The substrates are however already so large that the use of a lamp house illuminating the embossing material on the substrate over the entire area is not possible, or is so only with great difficulty. The lamp house is therefore preferably modified in such a way that it can illuminate stepwise or continuously partial segments of the embossing material, in particular rectangular sections. An idea according to the invention includes in particular moving the lamp house over the already embossed surface sections of the embossing material. For the sake of completeness, it is mentioned that, whilst a full-area illumination takes time and effort, is expensive and extremely complicated, it is nonetheless possible.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0084">The apparatus and the method can respectively be operated or carried out optionally in the step-and-repeat operation. An optional aspect of the invention includes in particular the possibility of being able to move the module in a step-and-repeat process over very large areas and thus of being able to emboss areas of several square metres, in that the stamping process according to the invention is carried out at each individual step-and-repeat position. Moreover, the invention thus permits a large-area application of the embossing process, in particular with a width greater than 0.01 m, preferably greater than 1.0 m, still more preferably greater than 10 m and/or a length greater than 0.01 m, preferably greater than 5 m, still more preferably greater than 10 m.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0085">A further optional aspect is the use of the module at at least one side of an endless substrate. An endless substrate is understood to mean a substrate stored in particular on a first roll, the length whereof is many times greater than its width. An endless substrate is in particular an endless film. The endless substrate can also be formed from glass, if the glass is thin enough to be bent without breaking. Typical glass thicknesses are less than 1000 &#x3bc;m, preferably less than 500 &#x3bc;m, still more preferably less than 250 &#x3bc;m, most preferably less than 100 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0086">By means of different processes, in particular heat treatments, hardening processes etc., the glass, in particular its surface, can be modified in such a way that it can be rolled up. According to the invention, the module can be used to carry out an embossing process according to the invention on a part of the endless substrate. The module, in particular the stamp, is then removed from the endless substrate and the endless substrate is moved onward by a desired unit, in particular at least the length of the embossed structure. According to the invention, a further embossing process can then take place. By means of this special embodiment, the module is preferably moved only in the direction normal to the endless substrate, while the endless substrate is moved onward in a stepwise manner. The endless substrate is preferably stored in a storage unit, in particular a second roll.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0087">The structured stamp according to the invention is developed further, in that the stamp is clamped by means of two clamping bars arranged at the two mutually opposite clamping sides. The clamping bars comprise in particular fixing means for fixing the stamp. Each clamping bar can be fixed to the stamp either directly or via a spring system. Preferably, however, at least one of the clamping bars is fixed to the stamp by means of springs.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0088">The embossing roller can in particular comprise a motor, which permits the active rotation of the embossing roller. It is also conceivable that the embossing roller can be rotated in a controlled manner by an external motor via a gear unit.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0089">The translational speed of the embossing roller lies between 0.1 mm/s and 1000 mm/s, preferably between 1.0 mm/s and 750 mm/s, still more preferably between 10 mm/s and 500 mm/s, most preferably between 75 mm/s and 250 mm/s, with utmost preference at 100 mm/s.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0090">In a development of the present invention, provision is made such that the stamp is constituted by a carrier and an in particular elastomer stamp moulded or hot-embossed on said carrier. The production of the structured stamp is thus more favourable.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0091">The elastomer stamp is in particular made of one of the following<ul id="ul0017" list-style="none">    <li

id="p-0080" num="0235">Furthermore, provision is preferably made such that the translational speed of the removal means lies between 0.1 mm/s and 100 mm/s, preferably between 1 mm/s and 75 mm/s, still more preferably between 5 mm/s and 50 mm/s.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0236">The removal of the structured stamp or the stamp system from the embossing material takes place in particular by the targeted movement of a clamping bar via the movement of a rotatably mounted cross-member in a holding fixture. The clamping bar fixes the stamp and is connected via springs to a rotatably mountable cross-member, which is fixed in a holding fixture which can be moved in a translational manner. In special embodiments, it is also conceivable that the springs and the rotatably mountable cross-member are dispensed with and the clamping bar itself is mounted rotatably in the holding fixture. The technical advantage of the spring system, which fixes the stamp in a flexible manner, is however thereby lost. The holding fixture is moved in a targeted manner along a lifting system in a first direction. The translational movement of the lifting system along a second direction, in particular along a rail, can take place in particular simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0237">As a result of the combination of two movements, the clamping bar can be moved along an arbitrary curve. The embossing element acts in particular simultaneously on the structured stamp or the stamp system and thus has a decisive influence on the release of the structured stamp or the stamp system from the embossing material.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0238">The following considerations describe the resultant forces that lead to a movement of the sub-systems in question, not the cutting forces. The forces are generally functions of time.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0239">The embossing element presses with a force F<sub>R(t) </sub>on the structured stamp. Force F<sub>R(t) </sub>can be broken down into a horizontal force F<sub>RH(t) </sub>and a vertical force F<sub>RV(t)</sub>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0240">At the same time, the removal means (also referred to in this description as removal elements) withdraw the structured stamp and thus generate a force F<sub>s(u,t)</sub>, which can also be broken down into a horizontal force F<sub>SH(u,t) </sub>and a vertical force F<sub>SV(u,t)</sub>. Force F<sub>s(u,t) </sub>acts at each point of the structured stamp, but generally changes its direction with the position in the structured stamp.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0241">Forces F<sub>s(u,t)</sub>, F<sub>SH(u,t) </sub>and F<sub>SV(u,t) </sub>are also specified, apart from time, as functions of coordinate u, wherein u is the position along the, in particular also curved, structured stamp, proceeding from one of its ends.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0242">By the movement, in particular acceleration, of the embossing element and the removal element, forces F<sub>S(u,t)</sub>, F<sub>SH(u,t) </sub>and F<sub>SV(u,t) </sub>can thus be adjusted in a targeted manner and the removal of the structured stamp from the embossing material can thus be controlled in a targeted manner.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0243">In particular, large force components F<sub>SV(u,t) </sub>and small force components forces F<sub>SH(u,t) </sub>are preferable close to the removal. The nanostructures of the structured stamp are thus predominantly lifted out of the embossed structures of the embossing material, whereas a lateral application of force on the embossed nanostructures of the embossing material is as far as possible prevented.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0244">The control of the forces takes place in particular by means of hardware and/or firmware and/or software. In particular, there are force-measuring sensors in the removal means and/or in the embossing element.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0245">Large radii of the embossing element, in particular an embossing roller, promote a greater force component F<sub>SH(u,t)</sub>, but provide the nanostructures of the structured stamp with the possibility, over a longer distance, of being removed from the embossed nanostructures of the embossing material largely in the normal direction to the embossing surface. Small radii of the embossing element, on the other hand, promote a greater force component F<sub>SV(u,t)</sub>, which promotes the removal in the normal direction to the embossing surface, and are removed relatively quickly in the normal direction to the embossing surface.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0246">In particular, release angle &#x3b1; can be kept constant by a predefined radius of the embossing element. The release angle is defined as the angle between the horizontal and the tangent to the curvature curve of the nanostructures. The release angle is in particular less than 5&#xb0;, preferably less than 1&#xb0;, still more preferably less than 0.1&#xb0;, most preferably less than 0.01&#xb0;, with utmost preference less than 0.001&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0247">In particular, the entire microscopic removal behaviour is constant over the entire area to be removed.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0248">The required force for the release of the nanostructures of the structured stamp from the embossed nanostructures of the embossed material is in particular also dependent on the size of the nanostructures. The smaller the nanostructures, the larger their total free surface and the greater the adhesive friction to be overcome between the nanostructures of the structured stamp and the embossed nanostructures of the embossed material. Furthermore, the aspect ratio, i.e. the ratio between the height and the width or length of the structures, plays a decisive role. Such considerations are chiefly of importance when the nanostructure density is a function of the location.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0249">The required force for the release of the nanostructures can be measured precisely by the force-measuring sensors, which are located in particular in the removal means and/or in the embossing element, and can be regulated by the control systems present. The direction and magnitude of the removal force can be controlled in a targeted manner by a targeted interaction of the force and position control of the roller stamp and the remaining removal elements. This can take place dynamically during the removal process either by means of a formula or by means of a control loop and the establishment of limiting parameters. Already measured and/or calculated removal forces are preferably used as limiting parameters. If a force exceeds or falls below the correspondingly predefined limiting value, the desired setpoint value is immediately reset by the control loop.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0250">It may be necessary to apply an inhomogeneous linear force to the embossing element during the deformation action depending on the nanostructure density. It would be conceivable, for example, for the nanostructures to become denser along the y-direction from the left-hand side to the right-hand side. The required release force thus increases along the y-direction from left to right. Accordingly, a greater force must be applied to the structured stamp on the right-hand side. This is most easily brought about by the fact that a constant, homogeneous force is applied to the clamping bar along the entire length of the y-direction via the removal elements connected to it, but that the embossing element presses against the structured stamp on the right-hand side with a smaller force compared to the left-hand side during the removal. The resultant release force is thus greater on the right-hand side.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0251">Force-measuring sensors can be used to measure the force, in particular the linear force. A measurement of an averaged force or the course of a force along the line on which the linear force acts is conceivable. The embossing process can preferably be controlled and optimised by measuring the force that the embossing roller exerts on the embossing material.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0252">If the embossing element is designed as a roller, the roller can in particular comprise a coating. The coating can have a favourable effect on the embossing and removal behaviour. Soft coatings, in particular, permit a local deformation of the embossing element and thus prevent an excessively strong action on the embossed nanostructures of the embossing material. The coating material has a Vickers hardness less than 10,000, preferably less than 5000, still more preferably less than 2000, still more preferably less than 500, most preferably less than 100, with utmost preference less than 50. The E-modulus of the coating material is less than 1000 GPa, preferably less than 500 GPa, still more preferably less than 200 GPa, most preferably less than 100 GPa, with utmost preference less than 10 GPa.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0253">A further preferred embodiment is a roller holding fixture (also referred to generally as an embossing element suspension system or embossing element suspension device). The embossing element suspension system is designed in such a way that a force acting on the stamp or the carrier can be adjusted in a targeted manner by means of a counterforce. A very precise and easy control of the force acting on the stamp and/or the carrier is thus advantageously made possible. The embossing element suspension device can be constituted as a rotatably mounted rocker or as a rotatably mounted carrier. Alternatively, the embossing element suspension device can be constituted as a spiral.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0254">Features of the device and/or the structured stamp disclosed according to the device are also deemed to be disclosed as features of the method and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0255">Further advantages, features and details of the invention emerge from the following description of preferred examples of embodiment and with the aid of the drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0101" num="0256"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a diagrammatic cross-sectional view of a first embodiment of the present invention, i.e. an inventive first process step of the alignment of an inventive structured stamp relative to an embossing material applied on a substrate,</p><p id="p-0102" num="0257"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a diagrammatic cross-sectional view of an inventive second process step of the approach of the structured stamp towards the embossing material to the embossed,</p><p id="p-0103" num="0258"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a diagrammatic cross-sectional view of a third process step of the force-application by an embossing element on the structured stamp (start of embossing),</p><p id="p-0104" num="0259"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a diagrammatic view of the process step according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> at the end of embossing,</p><p id="p-0105" num="0260"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a diagrammatic view of a first apparatus according to the invention in a first position,</p><p id="p-0106" num="0261"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a diagrammatic view of a first apparatus in a second position,</p><p id="p-0107" num="0262"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a diagrammatic view of a first apparatus in a third position, in particular a removal position,</p><p id="p-0108" num="0263"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a diagrammatic, enlarged view of a sub-region between the structured stamp and the embossing material,</p><p id="p-0109" num="0264"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a diagrammatic view of a module for a second apparatus,</p><p id="p-0110" num="0265"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>a </i></figref>shows as a diagrammatic front view of a second apparatus according to the invention, designed for a step-and-repeat process,</p><p id="p-0111" num="0266"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a diagrammatic plan view of the second apparatus according to the invention,</p><p id="p-0112" num="0267"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a diagrammatic linear representation of a first embossing element suspension system according to the invention,</p><p id="p-0113" num="0268"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a diagrammatic linear representation of a second embossing element suspension system according to the invention,</p><p id="p-0114" num="0269"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>c </i></figref>shows a diagrammatic linear representation of a third embossing element suspension system,</p><p id="p-0115" num="0270"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a diagrammatic representation of the use of the first embossing element suspension system according to the invention in a first position,</p><p id="p-0116" num="0271"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a diagrammatic representation of the embossing element suspension system in a second position, and</p><p id="p-0117" num="0272"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>c </i></figref>shows a diagrammatic representation of the embossing element suspension system and a third position.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0118" num="0273">Advantages and features of the invention are marked in the figures with reference numbers identifying the latter in each case according to embodiments of the invention, wherein components or features with an identical or identically acting function are marked with identical reference numbers.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0119" num="0274">The features according to the invention are not represented true to scale in the figures, in order to be able to represent primarily the function of the individual features.
