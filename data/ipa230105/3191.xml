A modern wind turbine typically includes a tower, a generator, a gearbox, a nacelle, and a rotor including one or more rotor blades. The rotor blades capture kinetic energy from wind using known foil principles and transmit the kinetic energy through rotational energy to turn a shaft coupling the rotor blades to a gearbox, or if a gearbox is not used, directly to the generator. The generator then converts the mechanical energy to electrical energy that may be deployed to a utility grid.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">During operation, the direction of the wind which powers the wind turbine may change. The wind turbine may thus adjust the nacelle through, for example, a yaw adjustment about a longitudinal axis of the tower to maintain alignment with the wind direction. In addition, the wind turbine may adjust a pitch angle of one or more of the rotor blades via a pitch drive mechanism configured with a pitch bearing to change the angle of the blades with respect to the wind.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typical pitch drive mechanisms include pitch drive motor, a pitch drive gearbox, and a pitch drive pinion. In such configurations, the pitch drive motor is coupled to the pitch drive gearbox so that the pitch drive motor imparts mechanical force to the pitch drive gearbox. Similarly, the pitch drive gearbox may be coupled to the pitch drive pinion for rotation therewith. The pitch drive pinion may, in turn, be in rotational engagement with the pitch bearing coupled between the hub and a corresponding rotor blade such that rotation of the pitch drive pinion causes rotation of the pitch bearing. Thus, in such embodiments, rotation of the pitch drive motor drives the pitch drive gearbox and the pitch drive pinion, thereby rotating the pitch bearing and the rotor blade about the pitch axis.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Since the pitch bearing allows the rotor blades to move, failure of one of the pitch bearings requires a turbine shut down event, thereby decreasing annual energy production. Pitch bearing failures may occur for a variety of reasons, including for example, loading due to turbulence, shear, thrust, etc., pitching activity (ball bunching, pitch travel, the number of pitch cycles, etc.), bearing design, and/or lubrication. In addition, pitch bearings are very costly to replace in the event of a failure due to the need of a large crane.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, the present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for detecting pitch bearing anomalies in a wind turbine using signals from the pitch motors so as to avoid a failure event.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method for preventing a pitch bearing failure of a pitch system of a wind turbine. The method includes monitoring, via at least one sensor, one or more electrical signals of a pitch motor of a pitch drive mechanism of the pitch system that drives a pitch bearing of the pitch system. The method also includes analyzing, via the controller, the one or more electrical signals of the pitch motor so as to remove noise and amplify outliers. Moreover, the method includes estimating bearing friction of the pitch bearing using the analyzed one or more electrical signals of the pitch motor. As such, the method includes implementing, via the controller, a control action when the estimated bearing friction of the pitch bearing indicates an anomaly in the pitch bearing.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment, the electrical signal(s) may include, for example, current, voltage, power, and/or torque. In another embodiment, the filter(s) may include a low-pass filter, a high-pass filter, a band-pass filter or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, in an embodiment, analyzing the electrical signal(s) of the pitch motor so as to remove the noise and amplify outliers may include filtering the electrical signal(s) of the pitch motor over the predetermined time period. For example, in one embodiment, filtering the electrical signal(s) of the pitch motor over the predetermined time period may include determining a mean drift in the electrical signal(s) of the pitch motor over the predetermined time period and removing the mean drift from the electrical signal(s) of the pitch motor for the predetermined time period to reduce noise of the one or more operational signals due to an aerodynamic torsional moment on the rotor blade.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, filtering the electrical signal(s) of the pitch motor over the predetermined time period may include removing noise due to pitch accelerating torque by detecting a component of motor torque leading pitch rate in phase by 90 degrees and removing the component from the one or more electrical signals, removing noise due to aerodynamic steady state torsional torque by detecting mean drift in motor torque and removing the mean drift from the one or more electrical signals, and normalizing a metric of friction with pitch travel and bearing load.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In further embodiments, estimating the bearing friction of the pitch bearing using the analyzed one or more electrical signals of the pitch motor may include generating, via the controller, a predictive computer model of the pitch bearing using the electrical signal(s) of the pitch motor and one or more operational signals of the pitch system. For example, in an embodiment, the operational signal(s) of the pitch system may include temperature, ball bearing friction, cage stress, operational hours, thrust, brake activation, or pitching activity of the pitch drive mechanism. More specifically, the pitching activity may include pitch motor energy per degree of pitch travel, amount of pitching, pitch angle, or any other suitable pitching activity.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In additional embodiments, the electrical signal(s) of the pitch motor comprises the current. In such embodiments, analyzing the electrical signal(s) of the pitch motor so as to remove noise and amplify outliers may include altering the current using at least one of a root-mean-square, a standard deviation, or power of the pitch motor to obtain an altered current value and generating a heat map of the pitch bearing as a function of wind speed and time for the predetermined time period using the altered current value.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In several embodiments, estimating the bearing friction of the pitch bearing using the analyzed one or more electrical signals of the pitch motor may include determining a frictional power loss of the pitch bearing from the heat map. In another embodiment, the method may include generating the heat map of the pitch bearing using a digital twin model.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Thus, in certain embodiments, implementing the control action when the estimated bearing friction of the pitch bearing indicates an anomaly in the pitch bearing may include implementing the control action when the frictional power loss of the pitch bearing exceeds a predetermined threshold.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a system for preventing a pitch bearing failure of a pitch system of a wind turbine. The system includes at least one sensor configured for monitoring one or more electrical signals of a pitch motor of a pitch drive mechanism of the pitch system that drives a pitch bearing of the pitch system. The system also includes a controller communicatively coupled to the sensor(s). The controller includes at least one processor configured to perform a plurality of operations, including but not limited to analyzing the one or more electrical signals of the pitch motor so as to remove noise and amplify outliers, estimating bearing friction of the pitch bearing using the analyzed one or more electrical signals of the pitch motor, and implementing a control action when the estimated bearing friction of the pitch bearing indicates an anomaly in the pitch bearing. It should also be understood that the system may further include any of the additional features and/or steps as described herein.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims.

Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In general, the present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for detecting pitch bearing anomalies in a wind turbine using signals from the pitch motors so as to avoid a failure event. As generally understood, pitch motors move wind turbine rotor blades. Thus, the signals from such motors (e.g. current, voltage, power, air-gap torque, temperature, pitch travel, etc.) offer valuable insight and can be used in numerous ways according to the present disclosure. For example, in an embodiment, the pitch motor signals can be used to estimate bearing friction and detect various bearing and pitch motor failure modes causes by, e.g. lack of lubrication, grease leakage, seal break, cage overlap, cage protrusion and liberation, ball bunching, raceway degradation and truncation, ball wear/breaking, pitch motor degradation, etc. Further, the systems and methods of the present disclosure can reduce noise in such data by averaging and emphasizing outliers to develop a time-varying covariate that can guide inspections, life extending mitigations like debris removal, greasing, resealing, prognostics on when a bearing may fail, and replacement scheduling for greatest crane productivity.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In further embodiments, the pitch signals can be used to estimate aerodynamic torsional torque by measuring pitch motor counter torque, which can be used to detect blade misalignment, blade wear, icing and wind estimation. Moreover, the pitch signals can be used to detect pitch motor control instability and torsional resonance instability in blades as well as to estimate blade torsional frequency. In addition, by collecting the pitch signals, pitching activity can also be monitored and flagged if too high, since increased pitching activity can be caused by closed-loop instability.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In still further embodiments, the pitch signals can be normalized for pitch travel and used to estimate net bearing tribology parameters such as friction coefficient, slip at maximum friction, power loss in frictional hysteresis and so on, which may help further differentiate and pinpoint failure modes. Moreover, the pitch signals can be used to estimate the contribution to pitch torque due to gravity and blade bending, use such to estimate blade flap stiffness and blade deflection and possibly shear.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates perspective view of one embodiment of a wind turbine <b>10</b> according to the present disclosure. As shown, the wind turbine <b>10</b> includes a tower <b>12</b> extending from a support surface <b>14</b>, a nacelle <b>16</b> mounted on the tower <b>12</b>, and a rotor <b>18</b> coupled to the nacelle <b>16</b>. The rotor <b>18</b> includes a rotatable hub <b>20</b> and at least one rotor blade <b>22</b> coupled to and extending outwardly from the hub <b>20</b>. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the rotor <b>18</b> includes three rotor blades <b>22</b>. However, in an alternative embodiment, the rotor <b>18</b> may include more or less than three rotor blades <b>22</b>. Each rotor blade <b>22</b> may be spaced about the hub <b>20</b> to facilitate rotating the rotor <b>18</b> to enable kinetic energy to be transferred from the wind into usable mechanical energy, and subsequently, electrical energy. For instance, the hub <b>20</b> may be rotatably coupled to an electric generator <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) positioned within the nacelle <b>16</b> to permit electrical energy to be produced.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a simplified, internal view of one embodiment of the nacelle <b>16</b> of the wind turbine <b>10</b> is illustrated. As shown, a generator <b>24</b> may be disposed within the nacelle <b>16</b>. In general, the generator <b>24</b> may be coupled to the rotor <b>18</b> of the wind turbine <b>10</b> for generating electrical power from the rotational energy generated by the rotor <b>18</b>. For example, the rotor <b>18</b> may include a main shaft <b>40</b> coupled to the hub <b>20</b> for rotation therewith. The generator <b>24</b> may then be coupled to the main shaft <b>40</b> such that rotation of the main shaft <b>40</b> drives the generator <b>24</b>. For instance, in the illustrated embodiment, the generator <b>24</b> includes a generator shaft <b>42</b> rotatably coupled to the main shaft <b>40</b> through a gearbox <b>44</b>. However, in other embodiments, it should be appreciated that the generator shaft <b>42</b> may be rotatably coupled directly to the main shaft <b>40</b>. Alternatively, the generator <b>24</b> may be directly rotatably coupled to the main shaft <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">It should be appreciated that the main shaft <b>40</b> may generally be supported within the nacelle <b>16</b> by a support frame or bedplate <b>46</b> positioned atop the wind turbine tower <b>12</b>. For example, the main shaft <b>40</b> may be supported by the bedplate <b>46</b> via a pair of pillow blocks <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> mounted to the bedplate <b>46</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the wind turbine <b>10</b> may also include a turbine control system or a turbine controller <b>26</b> within the nacelle <b>16</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the turbine controller <b>26</b> is disposed within a control cabinet <b>52</b> mounted to a portion of the nacelle <b>16</b>. However, it should be appreciated that the turbine controller <b>26</b> may be disposed at any location on or in the wind turbine <b>10</b>, at any location on the support surface <b>14</b> or generally at any other location. The turbine controller <b>26</b> may generally be configured to control the various operating modes (e.g., start-up or shut-down sequences) and/or components of the wind turbine <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Each rotor blade <b>22</b> may also include a pitch adjustment mechanism <b>32</b> configured to rotate each rotor blade <b>22</b> about its pitch axis <b>34</b>. Further, each pitch adjustment mechanism <b>32</b> may include a pitch drive motor <b>33</b> (e.g., any suitable electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic motor), a pitch drive gearbox <b>35</b>, and a pitch drive pinion <b>37</b>. In such embodiments, the pitch drive motor <b>33</b> may be coupled to the pitch drive gearbox <b>35</b> so that the pitch drive motor <b>33</b> imparts mechanical force to the pitch drive gearbox <b>35</b>. Similarly, the pitch drive gearbox <b>35</b> may be coupled to the pitch drive pinion <b>37</b> for rotation therewith. The pitch drive pinion <b>37</b> may, in turn, be in rotational engagement with a pitch bearing <b>54</b> coupled between the hub <b>20</b> and a corresponding rotor blade <b>22</b> such that rotation of the pitch drive pinion <b>37</b> causes rotation of the pitch bearing <b>54</b>. Thus, in such embodiments, rotation of the pitch drive motor <b>33</b> drives the pitch drive gearbox <b>35</b> and the pitch drive pinion <b>37</b>, thereby rotating the pitch bearing <b>54</b> and the rotor blade <b>22</b> about the pitch axis <b>34</b>. Similarly, the wind turbine <b>10</b> may include one or more yaw drive mechanisms <b>38</b> communicatively coupled to the controller <b>26</b>, with each yaw drive mechanism(s) <b>38</b> being configured to change the angle of the nacelle <b>16</b> relative to the wind (e.g., by engaging a yaw bearing <b>56</b> of the wind turbine <b>10</b>).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further, the turbine controller <b>26</b> may also be communicatively coupled to each pitch adjustment mechanism <b>32</b> of the wind turbine <b>10</b> (one of which is shown) through a separate or integral pitch controller <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) for controlling and/or altering the pitch angle of the rotor blades <b>22</b> (i.e., an angle that determines a perspective of the rotor blades <b>22</b> with respect to the direction <b>28</b> of the wind).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, one or more sensors <b>57</b>, <b>58</b> may be provided on the wind turbine <b>10</b>.

However, it should be appreciated that the disclosed method <b>100</b> may be implemented using any other suitable pitch system now known or later developed in the art. In addition, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts steps performed in a particular order for purposes of illustration and discussion, the methods described herein are not limited to any particular order or arrangement. One skilled in the art, using the disclosures provided herein, will appreciate that various steps of the methods can be omitted, rearranged, combined and/or adapted in various ways.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown at (<b>102</b>), the method <b>100</b> includes monitoring, via at least one sensor (e.g. sensor(s) <b>57</b>), one or more electrical signals of the pitch motor <b>33</b> of the pitch drive mechanism <b>32</b> of the pitch system <b>70</b>. For example, in an embodiment, the electrical signal(s) may include, for example, current, voltage, power, and/or torque. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the electrical signal(s) may be pitch current.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, as shown at (<b>104</b>), the method <b>100</b> includes filtering, via at least one filter, the electrical signal(s) of the pitch motor <b>33</b> over a predetermined time period. For example, in an embodiment, the filter(s) may include a low-pass filter, a high-pass filter, a band-pass filter or combinations thereof. More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the pitch current may be filtered via a low-pass filter <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, as shown at (<b>106</b>), the method <b>100</b> includes analyzing, e.g. via the pitch system <b>70</b> and/or the turbine controller <b>26</b>, the electrical signal(s) of the pitch motor <b>33</b> so as to remove noise and amplify outliers. For example, in an embodiment, the method <b>100</b> may include determining a mean drift in the electrical signal(s) of the pitch motor <b>33</b> over the predetermined time period and removing the mean drift from the electrical signal(s) of the pitch motor <b>33</b> for the predetermined time period to reduce noise of the operational signal(s) due to an aerodynamic torsional moment on the rotor blade <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In another embodiment, the method <b>100</b> may also include removing noise due to pitch accelerating torque by detecting a component of motor torque leading pitch rate in phase by ninety degrees (90&#xb0;) and removing the component from the electrical signal(s). Moreover, the method <b>100</b> may include removing noise due to aerodynamic steady state torsional torque by detecting mean drift in motor torque and removing the mean drift from the electrical signal(s). In such embodiments, the method <b>100</b> may include normalizing a metric of friction with pitch travel and bearing load, e.g. so as to further improve diagnostic accuracy and make the method <b>100</b> robust to variations in pitch travel and loads.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus, as shown at block <b>154</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in an embodiment, the pitch system <b>70</b> may be configured to analyze the electrical signal(s) of the pitch motor <b>33</b> by altering the pitch current using at least one of a root-mean-square, a standard deviation, and/or power of the pitch motor <b>33</b> to obtain an altered current value <b>156</b>. As shown at <b>158</b>, the turbine controller <b>26</b> may then determine a maximum value over a certain time interval, such as 10 minutes. Such maximum values may also be stored in a global data repository <b>162</b>, e.g. of a farm-level controller <b>160</b>. Thus, by monitoring the maximum values of pitch current, the system <b>150</b> provides improved monitoring of pitch bearing failures.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">More specifically, referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, as shown at (<b>108</b>), the method <b>100</b> further includes estimating bearing friction of the pitch bearing <b>54</b> using the analyzed electrical signal(s) of the pitch motor <b>33</b>. For example, in an embodiment, the bearing friction may be estimated by generating, via the turbine controller <b>26</b>, a predictive computer model of the pitch bearing <b>54</b> using the electrical signal(s) of the pitch motor <b>33</b> and one or more operational signals of the pitch system <b>70</b>. For example, in an embodiment, the operational signal(s) of the pitch system <b>70</b> may include temperature, ball bearing friction, cage stress, operational hours, thrust, brake activation, or pitching activity of the pitch drive mechanism <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the pitching activity may include pitch rate, pitch motor energy per degree of pitch travel, amount of pitching, pitch angle, or any other suitable pitching activity. Further, as shown at <b>166</b>, the pitch torque may be determined as a function of the pitch current. In addition, as shown at <b>168</b>, the pitch rate may be used to determine the pitch power, e.g. by multiplying the pitch torque by the pitch rate. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the pitch rate may be used to determine the pitch travel, e.g. by determining the absolute value of the pitch rate as shown at <b>170</b>. Moreover, as shown, the pitch travel can also be filtered via a low-pass filter <b>153</b>. The outputs <b>172</b>, <b>173</b> of the low-pass filters <b>152</b>, <b>153</b> represent an average frictional power and an average pitch travel rate, respectively. Thus, as show, the controller <b>26</b> can determine the frictional work <b>176</b>, which can be used to indicate an anomaly in the pitch bearing <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Thus, in certain embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>C</figref>, the method <b>100</b> may include generating a heat map <b>164</b> of the pitch bearing <b>54</b> as a function of wind speed and time for the predetermined time period using the altered current value. For example, in an embodiment, the method <b>100</b> may include generating the heat map <b>164</b> of the pitch bearing <b>54</b> using a digital twin model. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>C</figref>, a damaged pitch bearing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>) can be easily detected, e.g. by comparing heat maps for all pitch bearings <b>54</b> across all of the rotor blades <b>22</b> of the wind turbine <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, as shown at (<b>110</b>), the method <b>100</b> includes implementing, via the turbine controller <b>26</b>, a control action when the estimated bearing friction of the pitch bearing <b>54</b> indicates an anomaly in the pitch bearing <b>54</b>.
