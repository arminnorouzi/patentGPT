The use of subscriber identification module (SIM) cards is essential for transmitting and receiving data through a cellular network. In order to deploy and change SIM cards at such device may demand physical access to the device and SIM cards and impose expensive labour costs. In addition, the logistics involved, such as recoding SIM card usage, choosing the lowest tariff SIM card, and determining when to change SIM card impose additional labour cost. It is desirable to have methods and systems that are able to reduce the labour cost and lower the tariff cost.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention discloses methods and systems for communicating at a cellular router between a first wireless communication module and a first subscriber identity module (SIM). According to the present invention, the cellular router comprises at least one wireless communication module, at least one processing unit, at least one memory; at least one non-transitory computer readable storage medium for storing program instructions executable by the at least one processing unit for receiving a first request from the first wireless communication module. The cellular router then encapsulates the first request in a first modified request and sends the first modified request to a first communication apparatus. After sending the first modified request to the first communication apparatus, the cellular router waits for a first modified reply. While waiting for the first modified reply the cellular router sends at least one halt message to the first wireless communication module after a first time threshold. When the cellular router receives the first modified reply, the cellular router decapsulates the first modified reply to retrieve a first reply and sends the first reply to the first wireless communication module. For the present invention, the first modified reply is a reply to the first modified request. The first wireless communication module is housed inside the cellular router or coupled to the cellular router and the first SIM is not housed in the cellular router.</p><p id="p-0006"

Interconnected networks <b>103</b> can be a foreign locally accessible cellular network or an interconnection of cellular networks. A foreign locally accessible network is a home network associated with the local SIM cards in the overseas region. The home network is accessible by international SIM cards but with roaming charges.

In one variant, request <b>402</b> is sent using User Datagram Protocol (UDP) when speed is more important than reliability, since UDP is a connectionless protocol the speed becomes a trade-off over reliability unlike TCP. Furthermore, UDP transmission of request <b>402</b> can be used in a network environment where router MCU <b>306</b> wants to broadcast or multicast request <b>402</b> in order to connect to more than one SIM Bank MCU <b>314</b>.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">After 0.8 seconds for example, router MCU <b>306</b> reaches its time threshold <b>403</b><i>a</i>. It should be appreciated that there is no limitation to at how many seconds time thresholds <b>403</b> could be set as long as it is shorter than the timeout period of wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a</i>. Time thresholds <b>403</b> may be predetermined based on instructions from a user or administrator of cellular router <b>300</b>. Time thresholds <b>403</b> may also be preconfigured by the manufacturer of cellular router <b>300</b>. At one example, the time threshold for router MCU <b>306</b> could be set at 0.8 seconds when the timeout period of a wireless communication module is set to 1.2 seconds. At 0.8 seconds, when there is no reply received from SIM Bank MCU <b>314</b>, router MCU <b>306</b> transmits halt command <b>404</b><i>a </i>to wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a</i>. Halt command <b>404</b><i>a </i>is used to instruct wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a </i>to wait further. When wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a </i>receives halt command <b>404</b><i>a</i>, it will continue to wait for a reply for a period of time.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In this illustration, if a reply is not yet received within 0.8 seconds, router MCU <b>306</b> again reaches its time threshold <b>403</b><i>b </i>i.e. 1.6 seconds which is 0.8 seconds after halt command <b>404</b><i>a </i>being sent.

As reply <b>406</b> has already been sent to wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a</i>, router MCU <b>306</b> then stops transmitting halt commands to wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a </i>since there is no need to extend the timeout period for reply <b>405</b> anymore. Wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a </i>then performs according to the reply received. In another scenario, reply <b>405</b> is still not received within the third extended timeout period and router MCU <b>306</b> again approaches a time threshold. In such case for every time router MCU <b>306</b> approaches its time thresholds without receiving a reply from SIM Bank MCU <b>314</b>, router MCU <b>306</b> transmits halt commands to wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a </i>to reset the timer and tries to extend the timeout period of wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a</i>. As a result, the 1.2 seconds timeout period can be extended to one minute for example. Furthermore, there is no limitation that the timeout period for wireless communication can only be extended to one minute. The timeout period can be extended beyond one minute when desired, but limited by the requirements of wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The extension of the timeout period can be predetermined based on instructions from a user or administrator of cellular router <b>300</b>. In another example, the number of halt commands sent by router MCU <b>306</b> has reached a halt command sent threshold (HST) and router MCU <b>306</b> still does not receive a reply from SIM Bank MCU <b>314</b>, router MCU <b>306</b> discontinues transmitting the halt commands to wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a</i>. One of the reasons for discontinuing sending halt commands after HST is reached is to reduce the loading on router MCU <b>306</b> because wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a </i>accepts only a number of halt commands in a certain period of time, for example ten halt commands in eight seconds. Depending on the model of wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a</i>, it may ignore incoming halt commands after HST is reached. In certain model of wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a</i>, after HST is reached, wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a </i>will reset the corresponding SIM card. The value of HST depends on the specification of a wireless communication module and may vary for different wireless communication modules. The time interval among and the number of halt commands to be sent can be predetermined based on instructions from a user or administrator of cellular router <b>300</b>.

For example, in step <b>931</b>, cellular router <b>800</b> sends a request to SIM directory server <b>804</b>, then SIM directory server <b>804</b> forwards the request to the SIM bank holding the selected SIM card. For illustration purpose only, SIM bank B holds the selected SIM card. Therefore, SIM directory server <b>804</b> in step <b>932</b> forwards the request to SIM bank B. When the selected SIM card replies with a response, an error message or a rejection, the reply is forwarded by SIM bank B to SIM directory server <b>804</b> in step <b>933</b>. Then SIM directory server <b>804</b> forwards or relays the reply to cellular router <b>800</b> in step <b>934</b>. Comparing to the embodiment illustrated in steps <b>920</b>-<b>923</b>, the benefits of the present embodiments of using SIM directory server <b>804</b> for relaying includes higher security and simpler management. However, the disadvantages include larger latency.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">In another embodiment, cellular router <b>800</b> does not directly communicate with a SIM bank. Further SIM directory server <b>804</b> may not know which SIM card is available when a request is received from cellular router <b>800</b> in step <b>941</b>. The request may comprise a SIM card request. In steps <b>942</b> and <b>943</b>, SIM directory server <b>804</b> requests for SIM card availability and forwards a plurality of requests, which are based on the request received in step <b>941</b>, to SIM bank A and SIM bank B respectively at about the same time. One of the benefits for sending the plurality of requests to both SIM bank A and SIM bank B at about the same time is to reduce waiting time in case one of the requests was not received successfully by the corresponding SIM bank or one the SIM banks is not operating orderly. One of the disadvantages for sending the plurality of requests to both SIM bank A and SIM bank B at about the same time is consuming more resources. In step <b>944</b>, SIM bank A sends a response in response to request received in step <b>942</b>. Similarly, in step <b>945</b>, SIM bank A sends a response in response to request received in step <b>943</b>. When both responses in steps <b>944</b> and <b>945</b> provide SIM card availability information, SIM directory server <b>804</b> may select one of SIM card availability information to forward to cellular router <b>800</b>. Therefore, only one SIM card is being selected and to be used by cellular router <b>800</b>. For example, SIM directory server <b>804</b> selects SIM card availability information embedded in the response received in step <b>944</b> from SIM bank A, SIM directory server <b>804</b> forwards the SIM card availability information in step <b>946</b> to cellular router <b>800</b>.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">Regarding the SIM card availability information received in step <b>945</b> from SIM bank B, processing unit of SIM directory server <b>804</b> may not use it further or use it later for cellular router <b>800</b> or another cellular router.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates a more detailed process of steps <b>910</b>-<b>911</b> and steps <b>912</b>-<b>913</b>. In process <b>1001</b>, SIM directory server <b>804</b> selects a SIM bank to communicate with. There are myriads of ways to select the SIM bank. For example, SIM directory server <b>804</b> may select a SIM bank based on the period of time of last communication. In another example, SIM directory server <b>804</b> may select the SIM bank periodically. In another example, SIM directory server <b>804</b> may select the SIM bank after receiving a request to connect or connection termination from a cellular router. In process <b>1002</b>, SIM directory server <b>804</b> sends messages to the selected SIM bank for collecting status and/or for instructing the selected SIM bank. For illustration purpose, the selected SIM bank is SIM bank B. In one example, SIM directory server <b>804</b> may collect SIM card availability information. SIM card availability information may include: number of SIM cards available for use, number of SIM cards being used, status of one or more SIM cards, location of one or more SIM cards, address of one or more SIM cards, position of one or more SIM cards and billing information of one or more SIM cards. In one example, SIM directory server <b>804</b> may collect information regarding a connection established using one of the SIM cards in SIM bank B with a cellular router. In one example, SIM directory server <b>804</b> may instruct SIM bank B to perform management on one or more SIM cards, including checking health of a SIM card; to disconnect a connection established between a cellular router with a SIM card; to reset a SIM card electronically; to reset a SIM card mechanically. Processes <b>1001</b> and <b>1002</b> may be performed together using one message or in sequence. At process <b>1003</b>, SIM directory server <b>804</b> may receive a response from SIM bank B. The response may contain status of SIM bank B, status of one or more SIM cards in SIM bank B, execution results according to the instruction, error message and one or more messages received from one or more SIM cards in SIM bank B. Based on the response, processing unit(s) of SIM directory server <b>804</b> may update a database, further instruction SIM bank B, send one or more messages to one or more cellular routers. There is no limitation that SIM bank B must send a response to SIM directory server <b>804</b>. For example, SIM bank B may be out of order and is not able to send a response. In another example, processing unit of SIM bank B may determine, according to instructions stored in non-transitory computer readable storage media, not to send a response.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">The database being updated in process <b>1003</b> may perform as a directory for looking up a suitable SIM card. When cellular router <b>800</b> sends the request at step <b>200</b>, cellular router <b>800</b> may not know which SIM card it should use. Through the database, processing unit of SIM directory server <b>804</b> is able to identify an available SIM card for cellular router <b>800</b>. More details of the database will be described in process <b>1112</b>.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates a more detailed process of steps <b>920</b>-<b>921</b>. At process <b>1111</b>, a request of using a SIM card from cellular router <b>800</b> is received by SIM directory server <b>804</b>. When cellular router <b>800</b> first needs a SIM card for establishing a wireless communication with a wireless network service provider, cellular router <b>800</b> sends a request to SIM directory server <b>804</b>. At this point, the processing unit of cellular router <b>800</b> has no information of which particular SIM card to use. The processing unit of cellular router <b>800</b> may embed preferences of a SIM card in the request. The processing unit of cellular router <b>800</b> may further embed other information, including location of cellular router <b>800</b> and other SIM cards that are being used by cellular router <b>800</b>, in the request. The request may be encrypted.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">In one variant, processing unit of cellular router <b>800</b> may send a plurality of the same request to SIM directory server <b>804</b> in order to increase the reliability that the request is received by SIM directory server <b>804</b>. There is no limitation on the communications technology or media to be sued by sending the request. For example, cellular router <b>800</b> may send the plurality of the same request through a DSL communication service, a 4G/LTE communication service and an IEEE 802.11 wireless network. Processing unit of SIM directory server <b>804</b> may process the first arrived request of the plurality of the same request and ignore subsequent arrived requests of the plurality of the same request.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">At process <b>1112</b>, processing unit of SIM directory server <b>804</b> selects a SIM card for cellular router <b>800</b>. The selection may be based on location of cellular router <b>800</b>, wireless communication service providers accessible by cellular router <b>800</b>, tariffs, time, date, estimated reliability between cellular router <b>800</b> and a SIM bank, location of a SIM bank, and/or usage restriction. There is no limit where the selected SIM card has to located at unless there is a such selection criteria. For example, SIM directory server <b>804</b> may select a SIM card from one of SIM bank A and SIM bank B. When there are additional SIM banks available, SIM directory server <b>804</b> may use a SIM card from an additional SIM bank.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">In more details, the database in SIM directory server <b>804</b> is used to select the SIM card. As the database has availability information of SIM cards located in SIM banks <b>805</b>, processing unit of SIM directory server <b>804</b> may use the database to select a SIM card quickly when receiving a request from cellular router <b>800</b>. In the database, information stored related to a SIM card may include phone number, IMSI, Mobile Country Code (MCC), a Mobile Network Code (MNC), location of the SIM card, identity of the SIM bank holding the SIM card, IP address of the SIM bank, IP address of the SIM socket with the SIM card, tariff, data plan limited, data usage, remaining allowed data usage, wireless technology allowed, payment contact, subscription codes, geographical area allowed to be used without incurring roaming charge, and any other information that may help selecting the SIM card.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">For example, based on the location information of cellular router <b>800</b> in the request, SIM directory server <b>804</b> may select a SIM card that would not incur roaming charge in the location of cellular router <b>800</b>.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">It is preferred that one of substantial criteria is tariffs. In one example, a SIM card that has lowest tariff for cellular router <b>800</b> to use is selected. For example, cellular router <b>800</b> is operating in Los Angeles. SIM directory server <b>804</b> will select a SIM card that has lowest tariff in Los Angeles for cellular router <b>800</b>. When cellular router moves from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, for example, another SIM card may be selected in order to achieve lowest tariff.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">In another example, based on one or more cellular networks found by cellular router <b>800</b> and sent to SIM directory server <b>804</b>, SIM directory server <b>804</b> may select a SIM card that has a MCC and a MNC matching one of the one or more cellular networks. In one variant, SIM directory server <b>804</b> may use different criteria to selects a SIM. For example, in addition to be based on the location of cellular router <b>800</b>, SIM directory server <b>804</b> may select a SIM card based on not only the location of cellular router <b>800</b> but also the remaining allowed data usage of a SIM card.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">Information of the selected SIM card may be retrieved from the database of the SIM bank which holds the selected SIM card. The information may also be already provided to SIM directory server <b>804</b> before the SIM card is selected. For example, the information may be stored in a database locally accessible to the SIM directory server <b>804</b>. Once the SIM card is selected, SIM directory server <b>804</b> may retrieve the information from the database. The information may be used to facilitate the selection.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">In one variant, after a SIM card is selected, SIM directory server <b>804</b> may verify whether the selected SIM card is indeed available for use. SIM directory server <b>804</b> may send a request to the SIM bank holding the selected SIM card for verification. In one example, the SIM bank will send a request to the SIM bank holding the selected SIM card is in operation. The SIM bank will then reply to the request of SIM directory server <b>804</b>.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">At process <b>1113</b>, SIM directory server <b>804</b> reply to the request received at process <b>1111</b> with connectivity information. SIM card connectivity information may include identity of a SIM bank, identity of the selected SIM card, IMEI of the selected SIM card, a publicly reachable address of the SIM bank which holds the selected SIM card, a publicly reachable address of the selected SIM card, usage restriction, and/or authentication information. For example, IP address of the SIM banking holding the selected SIM card may be included in the SIM card connectivity information. In another example, a security token with a time limit is sent to both cellular router <b>800</b> and the SIM bank. Cellular router <b>800</b> will then have to authenticate with the SIM bank within the time limit using the security token.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">There is no limitation on the medium and technology communications used for cellular router <b>800</b> to send the request of using a SIM card. For example, the request in process <b>1111</b> may be sent by cellular router <b>800</b> through an Internet connection or a private connection. The request may also be sent through a wireless connection or a wired connection. In one example, the request is sent through network interface <b>310</b> check of cellular router <b>800</b> using an ADSL connection. In another example, the request is sent through one of wireless communication modules <b>307</b> and the connectivity information embedded in reply in process <b>1113</b> is for another wireless communication module of wireless communication modules <b>307</b>. For example, the wireless communication module is wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a </i>and the another wireless communication module is wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>b</i>. Wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a </i>is used to send the request may establish a connection based on a locally available SIM card in cellular router <b>800</b>. The use of locally available SIM card may incur a roaming charge or higher tariff. Therefore, before the wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>b </i>can be used, the use of wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a </i>is restricted. For example, wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a </i>may only be used to communicate with SIM directory server <b>804</b> and SIM banks <b>805</b>. In one variant, there is no restriction on the use of wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">In one embodiment, after one wireless communication module of wireless communication modules <b>307</b> has successfully established a connection to the Internet, cellular router <b>800</b> will repeat (i) steps <b>920</b> to <b>923</b>, (ii) steps <b>931</b>-<b>934</b> or (iii) steps <b>941</b>-<b>946</b> for another wireless communication module. For example, after wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a </i>has used SIM card connectivity information from SIM bank <b>805</b> to establish an Internet connection, processing unit of cellular router <b>800</b> may use wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>a </i>to perform steps <b>931</b>-<b>934</b> to retrieve SIM card connectivity information in order to enable wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>b </i>to connect to the Internet. The SIM card connectivity information for wireless communication module <b>307</b><i>b </i>is originated from a SIM card located in one of the SIM banks.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">In one variant, a SIM bank may have one or more wireless communication modules.
