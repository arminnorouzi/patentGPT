of U.S. application Ser. No. 16/449,275, filed on 21 Jun. 2019, which is incorporated by reference herein.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the processing of a transaction between a merchant and a customer using a point of sale application and an add-on application, and more particularly relates to transitioning the processing of the transaction between the point of sale application and the add-on application.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Point of sale systems are widely used to process transactions between customers and merchants. Functions performed by typical point of sale systems include generating a list of items (or services) to be purchased (sometimes called an invoice or a purchase order), calculating a total amount to be paid by a customer, facilitating the transfer of funds from a customer to a merchant, printing a receipt, etc. Some point of sale systems may also facilitate loyalty programs, providing rewards to customers based on their purchasing history.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, an add-on application running on a point of sale device may monitor a current state (e.g., payment state, refund state, checkout state, etc.) of a user interface of a point of sale application also running on the point of sale device. The monitoring of the current state may include parsing images of the interface using optical character recognition (OCR), computer vision, machine learning or another methodology and/or comparing current fingerprints of the interface with fingerprints taken of the interface during an initial configuration process to determine the current state of the user interface. In response to a determined current state, on-screen overlay buttons may be displayed on the user interface of the point of sale application. Upon recognizing a triggering event associated with the current state of the user interface of the point of sale application, the processing of the transaction may transition from the point of sale application to the add-on application. Example triggering events may include recognizing an intent of the customer or the merchant to start using financial instruments to transfer funds from the customer to the merchant, or refund funds from the merchant back to the customer. One example of a triggering event is the selection of the above-mentioned on-screen overlay button.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Upon taking over the processing of the transaction, the add-on application may extract a total amount from the user interface of the point of sale application (e.g., total amount to be paid by the customer, total amount to be refunded to the customer, etc.). The add-on application may then receive identifying information of the customer, which can be used to link the customer with his/her rewards account (or more generally any account associated with the customer). In the case of a credit card transaction, the credit card number of the customer may be used as the identifying information of the customer and may be used to look-up the rewards account of the customer (specifically, a rewards account not provided by the issuer of the credit card), in which case the &#x201c;login&#x201d; of the customer requires no additional action beyond what a customer is accustomed to doing during a typical credit card transaction. In the case of a cash transaction, a phone number or other identifying information of the customer may be used to look-up the rewards account of the customer.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The add-on application may then process the transaction. In the case of a purchase, the add-on application may facilitate funds to be transferred from the customer to the merchant (e.g., processing a credit card, displaying a user interface to facilitate a cash transaction, etc.). Reward points from the reward account of the customer may also be redeemed to provide the customer with a discount on his/her purchase. In the case of a refund, the add-on application may facilitate funds to be transferred from the merchant to the customer. Upon completion of the processing of the transaction, the add-on application may record information associated with the transaction with the rewards account of the customer (e.g., total amount paid, total amount refunded, items purchase, items refunded, reward points redeemed, reward points earned, etc.).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Upon completion of the processing of the transaction, the add-on application may also return a result of the transaction to the point of sale application by emulating user actions on the user interface of the point of sale application. Emulated user actions on the user interface of the point of sale application may include selection of an &#x201c;other tenders&#x201d; button (or other user interface element) on the user interface of the point of sale application so as to navigate to an accounting screen within which emulated user actions can be performed to input the amount paid by or refunded to the customer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and other embodiments of the invention are more fully described in association with the drawings below.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a block diagram of a point of sale system to process a transaction between a merchant and a customer, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>J</figref> depict screenshots of user interfaces to process a payment using a credit card, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref> depict screenshots of user interfaces to process a cash transaction, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>J</figref> depict screenshots of user interfaces to process a transaction involving the redemption of rewards, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>F</figref> depict screenshots of user interfaces to process a refund, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref> depict screenshots of user interfaces to add a new payment type, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>E</figref> depict screenshots of user interfaces to train the add-on application to recognize various states and elements of a user interface provided by a point of sale application, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts a sequence diagram for processing a transaction between a merchant and a customer using a point of sale application and an add-on application, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts a sequence diagram for processing a payment from a customer using a point of sale application and an add-on application, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts a sequence diagram for processing a transaction involving the redemption of rewards using a point of sale application and an add-on application, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> depicts a sequence diagram for processing a refund to a customer using a point of sale application and an add-on application, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> depicts components of a computer system in which computer readable instructions instantiating the methods of the present invention may be stored and executed.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. Descriptions associated with any one of the figures may be applied to different figures containing like or similar components/steps. While the sequence diagrams each present a series of steps in a certain order, the order of some of the steps may be changed.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts block diagram <b>100</b> of a point of sale system (or more generally, a system for processing a transaction) that is configured process a transaction between merchant <b>112</b> and customer <b>124</b>. The point of sale system may include point of sale device <b>102</b> on which a point of sale application <b>104</b> and an add-on application <b>106</b> may be installed. Point of sale application <b>104</b> (on its own, without any actions from add-on application <b>106</b>) may be used to process one or more transactions between merchant <b>112</b> and customer <b>124</b>. A transaction may include one or more of customer <b>124</b> making a purchase, merchant <b>112</b> processing a purchase for customer <b>124</b>, customer <b>124</b> making a refund, or merchant <b>112</b> processing a refund for customer <b>124</b>. An example of a point of sale application <b>104</b> is Aronium, provided by Aronium of Belgrade, Serbia.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Add-on application <b>106</b> may emulate certain functionality of point of sale application <b>104</b> (e.g., charge a credit card of the customer, ring up a cash transaction). In certain instances, merchant <b>112</b> and/or customer <b>124</b> may be given the choice of either using point of sale application <b>104</b> or add-on application <b>106</b> to process a transaction. In other instances, merchant <b>112</b> and/or customer <b>124</b> may be directed to use add-on application <b>106</b> to process a transaction (or complete the processing of a transaction). Add-on application <b>106</b> may additionally provide functionality that point of sale application <b>104</b> does not offer. For example, add-on application <b>106</b> may enroll customer <b>124</b> in a rewards (or loyalty) program, track the purchases and/or refunds of customer <b>124</b>, and allow customer <b>124</b> to redeem rewards earned through the rewards program. Even if point of sale application <b>104</b> were to offer a rewards program, add-on application <b>106</b> may offer a rewards program with functionality beyond what the rewards program of point of sale application <b>104</b> offers. For example, the rewards program of point of sale application <b>104</b> may be configured to work with a single merchant, whereas the rewards program of add-on application <b>106</b> may be configured to work with multiple merchants, such that rewards earned through one merchant can be redeemed at another merchant. As an additional example, add-on application <b>106</b> may allow merchant <b>112</b> to process transactions with financial institutions that may or may not already be natively supported by point of sale application <b>104</b>, or allow customer <b>124</b> to utilize financial instruments for payment that are not natively supported by point of sale application <b>104</b>, such as contact and contactless EMV credit that may or may not be natively supported by point of sale application <b>104</b>, or alternative payment methods like AliPay&#xae; that similarly may or may not be natively supported by point of sale application <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Once add-on application <b>106</b> is installed on point of sale device <b>102</b>, the processing of a transaction may seamlessly transition between add-on application <b>106</b> and point of sale application <b>104</b>. Importantly, add-on application <b>106</b> does not modify the source code of point of sale application <b>104</b>. Instead, add-on application <b>106</b> is able to operate with point of sale application <b>104</b> by, for example, monitoring the current state of point of sale application <b>104</b>, overlaying or inserting user interface elements (e.g., buttons) into the user interface provided by point of sale application <b>104</b>, presenting user interfaces additional to those of point of sale application <b>104</b>, and/or emulating user actions (e.g., performing mouse clicks, inputting text, etc.) in the user interface of point of sale application <b>104</b>. Such functionality will be described in detail in the description associated with the screenshots presented in the subsequent figures. An example of add-on application <b>106</b> is Fivestars&#xae;, provided by Fivestars&#xae; of San Francisco, Calif.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, point of sale application <b>104</b> and add-on application <b>106</b> may run on operating system <b>110</b> of point of sale device <b>102</b> (i.e., without the use of a web browser <b>108</b> which is shown as an optional component in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In another embodiment, point of sale application <b>104</b> and add-on application <b>106</b> may be browser plugins that run on web browser <b>108</b> of point of sale device <b>102</b>. Web browser <b>108</b>, in turn, may run on operating system <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Merchant <b>112</b> may communicate with point of sale device <b>102</b> via terminal <b>114</b><i>a. </i>Terminal <b>114</b><i>a </i>may include display device <b>116</b><i>a </i>(e.g., an LCD display, a touchscreen display, etc.), card reader <b>118</b><i>a </i>(e.g., a credit card reader, a debit card reader, a gift card reader, etc.), and other input/output (I/O) devices <b>120</b><i>a </i>(e.g., a near-field communication (NFC) reader to communicate with Apple Pay&#xae;, Google Pay&#xae;; a Bluetooth&#xae; or Bluetooth&#xae; low energy device to communicate with contactless alternative payment methods; a cursor controlling device such as a mouse; a video camera to monitor the contents of display device <b>116</b><i>a; </i>a microphone to allow for voice control; etc.). Cash/coin drawer <b>122</b> may also be communicatively coupled to terminal <b>114</b><i>a </i>and/or point of sale device <b>102</b>, and may open in response to an open instruction so as to allow merchant <b>112</b> to provide change to customer <b>124</b> and/or accept a cash payment from customer <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Customer <b>124</b> may communicate with point of sale device <b>102</b> via terminal <b>114</b><i>b. </i>Terminal <b>114</b><i>b </i>may include display device <b>116</b><i>b </i>(e.g., an LCD display, a touchscreen display, etc.), card reader <b>118</b><i>b </i>(e.g., a credit card reader, a debit card reader, a gift card reader, etc.), and other I/O devices <b>120</b><i>b </i>(e.g., a near-field communication (NFC) reader to communicate with Apple Pay&#xae;, Google Pay&#xae;; a Bluetooth&#xae; or Bluetooth&#xae; low energy device to communicate with contactless alternative payment methods; a cursor controlling device such as a mouse; a video camera to monitor the content of display device <b>116</b><i>a; </i>a microphone to allow for voice control; etc.). Cash/coin receptacle and/or dispenser <b>124</b> may also be communicatively coupled to terminal <b>114</b><i>b </i>and/or point of sale device <b>102</b>, and may be configured to provide change to customer <b>124</b> and/or accept a cash payment from customer <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is understood that one or more of the components depicted in diagram <b>100</b> may be optional. For example, in a self-checkout arrangement, merchant <b>112</b>, terminal <b>114</b><i>a </i>and cash/coin drawer <b>122</b> may not be present. It is understood that in a self-checkout arrangement without a cashier, merchant <b>112</b> may more generally refer to the owner of a store or restaurant which may be a person, a group of individuals or an enterprise. Thus, a transaction could be performed between a customer and a merchant, even if a merchant is not physically present at the same location as the customer. A common example of such a transaction is when a person makes an e-commerce purchase on his/her smartphone or home computer. As another example, card reader <b>118</b><i>a </i>of terminal <b>114</b><i>a </i>may be omitted, and a transaction may exclusively rely upon card reader <b>118</b><i>b </i>of terminal <b>114</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Point of sale device <b>102</b>, terminal <b>114</b><i>a </i>and/or terminal <b>114</b><i>b </i>may be communicatively coupled to rewards server <b>128</b> via network <b>126</b>. Network <b>126</b> may be any form of communications means and, in some cases, may be individual communications links, or one or more communications networks, including private networks, public networks and/or virtual private networks over public networks. Rewards server <b>128</b> may be used by add-on application <b>106</b> to facilitate a rewards program. For example, rewards server <b>128</b> may include a database that maps user identifying information (e.g., phone number, credit card number, social security number, first and last name, user login/password, etc.) of a user with the purchase history of a user, reward points of the user and/or product recommendations for the user.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Point of sale device <b>102</b>, terminal <b>114</b><i>a </i>and/or terminal <b>114</b><i>b </i>may also be communicatively coupled to one or more servers <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> that are operated by financial institutions in order to transfer funds between merchant <b>112</b> and customer <b>124</b>. For example, server <b>130</b> may be operated by American Express&#xae;, and server <b>132</b> may be operated by Worldpay&#xae;.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">While terminals <b>114</b><i>a </i>and <b>114</b><i>b </i>are shown to be directly coupled to point of sale device <b>102</b> (e.g., via a cable), it is possible that in other embodiments, terminals <b>114</b><i>a </i>and <b>114</b><i>b </i>are communicatively coupled to point of sale device <b>102</b> via network <b>126</b>, in which point of sale device <b>102</b> might be embodied as a server. It is also possible for terminal <b>114</b><i>a </i>and point of sale device <b>102</b> to be one integral device. It is also possible for terminal <b>114</b><i>b </i>and point of sale device <b>102</b> to be one integral device.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The screenshots below provide detailed examples of user interfaces that may be displayed during the processing of transactions by point of sale device <b>102</b>. In the examples, the screenshots only capture user interfaces that are displayed on display device <b>116</b><i>a </i>and are thus merchant-facing interfaces. Given such merchant-facing interfaces, it is expected that one will be able to modify the merchant-facing interfaces into customer-facing interfaces that are displayed on display device <b>116</b><i>b </i>(e.g., for a self-checkout system). For example, instead of an interface that instructs the merchant to request the customer to swipe his/her credit card, an interface may instead directly instruct the customer to swipe his/her credit card.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>J</figref> depict screenshots of user interfaces to process a payment using a credit card. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> displays screenshot <b>200</b> of an interface from point of sale application <b>104</b> at the beginning of a transaction prior to any items being selected for purchase. User interface element <b>202</b> from add-on application <b>106</b> may be inserted into the user interface from point of sale application <b>104</b>. In order to notify add-on application <b>106</b> that a transaction is beginning, merchant <b>112</b> may select user interface element <b>202</b>, causing the display of an interface provided by add-on application <b>106</b> (depicted in screenshot <b>204</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), and then in the interface depicted in screenshot <b>204</b>, merchant <b>112</b> may select user interface element <b>206</b> (e.g., button with text &#x201c;Create New Sale&#x201d;). Upon selection of user interface element <b>206</b>, the interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> may be depicted again, allowing items to be selected for purchase. It is noted, however, that such action from merchant <b>112</b> to notify add-on application <b>106</b> about the start of a new transaction may be omitted in certain embodiments. For clarity, it is noted that the additional details depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> (e.g., total $115.00) are from a previously completed transaction, and could be omitted from the user interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>. For example, using machine learning, add-on application <b>106</b> may be trained to automatically recognize that a new transaction is about to begin or may begin based on certain characteristics of the user interface of point of sale application <b>104</b> (e.g., total equal to 0, indicating the entry process for a fresh order is at the beginning; no items in cart, similarly indicating a new order can begin, etc.&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> depicts screenshot <b>208</b> of the interface from point of sale application <b>104</b>, after three items have been selected for purchase. In particular, user interface element <b>210</b><i>a </i>(featuring a &#x201c;Fivestars T-Shirt), user interface element <b>210</b><i>b </i>(featuring a &#x201c;Fivestars Bottle Opener&#x201d;) and user interface element <b>210</b><i>c </i>(featuring a &#x201c;Fivestars Scarf&#x201d;) were selected. In a left panel of the interface, the quantity and price of the selected items may be displayed (<b>212</b><i>a, </i><b>212</b><i>b, </i><b>212</b><i>c</i>) along with total <b>214</b> (e.g., 32.00). Certainly, there are other ways that products could be selected for purchase, including the scanning of a barcode associated with a product, the detection of a radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag embedded in a product, the manual entry of a serial number, etc.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">While the interface from point of sale application <b>104</b> is displayed, add-on application <b>106</b> may periodically monitor (e.g., every half second) the contents of the interface in order to infer the current state of the interface (e.g., product selection state, payment state, refund state, etc.). Several possible ways to monitor the contents of the interface are possible. For example, add-on application <b>106</b> may take screenshots, via the operating system's screenshot interface or screen buffer, or via a physical device pointing at display device <b>116</b><i>a </i>like a camera, or via a physical video feed intercept. Alternatively or in addition, add-on application <b>106</b> may take a fingerprint of the current contents of the screen, using a method such as examining the current color setting of a number of pixels on the screen, or taking a hash of the current screen pixel contents (i.e., the type of hash that can be used to calculate a hash difference). Alternatively or in addition, add-on application <b>106</b> may take a dump of the contents being displayed on screen, using operating system user interface introspection tools that allow reading of user interface element labels and contents, such as what the Windows API tools enable, or using the document object model (DOM) in the case of a browser-based point of sale application. Alternatively or in addition, add-on application <b>106</b> may use the operating system accessibility tools API to collect information about what is being displayed on screen, to then feed into a screen state analysis system. This information could be text, positioning, colors, window information, or any other information that an operating system accessibility or other handicapped accessible toolkit would provide. Alternatively or in addition, the add-on application <b>106</b> may take a hardware or software video feed from display device <b>116</b><i>a, </i>possibly by a USB webcam, possibly by a video intercept device like a VGA tap, or possibly by a software level video feed, like the iOS screen streaming feature.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Using machine learning, add-on application <b>106</b> may be trained to automatically identify the current state of the interface based on the monitored contents of the interface. For example, an expert installer may train the system by specifying one or more attributes that are associated with each of the states, and add-on application <b>106</b> may subsequently use the expert provided training data to identify the current state of the user interface of point of sale application <b>104</b>. After a current state has been identified, add-on application <b>106</b> may further retrieve and compare one or more stored pixels (i.e., stored pixels of a user interface previously associated with the current state) with pixels of the current interface to verify whether or not the identified current state is correct. In another embodiment of the verification process, add-on application <b>106</b> may retrieve and compare one or more stored words (i.e., stored words displayed on a user interface previously associated with the current state) with words retrieved from the current user interface from OS introspection, the browser source, or full screen OCR. In another embodiment of the verification process, add-on application <b>106</b> may use trained computer vision/machine learning models to verify whether or not the identified current state is correct.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The training of add-on application <b>106</b> to perform such state identification will be described in more detail below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref>. In the current example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, add-on application <b>106</b> may identify the interface to be in a &#x201c;product selection&#x201d; or &#x201c;ordering&#x201d; state based on the presence of one or more of user interface elements <b>210</b><i>a, </i><b>210</b><i>b, </i><b>210</b><i>c, </i>etc. Upon selection of user interface element <b>216</b> (e.g., &#x201c;F10 payment&#x201d; button), the interface may transition to the payment screen depicted in screenshot <b>218</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the payment screen, items that have been selected for purchase may be displayed in a modified format (e.g., with price rather than the quantity of an item being the emphasized attribute). See, e.g., <b>220</b><i>a, </i><b>220</b><i>b </i>and <b>220</b><i>c. </i>The total <b>214</b> (e.g., 32.00) may be displayed in a different position (e.g., off to the right side of the interface). Various user interface elements may be depicted for merchant <b>112</b> to select a payment type, for example, user interface element <b>223</b><i>a </i>corresponding to cash, user interface element <b>223</b><i>b </i>corresponding to credit, user interface element <b>222</b><i>c </i>corresponding to a debit card, user interface element <b>222</b><i>d </i>corresponding to check, user interface element <b>222</b><i>e </i>corresponding to a voucher, <b>222</b><i>f </i>corresponding to a gift card, <b>222</b><i>g </i>corresponding to a split payment option, and <b>222</b><i>h </i>corresponding to an &#x201c;other tenders&#x201d; option. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, the other tenders option is &#x201c;Fivestars Credit&#x201d; and represents funds that are processed by add-on application <b>106</b>. The meaning of funds that are processed by add-on application <b>106</b> will be more clearly understood at the conclusion of the transaction explained in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>J</figref>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Add-on application <b>106</b> may recognize the current state of the interface depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> to be in the &#x201c;payment state&#x201d; based on, for example, the particular position and/or color of cancel button <b>221</b> (as the particular position of the cancel button may be unique to the payment state), a comparison of a current fingerprint of the interface with a stored fingerprint that is associated with the payment state, etc. Any other characteristics of the interface depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> may also be used to identify the current state of the interface so long as those characteristics are unique to the interface depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Upon recognizing the current state of the interface depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> to be in the &#x201c;payment state,&#x201d; add-on application <b>106</b> may be configured to overlay the &#x201c;cash&#x201d; and &#x201c;credit&#x201d; buttons over the existing &#x201c;cash&#x201d; and &#x201c;credit&#x201d; buttons of the interface of point of sale application <b>104</b> using operating system overlay APIs or other means. In a web-based point of sale application, buttons or other user interface elements may be inserted via DOM injection. Button <b>223</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> is in fact a cash button that has been overlaid on top of the existing cash button of point of sale application <b>104</b> (not shown), and button <b>223</b><i>b </i>is a credit button that has been overlaid on top of the existing credit button of point of sale application <b>104</b> (not shown). The determination of where and when to insert buttons may involve machine learning, in which add-on application <b>106</b> is provided many examples of where and when to insert buttons (i.e., training data), and after parameters of the learning machine have been trained based on the training data, add-on application <b>106</b> may automatically insert buttons at the desired locations and at the desired times.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the instant case, the color of the inserted buttons and the font of the text within the inserted buttons are distinct from the existing buttons of point of sale application <b>104</b> so that merchant <b>112</b> is aware that the cash and credit buttons have been provided by add-on application <b>106</b>. However, such variation in the format of the inserted buttons is optional, and in another embodiment, an inserted button may be overlaid on top of an existing button and appear identical to the existing cash and credit buttons (or may be a transparent button overlaid on top of an existing button), so that merchant <b>112</b> may not be aware that the user interface has been modified. In another embodiment, rather than inserting buttons into the user interface of point of sale application <b>104</b>, add-on application <b>106</b> may listen directly to clicks (and other selection commands) made upon the pre-existing buttons of point of sale application <b>104</b>. The listening operation of add-on application <b>106</b> may use operating system mouse or touchscreen filters (e.g., filtering all mouse clicks, and transitioning processing of the transaction to the add-on application <b>106</b> when a click falls within the pixel coordinates that are known to be occupied by the pre-existing button of point of sale application <b>104</b>). In the case of a point of sale application <b>104</b> operating within a web browser <b>108</b>, the listening operation of add-on application <b>106</b> may be enabled by installing touch and click event listening hooks or modifying pre-existing touch and click event listening hooks on the DOM elements corresponding to the pre-existing buttons of point of sale application <b>104</b>. Other configurable attributes of the buttons from add-on application <b>106</b> may include the size of a button, the text within a button, etc.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The reason for inserting the (overlay) buttons, or alternatively listening to and overriding clicks or touches made to the pre-existing point of sale application <b>104</b> buttons, is to enable the processing of the transaction to seamlessly transition from point of sale application <b>104</b> to add-on application <b>106</b>. Upon the selection of the inserted cash button <b>223</b><i>a, </i>add-on application <b>106</b> may take over the processing of the transaction from point of sale application <b>104</b>, more specifically the processing of a cash transaction. Upon the selection of the inserted credit button <b>223</b><i>b, </i>add-on application <b>106</b> may take over the processing of the transaction from point of sale application <b>104</b>, more specifically the processing of a credit transaction. In the instant example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, no button has been overlaid on top of user interface element <b>222</b><i>c, </i>so if merchant selects user interface element <b>222</b><i>c, </i>point of sale application <b>104</b> would continue the processing of the transaction, more specifically the processing of a debit transaction. However, in another embodiment, it is possible for a &#x201c;Debit&#x201d; button to be overlaid on top of user interface element <b>222</b><i>c, </i>and in such case, upon selection of an overlaid &#x201c;Debit&#x201d; button (not depicted), add-on application <b>106</b> would take over the processing of a debit transaction from point of sale application <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Indeed, whether a button is inserted and further the position of an inserted button is a user configurable option. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, buttons from add-on application <b>106</b> are overlaid on top of existing buttons from point of sale application <b>104</b>, so merchant <b>112</b> must select the buttons from add-on application <b>106</b> instead of the buttons from point of sale application <b>104</b> in the case of a cash or a credit transaction. However, in another embodiment (not depicted), buttons from add-on application <b>106</b> may be inserted adjacent to (i.e., next to) buttons from point of sale application <b>104</b>, so merchant <b>112</b> is given the choice of continuing the processing of a transaction with either point of sale application <b>104</b> or add-on application <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Selection of any of the overlaid (or inserted) buttons <b>223</b><i>a, </i><b>223</b><i>b </i>is one example of a &#x201c;triggering event,&#x201d; and such selection indicates an intent of merchant <b>112</b> (or customer <b>124</b>, in a customer-facing interface) to start using add-on application <b>106</b> to transfer an amount of funds (e.g., equal to the total of the purchase) from the customer to the merchant. Upon merchant <b>112</b> selecting credit button <b>223</b><i>b, </i>the transaction may transition from point of sale application <b>104</b> to add-on application <b>106</b>. Add-on application <b>106</b> may then take a screenshot of the region around and including total <b>214</b> (e.g., 32.00), and use optical character recognition (OCR) to recognize total <b>214</b> so that add-on application <b>106</b> can determine how much to charge a credit card of customer <b>124</b>. In addition, add-on application <b>106</b> may, at the same time, take one or more screenshots of regions that are depicted in other embodiments (e.g., a region around a sub-total, a region around a tax amount, a region around a tip amount, a region around a discount amount, and a region around the items listed in the current transaction), and use optical character recognition (OCR) to recognize and record these additional amounts and elements in the transaction history. User actions to specify such region around total <b>214</b> during an initial configuration process will subsequently be explained in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>. The processing of a cash transaction (i.e., the process associated with the selection of cash button <b>223</b><i>a</i>) will subsequently be explained in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It is noted that OCR technology of add-on application <b>106</b> may also read amounts in the current order displayed in the user interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> (e.g., total, tax, subtotal where available), and show those amounts to consumer <b>124</b> on consumer-facing terminal <b>114</b><i>b, </i>as well as record those amounts in rewards server <b>128</b>, whether or not customer <b>124</b> signs up for a loyalty/rewards account.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Various embodiments to extract total <b>214</b> and additional elements which may include sub-total, tax, tips, discounts, and items in the order, in addition to the above described embodiment are possible. In one embodiment, add-on application <b>106</b> may take a screenshot of a specific location or locations, or the whole screen, send the screenshot to an OCR system like Google Cloud&#xae; OCR or Tesseract&#xae;, and read the amount to charge the user, which can be the total or part of the total, and the OCR system may send the total and other elements back to add-on application <b>106</b>. In another embodiment, add-on application <b>106</b> may read the total and other elements in plain text rather than via OCR by using the UI introspection capabilities of the operating system to understand the UI element labels and contents. In another embodiment, add-on application <b>106</b> may listen in on the printer pipeline physically or virtually to understand the total to be charged and other elements (e.g., tip, tax, discounts applied, and items ordered) to be recorded along with the total in the order history of the add-on application <b>106</b> by reading from table checks and other pre-transaction printed materials. In another embodiment, add-on application <b>106</b> may allow merchant <b>112</b> to close the transaction entirely, by marking the tender as cash or other credit, or use its automation to close the transaction, entirely on the point of sale, then read the final receipt from the printer either via virtual print driver, software print interceptor, or hardware printer interceptor/printer tap so as to extract the total and other elements (e.g., tip, tax, discounts applied, and items ordered).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">It is noted that the selection of credit button <b>223</b><i>b </i>is just one of many possible triggering events that may cause the processing of the transaction to transition from point of sale application <b>104</b> to add-on application <b>106</b>. In another embodiment, a physical hardware button or buttons (e.g., hotkeys or other combinations on a keyboard or other input device) may be pressed by merchant <b>112</b> to cause the processing of the transaction to transition from point of sale application <b>104</b> to add-on application <b>106</b>. For example, a hardware device can be connected through an API or SDK over the web or local connection or through a device-to-device connection.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In another embodiment, the triggering event may be an event that occurs earlier than the selection of the payment type. For example, the triggering event may be the selection of payment button <b>216</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, and in response to the selection of payment button <b>216</b>, a user interface similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> may be displayed to select a payment type, but that user interface is provided by add-on application <b>106</b> instead of point of sale application <b>104</b>. Therefore, it is understood that many possible triggering events are possible which cause the processing of the transaction to transition from point of sale application <b>104</b> to add-on application <b>106</b>, and that the pressing of the overlaid credit button <b>223</b><i>b </i>is just one possible triggering event.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, in response to the selection of credit button <b>223</b><i>b, </i>add-on application <b>106</b> may provide the user interface depicted in screenshot <b>226</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref> so as to facilitate the processing of a credit transaction. Such user interface may include user interface element <b>228</b> that is associated with customer <b>124</b>. At this point in the example transaction, identifying information of customer <b>124</b> may not yet have been received, so user interface element <b>228</b> provides only a generic image of customer <b>124</b> and the generic customer name of &#x201c;Your Guest&#x201d; that is associated with <b>0</b> reward points. The user interface may include message <b>230</b> instructing merchant <b>112</b> to ask customer <b>124</b> to insert or swipe his/her credit card. The user interface may include a user interface element <b>232</b> allowing merchant <b>112</b> to change the payment type of customer <b>124</b> to cash. Total <b>214</b> (e.g., 32.00) may also be displayed in the user interface so that merchant <b>112</b> is aware of the amount that will be charged to the credit card of customer <b>124</b>. This total amount may be determined via the OCR processing of total <b>214</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In response to a credit card of customer <b>124</b> being read by card reader <b>118</b><i>a </i>or <b>118</b><i>b, </i>add-on application <b>106</b> may provide the user interface depicted in screenshot <b>234</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>F</figref>. User interface element <b>228</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>) is now replaced with user interface element <b>236</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>F</figref>) with information associated with customer <b>124</b> (e.g., photograph, first and last name, number of reward points). In the instant example, add-on application <b>106</b> identifies customer <b>124</b> via the credit card number of customer <b>124</b>. In other words, the credit card number of customer <b>124</b> was used as a login name for the rewards account of customer <b>124</b>. Upon gaining access to the credit card number of customer <b>124</b>, add-on application <b>106</b> may retrieve other identifying and/or personal information of customer <b>124</b> from rewards server <b>128</b> (e.g., photograph, first and last name, number of reward points). In one embodiment, a customer identifier is computed as a hash of the credit card number, and such customer identifier is used to identify customer <b>124</b> in rewards server <b>128</b> (e.g., a rewards account of customer <b>124</b> is labeled with via such customer identifier).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">It is noted that in the above example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>F</figref>, the credit card of the customer had already been linked to a rewards account of customer <b>124</b>. If, however, the credit card of customer <b>124</b> were not yet linked to a rewards account, a user interface (not depicted) may be presented after customer <b>124</b> swipes his/her card. In such user interface, customer <b>124</b> may be provided numeric keys to input his/her phone number (or other identifying information). Upon receiving the customer's phone number or other identifying information, the customer's credit card may be linked to an existing (or newly created) rewards account that is associated with the customer's phone number or other identifying information, and the process may proceed to the user interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>F</figref> regarding the selection of a reward. If customer <b>124</b> chooses to not link his/her credit card with any phone number or other identifying information, the customer may be provided with an option to skip entry of same and the process may proceed directly to the user interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>G</figref> regarding the entry of tip amount.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The interface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>F</figref> may also include user interface elements <b>238</b> that allow merchant <b>112</b> to redeem reward points on behalf of customer <b>124</b>. Alternatively and/or in addition, similar user interface elements may be presented on display device <b>116</b><i>b </i>(i.e., the customer-facing display) so as to allow customer <b>124</b> to directly make a selection to redeem reward points.

Total <b>242</b> (e.g., $32.00) may be presented again, and below total <b>242</b>, the payment type may be specified <b>244</b> (e.g., Card Ending 4242). In the present example, the button <b>240</b> to skip the redemption of the rewards is selected, since the process to redeem rewards will be described in association with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>J</figref> below.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Upon selection of button <b>240</b> to skip the redemption of the rewards, add-on application <b>106</b> may provide the user interface depicted in screenshot <b>246</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>G</figref>. Such user interface may include message <b>248</b>, instructing merchant <b>112</b> to wait for customer <b>124</b> to add a tip. If customer <b>124</b> opts to not provide a tip, merchant <b>112</b> may select user interface element <b>250</b> to skip the payment of a tip. In another embodiment, upon customer <b>124</b> specifying that no tip will be provided, such action of customer <b>124</b> may cause the automatic selection of user interface element <b>250</b> to skip the payment of a tip, or equivalently, add-on application <b>106</b> may receive the customer's instruction and proceed with the payment transaction with the understanding that no tip will be collected. It is noted that the user interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>G</figref> to collect a tip may be omitted in certain environments (e.g., a grocery store).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the present example, customer <b>124</b> uses terminal <b>114</b><i>b </i>to specify a tip amount of $4.80 (the tip amount shown in the subsequent user interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>J</figref>).

More specifically, add-on application <b>106</b> may process the payment (or other transaction) through its payment facilitator (PayFac), independent sales organization (ISO) or independent software vendors (ISV) payment rails. In another embodiment, add-on application <b>106</b> may process the payment (or other transaction) through the merchant's pre-existing payment merchant account. In another embodiment, add-on application <b>106</b> may process the payment (or other transaction) by collecting the payment card data and final total, including tip, and sending directly to point of sale application <b>104</b> itself to process the transaction, or sending that payload to the point of sale's cloud or central server, or another cloud or central payment server.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Upon completion of the processing of the payment, add-on application <b>106</b> may return a result of the payment to point of sale application <b>104</b>, as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>H and <b>2</b>I</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>H</figref> depicts a user interface of point of sale application <b>104</b>, similar to the user interface depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> prior to the occurrence of the triggering event. User actions may be emulated by add-on application <b>106</b> in the user interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>H and <b>2</b>I</figref> in order to inform point of sale application <b>104</b> of an amount paid by customer <b>124</b> and/or whether or not the transaction was completed by add-on application <b>106</b>. A monitoring process of add-on application <b>106</b> (similar to or identical to the process used to determine the state of the user interface) may be used to determine the location of user interface element <b>222</b><i>h </i>button (e.g., the &#x201c;Fivestars Credit&#x201d; button). Cursor <b>262</b> may then be positioned on Fivestars Credit button <b>222</b><i>h, </i>and a selection command (e.g., mouse click, tap on touchscreen, etc.) of cursor <b>262</b> may be performed by add-on application <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Upon an emulated user action to select Fivestars Credit button <b>222</b><i>h, </i>point of sale application may provide the user interface depicted in screenshot <b>264</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>I</figref>. Before emulating any additional user actions, add-on application <b>106</b> may verify the user interface displayed in response to selecting Fivestars Credit button <b>222</b><i>h. </i>That is, add-on application <b>106</b> may retrieve a stored (i.e., pre-determined) screenshot of the user interface that is expected in response to selecting Fivestars Credit button <b>222</b><i>h, </i>and compare the interface (e.g., or compare certain selected attributes thereof) depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>I</figref> to the expected user interface. If the verification step fails (e.g., a discrepancy is determined based on the comparison), the process described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>H</figref> may be attempted again, or the process may be aborted. If the verification step is successful, various aspects of the completed payment may be input into the interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>I</figref>, such as a subtotal (e.g., $32.00), a tip amount (e.g., $4.80) and a total amount (e.g., $36.80) that was paid by customer <b>124</b>. In certain embodiments, the input of a tip amount into the interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>I</figref> may be omitted and/or may not be possible. It is noted that the input of these amounts may be performed via emulated user actions (e.g., emulated keypresses, emulated mouse clicks of keypad <b>266</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>I</figref>, etc.). Upon the various aspects of the completed payment being entered into the user interface, user interface element <b>268</b> (e.g., &#x201c;OK&#x201d; button) may be selected (e.g., by an emulated mouse click). If for some reason the communication of the transaction result to point of sale application <b>104</b> needs to be aborted, user interface element <b>270</b> (e.g., &#x201c;Cancel&#x201d; button) may be selected (e.g., by an emulated mouse click).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Following selection of the OK button, add-on application <b>106</b> may provide the user interface depicted in screenshot <b>252</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>J</figref>. Such user interface may include message <b>254</b> that the payment is complete, as well as an order summary with the subtotal amount <b>242</b> (e.g., &#x201c;$32.00&#x201d;), tip amount <b>258</b> (e.g., &#x201c;$4.80&#x201d;) and total amount (e.g., &#x201c;$36.80&#x201d;). At some point after the payment has been processed, add-on application <b>106</b> may also store information associated with the transaction with the rewards account of customer <b>124</b> (e.g., total paid, tip paid, items purchased, reward points earned from the purchased, etc.).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In view of the description of the user interfaces depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>H and <b>2</b>I</figref>, the purpose for Fivestars Credit button <b>222</b><i>h </i>should now be more apparent. Such button may not be used to select a type of payment to pay for a transaction (as was the case for buttons <b>223</b><i>a, </i><b>223</b><i>b, </i>and the other payment buttons), but rather may be used to select a type of payment that was used to pay for a transaction. Stated differently, such button may be used to navigate to one or more interfaces to perform an accounting step (e.g., for point of sale application <b>104</b> to be updated on whether or not the transaction was successfully processed by add-on application <b>106</b> and if so, the amount that was paid by customer <b>124</b>). In some embodiments, other buttons may also be used to navigate to one or more interfaces to perform an accounting step. For example, native cash button <b>222</b><i>a </i>may be selected to navigate to one or more interfaces to, in the typical circumstance, input an amount of cash that was collected by merchant <b>112</b>. However, to complete the instant accounting step, the amount collected by add-on on <b>106</b> may be entered in lieu of an amount of cash. Such practice may allow point of sale device <b>102</b> to properly account for the dollar value of the transaction, but it may result in a discrepancy in the various amounts of the tender types (e.g., amount of cash in cash drawer may not be what is expected). Further, selection of native cash button <b>222</b><i>a, </i>in most instances, would cause cash drawer <b>122</b> to open, so merchant <b>112</b> would additionally need to close cash drawer <b>112</b> during such accounting step that makes use of native cash button <b>222</b><i>a. </i>As another example, native credit button <b>223</b><i>a </i>may also be used to complete the instant accounting step if a null-transaction option is provided and the purchase amount can be entered without actually charging a credit card.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">It is noted that there are various ways to emulate user actions. In one embodiment, a physical device may be attached to point of sale device <b>102</b> that can send physical keyboard and mouse signals to point of sale device <b>102</b> to control point of sale application <b>104</b> and close-out the transaction in the appropriate amount. In another embodiment, add-on application <b>106</b> may use browser keyboard and mouse press events to control the close-out flow of the point of sale (only in the cases that point of sale application <b>104</b> is implemented as a browser plug-in). In another embodiment, add-on application <b>106</b> could also interface with an API or SDK on point of sale device <b>102</b> or on the web to close out a specific amount on point of sale application <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">It is further noted that, in another embodiment (not depicted), it is possible to have a &#x201c;Fivestars payment&#x201d; button (distinct from Fivestars Credit button <b>222</b><i>h </i>used for accounting) in the user interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, and no overlays may be present over the native cash and credit buttons. Selection of the Fivestars payment button in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> may result in a triggering event, causing add-on application <b>106</b> to take over the processing of a payment transaction. At a later time point, such as in the interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>, merchant <b>112</b> may then be offered the selection between the cash payment type and the credit payment type.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref> depict screenshots of user interfaces to process a cash transaction.

In another embodiment, a physical hardware button that is associated with the processing of a cash transaction may be pressed by merchant <b>112</b> to cause the processing of a cash transaction to transition from point of sale application <b>104</b> to add-on application <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Add-on application <b>106</b> may then take a screenshot of the region around and including total <b>302</b> (e.g., 2.00), and use optical character recognition (OCR) to recognize total <b>302</b> within the screenshot in order for add-on application <b>106</b> to determine how much cash to request from customer <b>124</b>. Add-on application <b>106</b> may then provide the user interface depicted in screenshot <b>304</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> so as to facilitate the processing of a cash transaction. Such user interface may include user interface element <b>228</b> that is associated with customer <b>124</b>.

Subsequent to such training, when add-on application <b>106</b> encounters a user interface that is similar to image <b>701</b> that has been tagged as the payment screen, add-on application <b>106</b> may recognize that user interface to be in the payment state. While the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> labeled only one screen (i.e., image <b>701</b>) as the payment screen, it is noted that a plurality of screens could each be labeled as a possible example of the payment screen. For example, the position of buttons in the plurality of screens could be shifted with respect to one another, but all of the screens could still be payment screens. As another example, the number of payment types depicted in the screens could differ, but all of the screens could still be payment screens. In such case, a user interface could be determined as a payment screen if that user interface is similar to one or more of the plurality of screens that have been labeled as examples of the payment screen.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> depicts screenshot <b>704</b> of a user interface with user interface element <b>706</b> (e.g., &#x201c;Screen ID Pixel&#x201d; button) that can be used by an individual to further label a pixel that is unique to the payment screen and/or state. In other words, the user may first select Screen ID Pixel button <b>706</b>, and then select a pixel in the payment screen that is unique to the payment screen. In the instant example, the selected screen ID pixel is pixel <b>707</b> within Cancel button <b>708</b>, since the location and the color of pixel <b>707</b> within Cancel button is unique to the payment screen and/or state.

Subsequent to such training, when add-on application <b>106</b> encounters a user interface with a pixel having the same color and location as the selected screen ID pixel for the payment screen, such determination can be one additional factor that add-on application <b>106</b> uses to determine whether or not the user interface is in the payment state.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> depicts screenshot <b>705</b> of a user interface with user interface element <b>710</b> (e.g., &#x201c;OCR Region&#x201d; button) that can be used by an individual to further specify a region with a purchase total within the payment screen and/or state. In other words, the user may first select OCR Region button <b>710</b>, and then specify a region in the payment screen with the purchase total. In the instant example, the OCR region is specified as region <b>712</b>, since region <b>712</b> contains the total $2.00.

In such cases, additional tagging information described below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>E</figref> may be used to locate the Fivestars Credit button.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>E</figref> depicts screenshot <b>717</b> of a user interface with user interface element <b>718</b> (e.g., &#x201c;Macro Image&#x201d; button) that can be used by an individual to additionally specify a button (or other user interface element) in the payment screen and/or state that should be automatically selected by add-on application <b>106</b> (more specifically, to specify an image that is unique to the button that should be automatically selected). In other words, the user may first select the Macro Image button <b>718</b>, and then select an image that is unique to the button that should be automatically &#x201c;clicked&#x201d;. In the present example, the macro image is selected as image <b>720</b> within the &#x201c;Fivestars Credit&#x201d; button. Image <b>720</b> may be a group of pixels within the Fivestars Credit button that includes the text &#x201c;Fivestars Credit,&#x201d; as the text &#x201c;Fivestars Credit&#x201d; is unique to the &#x201c;Fivestars Credit&#x201d; button. Subsequent to this training, even if the location of the Fivestars Credit button within the payment screen were to change, add-on application <b>106</b> can still locate the location of the instant button in the payment screen by searching for image <b>720</b> (e.g., by using a visual grep tool). Alternatively, a trained computer vision and machine learning technology could automatically identify the appropriate buttons and their locations in the point of sale application <b>104</b> for desired input actions taken by add-on application <b>106</b>, enabling the add-on application <b>106</b> to contextualize and recognize the location of the appropriate button for the desired input action, in this case, the Fivestars Credit button, which may or may not be accomplished with additional human training.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The following sequence diagrams are presented to summarize the processes described in the above screenshots. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts sequence diagram <b>800</b> for processing a transaction between merchant <b>112</b> and customer <b>124</b> using point of sale application <b>104</b> and add-on application <b>106</b>.
