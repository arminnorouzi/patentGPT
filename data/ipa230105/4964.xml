More generally, the invention relates to an improvement of secure electronic payments.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNOLOGICAL BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">An electronic transaction allows the sale or purchase of goods or services by using electronic payment means. This document relates more particularly to transactions initiated on a point of sale and made on a device provided with means to secure such transactions. To implement this type of transaction, a payment device stores payment identifiers, such as a bank card (magnetic, contact or contactless), a mobile phone or a smart watch, to be presented to a payment terminal which verifies that the payment means is authentic and validates the transaction. In the current transactions, only authentication of the payment means and the payment capacity are verified. There are numerous payment protocols. As a non-limiting example, the EMV (acronym of the initials of the founding companies Europay international, Mastercard international and Visa international) specifies the interoperability between bank cards and payment terminals by authorising numerous implementation variants: contact or contactless, with cash or credit payment, with or without PIN code, with variable security levels depending on the type of transaction or depending on the card issuer, etc.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, payment conditions may be governed by certain personal data of a purchaser and certain transactions may also be legally prohibited depending on such personal data. When they exist, these transaction conditions are generally verified by a vendor during the purchase. Non-resident consumers may not want to pay certain taxes imposed on the sale of products, such as for example VAT (value added tax) in France. In this case, they must justify their status or submit a tax refund request after making a purchase. It may be necessary to verify the purchaser's age to obtain a price reduction or a purchase authorisation. This type of verification can only be carried out if a vendor is present or, if such a purchase is made on an automatic dispenser, by trusting the data indicated by the purchaser. A vendor may also omit to verify such personal data or be deceived by a malicious person, just like an automatic dispenser.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a need to be able to make transactions governed by personal data of a holder of payment means to apply a suitable price or authorise a transaction securely and automatically depending on personal data of a purchaser having electronic payment means.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention proposes to improve the electronic transactions at a point of sale by securely verifying the authenticity of one or more items of personal information of a purchaser without the purchaser having to produce proof to a vendor. To this end, a payment device comprises at least one item of personal information which is submitted in a certified manner to a payment terminal. The payment terminal is designed to implement a transaction policy which takes into account one or more items of personal information to authorise or refuse to finalise a transaction.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention proposes an electronic transaction method between a payment device associated with a bank account of a user and a payment terminal associated with a bank account of a purchaser wherein the payment device and the payment terminal exchange at least one cryptographic key before performing a transaction step during which the transaction is validated or rejected. The payment device includes at least one item of personal information about the user. The payment terminal includes at least one transaction policy including a condition relative to the at least one item of personal information. The method includes a verification step, prior to the transaction step, for securely verifying the condition of the transaction policy relative to the personal information using the cryptographic key.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first embodiment, the verification step may consist in the payment device sending the personal information together with a cryptographic signature made using the personal information and the cryptographic key to authenticate the personal information. The payment terminal may verify the condition of the transaction policy after authenticating the personal information.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a variant of this first embodiment, prior to sending the personal information, the payment terminal may send a request to the payment device asking it to send the personal information.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a second embodiment, the verification step may consist in the payment terminal sending a request to the payment device asking it to verify the transaction policy, the request being signed using the cryptographic key. The condition of the transaction policy may be verified by the payment device, after authenticating the request using the cryptographic key, which creates and transmits a validation or invalidation message to the payment terminal depending on the condition and the personal information.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a special embodiment, the transaction amount may be modified by the payment terminal depending on the result of the verification step.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the cryptographic key may be exchanged during a mutual authentication step.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention also proposes an electronic transaction method implemented by a microprocessor of a payment device associated with a bank account of a user designed to cooperate with a payment terminal associated with a bank account of a purchaser to perform a transaction step during which the transaction is validated or rejected, said method including a step for exchanging at least one cryptographic key with the payment terminal. The payment device includes at least one item of personal information about the user, saved in a data memory. The method includes a verification step for securely verifying a condition of a transaction policy relative to the personal information using the cryptographic key.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a first embodiment, the verification step may include sending a message containing the personal information together with a cryptographic signature made using the personal information and the cryptographic key to authenticate said personal information.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a second embodiment, the verification step for verifying the condition of the transaction policy may include a prior step for authenticating a request issued by the payment terminal containing the condition of the transaction policy, the request being signed using the cryptographic key, and a step for sending a validation or invalidation message depending on the condition and the personal information.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The invention further proposes an electronic transaction method implemented by a microprocessor of a payment terminal, associated with a bank account of a purchaser, designed to cooperate with a payment device associated with a bank account of a user. Said method includes a step for exchanging at least one cryptographic key with the payment device and a transaction step during which the transaction is validated or rejected. The payment terminal includes at least one transaction policy including a condition relative to at least one item of personal information about the user of the payment device. The method includes a verification step for requesting the verification of the condition of the transaction policy relative to the personal information by using the cryptographic key, and the transaction step is implemented if and only if the condition is met.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a first embodiment, during the verification step, the method may include a step for receiving a message including the personal information together with a cryptographic signature made using the personal information and the cryptographic key and a step for verifying the condition of the transaction policy after authenticating the personal information using the cryptographic key.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a variant of this first embodiment, the method may include a step for creating and transmitting a request to the payment device to obtain the personal information.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a second embodiment, the verification step may consist in creating and transmitting a request to the payment device asking it to verify the transaction policy, the request being signed using the cryptographic key.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a special embodiment, the method may include a step for modifying the transaction amount depending on the result of the verification of the condition before validating the transaction.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to another aspect, the invention proposes an electronic transaction system comprising a payment device associated with a bank account of a user and a payment terminal associated with a bank account of a purchaser wherein the payment device and the payment terminal are configured to exchange at least one cryptographic key before performing a transaction step during which the transaction is validated or rejected.

The system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a payment terminal <b>1</b> capable of communicating firstly with a bank server <b>2</b> and secondly with a payment device <b>3</b> or <b>4</b>. This type of system is frequently used to perform payment operations from a point of sale, as defined in numerous payment service standards, for example in the EMV standard which is the most widely used and which includes numerous implementation possibilities. The payment terminal <b>1</b> may need to perform &#x201c;offline&#x201d; or &#x201c;online&#x201d; transactions, in other words disconnected from or connected to the bank server <b>2</b>. The payment device <b>3</b> is traditionally a smart card <b>3</b> or a mobile phone <b>4</b>, or any other electronic device capable of securely emulating the operation of a smart card, such as for example a smart watch which is an extension of a mobile phone in the form of a wrist watch, or any type of computer having the same capacities or features.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a functional diagram of a bank card <b>3</b> or smart card which includes a microprocessor <b>31</b> controlling a central bus <b>32</b> to exchange data with a memory <b>33</b>, a cryptoprocessor <b>34</b>, a contact communication interface <b>35</b> and a contactless communication interface <b>36</b>. The contact communication interface <b>35</b> is for example compatible with standard ISO7816. The contactless communication interface <b>36</b> is for example an NFC (Near Field Contactless) type communication interface, compatible with standard ISO14443. Although numerous payment card have these two types of communication interface <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>, some cards have only one contact or contactless communication interface.

Some of the sub-programs may respectively concern transaction policies which define special payment conditions, for example electronic verifications to be performed depending on the type of card, a payment threshold above which the bank must be contacted to authorise or refuse the transaction, conditions relative to entering or typing a verification code or additional verifications that can be configured by the merchant using said terminal <b>1</b></p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Users of the payment terminal <b>1</b> use the screen <b>105</b> to display information when executing a transaction.

Such transaction policies can be justified from a legal point of view or from a commercial point of view. Each transaction policy Pol(PI) includes a condition relative to personal information PI which governs the performance of a transaction depending on whether or not said condition is met by said personal information PI. By verifying that the personal information PI meets the condition of the transaction policy Pol(PI), the payment terminal <b>1</b> avoids the need to prove to a vendor that this information is true, for example by producing an identity document. Transactions governed by personal information can thus be performed without a vendor having to be present, and this type of transaction can therefore be performed using dispensing machines.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Some policies used to verify personal information are indicated as non-limiting examples. A first transaction policy Pol(PI) may concern a minimum age of the holder of the payment device in order to perform a transaction on a product whose distribution is legally restricted. For example, a sale may be refused to a minor. This first policy allows, for example, a cigarette or alcoholic beverage dispenser to verify the customer's age without a person having to be present to perform said verification. A second transaction policy Pol(PI) may concern a commercial discount depending on the age of the person as part of a sales promotion to privilege young or senior customers. For example, if the card holder is under twenty-five or over sixty-five, the payment terminal <b>1</b> can verify the personal information PI corresponding to the age of the holder of the payment device and calculate a ten percent discount on a transaction amount. A third transaction policy Pol(PI) may consist in not taxing foreigners to avoid subsequent tax refund operations. With this third policy, the payment terminal <b>1</b> may, for example, verify personal information PI corresponding to the country of residence of the holder of the payment device and deduct the amount of the taxes if the personal information PI corresponds to a country for which the tax refund applies. The address may also be used for commercial purposes in a fourth transaction policy Pol(PI) which generates commercial discounts for persons living in geographic areas covered by sales promotions. According to this fourth policy, the terminal verifies personal information PI corresponding to the address or post code of the holder of the payment device, then calculates a commercial discount if the address of residence corresponds to a geographic area covered by a sales promotion. Numerous other policies can be considered, provided that certain items of personal information are present in the payment device. Numerous variants can be considered, provided that a transaction can be governed by personal information PI.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Several methods are available to verify that the personal information PI meets the condition of the transaction policy Pol(PI). According to the invention, the authenticity of the personal information PI is verified before verifying that it meets said condition. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> show two verification techniques. For these two <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the payment terminal <b>1</b> and the bank server <b>2</b> are considered together. For some authentication operations, in fact, the payment terminal <b>1</b> becomes &#x201c;transparent&#x201d; and only acts as relay or gateway between a payment device <b>3</b> or <b>4</b> and the bank server <b>2</b>. For the descriptions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, a smart card reader type payment terminal <b>1</b> is considered in connection with a bank card type payment device <b>3</b>. All the variants of the bank terminal or of the payment terminal <b>3</b> or <b>4</b> can nevertheless replace the system described.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> describes a first example of a method for using the personal information. The payment terminal <b>1</b> and the payment device <b>3</b> implement their respective transaction programs including the sub-programs relating to the various steps of the method which will be described and in particular the sub-programs relating to the implementation of the transaction policies Pol(PI). In this first example, the payment terminal <b>1</b> and the payment device <b>3</b> perform a mutual authentication step <b>500</b>, as defined in a bank payment protocol, for example the EMV protocol. During this mutual authentication step <b>500</b>, the payment device <b>3</b> and the payment terminal <b>1</b> can exchange public keys, certificates, a secret, perform a challenge, determine a session key and, possibly, exchange a PIN code. This authentication step <b>500</b> is performed, firstly, to allow the payment terminal <b>1</b> to verify that the payment device <b>3</b> is an authorised payment device and, secondly, to allow the payment device <b>3</b> to verify that the payment terminal <b>1</b> is an authorised payment terminal and, optionally, that the holder of the payment device validates the transaction on the payment terminal <b>1</b>. For more details, those skilled in the art will refer to the various existing payment transaction standards. In the framework of the invention, any transaction standard can replace the EMV standard and there is no need for mutual authentication provided that at least one cryptographic key is exchanged between the payment terminal <b>1</b> and the payment device <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to the state of the art, a transaction step <b>501</b> follows the mutual authentication step <b>500</b>. During the transaction step <b>501</b>, the payment terminal <b>1</b> and the payment device <b>3</b> exchange transaction data such as for example the transaction amount, and each executes an offline risk analysis sub-program, possibly as well as an online risk analysis by communicating with the bank server <b>2</b>, then finalise the transaction either by refusing or accepting it, and by each one storing the transaction performed.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">According to the invention, a verification step for verifying the personal information PI is added between the mutual authentication step <b>500</b> and the transaction step <b>501</b>. The transaction policy Pol(PI) can then be applied before or during the transaction step <b>501</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the payment terminal <b>1</b> sends a request <b>510</b> to the payment device <b>3</b> asking it to send one or more items of personal information PI. Following this request <b>510</b>, the payment device <b>3</b> sends an answer <b>520</b> containing the requested personal information PI together with data Sig(PI) authenticating the personal information PI. The payment terminal <b>1</b> then verifies the data authenticating the personal information PI in a step <b>530</b> and, if said information is authenticated, verifies that the personal information meets the condition of the transaction policy Pol(PI). The transaction policy Pol(PI) is then applied, depending on the verification, before or during the transaction step <b>501</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The request of <b>510</b> can be sent in several ways, or even be sent implicitly. According to a first embodiment complying with the EMV protocol, the request <b>510</b> is not sent. During the mutual authentication step <b>500</b>, information relative to the possibilities of the payment terminal <b>1</b> can be sent to the payment device <b>3</b> so that the latter is informed of the protocol to be applied regarding the payment terminal <b>1</b>. As part of the information sent, the payment terminal <b>1</b> indicates that an item of personal data PI is required to finalise the transaction. After the mutual identification step <b>500</b>, the payment terminal <b>1</b> performs a hot reset of the payment device <b>3</b>. Following the reset signal, the payment device <b>3</b> issues an answer <b>520</b> which corresponds to an ATR (Answer To Reset) type message together with the personal information PI and a signature Sig(PI) of the personal information PI. Preferably, the signature Sig(PI) is a cryptographic signature of the personal data PI, for example a signature as defined in the PKCS #1 standard using a cryptographic key which can be a common encryption key or a public key encryption structure, shared by the payment device <b>3</b> and the payment terminal <b>1</b>. Numerous types of signature are possible, including as an additional but non-limiting example a MAC (Message Authentication Code) as defined in the publication RFC 2104: &#x201c;HMAC: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication&#x201d; can also be used. The most important being that the cryptographic key used by the payment device <b>3</b> allows the payment terminal <b>1</b> to verify the authenticity of the personal data PI during step <b>530</b>. Once the personal information PI is considered to be authentic, the payment terminal verifies whether said personal information PI meets the condition of the transaction policy Pol(PI).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">According to a second embodiment, the payment terminal <b>1</b> sends a request <b>510</b> as an APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit) type command defined in standard ISO7816 to read the personal information PI. Amongst the APDU commands that can be used for the request <b>510</b>, those skilled in the art can use, as non-limiting examples, the GET_DATA, READ_BINARY and READ_RECORD commands to read information in a payment device <b>3</b>. In response to one of these commands identifying the personal information PI or an area containing said information PI, the payment device replies by sending an answer message <b>520</b> containing the personal information PI together with a certificate or a cryptographic signature Sig(PI) so that the payment terminal can authenticate said personal information PI during step <b>530</b>. The certificate or the cryptographic signature is produced, for example, according to one of the techniques described previously. Once the personal information PI is considered to be authentic, the payment terminal verifies whether said personal information PI meets the condition of the transaction policy Pol(PI).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a second example of a method for using the personal information PI. The payment terminal <b>1</b> and the payment device <b>3</b> implement their respective transaction programs including the sub-programs relating to the various steps of the method which will be described and in particular the sub-programs relating to the implementation of the transaction policies Pol(PI). In this second example, the payment terminal <b>1</b> and the payment device <b>3</b> perform a mutual authentication step <b>500</b> and a transaction step <b>501</b>, as previously defined according to an electronic payment protocol. A verification of the personal information PI is added between the mutual authentication step <b>500</b> and the transaction step <b>501</b> before applying the transaction policy before or during the transaction step <b>501</b>. In the framework of the invention, any transaction standard can replace the EMV standard and there is no need for mutual authentication provided that at least one cryptographic key is exchanged between the payment terminal <b>1</b> and the payment device <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In this second example, the payment terminal <b>1</b> sends a request <b>610</b> to the payment device <b>3</b> asking it to verify the personal information PI, indicating a condition to be met regarding the personal information PI to apply the transaction policy Pol(PI). During a step <b>620</b>, the payment device <b>3</b> verifies that the personal information PI meets the condition sent in the request <b>610</b>. The payment device <b>3</b> sends an answer <b>630</b> to the payment terminal <b>1</b> containing the result of the verification. The payment terminal <b>1</b> then applies the transaction policy Pol(PI) depending on the result of the verification, before or during the transaction step <b>501</b>. Thus, the personal information PI can remain confidential since the only information given is that the personal information PI meets the condition of the transaction policy.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The verification request <b>610</b> can be sent using a VERIFY type APDU having a certain number of data fields which specify the personal information PI to be verified and the condition of the transaction policy Pol(PI). In addition, to guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data, the request <b>610</b> may also include a signature produced using a cryptographic key shared by the payment terminal <b>1</b> and the payment device <b>3</b>. The signature is produced for example on all the bits of the request which correspond to the condition. The condition may include a value and a relation between the value and the personal information PI. For example, for personal information PI corresponding to an age or a date of birth, the value can be the limiting age or date of birth and the relation can be a comparison with this age or date or birth such as &#x201c;less than&#x201d; or &#x201c;greater than&#x201d;. If the personal information is a place of residence, for example a country, a post code or an address, the relation may be of type &#x201c;equal to&#x201d; or &#x201c;different from&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">After receiving the request <b>610</b>, the payment device <b>3</b> implements a verification sub-program during step <b>620</b>. Thus, the payment device checks that the signature of the request <b>610</b> meets the requested condition. This first verification ensures that the request has been issued by the payment terminal <b>1</b> which is considered as a device authorised to perform such a verification. Once the request has been successfully verified, the microprocessor <b>31</b> of the payment device <b>3</b> reads in its memory <b>33</b> the personal information PI specified in the request <b>610</b>. The payment device <b>3</b> then performs the requested comparison of the personal information PI with the value indicated. After making the comparison, the payment device then prepares and sends an answer <b>630</b> corresponding to the result of said comparison. The result is binary, in other words the condition is met or the condition is not met and the answer <b>630</b> may correspond to a message in response to the VERIFY command validating or not the comparison made securely. Optionally, the answer may also be signed using the cryptographic key. The payment terminal <b>1</b> then applies the transaction policy Pol(PI) depending on the result of the verification, before or during the transaction step <b>501</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Those skilled in the art may notice that the second embodiment of the invention also allows the personal information PI to be kept in the payment device. The personal information PI which may be sensitive information, for example the holder's address, therefore remains confidential.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In other embodiments, several items of personal information may be present in the payment device <b>3</b> and several transaction policies Pol(PI) may be used during a given transaction. According to a special embodiment, steps <b>510</b> to <b>530</b> or <b>610</b> to <b>630</b> can be repeated as many times as required. According to another embodiment, more complex commands concerning several items of personal information and/or several conditions can be used simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the APDUs used must be defined both in the payment device <b>3</b> and in the payment terminal <b>1</b>. Those skilled in the art will therefore understand that such features must be encoded and standardised in order to use them.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">According to a variant, communication interfaces complying with standards ISO7816 or ISO14443 do not have to be used. This is the case in particular when the payment device is a mobile phone <b>4</b>. In this case, the transaction can be performed using a radiofrequency communication protocol, for example complying with standard IEEE 802.11 more widely known as WiFi. The transaction can be made secure by using, for example, a channel encrypted using a transaction method similar to that described previously. The embodiments described using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> can be applied in the same way, taking into account the fact that the messages between the payment terminal <b>1</b> and the mobile phone <b>4</b> will be exchanged according to another data exchange protocol which does not necessarily use APDUs.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Irrespective of the embodiment, certifying the personal information PI guarantees, for the transaction, that the information is authentic.
