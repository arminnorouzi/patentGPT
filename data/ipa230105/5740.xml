A number of repetition times of step S<b>2</b> and step S<b>3</b> is determined based on requirements on the thin-film layer in actual production.

When thin-film deposition and impurity purge treatment are repeatedly performed, not only can a thick thin-film layer be formed, but also impurity purge treatment can be performed on each thin-film layer, such that impurities inside the thick thin-film layer can also be purged. This avoids that only impurities on the surface of the thin-film layer or a thinner thin-film are purged, but impurities inside the thick thin-film layer cannot be purged.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, after step S<b>4</b> and before step S<b>5</b>, the thin-film deposition method in this embodiment of the present application further includes: adding a filling material into a formed third purified deposited layer <b>211</b> for filling gaps left by purging the impurity in the purified deposited layer <b>211</b>, to form a filling layer <b>212</b>, where the formed thin-film layer <b>2</b> includes at least one filling layer <b>212</b>.

When the last layer in the thin-film layer is the filling layer, the impact of external air on the performance of the thin-film layer can be avoided, and the stability of the thin-film layer can be further improved.
