These devices, of &#x201c;sandwich press&#x201d; or &#x201c;waffle iron&#x201d; type, used for the preparation of waffles, are disclosed, for instance, in U.S. Pat. No. 9,554670 and WO 2014036588.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">From said documents, a device is known for the preparation of hot dough by means of at least two heating plates, which may be removable, and each heating plate is provided with a cavity to receive the dough that is to be heated.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Said heating plates are arranged inside the device, which is divided into an upper subassembly and a lower subassembly, the latter having the function of a base of the device, both subassemblies being hinged to one another. The heating plates inside the device are arranged, at least one of them being located in the upper subassembly and at least a second one in the lower subassembly and arranged in an operative position overlapping one another.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">These devices also include at least one heat transfer plate located in at least one of the upper or lower subassemblies that has an associated thermostat which is configured to regulate the temperature.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">These devices have several problems which derive from the fact that the heating plates are attached to at least one of the subassemblies and do not have a system providing some degree of rocking movement or play that allows to guarantee an optimal contact between said oppositely arranged heating plates when closing the device, such that, if the amount of dough that is placed into the cavities of the heating plates is not uniformly distributed, the heat transfer throughout the dough will be variable and, therefore, the obtained brioche will not have uniform heating. On the other hand, the fact that the plates do not completely contact each other when oppositely arranged may cause leakage or spillage of the frozen substance filling which would seep out of the brioche.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat.

The device comprises, according to a structure already known in the state of the art, for example, from one or more of the recited background items:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0013">an upper subassembly and a lower subassembly, the latter carrying out the function of a base and both being hinged to one another;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0014">two or more removable heating plates, each one provided with a cavity to receive the product, one or more of said heating plates installed in the upper subassembly and the other one or more heating plates installed in the lower subassembly, arranged so that in an operative position, overlap one another;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0015">two or more light indicators, to display the operative state of the device and report that the heating plates have reached a defined determined temperature; and<br/>at least one thermostat that is configured to regulate the temperature of said heating plates.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0014" num="0016">The heating plates are heated, for example, by means of a resistor, embedded or fitted in the plate itself or attached thereto.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0017">The heating plates used have a configuration which adequately adapts to the corresponding subassembly, adopting, for instance, quadrangular geometry. A cavity exists in the centre of each surface with a prescribed form or pattern in order to shape the final edible product, generally according to a prescribed substantially hemispherical geometry to produce a brioche with a substantially spherical geometry. However, brioches with different geometries can also be produced by providing a cavity with a suitable form.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">According to the proposal of the present invention, the device for heating filled brioches is characterized in that each of said removable heating plates is linked to the upper or lower subassembly wherein it is installed by means of at least one preferably releasable attachment or fastening element, which allows for the relative shifting of the heating plate relative to the respective subassembly wherein it has been inserted, and in thermal contact with a heat transfer plate that has a heating thermal resistor attached or connected thereto.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019">In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the heat transfer plate and the heating thermal resistor are housed in an enclosure supported in the respective upper or lower subassembly on loaded elastic elements, which press said enclosure against the corresponding heating plate, ensuring, by means of an opening of said enclosure, an optimal contact with the heat transfer plate, and there existing guide columns configured to allow a guided limited shifting of the enclosure along a shifting stroke.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">According to one exemplary embodiment, said attachment element is releasable and is formed by an elongated piece of an elastic and/or compressible material which does not deform easily, such as, for instance, a tab, a flange or a piece of equivalent functionality, said tab being attached to one of said subassemblies by means of a through slot in each of the subassemblies and said tab being linked to a heating plate. In an alternative embodiment, it is contemplated that two releasable fastening elements be arranged on opposite side faces of each heating plate and, therefore, each of the subassemblies has two slots for attaching both tabs.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">Said heat transfer plate is surrounded by a thermoinsulating layer, except for an area where it has a wide opening&#x2014;for instance, a central area&#x2014;that allows for a direct contact of said heat transfer plate with the heating plate to which it is attached while at same time providing an efficient protection of the electrical parts of the device.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">The arrangement of said loaded elastic elements, preferably preloaded springs or elastic elements, will be adapted to the geometry of the supporting enclosures that house the heat transfer plates in order to ensure their correct stability, such that preferably four loaded springs will be used, one being located on the back side of each of the corners of the heat transfer plate wrapped by the thermoinsulating layer.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">In an alternative exemplary embodiment, it is contemplated that the device should include a lower subassembly which includes two or more independent heating plates, in an adjacent position and the upper subassembly should consist of an equivalent number of independent heating plates, complementary to the heating plates of the lower subassembly, said plates of the upper and lower subassemblies being in an operative position, mutually opposed and overlapping. This arrangement allows an increase in the production capacity of the device and, in addition, the configurations of the cavities of one and other plates may be different, whereby different brioches may be produced. In this case, furthermore, the heat transfer plates (in thermal contact with each group of two opposing heating plates), respectively supported in the upper and lower subassembly, are controlled by an independent regulating thermostat.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0024">The former and other advantages and characteristics will be more fully understood from the following detailed description of an exemplary embodiment with reference to the attached drawings, which must be understood as illustrative and non-limiting, wherein:</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>show, respectively, a perspective view of the device of the invention in closed and opened positions, respectively.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an exploded view of the lower subassembly of the device of the proposed invention.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>and <b>3</b><i>c </i></figref>show an elevation view of the device and of its respective section along a central vertical plane, respectively, and a detail that allows a better view of the releasable fastening element arranged in one of the slots.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a simplified elevation view of the device, wherein only the arrangement of some of the essential elements of the proposed solution has been portrayed for an improved understanding thereof.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a sectional view of the device, in an exemplary embodiment wherein said device has two independent brioche preparation areas in the same device.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0030">The attached figures show several exemplary embodiments of the present invention having an illustrative non-limiting character.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0031">It will be understood that different parts that constitute the invention described in an embodiment may be freely combined with the parts described in other different embodiments, even if such a combination has not been explicitly explained or shown, provided that no prejudice results from the combination.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0032">It should be noted that any description which only describes one of the subassemblies of the device, and the components or pieces which form it, will be valid or applicable, only in the corresponding cases, to the subassembly that is not mentioned.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>illustrates a device <b>1</b> for heating filled brioches arranged in an operative position for heating a brioche.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034">Said heating device <b>1</b> is formed by an upper subassembly <b>3</b>, a lower subassembly <b>4</b>, a decorative closing plate <b>5</b>, at least one joint <b>10</b> such as a hinge, supporting elements or feet <b>7</b>, which preferably allow to adjust the height of the device or level the same relative to a supporting top or surface, two light indicators <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>, preferably of LED or neon type, wherein one of them indicates the operative state of the device <b>1</b>, preferably by the use of a green colour, and the other one indicates whether the heat transfer plates <b>16</b> have reached a predetermined baking temperature or a user-defined temperature, preferably by the use of a red colour.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035">The upper subassembly <b>3</b> and the lower subassembly <b>4</b> are preferably linked by two joints <b>10</b>, in this case two hinges.

Both heating plates <b>14</b> of each upper <b>3</b> and lower <b>4</b> subassembly and their respective cavities <b>14</b><i>a, </i>intended to receive the filled brioches; for example, of a frozen substance; for their heating, can be seen.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>also illustrates the peripheral channel <b>27</b> provided at the periphery of the cavity <b>14</b><i>a </i>of both the upper and lower heating plates <b>14</b>. When the upper and lower subassemblies <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> are closed, the upper and lower peripheral channels <b>27</b> face and overlap each other defining a peripheral cavity <b>28</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>). Said peripheral cavity <b>28</b> collects any leak of frozen product with which the brioche is filled, avoiding leakage to the outside of the device <b>1</b> and to the internal components thereof.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040">In the embodiment shown, the peripheral channel <b>27</b> is located adjacent to a sealing portion <b>14</b><i>b, </i>which is located adjacent to the edge of the cavity <b>14</b><i>a, </i>i.e., the sealing portion <b>14</b><i>b </i>is located between the peripheral channel <b>27</b> and the cavity <b>14</b><i>a </i>of a heating plate <b>14</b>. Said sealing portion <b>14</b><i>b </i>surrounds the cavity <b>14</b><i>a </i>and when faced and overlapping with the opposite sealing portion <b>14</b><i>b</i>, creates a sealing flange to the brioche that prevents leakage of the frozen product to the outside of the brioche. In the embodiment shown, the sealing portion <b>14</b><i>b </i>protrudes form the peripheral channel <b>27</b>, which is formed as a groove on the surface of the heating plate <b>14</b>. Said peripheral channel <b>27</b> can be concentric with the cavity <b>14</b>, or not. In any case, the upper and lower peripheral channels <b>27</b> are shaped so that they overlap each other when the device <b>1</b> is in its operative position. In the embodiment shown, the heating plates <b>14</b> are dimensioned so that its edges are substantially aligned, i.e., substantially flush, with the outer casing of the upper and lower subassemblies <b>3</b>,<b>4</b>, as can also be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>. This has the benefit that even if a leakage of frozen product occurs that fills the peripheral cavity <b>28</b>, the leaked product would fall from the edge of the heating plate <b>14</b> to the outside of the device <b>1</b>, thereby preventing leakage to the internal components of the device <b>1</b>, which is something that could damage them and could be very difficult to clean. On the contrary, if the heating plates <b>14</b> were larger than the corresponding subassembly <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, so that they protrude from the casing, there would be a risk of burn as it is very hot. Therefore, it is preferred that the heating plate <b>14</b> is substantially flush with the outer casing of the corresponding subassembly <b>3</b>,<b>4</b> as it provides the optimal compromise between ease of cleaning and avoidance of burns.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an exploded view of the lower subassembly <b>4</b> of the proposed device <b>1</b>, and shows how the heating plate <b>14</b> overlaps the heat transfer plate <b>16</b>, which is wrapped by the thermoinsulating layer <b>13</b> except for a face wherein an opening exists.
