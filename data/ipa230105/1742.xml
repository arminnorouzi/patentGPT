On the other hand, the block rigidity can be increased and the on-snow performance improved, since the hard rubber <b>7</b> with a higher elastic modulus than that of the tread rubber is disposed in a tire radial region including at least the opening to the tread surface <b>1</b> of the walls defining the walls of the widthwise sipe <b>6</b> (the entire region of the walls in the present example).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As a result of intense study, I discovered that since the hard rubber <b>7</b> is disposed at the location where the tire contacts the ground in the above configuration with the hard rubber <b>7</b>, the location that becomes the edge when the tire is rolling is in particular formed by the hard rubber <b>7</b>, resulting in some cases in a decrease in the on-ice grip performance.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the pneumatic tire of the present embodiment, the microfabrication <b>8</b> is therefore applied in a region of the tread surface <b>1</b> surrounding at least a portion of the opening (the entire opening in the illustrated example) of the widthwise sipe <b>6</b> to the tread surface <b>1</b>.

This configuration can sufficiently secure the region for improving the grounding property and can further improve the on-ice and on-snow grip performance.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The aforementioned region preferably includes the range from the opening of the widthwise sipe to the tread surface to a position 2 mm away on each side in the tire circumferential direction. This configuration can sufficiently secure, in the tire circumferential direction, the region for improving the grounding property and can further improve the on-ice and on-snow grip performance.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the case in which the block includes a plurality of widthwise sipes, as in the illustrated example, two of the aforementioned regions that are adjacent in the tire circumferential direction are preferably 1 mm or more and 10 mm or less apart in the tire circumferential direction (indicated as distance B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Two of the regions that are adjacent in the tire circumferential direction are more preferably 1 mm or more and 5 mm or less apart in the tire circumferential direction. By the distance B being 1 mm or more, a decrease in block rigidity can be suppressed, whereas by the distance B being 10 mm (more preferably 5 mm) or less, the edge pressure can be sufficiently secured.

By the surface roughness Ra of the aforementioned region being 10 &#x3bc;m or more, the surface area of the aforementioned region is increased, whereas by the surface roughness Ra of the aforementioned area being 500 &#x3bc;m or less, the actual footprint area is increased relative to the surface area of the aforementioned region, thereby further improving the on-ice and on-snow grip performance. For the same reasons, the surface roughness Ra of the aforementioned region is more preferably between 25 &#x3bc;m and 400 &#x3bc;m, even more preferably between 50 &#x3bc;m and 200 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">In a case in which the block includes a plurality of the widthwise sipes, the surface roughness Ra of the region of the widthwise sipe on one side in the tire circumferential direction is preferably larger than the surface roughness Ra of the region of the widthwise sipe on the other side in the tire circumferential direction. Improving the water drainage property is advantageous for the on-ice and on-snow grip performance on the stepping-in side, and improving the grounding property is advantageous for the on-ice and on-snow grip performance on the kicking-out side. Therefore, by the aforementioned one side in the tire circumferential direction being the stepping-in side, the on-ice and on-snow performance can be effectively improved.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">Similarly, in a case in which the rotation direction of the pneumatic tire is specified, the surface roughness Ra of the region of the widthwise sipe on the stepping-in side of the block is preferably larger than the surface roughness Ra of the region of the widthwise sipe <b>6</b> on the kicking-out side of the block.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">For the same reasons, in a case in which the block includes a plurality of the widthwise sipes, the surface roughness Ra of the region of the widthwise sipe located farthest on one side in the tire circumferential direction (the stepping-in side) is preferably the largest. In a case in which the block includes three or more of the widthwise sipes, the surface roughness Ra of the region of the widthwise sipe <b>6</b> preferably decreases gradually from one side in the tire circumferential direction (the stepping-in side) to the other side in the tire circumferential direction (the kicking-out side).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">The surface roughness Ra of the aforementioned region need not be set to differ between widthwise sipes, however, and may be the same.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">The microfabrication is preferably applied so that the kurtosis Rku of the aforementioned region is between 2 and 6. By the kurtosis Rku being 2 or more, the improvement in the grounding property can be efficiently achieved by microfabrication, whereas by the kurtosis Rku being set to 6 or less, abnormal wear and deterioration of the grip due to excessive surface roughness can be suppressed. For the same reason, the kurtosis Rku of the aforementioned region is more preferably between 3 and 5.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">In the illustrated example, the aforementioned region to which microfabrication is applied is rectangular in plan view, but this configuration is not limiting. The region can have various shapes, such as a partially rounded shape. For example, in a case in which the widthwise sipe is inclined relative to the tire width direction, the aforementioned region can have a parallelogram shape in plan view.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">The aforementioned microfabrication can be formed by any known technique, such as by projection of a blast material.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">Here, in a case in which the block includes a plurality of the widthwise sipes, it suffices for the widthwise sipe in which the hard rubber is disposed and to which microfabrication is applied in the aforementioned region to be any one or more widthwise sipes among the plurality of widthwise sipes. However, the hard rubber is preferably disposed and microfabrication is preferably applied in the region at least at the widthwise sipe adjacent to an edge of the block on one side in the tire circumferential direction. Since the contribution to the edge effect is particularly large on the kicking-out side of the block, this configuration can in particular further improve the on-ice and on-snow grip performance effectively when the one side in the tire circumferential direction is set to the kicking-out side.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">Similarly, the rotation direction of the pneumatic tire is preferably specified, and the hard rubber is preferably disposed and microfabrication is preferably applied in the region at least at the widthwise sipe located farthest on the kicking-out side of the block.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, each widthwise sipe <b>6</b> includes a constant sipe width portion <b>6</b><i>a </i>on the tread surface <b>1</b> side, in which the sipe width (width measured parallel to the tread surface <b>1</b> in a cross-sectional view) is constant (equivalent to the opening width at the tread surface <b>1</b>), and a widened portion <b>6</b><i>b </i>on the sipe bottom side, in which the sipe width is larger than on the tread surface <b>1</b> side. In the illustrated example, the widened portion <b>6</b><i>d </i>is substantially circular in a cross-sectional view. In this way, the widthwise sipe preferably includes a widened portion, at the groove bottom side, in which the sipe width is larger than at the tread surface side. The reason is that block fragments (the portions of blocks divided by the widthwise sipes) can more easily collapse, improving the edge pressure and further improving the grip performance on ice and snow. This configuration can also improve the drainage performance when wear progresses. In the present example, the portion farther outward in the tire radial direction than the widened portion <b>6</b><i>b </i>is the constant sipe width portion <b>6</b><i>a </i>that has a constant sipe width, but this portion can also be a portion with a variable sipe width.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">The sipe width of the constant sipe width portion <b>6</b><i>a </i>is not particularly limited but can, for example, be between 0.2 mm and 1.0 mm. The maximum width of the widened portion <b>6</b><i>b </i>is not particularly limited but can, for example, be between 1.2 mm and 6.0 mm. The extension length in the depth direction of the constant sipe width portion <b>6</b><i>a </i>is not particularly limited but can, for example, be between 2.0 mm and 12 mm.

The contribution to the edge effect is particularly large on the kicking-out side of the block. Therefore, when the one side in the tire circumferential direction is set to the kicking-out side, the block fragments (the portions of blocks divided by the widthwise sipes) on the kicking-out side can more easily collapse, and in particular the on-ice and on-snow grip performance can be further improved effectively. In a case in which the block includes three or more of the widthwise sipes, the width of the widened portion preferably decreases gradually from one side in the tire circumferential direction to the other side in the tire circumferential direction.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">Similarly, the rotation direction of the pneumatic tire is preferably specified, and the width of the widened portion on the kicking-out side of the block is preferably larger than the width of the widened portion on the stepping-in side of the block.
