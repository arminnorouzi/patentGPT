id="p-0003" num="0002">Tanks can store fluids or liquids, including flammable fluids such as oil or gas. The fluid can corrode portions of the tank that come into contact with the fluid. External surfaces of the tank can corrode due to water or other fluids under the floor of the tank, or water that leaked into the tank through, for example, a roof seal and sank below the hydrocarbon fluid due to its higher density. Corrosive elements in the hydrocarbon fluid can also contribute to corrosion. This corrosion can eventually cause the tank to leak. However, it can be challenging to determine the integrity of the tank to prevent leaks.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure is directed to systems, methods and apparatus of inspecting a tank containing a flammable fluid. Due to the technical challenges of inspecting a tank containing a flammable fluid, tanks inspections may be performed on empty tanks that are out-of-service. However, out-of-service inspection entails many hazardous steps. For example, the tank is first emptied of its liquid content. A large opening is then cut in the side of the tank to allow people and tools to enter. The residual sediments on the floor are collected, removed from the tank and safely disposed of. The atmosphere inside the tank is degassed and rendered safe. Human operators then enter the confined space under harsh and hazardous conditions to perform tedious plate-by-plate floor inspection. Once the inspection is complete, plates are welded to close the opening on the side of the tank, and the tank refilled with flammable fluid. These additional steps taken to inspect a tank can be time consuming, resource intensive, or hazardous.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Systems, methods and apparatus of this technical solution provide an autonomous vehicle that can inspect a tank containing a flammable fluid. The autonomous vehicle of this technical solution can perform an in-service tank inspection. An in-service tank inspection can refer to inspecting the tank while the flammable fluid is still contained in the tank. In some cases, an in-service tank inspection can refer to a closed tank inspection, such as inspecting a tank containing a flammable fluid while the lid of the tank is closed or sealed. To perform an in-service tank inspection, the autonomous vehicle of this technical solution can be tetherless and include a propeller, battery, and control unit that can automatically perform a tank inspection process. By automatically performing an in-service tank inspection with the tank lid closed, the autonomous vehicle can save time, reduce resource utilization and increase safety by inspecting the tank without having to empty the tank, which can allow for more frequent tank inspections. The system can more accurately predict the quality, integrity or state of the tank by performing more frequent tank inspection, or collecting inspection data at different intervals.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">At least one aspect is directed to a vehicle to inspect a tank containing a flammable fluid. The vehicle can include a propeller, a battery, a control unit, an inspection device, and a ranging device. The battery can provide power to the propeller, the control unit, the inspection device, and the ranging device. The control unit can generate a map of the tank based on data received from the ranging device. The ranging device can include an acoustic sensor or electromagnetic radiation sensor capable of providing a measurement of the distance between the robot and the environment (e.g., tank shell and obstacles such as pipes or roof support columns). The control unit can determine a first position of the vehicle on the map of the tank. The propeller, which can be electrically connected to the battery, can move the vehicle through the flammable fluid in the tank. The inspection device, which can be electrically connected to the battery, can determine a quality metric of a portion of the tank. The control unit can be electrically connected to the battery, the ranging device, the propeller and the inspection device. The control unit can cause the propeller to move the vehicle from the first position to a second position within the tank. The control unit can determine, via the inspection device, the quality metric for the portion of the tank at the second position within the tank. The control unit can store, in a data structure in memory of the vehicle, the quality metric corresponding to the second position within the tank.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The control unit of the vehicle can execute a diagnostic program prior to causing the propeller to move the vehicle. The control unit of the vehicle can be configured to determine, based on results of a diagnostic program, to initiate a tank inspection process, and provide, based on the tank inspection process, a command to cause the propeller to move the vehicle from the first position to the second position within the tank. The control unit of the vehicle can be configured to disable, based on a diagnostic program, the propeller to prevent the propeller from moving the vehicle from the second position. The control unit of the vehicle can be further configured to execute a diagnostic program prior to causing the propeller to move the vehicle, and set a speed of the propeller based on a result of the diagnostic program.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The control unit of the vehicle can further be configured to cause the propeller to move the vehicle to a plurality of portions of the tank, generate a map of the tank based on traversing a plurality of portions of the tank, and detect an exit condition based on the generated map. The control unit of the vehicle can be further configured to adjust a speed of the propeller based on a current location of the vehicle on the map and detect the exit condition based on an amount of power available in the battery. A plurality of propellers of the vehicle can be configured to move the vehicle in one or more directions. The propeller of the vehicle can be one of a controllable-pitch propeller, skewback propeller, modular propeller, or Voith Schneider propeller. The quality metric of the vehicle can indicate a thickness of the portion of the tank at the second position within the tank.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">At least one aspect is directed to a method of inspecting a tank containing a flammable fluid. The method can be performed by a vehicle having one or more processors and memory. The method can include lowering, via a cable, the vehicle into the tank containing the flammable fluid, wherein the vehicle can comprise a propeller, a battery, a control unit, an inspection device, and a ranging device. The method can include removing, subsequent to deploying the vehicle, the cable from the tank. The method can include moving, by the propeller, the vehicle through the flammable fluid in the tank. The method can include generating, by the control unit based on data received from the ranging device, a map of the tank. The method can include determining, by the control unit, a first position of the vehicle on the map of the tank.

The winch can lower the vehicle to the tank floor, at which point the winch or vehicle can detect that the vehicle is in contact with the tank floor and disengage the cable from the vehicle. Upon being lowered into the flammable fluid in the tank, the vehicle can be disconnected from systems or components external to the tank. The control unit of the vehicle can command the propeller to move the vehicle through the flammable fluid in the tank. While moving throughout the tank, the control unit, using a ranging device, can generate a map of the tank. The control unit can inspect the tank using an inspection device, and store the collected data. The control unit can associate the data from the inspection device with a position or location on the generated map of the tank. By analyzing the collected data, the system can determine the integrity of the tank, such as the thickness of the tank floor, or the level of corrosion of the tank floor.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Thus, systems, methods and apparatus of this technical solution can perform a tank inspection without emptying or draining a flammable fluid from the tank prior to inspecting the tank, thereby improving the efficiency and safety of the tank inspection process, saving time, and utilizing fewer resources.

The vehicle <b>101</b> can be constructed with one or more insulated layers to prevent sparks or electrostatic discharge. The one or more insulated layers can include a spark protection layer, which can be, for example, a rubber layer between one or more layer of steels, preventing accidental collision between the steel layers which can cause a spark. The vehicle <b>101</b> can be equipped with a non-sparking tool or at least one anti-static tool. The non-sparking tool can be characterized by lack of ferrous metals including steel or iron, which can prevent ignition of sparks under certain condition.

The dense flammable environment can include ethanol, gasoline (petrol), diesel, oil, or jet fuel. The vehicle <b>101</b> can maintain a temperature lower than an ambient temperature, an autoignition temperature, or a flash point. The autoignition temperature can indicate a temperature point at which a substance can be ignited in normal atmosphere without an external source of ignition. The flash point can indicate the lowest temperature at which vapors of the material will keep burning after an ignition source is removed. For example, gasoline can include an autoignition temperature of 280 Celsius and a flash point of 43 Celsius. The vehicle <b>101</b> can use a temperature sensor of the ATIS <b>102</b> to indicate the temperature of the vehicle <b>101</b>, such that the vehicle <b>101</b> can initiate an operation condition upon the temperature exceeding certain threshold, for example.

The vehicle <b>101</b> can determine the speed of the propeller <b>118</b> or inspection time, based on the density of the dense flammable environment. For example, a vehicle submerged in gasoline can determine a first speed of one or more propellers configured for a density of 750 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, and a second vehicle similar to the first vehicle submerged in diesel can determine a second speed, faster than the first speed, of one or more propellers configured for a density of 830 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The vehicle <b>101</b> can monitor the temperature of the vehicle <b>101</b> in order to facilitate safely traversing the vapor layer.

The method <b>500</b> can be performed by system <b>100</b>, system <b>400</b>, or one or more component thereof. In brief overview, at step <b>502</b>, a winch can lower at least one vehicle into the tank containing flammable fluid via a cable. At step <b>504</b>, the winch can remove the cable from the tank. At step <b>506</b>, the vehicle can execute the diagnostic program. At step <b>508</b>, the vehicle can determine to initiate an exit process based on the diagnostic program result. At step <b>510</b>, the vehicle can determine to initiate a tank inspection process based on the diagnostic program result.

At step <b>516</b>, the vehicle can generate a map of the tank. At step <b>518</b>, the vehicle can determine a first position of the vehicle on the tank map. At step <b>520</b>, the vehicle can cause the propeller to move from the first position to a second position.

At step <b>524</b>, the vehicle can store the quality metric <b>136</b> in the vehicle resource repository. At step <b>526</b>, the vehicle can initiate the exit process based on an exit condition from the diagnostic program result.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, and in further detail, a winch can lower a vehicle <b>101</b> into the tank containing flammable fluid via a cable at step <b>502</b>. The vehicle can include a control unit, battery, sensor, propeller, ranging device, inspection device, latch mechanism, or vehicle resource repository. The cable of the winch can be connected to the vehicle via the latch mechanism. The latch mechanism can be configured by the control unit to receive an indication of a state of the latch mechanism, the state can indicate the connection of the cable to the latch of the vehicle including a connected state or a disconnected state. The state of the latch mechanism can be used to lock the latch to the vehicle or release the latch from the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">The winch can lower the vehicle into the tank at a predetermined speed or rate. The winch can lower the vehicle into the tank based on the amount of fluid remaining in the tank, or the amount of fluid contained in the tank. Depending on the level of the fluid in the tank, the winch can lower the vehicle at a slower rate. The winch can receive an indication of the fluid level within the tank, or otherwise determine the level of the fluid. For example, the winch can include an input device or processor that receives an indication of the fluid level in the tank, or otherwise determine the fluid level within the tank. The winch can be preconfigured to lower the vehicle into the tank at a predetermined rate or default rate.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">For example, a tank or other administrator can determine the distance from a floating roof to the tank floor with reasonable accuracy using a gauge, predetermined construction drawings, or a tape measure (e.g., the cable used to launch and recover the vehicle can include markings every 10 feet, for example). The tank administrator can provide this information to the system.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">At step <b>504</b>, the winch can remove the cable from the tank subsequent to deploying the vehicle. The winch can remove the cable from the tank after the winch has submerged the vehicle into the flammable fluid or lowered the vehicle to the tank floor. The winch can determine to remove the cable from the tank based, or responsive to, an indication. The winch can receive an indication from a sensor that indicates the vehicle has contacted the tank floor, or that the latch has disconnected the cable from the vehicle. The winch can receive an indication from a sensor that the vehicle has become at least partially submerged in the flammable fluid, or otherwise come into contact with the flammable fluid or the tank floor. The winch can remove the cable based on a time interval. For example, the winch can determine to remove or raise the cable from the tank based on expiration of a countdown timer that is set based on a predetermined vehicle deployment process. In another example, the winch can determine to remove the cable based on detecting that a tension in the cable has fallen below a threshold, which can indicate that the vehicle has contacted the tank floor and is being supported by the tank floor instead of the cable.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">The sensor of the winch can determine the vehicle was lowered into the flammable fluid based on the difference on the force measured by the sensor. For example, the vehicle may weigh 100 kg. The sensor can detect a 1000 N force as the vehicle is being lowered into the tank, but prior to the vehicle contacting the fluid. The sensor can detect the force based on a tension associated with the cable connecting the vehicle to the winch. When the vehicle comes into contact with the flammable fluid, the sensor can detect a reduction in the force. For example, the sensor can detect a force of 750 N when the vehicle comes into contact with the flammable fluid. As the vehicle becomes increasingly submerged in the fluid, the sensor can detect a further reduction in the force until the vehicle is completely submerged in the fluid. However, since the vehicle may have negative buoyancy, the sensor may still detect some non-zero force, although the detected force may be significantly less than the originally detected weight of the vehicle. The sensor can detect a constant force, or substantially constant force (e.g., less than 5% variation) between the vehicle becomes fully submerged in the fluid and just before the vehicle contacts the tank floor. When the vehicle contacts the tank floor, the sensor can detect a further reduction in force. For example, the sensor can detect a near zero force&#x2014;or a force only due to the weight of the cable&#x2014;when the vehicle comes into contact with the tank floor because the tank floor can support the weight of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">Thus, the winch can determine, based on a difference between forces measured by the sensor, to reel up the cable based on the vehicle at least partially submerged in the flammable fluid or the vehicle reaching the tank floor. The winch can further determine to remove the cable from the tank based on a timer. The timer can be predetermined based on a historical data indicating a time for the vehicle to be lowered into the tank and disconnect the cable from the latch.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">At step <b>506</b>, the vehicle can execute the diagnostic program. The vehicle can obtain the diagnostic program from memory or storage. The vehicle can select a diagnostic program based on a criteria or factor associated with the tank in which the vehicle is lowered. The vehicle can execute the diagnostic program to determine or identify a diagnosis or diagnostic result. The vehicle can use the diagnostic program, or results thereof, to determine whether to initiate a tank inspection process. For example, if the results of the diagnostic program indicate that there are no system errors, or that the conditions associated with performing a successful tank inspection process have been met, the vehicle can begin the tank inspection. The results of the diagnostic program can indicate an operation condition or status of one or more components of the ATIS or vehicle. The diagnostic program can detect the state of the cable, which can indicate the connection of the cable to the vehicle. The operation condition can include exit condition, wait condition, low power state, cooling state, or high performance state.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">At step <b>508</b>, the vehicle can determine to initiate an exit process based on the diagnostic program result. The diagnostic program result can indicate an exit condition based on at least an amount of power available in the battery, the condition of the vehicle or the one or more components of the ATIS (e.g. temperature, performance, etc.), or an absence of indication of uninspected one or more portions of the tank. The vehicle can determine not to initiate the exit process. Instead, the vehicle can determine to initiate the tank inspection process based on the diagnostic program result. The vehicle can determine not to initiate the exit process, but to execute step <b>520</b> based on the diagnostic program result responsive to the storing the quality metric as in step <b>524</b>.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">At step <b>510</b>, the vehicle can determine whether to initiate a tank inspection process based on the diagnostic program result. If the vehicle determines not to initiate the tank inspection process at step <b>510</b>, the vehicle can proceed to step <b>512</b>. The vehicle can determine not to initiate the tank inspection process based on the diagnostic program result. The vehicle can disable the propeller to prevent moving the vehicle based on not initiating the tank inspection process, as in step <b>512</b>. In another implementation, the diagnostic program can be run before the vehicle latch system detaches the vehicle from the cable. By doing so, recovery is facilitated if errors are found during execution of the diagnostic program.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">For example, the vehicle can disable the propeller to prevent moving the vehicle. The propeller can be disabled by the control unit using the propeller control program based on the diagnostic program result. The vehicle can then execute the diagnostic program responsive to disabling the propeller. The vehicle can execute the diagnostic program in a manner similar to step <b>506</b>. The diagnostic program result can indicate at least one operation condition including a waiting condition or a cooling state. The cooling state can be based on the temperature of the vehicle or the one or more components of the ATIS. The waiting condition can be based on the diagnostic program requiring one or more additional results, for example, results from testing the components of the ATIS.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">If, however, the vehicle determines to initiate the tank inspection process at step <b>510</b>, the vehicle can proceed to step <b>514</b>. At step <b>514</b>, the vehicle can initiate the tank inspection process by generating and providing one or more commands, such as a command to move the vehicle through the flammable fluid. The vehicle can move through the flammable fluid by a propeller. The vehicle can execute, by the control unit, the diagnostic program prior to causing the propeller to move the vehicle. The vehicle can use the propeller to move to a plurality of portions of the tank. The vehicle can use the ranging device concurrent to traversing the plurality of portions of the tank. The vehicle can configure the propeller to turn in a plurality of directions to move the vehicle in one or more directions.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">At step <b>516</b>, the vehicle can generate a map of the tank. The generation of the tank map <b>130</b> can be based on the vehicle traversing the plurality of portions of the tank. The vehicle can further generate a map without traversing the plurality of portions of the tank using the ranging device, such as an infrared sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, electromagnetic radiation sensor (laser) or a radar sensor. The map of the tank can be stored in the tank map within the vehicle resource repository. The control unit <b>104</b> of the vehicle can detect an exit condition based on the generated tank map, for example, the vehicle can be provided, based on the available power of the battery corresponding to the size of the tank, with the exit condition by the diagnostic program.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">At step <b>518</b>, the vehicle can determine a first position of the vehicle on the tank map <b>130</b>. The first position can be determined based on information provided by the ranging device, for example, the ranging device can be configured by the mapping unit <b>108</b> to identify or update the position of the vehicle. The first position can indicate the position of the lid with respect to the tank, the lid used for lowering the vehicle into the tank. The first position <b>302</b> can be the first uninspected portion of the tank. The vehicle can determine, by the control unit based on one or more results of the diagnostic program, to initiate the tank inspection process. The tank inspection process can indicate a command for the vehicle to determine a quality metric for the first position. The vehicle can provide an indication of an inspected portion to the tank map or remove an indication of an uninspected portion from the tank map using the ranging device responsive to determining the quality metric for the first position of the tank.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">At step <b>520</b>, the vehicle can cause the propeller to move from the first position to a second position using the control unit. The control unit can provide a command to cause the propeller to move the vehicle from the first position to the second position based on at least the determined first position or the determined quality metric <b>136</b> corresponding to the first position based on the tank inspection process. The vehicle can be configured by the control unit, based on the diagnostic program <b>138</b>, to disable the propeller to prevent the propeller from moving the vehicle from the second position. The second position can correspond to at least one uninspected portion of the tank. The speed of the propeller can be set or adjusted by the control unit based on the result of the diagnostic program <b>138</b>, the result can be an operation condition, such as, an exit condition, a wait condition, a low power state, a cooling state, or a high performance state, as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The speed of the propeller can be set or adjusted based on a current position of the vehicle on the tank map. For example, the control unit can increase the speed of the propeller to move from the first position, decrease the speed of the propeller prior to reaching the second position, and disable the propeller based on the vehicle reaching the second position. The control unit can configure the propeller to move the vehicle in a different direction (e.g. reverse or sideways) based on the vehicle straying from the second position.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">At step <b>522</b>, the vehicle can determine a quality metric for at least one portion of the tank corresponding to the second position on the tank map via the inspection device. The inspection device can include a magnetic sensor, a magnetic sensor array, an ultrasonic array system, an ultrasonic phased array system, or a sweeping device. The sweeping device can include a brush for sweeping one or more substance off at least one portion of the tank. The quality metric can indicate a thickness of the portion of the tank at the second position within the tank. The vehicle can determine, based on the quality metric of the portion of the tank, to determine an additional quality metric for the portion of the tank, the additional quality metric can be determined using at least one different component of the inspection device. For example, the vehicle can determine a quality metric corresponding to the second position using the magnetic sensor of the inspection device, determine the quality of the information from the inspection device, and determine an additional quality metric corresponding to the second position using the ultrasonic array system based on obtaining a low quality information of the quality metric. The quality of the information can be based on a signal-to-noise ratio.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">The vehicle can collect data from multiple sensing devices or inspection devices simultaneously (e.g., at the same time or overlapping times or immediately one after the other). The vehicle can record data from both sensors for further processing. The vehicle can perform real-time analysis of the data to determine whether one sensor is faulty, and switch to the other sensor.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">At step <b>524</b>, the vehicle can store the quality metric in the vehicle resource repository. The quality metric can correspond to at least the first position or the second position within the tank. The vehicle resource repository can be a data structure in memory of the vehicle. The vehicle resource repository can be accessed by the control unit. The quality metric corresponding to a position can indicate the one or more inspected portions of the tank. The indication of at least one uninspected portion of the tank can be based on an absence of the quality metric corresponding the portion of the tank, which can be released responsive to storing the quality metric corresponding to the portion of the tank. The vehicle can initiate the diagnostic program responsive to storing the quality metric in the vehicle resource repository.

The command can include an instruction to initiate an inspection at the first position on the map. The command can be based on the tank inspection process, which can be configured based on a result of the diagnostic program. The command can include, for example, enabling or disabling the inspection device, moving the inspection device to a different portion of the tank corresponding to the first position, or changing the inspection device type. The inspection device type can change, for example, from one or more magnetic conductors to ultrasonic array or phased array system or vice versa. The ranging device can receive a command, based on the tank inspection process prior to the inspection device receiving the inspection command, to generate the tank map based on a plurality of acoustic waves reflected off one or more portions of the tank.

The change of magnetic field can include magnitude, intensity, direction, duration, decay time, or frequency to increase or decrease the magnitude or intensity of electric current based on the inspection process. The inspection device can generate at least one pulsed eddy current for measuring thickness or detecting corrosion. The pulsed eddy currents can contain a continuum of frequencies, which can be used to measure electromagnetic response to various frequencies can using a single step. The magnetic field, created by an electric current from the inspection device, can penetrate through the one or more layers or constructions of the tank and stabilize in the layer of the tank. The electrical current generated by the inspection device can be disabled to cause a drop in the magnetic field, which can result in eddy currents appearing in the layers of the tank floor and decrease in strength over time. The pulsed eddy current probe can be used to monitor the decay in eddy currents, the decay time can determine the thickness of the tank. The electrical current magnitude in a given loop can be proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the area of the loop, and the rate of change of flux, and inversely proportional to the resistivity of a material.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">The inspection device can generate eddy currents by a plurality of conductors arranged in an array. A pulsed eddy current array can refer to a nondestructive testing technology that can provide the ability to drive multiple eddy currents coils, which can be placed side by side in the inspection device. Each individual eddy currents coil in the inspection device sends a strong magnetic field towards the floor below the coil and then abruptly releases that field. Each coil then measures the decay time of the eddy currents associated with the release of the magnetic field. The decay time can be converted into a thickness or corrosion level measurement.

A tank (e.g. a tank for containing one or more hazardous fluids), has walls with a predetermined thickness. The PECA device <b>1000</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> can include a seven-element array with 7 inches&#xd7;1 inch coverage, or about 178 millimeter linear coverage (each element in the linear array has a 1 square inch footprint on the floor). The PECA device <b>1000</b> can be inserted into a tank to detect one or more flaws in the walls of the tank.

The PECA device <b>1000</b> can be attached or coupled to the vehicle <b>101</b>. The PECA device <b>1000</b> can be interconnected or in electrical communication with at least the control unit <b>104</b> and other components of the vehicle <b>101</b>. The PECA device <b>1000</b> may be embedded in or constructed onto the vehicle <b>101</b>, such that the PECA device <b>1000</b> is a part of the vehicle <b>101</b>. The PECA device <b>1000</b> can be detachable from the vehicle <b>101</b> via a locking or latching mechanism (e.g., bolt, clip, or hook) implemented or installed with the vehicle <b>101</b> and the PECA device <b>1000</b>. The PECA device <b>1000</b> can be welded onto the vehicle <b>101</b> (e.g., non-removable). The PECA device <b>1000</b> may be installed on any portion of the vehicle <b>101</b>, such as the bottom, the top, the front, the rear, or the side of the vehicle <b>101</b>. The PECA device <b>1000</b> can be constructed with one or more components and features similar to the vehicle <b>101</b>, such as to prevent sparks or ignition to occur within the tank containing flammable fluid. The PECA device <b>1000</b> can be implemented with a battery or connected to the battery of the vehicle <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">For example, the inspection device <b>122</b> can include the PECA device <b>1000</b>, and the vehicle <b>101</b> can perform a tank inspection using the PECA device <b>1000</b>. The PECA device <b>1000</b> and any other PECA devices described herein can use advanced electromagnetic inspection technology and can be used to detect flaws and corrosion in ferromagnetic materials, among others. The PECA device <b>1000</b> and any other PECA devices described herein can include a corrosion mapping tool (e.g., screening tool) that can allow wall thickness measurements, and inspection through liftoff, coatings, and sedimentation. The PECA device <b>1000</b> and any other PECA devices described herein can be sensitive to far-side and near-side flaws, and may use grid (static) or dynamic (in motion) acquisition of data. For example, using grid data acquisition process, the vehicle <b>101</b> can travel from a first position to a second position within the tank. To measure the thickness of the tank, the vehicle <b>101</b> may stop at any given position within the tank and initiate the inspection of the tank wall using the PECA device <b>1000</b>. In another example, using the dynamic data acquisition process, the vehicle <b>101</b> may initiate the tank wall inspection using the PECA device <b>1000</b> while in motion (e.g., moving from the first position to the second position within the tank). The positions can refer to any locations within the tank (e.g., in contact with the interior surface of the tank or hovering above the interior surface in the flammable fluid within the tank).</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">The PECA device <b>1000</b> and any other PECA devices described herein use averaged wall thickness measurements within the footprint of each element making up the array. If the wall loss is constant across the footprint of an element, the remaining wall thickness can be measured by the element with an accuracy of +/&#x2212;10%, for example. In another example, if a defect is smaller in diameter than the wall footprint of an element, the measured thickness can be undersized due to the averaging of the wall thickness within the element footprint. The inspection area can be of similar dimensions to the PECA device <b>1000</b>. The magnetic field generated by the PECA device <b>1000</b> can expand as the liftoff distance increases between the PECA device <b>1000</b> and the tank wall. For example, as the liftoff distance increases, the magnitude of the magnetic field applied to a portion of the tank wall decreases. Alternatively, decreasing the liftoff distance can increase the magnitude of the magnetic field applied to the tank wall for measuring the tank wall thickness and corrosion.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">The magnetic field intensity generated by the PECA device <b>1000</b> can be adjusted based on the liftoff distance or the wall thickness. The control unit <b>104</b> can configure the magnetic field intensity, for example, responsive to receiving an instruction from an external computing device. For example, an operator can use an external computing device communicatively connected to the control unit <b>104</b> to control the PECA device <b>1000</b>. The vehicle <b>101</b> being in contact with the floor, the operator can control the liftoff distance of the PECA device <b>1000</b> from the tank wall (e.g., tank floor) and the magnetic field intensity via instructions from the external computing device. Responsive to receipt of the instructions from the external computing device, the vehicle <b>101</b> can move the PECA device <b>1000</b> up or down relative to the vehicle <b>101</b> and thereby make the PECA device <b>1000</b> move further from or descend closer to the tank floor, for example. The control unit <b>104</b> can determine whether the PECA device <b>1000</b> is at the desired liftoff distance according to the instructions from the operator using at least one ranging sensor. The control unit <b>104</b> can instruct the vehicle <b>101</b> to maintain the vertical position of the PECA device <b>1000</b> in the vehicle <b>101</b> upon an indication that the PECA device <b>1000</b> is at the desired liftoff distance from the tank floor. For example, the vehicle <b>101</b> may be in contact with the interior tank surface (e.g., tank floor or tank wall). The elevation of the PECA device <b>1000</b> relative to the vehicle <b>101</b> can be dynamically adjusted to maintain a liftoff distance. In this case, since the vehicle <b>101</b> can negatively buoyant (e.g., sink), the vehicle <b>101</b> can roll on the floor, for example, via a 3-point of contacts using multiple omnidirectional wheels mounted at the bottom of the vehicle <b>101</b>. Other omnidirectional wheels can be mounted at other portions of the vehicle <b>101</b>. The PECA device <b>1000</b> can be rigidly mounted in or on the vehicle <b>101</b>, to maintain or position the PECA device <b>1000</b> at a predetermined liftoff distance (e.g., 5&#x2033; from the tank surface), for example, as the vehicle <b>101</b> is in contact with the floor. In some cases, the PECA device <b>1000</b> liftoff distance can be adjusted external to the tank (e.g., by taking the vehicle out of the tank to manually move the PECA device <b>1000</b> up or down in a mounting bracket installed on the vehicle <b>101</b>). Subsequent to adjusting the PECA device <b>1000</b>, the vehicle <b>101</b> can be sent back to the tank. In some cases, the liftoff distance of the PECA device <b>1000</b> may not be dynamically adjusted on the vehicle <b>101</b> during a survey.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">The control unit <b>104</b> can configure the magnetic field intensity generated by the PECA device <b>1000</b> responsive to determining the wall thickness or the liftoff distance. For example, the vehicle resource repository <b>126</b> can include a list that includes one or more associations between magnetic field intensity data, liftoff distance data, and wall thickness information (e.g., factors or features associated with the PECA device <b>1000</b>). A list may be referred to as, or used interchangeably with other descriptive terms, such as a table, a registry, or a record. An association may be referred to as an entry, a row, or a column within the list storing a magnetic field intensity setting to use for a liftoff distance and a wall thickness (e.g, plate thickness). This list may be referred to as magnetic field strength or intensity list. The entry can include values, codes, or any type of computer-readable language for configuring the PECA device <b>1000</b> or other components of the vehicle <b>101</b>. The control unit <b>104</b> can use one or more features of an entry to calculate an unknown feature within the same entry. For example, to determine the magnetic field strength to use for inspection, the control unit <b>104</b> can identify an entry having a liftoff distance of the PECA device <b>1000</b> and a plate thickness of the tank for inspection. In another example, to determine the wall thickness, the control unit <b>104</b> can instruct the PECA device <b>1000</b> to collect decay rate data at a liftoff distance using a magnetic field intensity. Based on the collected decay rate, the control unit <b>104</b> can identify an entry consisting of the measured decay rate, the liftoff distance, and the magnetic field intensity corresponding to a plate thickness.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">For example, the control unit <b>104</b> can initiate a calibration procedure to measure the PECA's response in nominal plate thickness conditions. The vehicle <b>101</b> may not move laterally nor longitudinally with respect to the calibration area during the calibration procedure. In some cases, the vehicle <b>101</b> may move during the calibration procedure, for example, if the plate has consistent thickness throughout the traveled distance for the test and the speed is slow enough. The calibration procedure can include measuring the eddy current decay rate from the plate of the tank at constant liftoff.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">Subsequent to measuring the eddy current decay rate during the calibration procedure, the control unit <b>104</b> can determine the plate thickness by comparing the decay rates measured during the inspection with the decay rate measured during the calibration procedure. For example, a slower decay rate than that measured during the calibration procedure can indicate a thicker area than the calibration area and a faster decay rate can indicate a thinner area than the calibration area. The measurement data collected by one or more components of the vehicle <b>101</b> can be stored in the vehicle resource repository <b>126</b>. Data collection by the one or more components may be referred to generally as data collection by the vehicle <b>101</b>, or in some cases, the control unit <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">The plate thickness of the tank can be provided prior to the inspection. For example, the plate thickness can be uploaded onto the memory of the vehicle <b>101</b>, or onto the vehicle resource repository <b>126</b>. By knowing the original plate thickness of the tank under inspection, the control unit <b>104</b> can set a liftoff distance and magnetic field intensity corresponding to the plate thickness.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">In some cases, after the control unit <b>104</b> performs the calibration procedure, the plate thickness measured by the PECA device <b>1000</b> can exceed the actual plate thickness. This situation can indicate that the PECA system was calibrated in an area either thinner or thicker than the nominal plate thickness. The thickness data determined during the inspection can then be recalibrated using another decay rate signal measured during the inspection as reference decay rate.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">The control unit <b>104</b> can control the velocity or speed of the vehicle <b>101</b> inspecting the tank wall based on one or more aforementioned features (e.g., wall thickness, magnetic field intensity, or the liftoff distance). The velocity or speed may be part of an entry within the table. The entry can include the one or more features. Thus, the control unit <b>104</b> can set the velocity of the vehicle <b>101</b> to inspect the tank via dynamic acquisition procedures. The velocity of the vehicle <b>101</b> carrying the PECA device <b>1000</b> can be predetermined for initiating the inspection process.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0243">The PECA device <b>1000</b> can be used to detect wall thickness or corrosion in various applications. For example, the PECA device <b>1000</b> can detect corrosion under insulation (&#x201c;CUT&#x201d;), corrosion under fireproofing (&#x201c;CUF&#x201d;), scab corrosion, or flow accelerated corrosion (&#x201c;FAC&#x201d;). The thicker walls around the indication can influence the averaging calculation. The PECA device <b>1000</b> can be designed, constructed, and operated to detect isolated flow and general corrosion on both the top-side of the tank (e.g., inside the tank) and on the soil-side of the tank (e.g., an external surface of the tank in the ground). The PECA device <b>1000</b> can integrate with custom electronics and software (e.g., ATIS <b>102</b>) to provide autonomous tank inspection with numerous (e.g., millions) of scans. The PECA device <b>1000</b> can detect, determine, or otherwise identify slow changes in the thickness of a wall of a tank, in addition to isolated defects. The vehicle <b>101</b> can calibrate the PECA device <b>1000</b> based on the calibration area, and then perform a measurement using the PECA device <b>1000</b> as the inspection device. For example, the ATIS <b>102</b> can roll over the tank wall within the flammable fluid and identify an area of the tank that is suitable for calibration. The ATIS <b>102</b> can perform a calibration routine or process. Subsequent to calibration, the ATIS <b>102</b> can inspect the tank wall or initiate a measurement procedure. In some cases, the ATIS <b>102</b> can perform the calibration external to the tank.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">The PECA device <b>1000</b> can include one or more probes to monitor the decrease or decay in eddy currents. The decay in eddy currents can be used to determine the thickness of the tank wall. For example, the PECA device <b>1000</b> can include one or more probes and coils. The PECA device <b>1000</b> can generate a magnetic field by supplying electrical current to the coils of at least one probe. The magnetic field can penetrate through any layer in between the PECA device <b>1000</b> and the tank wall (e.g., an insulation layer, fireproofing layer, or coating). Subsequent to generating the magnetic field in the tank wall, the PECA device <b>1000</b> can cut-off the excitation magnetic field. By monitoring the decrease in eddy current using the probe of the PECA device <b>1000</b>, the PECA device <b>1000</b> can determine the thickness of the wall based on the decay rate (e.g., thicker materials will delay the decay of the eddy current). The measured decay rate of the tank wall can be compared with a calibration decay rate of the tank wall. The comparison can be performed by one or more processors of the control unit <b>104</b> in the vehicle <b>101</b>. The control unit <b>104</b> can receive the inspection data or raw data from the PECA device <b>1000</b> and store the data in the vehicle resource repository <b>126</b>. For example, the PECA device <b>1000</b> can receive inspection data to determine wall thickness and corrosion level. The wall thickness and corrosion level can be correlated, e.g., high corrosion level may indicate a thinner wall and low corrosion level may indicate a thicker wall. To determine small flaws on the tank wall, the PECA device <b>1000</b> can include a custom 7-element array with 7 inches&#xd7;1 inch coverage or 178 millimeters (e.g., each element of the linear array covers 1 square inch). The PECA device <b>1000</b> with the custom 7-element array may be referred to as a custom PECA device. The PECA device <b>1000</b> can be sensitive to isolated flaws and general corrosion, both top-side and soil-side.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">The PECA device <b>1000</b> can include hardware and software to support autonomous tank inspection. The software may be updated via electrical communication with the control unit <b>104</b>, such as during operation within the flammable fluid. For example, the control unit <b>104</b> can receive data packets from an external computing device (e.g., remote device or administrator device) to configure or update one or more features or software of the PECA device <b>1000</b>. Responsive to receiving the data packets, the control unit <b>104</b> can configure the software of the PECA device <b>1000</b>. The hardware and software of the PECA device <b>1000</b> can be updated, upgraded, or configured prior to initiating the tank inspection process or inserting the vehicle <b>101</b> into the tank. The vehicle <b>101</b> can be communicatively coupled to an external computing device via a fiber optic tether. The control unit <b>104</b> of the vehicle <b>101</b> can exchange data packets with the external computing device, including software or firmware of the PECA device <b>1000</b>. The aforementioned features and functionalities of the PECA device <b>1000</b>, and the control unit <b>104</b> providing instructions to the PECA device <b>1000</b>, can be utilized, performed, or otherwise executed similarly or in addition to features and functionalities of other PECA devices. The vehicle <b>101</b> can be structurally compatible with one or more PECA devices. The control unit <b>104</b> can be compatible or updated to be compatible with one or more PECA devices.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-B</figref>, depicted is a mounted PECA device <b>1100</b> scanning a metal plate <b>1120</b>. The PECA device <b>1100</b> can include similar hardware, software, features, and functionalities as the PECA device <b>1000</b> depicted and described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. The mounted PECA device <b>1100</b> can be used for demonstrative, testing, or inspection purposes, or may be further mounted on an autonomous carrier vehicle to facilitate the autonomous scanning of one or more tanks (e.g., tank wall). The mounted PECA device <b>1100</b> can be optimized for tank floor inspection. The PECA device <b>1100</b> may be maintained at a nominal liftoff distance of 0.5&#x2033; (or about 12.7 millimeters) from the plate or the tank wall, for example. The plate thickness range depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-B</figref> can be between 0.25 and 1.25 inches or between 6.35 and 31.75 millimeters. The plate of the tank wall can include a thickness of 0.25 inches and up. The plate thickness can be an indicator for the traveling velocity of the vehicle <b>101</b> equipped with the PECA device <b>1100</b>. The mounted PECA device <b>1100</b> can have a minimal footprint for optimal sensitivity.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0247">The PECA device <b>1100</b> can be mounted on or attached to a mounting mechanism <b>1110</b> (e.g., mount, mounting structure, locking mechanism, or attachment). The mounting mechanism <b>1110</b> can be constructed with non-magnetic materials similar to the vehicle <b>101</b> or the PECA device <b>1100</b>. In some cases, the mounting mechanism <b>1110</b> or other mounting mechanisms can be used to install the PECA device <b>1100</b> to the vehicle <b>101</b>. The installation process can include locking the PECA device <b>1100</b> with the mounting mechanism <b>1110</b> and coupling the mounting mechanism <b>1110</b> with the PECA device <b>1100</b> to the vehicle <b>101</b>. The vehicle <b>101</b> can include a coupling component or mechanism to lock the PECA device <b>1100</b>. The vehicle <b>101</b> can include the coupling component on any part of the vehicle <b>101</b>, such as the front, rear, sides, bottom, top, or in some cases, inside the vehicle <b>101</b>. The mounting mechanism <b>1110</b> can be implemented in the chassis design of the PECA device <b>1100</b>. For example, the PECA device <b>1100</b> can be designed with at least one coupling feature, such as grooves, notches, protrusions, indentations, cleats, or latch. The vehicle <b>101</b> can include similar features to support or compatible with the coupling feature of the PECA device <b>1100</b>. The PECA device <b>1100</b> and the mounting mechanism <b>1110</b> can be coated with fire retardant substances, include at least one insulation layer, or other components to prevent sparks, reduce heat emission from the vehicle <b>101</b> or the PECA device <b>1100</b>, or prevent substances from entering the vehicle <b>101</b> or the PECA device <b>1100</b>.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0248">The metal plate <b>1120</b> may be referred to generally as a plate, constructed with one or more materials resistant to impact, changes in temperature, corrosion, or other potentially hazardous conditions. The resistivity provided by the materials can refer to a reduction in the consequences caused by external or internal environmental conditions. For example, the temperature, humidity, or objects impacting the plate may cause damages which leads to a reduction in plate thickness or an increase in corrosion level. The plate may be coated with at least a layer of fireproofing or corrosion preventive substances to reduce the degradation of the plate due to environmental conditions. The thickness of the plate can be consistent throughout. For example, from measuring the portions of the plate (e.g., from edge to edge), the corrosion level, plate thickness percentage, or other indicators of the plate thickness can be similar (e.g., within 1%, 2%, or 5% accuracy from the expected plate thickness). In other cases, the thickness of the plate may not be consistent. The plate can include corrosion, dent, bump, fold, or other abnormalities decreasing, or in some cases increasing, the plate thickness. The PECA device <b>1100</b> can average the thickness of the plate within a measured area. For example, the PECA device <b>1100</b> can be configured to cover 7 square inches of the plate for each measurement. The PECA device <b>1100</b> can be configured to cover greater or fewer areas, such as 3 square inches, 10 square inches, or 12 square inches. The PECA device <b>1100</b> can include hardware and software components to support measuring the plate thickness in various dimensions. Alternatively, the PECA device <b>1100</b> may not average the thickness of the plate. Instead, the PECA device <b>1100</b> can label one or more portions of the measured area to indicate the corrosion level or plate thickness respective to each portion, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. Therefore, by collecting raw data and labeling each portion of the plate thickness or corrosion level, undersizing the defects can be avoided. The metal plate <b>1120</b> can represent the plates used for constructing the tank wall for containing the flammable fluid (e.g., material, thickness, density, coating, or condition).</p><p id="p-0250" num="0249">Before inserting the vehicle <b>101</b> into the tank for inspection, the PECA device <b>1100</b> installed with the vehicle <b>101</b> can be tested using the metal plate <b>1120</b>. For example, the PECA device <b>1100</b> can collect plate thickness data or corrosion level data of the metal plate <b>1120</b> (e.g., test plate). The test plate may be representative of the tank wall. Subsequent to collecting the data, an operator can measure an actual thickness or an actual corrosion level of the test plate via additional tools. These tools may or may not be optimized for tank floor inspection. The differences between the measurement data collected via the PECA device <b>1100</b> can the actual measurement data collected via the additional tools can be calculated, for example, using an external computing device or the control unit <b>104</b> of the vehicle <b>101</b>. The operator can configure or calibrate the PECA device <b>1100</b> based on the differences between the measurement data and the actual measurement data. The control unit <b>104</b> can receive the measurement data and the actual measurement data. In response to the receipt, the control unit <b>104</b> can configure or calibrate the PECA device <b>1100</b> accordingly. The calibration process can include configuring the settings of the voltage supplied to the PECA device <b>1100</b> (e.g., to increase or decrease magnetic field strength, the liftoff distance (e.g., either globally for the version of PECA devices or specifically for this PECA device <b>1100</b>), or the velocity, if measuring the test plate while moving. The calibration process can include updating or reverting to a previous version of software or firmware.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0250">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, depicted is a diagram describing the liftoff of the illustrative PECA device <b>1200</b>. The PECA device <b>1200</b> can be similar to or include features and functionalities of the PECA devices depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>. As depicted, the illustrative PECA device <b>1200</b> has a nominal liftoff value from the plate (e.g., tank wall). The plate can have a predetermined thickness. The plate can also have a varying thickness throughout its surface, for example, each location on the plate may have a different thickness within predetermined or calculated boundaries. The plate thickness can represent or correspond to a corrosion level. The illustrative PECA device <b>1200</b> can scan the plate without contacting the plate. For example, the PECA device <b>1200</b> may be floating in the flammable fluid, thereby elevating from the plate. The PECA device <b>1200</b> can produce accurate sensor readings (e.g., PECA sensor readings, corrosion readings, other readings, etc.) while at a predetermined or calculated distance (e.g., liftoff distance) away from the plate.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0251">The plate can be coated or coupled with an additional layer. The coating or layer can include fire retardant substances, insulated layer, vapor layer, or corrosion preventive coating. The coating or layer can be applied to the plate, such as internal to the tank. The coating or layer can sit between the PECA device <b>1200</b> and the plate. The PECA device <b>1200</b> can collect data through the layer (e.g., emitting a magnetic field through the layer into the plate). The vehicle <b>101</b> with the PECA device <b>1200</b> can contact the layer without contacting the plate to collect plate thickness data (e.g., raw data, magnetic field data, decay data, or corrosion level data). The vehicle <b>101</b> can avoid contact with the layer or the plate to collect plate thickness data.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0252">The liftoff distance can be the same as the plate thickness. The liftoff distance can be dependent on the plate thickness, for example, the liftoff distance can be a function of the plate thickness. The liftoff distance can be dependent on the capabilities of the illustrative PECA device <b>1200</b>. For example, each PECA device <b>1200</b> (or any other PECA devices described herein) can include a nominal liftoff value which describes a nominal liftoff distance configuration.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0253">In some cases, the interior tank surface, such as the tank wall (e.g., tank shell), tank floor, or the borders of the tank can be curved. For example, when inspecting the vertical wall or shell of a cylindrical tank, the vehicle <b>101</b> may traverse in the flammable fluid and make contact with the shell using rollers. The side of the vehicle <b>101</b> where the PECA device <b>1200</b> is installed can face the plate to collect plate thickness information. While inspecting the tank wall, the vehicle <b>101</b> with the PECA device <b>1200</b> can move along the wall to continuously collect plate thickness information at uninspected areas. The vehicle <b>101</b> can change its depth to access the entire shell of the tank. Controlling the depth of the vehicle <b>101</b> can be achieved via instructions from the control unit <b>104</b>. Therefore, the control unit <b>104</b> can maintain the liftoff distance between the shell and the PECA device <b>1200</b> by maintaining the robot's rollers in contact with the shell.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0254">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, depicted is an example rendering <b>1300</b> of one or more PECA sensors. The PECA sensors can be from at least one of the PECA device, for example, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>, <b>11</b></figref>, or <b>12</b>. The example rendering <b>1300</b> may be referred to generally as a render <b>1300</b> of raw data collected from the PECA sensors. The render <b>1300</b> can represent a portion of the tank wall. The render <b>1300</b> can include one or more values which describe the thickness of the tank wall (e.g., plate, surface, or material). The values can be obtained by processing the raw data collected via the PECA sensors. The render <b>1300</b> can include one or more values indicating the corrosion level of the plate. The render <b>1300</b> can be displayed as a 2D image. The render <b>1300</b> can be displayed as a 3D image, navigable via a compatible software. The render <b>1300</b> can be saved as any file format available for reproduction in the compatible software, for example, STL, OBJ, FBX, EPS, 3DS, CSV, or PDF. The example render <b>1300</b> can represent a custom 7-element array with 7 inches coverage (178 mm). The renders can cover a larger area of processed data from the PECA sensors, such as 8 inches, 10 inches, or other sizes. The renders may cover a smaller portion of the tank plate based on a rendering setting.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0255">The raw data indicative of the thickness level or corrosion level can be used by a machine learning engine. The machine learning engine can process the raw data to generate a 3D map, structure, or model of the tank. The generated 3D model may be saved in any 3D compatible file type, as mentioned above. The render <b>1300</b> can render values that are obtained from any of the PECA devices described herein. The render <b>1300</b> can be indicative of more than one PECA sensor or device. The render <b>1300</b> may be based on one or more post-processing methods, for example, post-processing to calibrate the one or more PECA devices described herein.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0256">The render <b>1300</b> can be displayed via a display device of the external computing device. The display device can be in electrical communication with the control unit of the vehicle <b>101</b> (e.g., the display device installed in or on the vehicle <b>101</b>). In some cases, the render <b>1300</b> can be generated by the control unit <b>104</b>, such as in real-time or responsive to receiving the raw data from the PECA sensors. Responsive to an event may refer to performing an action or process immediately after the event. The render <b>1300</b> can be generated by the external computing device. For example, the control unit <b>104</b> can receive the raw data from the PECA sensors. The control unit <b>104</b> may store the raw data in the vehicle resource repository <b>126</b>. The control unit <b>104</b> can transmit the raw data to the external computing device for generating the render <b>1300</b>. In some cases, the raw data may not be stored in the vehicle source repository <b>126</b>. Instead, the raw data may be stored in an external data repository subsequent to transmitting the raw data to the external computing device.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0257">The example render <b>1300</b> can include a user interface for configuring display settings of the render <b>1300</b>. The settings can include a compensated wall thickness (&#x201c;CWT&#x201d;) to provide an indication of the remaining wall thickness. The measurement can be represented by a percentage, comparing the measured plate thickness to the nominal plate thickness. For example, when losing wall thickness, such as due to corrosion or other damages, the measured wall thickness (e.g., wall thickness percentage) can be below 100%. In another example, when wall thickness is gained, such as at a welded portion of the tank, the wall thickness percentage can be above 100%.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0258">The example render <b>1300</b> can include a rendered plate with multiple corroded regions. These regions may be labeled as shown in the render <b>1300</b>, such as region <b>1310</b> (COR: 35.0% (2.2 mm)), <b>1320</b> (COR: 30.2% (1.9 mm)), <b>1330</b> (COR: 37.3% (2.4 mm)), <b>1340</b> (COR: 55.9% (3.5 mm)), <b>1350</b> (COR: 36.2% (2.3 mm)), <b>1360</b> (COR: 36.4% (2.3 mm)), and <b>1370</b>. Each region may be labeled with, for example, the percentage displayed in the render <b>1300</b> that(?) may not represent corrosion level. Instead, the percentage can represent a remaining thickness of the plate from the original plate thickness. For example, the percentage indicated by each region can indicate the remaining material or thickness of the plate, such as 35%, 30.2%, 37.3%, or 55.9% of the original plate thickness. The corresponding plate thickness value can accompany the percentage, such as 2.2 mm for the 35%, 1.9 mm for the 30.2%, 2.4 mm for the 37.3%, and 8.5 mm for the 55.9%. The original thickness for each region of the plate may not be the same. The original thickness for each region may be similar or approximate to other regions. The original thickness may indicate an average thickness throughout the region of interest (e.g., the regions indicated by the aforementioned labels). For example, the original thickness of region <b>1310</b> can be 6.29 mm, whereas the original thickness of region <b>1360</b> can be 6.32 mm. The original thickness throughout the plate can be the same. The term &#x201c;original thickness&#x201d; may refer to a thickness measurement of the whole plate or a portion of the plate, for example, before the plate departs from the production facility, exposes to unsupervised or harsh environmental condition (e.g., flammable fluid), uses for constructing the tank, or filling the tank with flammable fluid. In some cases, the percentage or value indicated for each region may not be an average of the whole region. Instead, the percentage or value can indicate the remaining plate thickness of a portion of the region, e.g., the thinnest or the most corroded portion of each region. For example, referring to region <b>1310</b>, the 35% thickness may represent a thickness at the center of the region. Further from the center of region <b>1310</b>, the percentage may increase above 35%, thereby labeling the thinnest portion of the plate region. By detecting the thickness or corrosion level at each portion of the plate, the undersizing measurement can be avoided. Undersizing can occur when the thickness at a portion of the plate is not accurately depicted due to the defects being smaller than the averaging area (e.g., region).</p><p id="p-0260" num="0259">The scale of the thickness percentage or the corrosion level may be represented by a color spectrum in the render <b>1300</b>, such as from dark red to dark blue. From dark red, the color can include orange, yellow, green, cyan, and eventually blue to represent the thickness level, for example. The color settings may be configured by the external computing device or an administrator device running the software to obtain the render <b>1300</b>. In the case of render <b>1300</b>, dark red represents a thinner portion of the plate and dark blue represents a thicker portion of the plate. Therefore, any portion of the plate represented with a red highlight, such as in the render <b>1300</b>, may indicate a high risk of leakage. Any portion of the tank indicated by the red highlight may be notified to the external computing device. For example, the control unit <b>104</b> can process raw data received from the PECA sensors to determine the thickness percentage or a corrosion level for a portion of the plate. In response to a detection of less than 60% plate thickness, the control unit <b>104</b> can transmit an indication or a warning to the external computing device. The notification can indicate a high risk of leakage at the portion of the plate.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0260">The render <b>1300</b> can be generated using a machine learning engine. The machine learning engine may be trained with sample raw data and actual measurement data. By comparing, matching, and identifying the differences between the sample raw data and the actual measurement data, the machine learning engine can generate a model optimized for determining plate thickness based on collected raw data from the PECA sensors. The machine learning engine may be embedded in the control unit <b>104</b> to collect and render an image of the tank wall. The external computing device can include the machine learning engine to render the image subsequent to receiving the raw data from the control unit <b>104</b> of the vehicle <b>101</b> (e.g., during operation or after retrieving the vehicle <b>101</b> from the tank).</p><p id="p-0262" num="0261">A label can be created for an unidentified region of the plate. For example, an unidentified region can refer to a region of the plate the control unit <b>104</b> or the external computing device is not able to accurately determine the risk level, corrosion level, or plate thickness. An example region for the unidentified region can be depicted in region <b>1370</b>. When presenting region <b>1370</b> to an operator via a display device of the external computing device, the external computing device can provide an option for manual input of corrosion information and risk level. The corrosion information manually inputted by the operator can be used to train the machine learning engine for optimizing other labeling schemes or risk level determination. The control unit <b>104</b> can determine to reinspect a portion of the plate in response to an unidentified region. The unidentified portion region can indicate a borderline case of leakage risk, such as a 60% or 3.76 mm plate thickness.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0262">The percentage or value of the render <b>1300</b> can represent a corrosion level. For example, a high percentage can represent a high corrosion level (e.g., the measured portion of the plate is more corroded) or a reduction in thickness at a portion of the plate. Therefore, the percentage can represent a percentage of thickness loss or corroded at a portion or region of the plate. In some cases, the unit measurement can be represented via a value. The value can indicate the thickness of material loss, such as when calculated against the nominal wall thickness (e.g., original wall thickness). For example, an original plate thickness may be approximately 6.3 mm. By processing the raw data received from the PECA sensors, the control unit <b>104</b> can identify a corrosion level of 30%. The control unit <b>104</b> can display plate thickness lost corresponding to the corrosion level at a portion of the plate. In this case, the plate thickness lost can amount to 1.89 mm, 30% of the original plate thickness. Therefore, the thickness of this portion of the plate can be 4.41 mm.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0263">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, depicted are example data output renderings from one or more PECA devices (e.g., graph <b>1400</b>A) and one or more magnetic flux leakage (MFL) devices (e.g., graph <b>1400</b>B). The data rendered in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, for example, the graph <b>1400</b>A or the graph <b>1400</b>B, can be collected from a plate removed from a tank during a floor repair. The rendered data can be from rendering sensor data collected from a plate within a tank containing flammable fluid, such as during an in-service inspection. The plate can be scanned with one or more PECA sensors or one or more MFL sensors to collect the data represented by the graph <b>1400</b>A and the graph <b>1400</b>B. The graph <b>1400</b>A can be created using at least one of the PECA devices described herein, for example the PECA device <b>1000</b>, or the mounted PECA device <b>1100</b>.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0264">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, soil-side effects can be detected by both technologies. The representation of the data can be different between data collected via the PECA device or data collected via the MFL device. The graph <b>1400</b>B for the MFL device can be filtered to identify at least 15% of measured wall loss. Therefore, the graph <b>1400</b>B may not present other minor defects of the tank, in this case. The defect threshold can be set for graph <b>1400</b>B, such that other percentage of measured wall loss can be shown in graph <b>1400</b>B (e.g., 10%, 7%, or 5%). The graph <b>1400</b>A can be generated from raw data collected from PECA sensors. The graph <b>1400</b>A can illustrate averaged wall thickness measurements with a resolution of 1 inch by 0.5 inches, for example. The size of the resolution can be relative to a portion of the plate (e.g., 1 inch by 0.5 inches of the plate). The resolution size can be predetermined and configured by an operator. The resolution size for each portion of the plate can be different. For example, the resolution for a first portion can be 1 inch by 0.5 inches, while a second portion can be 0.5 inches by 0.5 inches within the same graph. Different resolution can be used to avoid undersizing the defects of the plate.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0265">The resolution size can increase, based on an accurate representation of an averaged area of the plate. For example, if a first portion and a second portion of the plate both indicate 90% thickness, the two portions can be combined to a resolution of 1.5 inches by 0.5 inches or 0.5 inches by 1.5 inches. The resolution size can be referred to as pixel size for rendering the graphs. By increasing the resolution size, resource consumption by the control unit <b>104</b> or the external computing device can be reduced. The resolution size can be determined automatically. For example, using the raw data collected from the PECA sensors, one or more processors (e.g., of the control unit <b>104</b> or the external computing device) can initially render a high-resolution graph. A high-resolution graph can indicate a greater number of pixels, or in the above case, less resolution size. The high-resolution render can include a resolution size of 0.25 inches by 0.25 inches, for example. From detecting the corrosion level around each pixel or portion of each graph rendered at the resolution size, the one or more processors can average its surrounding pixels with the same corrosion level. Therefore, each portion of each graph can include different resolution sizes, thereby increasing accuracy of defects depiction and reducing resources when rendering each graph on multiple devices.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0266">Referring to graphs <b>1400</b>A and <b>1400</b>B depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, multiple soil side defect colonies can be identified. These soil side defect colonies can be labeled as, for example, regions <b>1410</b>A, <b>1420</b>A, <b>1430</b>A, and <b>1440</b>A for graph <b>1400</b>A and <b>1410</b>B, <b>1420</b>B, <b>1430</b>B, and <b>1440</b>B for graph <b>1400</b>B. From a visual comparison between the two graphs, each colony or region from one graph can be matched with the respective region of the other graph. For example, region <b>1410</b>A includes similar patterns as <b>1410</b>B, <b>1420</b>A includes similar patterns as <b>1420</b>B, <b>1430</b>A includes similar patterns as <b>1430</b>B, and <b>1440</b>A includes similar patterns as <b>1440</b>B. Thus, the generated graph <b>1400</b>A from raw data collected by the PECA sensors can provide a high-accuracy soil-side defects detection. The graph <b>1400</b>A can be presented with multiple heat affected zones (&#x201c;HAZ&#x201d;) as labeled above and below the graph <b>1400</b>A.

The robot <b>1500</b> can include onboard battery power, one or more fiber optic data tethers, and one or more self-contained navigation systems. The robot <b>1500</b> can hover in the product (e.g., diesel, jet fuel, etc.) for mapping of floor obstacles. The robot <b>1500</b> can roll on the bottom of a tank or surface and critical zones for non-destructive testing data acquisition. The robot <b>1500</b> can perform automated surveys, for example, by implementing one or more of the methods described herein. The robot <b>1500</b> can include a PECA device <b>1570</b>, for example, the mounted PECA device <b>1100</b> mounted at the back of the robot <b>1500</b>, which can provide access to the floor and critical zones. The PECA device <b>1570</b> may be installed in other portions or location of the robot <b>1500</b> for access to the tank wall. The robot <b>1500</b> can provide a 0.5&#x2033; liftoff using a rigid mounting bracket, and 3 or more contact points with the floor. The mount of the PECA device <b>1570</b> can be rotatable at any angle or extendable to reach the tank wall. For example, the robot can roll along the tank floor, and rotate the PECA device <b>1570</b> to measure the vertical wall of the tank. The robot <b>1500</b> can include a brush <b>1565</b> for brushing the surface of the tank, such as ahead of the PECA to improve sensor readings, which is an improvement over other implementations.

These propellers can be located at various sides of the robot <b>1500</b> for movement within the flammable fluid. For example, propeller <b>1505</b> can move the robot vertically, propeller <b>1510</b> can move the robot longitudinally, and propeller <b>1515</b> can move the robot laterally. The propeller <b>1515</b> can rotate the robot <b>1500</b> in the vertical axis, such that the robot <b>1500</b> can move in a different longitudinal direction. The propellers can include multiple angular blades constructed using a spark-proof material. The propellers can increase or decrease the velocity of the robot <b>1500</b> based on the rotation speed and direction. For example, rotating the propeller clockwise at an increasing speed can increase the velocity of the robot <b>1500</b> going forward, and rotating the propeller counterclockwise can increase the velocity of the robot <b>1500</b> going backward. The propellers of the robot <b>1500</b> can be in electrical communication with the control unit <b>104</b> to receive electrical signals for initiating movements.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0270">The robot <b>1500</b> can include multiple wheels, such as wheel <b>1520</b>.

The wheels can be used to move the robot on the surfaces of the tank. The wheels can act as bumpers to avoid potential impact between the robot <b>1500</b> and the tank wall. The wheel can include a suspension system. The suspension system can elevate the robot <b>1500</b> from the ground and absorb the impact experienced by the body of the robot <b>1500</b> when falling to the tank floor, for example. The wheels of the robot <b>1500</b> can be in electrical communication with the control unit <b>104</b> or receive electrical signals for initiating movements.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0271">The robot <b>1500</b> can include a casing <b>1530</b>. The casing <b>1530</b> can house the electronics of the robot <b>1500</b> including the battery, the control unit <b>104</b>, the memory, or other components of the ATIS <b>102</b>. The casing <b>1530</b> can be constructed with impact-resistant material, spark-resistant material, temperature control coating (e.g., to maintain a consistent temperature of the robot <b>1500</b>), corrosion-resistant coating, fire-retardant coating, or other materials similar to the vehicle <b>101</b>. The casing <b>1530</b> may be referred to as the body of the robot <b>1500</b>. Electrical connections may be linked back to one or more components within the casing <b>1530</b>. The casing <b>1530</b> can include screw holes, sockets, or inserts to couple components to the exterior of the casing <b>1530</b>, such as the brush <b>1565</b>, the brush extender <b>1560</b>, and the mapping sonar <b>1550</b>. The casing <b>1530</b> may be symmetrical. The casing <b>1530</b> may be asymmetrical to fit additional components on a side of the casing <b>1530</b>.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0272">The robot <b>1500</b> can include at least one mapping sonar <b>1550</b>. The mapping sonar <b>1550</b> can generate the tank map by projecting sounds and recording the reflected sounds. For example, upon entering the tank, the robot can initiate the mapping sonar <b>1550</b> to generate a map of the tank. The generated map can be compared to a map provided by the external computing device prior to deployment into the tank. The pre-stored map (e.g., in the vehicle resource repository <b>126</b>) can be configured based on the generated map. For example, the map provided by the external computing device can be a barebone map with dimensions of the tank. Using the mapping sonar <b>1550</b>, the robot <b>1500</b> can detect pipes, middle column, and other objects or obstructions within the tank. Hence, the robot <b>1500</b> can configure the pre-stored map with data from the generated map, for example, to include exclusion zones.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0273">The robot <b>1500</b> can include at least one connector compatible with one or more wet cable penetrators.

The connector can include a cap to prevent liquid from entering. The connector can connect with the wet cable penetrators outside the tank or before submerging in the flammable fluid. The connection can be performed post-submersion. The connection between these components can be maintained throughout the tank inspection. The connection can be maintained only outside the tank in some cases, such that the connection is disconnected before the robot <b>1500</b> submerges in the flammable fluid. The control unit <b>104</b> can communicate with the external computing device via the connection between the connector and the cable. The control unit <b>104</b> can transmit data packages to the external computing device via the connection, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0274">The robot <b>1500</b> can include at least one brush <b>1565</b> for clearing debris from the tank surface. The debris may be in a solid-state or a jello form. For example, the flammable fluid can attach and harden on the tank wall. The brush <b>1565</b> can be attached to a brush extender <b>1560</b>. The extender <b>1560</b> can act as a piston to extend the brush <b>1565</b> to a certain reach, as capable by the extender <b>1560</b>. The extender <b>1560</b> can include a motor or gear for rotating the brush <b>1565</b>. By providing the rotation to the brush <b>1565</b>, the speed to clear the debris can be enhanced. The extender <b>1560</b> can be in electrical communication with the control unit <b>104</b> to activate, deactivate, or otherwise control the brush <b>1565</b>. The extender <b>1560</b> can be attached to any location of the robot <b>1500</b>. The location of the extender <b>1560</b> can correspond to the location of the brush <b>1565</b>. As an example, and depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the brush <b>1565</b> and the extender <b>1560</b> are located at the bottom of the robot <b>1500</b>. The extender <b>1560</b> and the brush <b>1565</b> can be installed at any location adjacent to the PECA device <b>1570</b>, such as to clean the surface of the plate for data collection by the PECA sensors. The brush <b>1565</b> can be composed of anti-static materials.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0275">The brush <b>1565</b> can include or be replaced with a suction mechanism or device. For example, the suction device can be connected to the extender <b>1560</b>. In this case, the extender <b>1560</b> can include a pump to both extend the suction device and pull in the debris from the tank wall. The pump can lead the removed debris from the suction device to a waste bin located in the casing <b>1530</b>, for example. In some cases, the suction device may dispose of the removed debris into the flammable fluid of the tank. The debris can refer to hardened flammable fluid stuck on the tank wall. The robot <b>1500</b> can include a grinding device interconnected with the pump. The grinding device can grind the debris to smaller particles for disposition. The grinding device can be included in the extender <b>1560</b>, for example. The debris can be grounded back to a liquid state, such that the robot <b>1500</b> can dispose of the grounded debris in the flammable fluid.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0276">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-B</figref>, depicted are mounting mechanism <b>1600</b>A and mounting mechanism <b>1600</b>B for one or more autonomous robots for tank inspection (e.g, the robot <b>1630</b> or the vehicle <b>101</b>). The robot <b>1630</b> can include a coupling mechanism for attaching a cable to lower the robot <b>1630</b> from the tank roof. For example, the component <b>1640</b> can include a coupling mechanism, such as a lock, a hook, or an anchor for attachment with the cable. The coupling mechanism can be in electrical communication with the control unit <b>104</b>. The coupling mechanism can release a lock attaching the cable to the robot <b>1630</b>. The lock can be released upon the robot <b>1630</b> contact with the flammable fluid within the tank. In another example, upon executing an exit procedure, the robot <b>1630</b> can identify the location of a cable reeling down from the tank roof. The robot <b>1630</b> can align the coupling mechanism to the cable and perform a connection between the coupling mechanism and the cable. Thereafter, the robot <b>1630</b> can be reeled up to the tank roof, completing the in-service inspection process.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0277">The in-service inspection process can include the following, among others. The robot <b>1630</b> can be reeled down from the top of the tank via a cable coupled to a coupling mechanism. Upon entering the flammable fluid, the control unit <b>104</b> can transmit an electrical signal to the coupling mechanism to release the cable from the robot <b>1630</b> or the coupling mechanism can be mechanically decoupled. The robot may not be attached to any cable or wires. An operator can remove the cable from the tank and close the tank lid. The robot <b>1630</b> can detect that the lid has been closed, and initiate the installed inspection process. The inspection process can include a predetermined route (e.g., stored in the vehicle resource repository <b>126</b>) for inspection portions of the tank, such as the floor or the wall. The robot <b>1630</b> can follow the route to inspect the predetermined portions of the tank using the propellers. In each area, depending on the debris or substances coated on the tank plate, the robot <b>1630</b> can use the brush <b>1565</b>, extendable by the extender <b>1560</b>, to clean the plate. The robot <b>1630</b> can use the PECA device <b>1640</b> to inspect each portion of the plate. The PECA device <b>1640</b> can inspect the plate during a pause.

Upon inspecting all the portions of the tank, the robot <b>1630</b> can execute an exit procedure by coupling with a cable reeled down from the tank roof. When executing the exit procedure, the control unit <b>104</b> can transmit a signal to the external computing device, notifying an operator to reel down a cable.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0278">The robot <b>1630</b> can be set to inspect all portions of the tank. For example, in addition to the predetermined route, the robot <b>1630</b> may detect that at least one portion of the tank was not inspected. The control unit <b>104</b> can compare locations of the inspected tank portions to a map stored in the memory. Upon identifying an uninspected portion of the tank, the robot <b>1630</b> can travel to the uninspected location and perform an inspection using the PECA device <b>1570</b>. The robot <b>1630</b> can identify one or more uninspected portions via a visual sensor identifying inspectable portions within the tank. The predetermined route can indicate one or more portions of the tank not to inspect. The portions to not inspect may be referred to as exclusion zones.

Accordingly, the robot <b>1500</b> can ignore the uninspected area, not within the dive plan <b>1700</b>A. In some other implementations, the robot <b>1500</b> can be configured to inspect all uninspected areas or at least areas reachable by the PECA device <b>1570</b>. In this case, the robot <b>1500</b> can travel or inspect outside the dive plan <b>1700</b>A. Thus, any indication of uninspected areas can be inspected by the robot <b>1500</b>.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0287">After measuring the tank using the dive plan, the controller software can retrieve the measurements from the one or more sensors (e.g., the PECA devices described herein) and create a track line rendering <b>1700</b>B of where the robot has scanned. As seen in the example track lines <b>1700</b>B, the portions inspected by the robot <b>1500</b> extends beyond the dive plan <b>1700</b>A. In other words, as an example, the dive plan <b>1700</b>A can be a movement guide for the robot <b>1500</b>, instead of an inspection location. Therefore, the robot <b>1500</b> can move along the dive plan <b>1700</b>A and measure the areas around the robot <b>1500</b> while moving in accordance with the dive plan <b>1700</b>A. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref>, in addition to the exclusion zones <b>1710</b>, <b>1720</b>, and <b>1730</b>, the dive plan <b>1700</b>A may conserve 3 feet of space between the robot <b>1500</b> and the tank wall, such as due to parallel arcs within the 3 feet from the tank wall. Hence, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref>, the actual track lines <b>1700</b>B may indicate one or more portions of the tank inspected by the robot <b>1500</b>, which may not be directly correlated to the dive plan <b>1700</b>A (e.g., the robot <b>1500</b> is not directly at the inspected portion). For planned tracks near the tank shell, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A-C</figref> can illustrate the dive plan, the actual track lines, and the NDT coverage near the tank shell.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0288">Using the actual sensor data, the controller software can render the NDT coverage <b>1700</b>C of the tank using the track lines and the sensor information about tank thickness. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, different plate thickness can be highlighted via various color schemes, such as in a spectrum from dark red to dark blue. Each inspected portion of the tank may be labeled with a corrosion level or tank thickness percentage upon rendering the NDT coverage <b>1700</b>C. In some cases, the NDT coverage <b>1700</b>C may not indicate dire defects within the tank plate (e.g., all portion of the tank plate include a thickness of 80% or more remaining). After generating the NDT coverage <b>1700</b>C, an additional dive plan can be created to remedy the defects within the tank wall or floor (e.g., at least one portion of the tank plate includes a thickness of less than 50%). For example, subsequent to completing the tank inspection, the robot <b>1500</b> can be retrieved from the tank. Sensor data collected via the PECA device <b>1570</b> can be retrieved to generate the NDT coverage <b>1700</b>C of the tank. The robot <b>1500</b> can transmit new sensor data in response to a collection by the PECA device <b>1570</b>. Once the NDT coverage <b>1700</b>C is generated, defects of the tank plate including the tank wall and floor can be identified. The defects can be notified to the operator via a notification to the external computing device based on a defect threshold. For example, the operator can configure or provide a predetermined defect threshold. The predetermined defect threshold can include a range of tank thickness or corrosion levels, such as a thickness of less than 60%, corrosion level of greater than 40%, or a decay rate of less than 25 ms for a magnetic field strength powered at 7 voltage. Other thresholds can be viable depending on what is considered a high-risk level. For example, a 50% wall thickness for a 1-foot plate may be of less risk than a 70% wall thickness for a 1-inch plate. Therefore, in response to the defect threshold, the robot <b>1500</b> can provide an indication of a risk level at each portion of the tank to the operator via the external computing device. Furthermore, the risk level can depend on the substances contained by the plate, such as flammable fluid, non-flammable fluid, or toxic compounds.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0289">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref>, the dive plan <b>1700</b>A can indicate different regions for utilizing different inspection procedures. Each region of the tank may require different settings and configurations for the PECA device <b>1570</b>, or other inspection devices thereof. For example, each region of the tank may be constructed using different plate thicknesses (e.g., thicker plate at the lower portion of the tank and thinner plate at the higher portion of the tank wall). The different regions may be labeled by the operator for the robot <b>1500</b> to adjust the inspection setting to meet the region requirement. The setting can include liftoff distance, magnetic field intensity, or traveling velocity of the vehicle. The control unit can appropriately adjust each setting to meet the requirement of each portion to inspect. For example, different regions can be illustrated in the dive plan <b>1700</b>A by way of changing the track lines color upon entering a new region. The robot <b>1500</b> can move differently upon entering a new region.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0290">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A-B</figref>, depicted are the effects of post-processing on the PEC data. An example illustration of raw PEC data render <b>1800</b>A is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>. An example illustration of aligned PEC data render <b>1800</b>B is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref>. Note that in the raw PEC data <b>1800</b>A does not line up with the aligned PEC data render <b>1800</b>A. For example, the raw PEC data <b>1800</b>A can be adjusted to align with weld seams <b>1810</b> detected in the PEC data with the render <b>1800</b>A. Prior to the adjustment, the raw PEC data render <b>1800</b>A can be skewed from the weld seams <b>1810</b> in the tank, such that the weld seams <b>1810</b> is not reflected in the render <b>1800</b>A. In contrast, the aligned PEC data uses one or more post-processing algorithms to align the PEC data to the weld seams <b>1810</b> in the tank, which is an improvement over other implementations.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0291">For example, the raw PEC data can be collected using one or more PECA devices, as depicted in at least <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>12</b>, and <b>15</b></figref>. The robot <b>1500</b> can use the PECA device <b>1570</b> to collect the raw PEC data. The raw PEC data can be provided as input to a post-processing software to align weld seams <b>1810</b> detected in PEC data with the render <b>1700</b>A. Real-time positioning of the robot <b>1500</b> during the inspection of each portion of the tank can be provided to the software for processing the PEC data. For example, the software can apply a translation or a rotation to each band of the raw PEC data to line-up with the rendered image <b>1800</b>A. After processing the PEC data, the software can output the rendered aligned PEC data <b>1800</b>B with an aligned weld seams <b>1810</b>.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0292">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, depicted is PEC data of a section of a 180-foot diameter tank scanned using one of the systems described herein. The PEC data can be represented in render <b>1900</b>. The PEC data can be collected using one or more PECA devices, such as the PECA device <b>1570</b>. Sedimentation can occur at the bottom of the tank. During deployment of the robot <b>1500</b>, a brush <b>1565</b> can be used to scrap or clean the sedimentation on the surface of the tank plate (e.g., on the tank floor or tank wall). From the rendered PEC data <b>1900</b>, regions <b>1910</b> and <b>1920</b> can indicate a thickness of approximately 85% remaining. Other regions in this section of the plate can include a thickness of greater than 85% remaining. In this case, the operator may not initiate a second dive plan, due to the low-risk level based on the thickness percentage at the section. Multiple risk-levels and their corresponding threshold can be predetermined and configured. For example, 80% or greater thickness can indicate low-risk, 65% to 80% can indicate a medium-risk level, and less than 65% thickness can indicate a high-risk level. The risk level may indicate a likelihood of leakage occurring, for example, within a predetermined timeframe (e.g., a month, a year, or a decade). For each risk level, a corresponding procedure can be performed. For example, with the low-risk level, this can indicate that the tank is fully operational and a second tank inspection can be scheduled for a future date, such as in a year. With the medium-risk level, additional precautions may be taken, such as scheduling an earlier inspection date (e.g., within half a year).</p><p id="p-0294" num="0293">In the implementations above, the risk levels are determined based on at least a portion of the plate bearing a thickness level indicative of a high likelihood of leakage. For example, a 1-inch by 1-inch portion of the tank can be less than 40% thickness. Even if the tank is a 70-foot diameter tank, the operator can determine that there is a high likelihood of leakage for the tank. The risk levels can be determined based on an average of all inspected portions of the tank. In this case, and referring to the previous example, the operator can determine that there is not a high enough likelihood of leakage (e.g., from the averaged of all inspected portion) label the tank as high-risk.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0294">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A-C</figref>, depicted is an example PEC inspection report. For example, as described above, a dive plan <b>2000</b>A can be similar to the dive plan <b>1700</b>A as described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref>. The actual track lines <b>2000</b>B can be similar to the track lines <b>1700</b>B as described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref>. Likewise, NDT coverage <b>2000</b>C can be similar to the NDT coverage <b>1700</b>C as described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>C</figref>. The PEC inspection report can provide the NDT coverage maps <b>1700</b>C, and plate by plate analysis after alignment with weld seams (e.g., alignment post-processing of PEC data), among others. Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-C</figref>, the dive plan <b>2000</b>A can be executed by at least the vehicle <b>101</b> or the robot <b>1500</b>. Furthermore, the NDT coverage <b>2000</b>C can be rendered using PEC data collected from one or more PECA devices, such as shown in at least <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>12</b> and <b>15</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0295">The dive plan <b>2000</b>A, the actual track lines <b>2000</b>B, and the NDT coverage <b>2000</b>C can include exclusion zone <b>2010</b>, similar to exclusion zones <b>1710</b>, <b>1720</b>, or <b>1730</b>. The exclusion zone <b>2010</b> can prevent the robot <b>1500</b> from moving beyond 5 feet from the zone <b>2010</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A-C</figref>, the renders <b>2000</b>A-C includes exclusion zone <b>2010</b> to account for pipes and objects within the tank. Additionally, the center of the tank can include an exclusion zone for the center column. In the case of the rendered NDT coverage <b>2000</b>C, the inspected portions of the tank can include thickness measurement of at least 0.3 mm or greater, for example. In this case, the original thickness of the tank can be 0.45 mm. Therefore, the thinnest portion of the plate is approximately 66.67% of the original thickness. In view of the above example, presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, this may categorize some portions of the tank as a medium-risk level. Therefore, a corresponding precaution measure for a medium-risk level can be executed by the operator and the robot <b>1500</b>.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0296">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, depicted are examples of additional data included in the PEC inspection report. The additional data can include graph <b>2100</b>A. The graph <b>2100</b>A can display high-resolution X and Y coordinates PEC thickness data in a selected plate of the floor of a scanned tank. The units of the X and Y coordinates can be presented as inches. The units can be configured by the operator, for example, using the external computing device or software rendering the graph <b>2100</b>A processing the PEC data. In some cases, the area of the high-risk defect may not be clearly represented in the graph <b>2100</b>A. Therefore, the inspection report can also include a graph <b>2100</b>B (e.g., numeric tables) indicating portions of the tank with a remaining wall thickness below a threshold (e.g., wall thickness threshold). The inspection report can also include relevant videos and snapshots from one or more cameras on the robot <b>1500</b>, or other autonomous tank inspection system.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0297">For example, any portions of the wall measured to be below the thickness threshold may indicate a high-risk level or high likelihood of leakage. In this case, the threshold may be predetermined at 0.281 inches or less. By visually observing graph <b>2100</b>A, an operator may not accurately identify every portion of the tank plate having a thickness of less than the threshold. Therefore, graph <b>2100</b>B can illustrate the portions of the plate that satisfy the threshold. For example, referring to regions <b>2120</b> and <b>2130</b>, graph <b>2100</b>B depicts a clear representation of portions of the plate satisfying the threshold thickness. Therefore, both graphs <b>2100</b>A and <b>2100</b>B may be shown in the PEC inspection report to identify and fix any defects of the tank wall.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0298">The PEC inspection report can include a minimap <b>2110</b> of the tank floor. The minimap <b>2110</b> can include a highlighted region of the tank floor.

The PA robot <b>2200</b> can include an advanced phased array ultrasonic testing (&#x201c;PAUT&#x201d;) system <b>2210</b>, including (2&#xd7;) 32/128 electronic boards and (8&#xd7;) 32-element probes (256 elements total). The PAUT system <b>2210</b> may be attached to any portion or side of the PA robot <b>2200</b>. The PA robot <b>2200</b> can include a 1 foot total sensing length (e.g., capable of detecting a plate of at least 1 foot in length). The PA robot <b>2200</b> can have improved navigation accuracy over other implementations, for example, using a higher performance inertial navigation system and/or additional acoustic ranging sensors. The navigation system and the acoustic ranging sensors can be installed on the PA robot <b>2200</b>, or other robots optimized for in-service tank inspection. The PA robot <b>2200</b> can have improved mapping capability over other implementations.

Each transducer can be pulsed independently, such as at varied timing or instances. By varying the timing of the pulses, at least one pattern of constructive interference can be set up. This constructive interference can radiate the ultrasonic beam at a predetermined angle based on the timing of each ultrasonic transducer (e.g., based on the progressive time delay). Changing the progressing time delay can change the direction or angle of the beams. The progressing time delay can be configured, for example, by the one or more processors of the PAUT system <b>2210</b>, such as to measure the plate thickness at different locations within the tank. The progressing time delay can be configured, for example, manually by an operator via the external computing device. By sweeping the beams in multiple directions at the plate, the data from the multiple beams can be aggregated to generate visual illustrations or images of the tank wall. In this case, the images can show multiple layers of the tank plate, thereby depicting the thickness of the tank plate. The PAUT system <b>2210</b> can be used together with one or more PECA devices.

The vehicle can refer to a robot for tank inspection using one or more PECA devices or a PA robot using one or more PAUT devices. The vehicle can perform one or more features and functionalities of the vehicle described in at least <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the robot described in at least <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, and the PA robot described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>. The vehicle can be equipped with other components in addition to the above list of components. For example, the vehicle can include an accelerometer, a velocity sensor, a positioning sensor to detect the vehicle location, a thermometer to measure the temperature of the vehicle or the tank, or other sensors thereof. The vehicle can be equipped with a brush. The brush can be used to clean debris off the interior surface of the tank. The brush can also clean sedimentation deposited on the tank floor. The control unit of the vehicle can extend the reach of the brush by using an extender. For example, in response the control unit receiving sensor data (e.g., from one or more cameras) indicating debris or other substances on the interior tank surface, the control unit can initiate a cleaning process using the brush. The brush may be rotated, such as to assist with removing the debris from the surface. Based on the sensor data, the control unit can activate the extender to reach the interior surface of the tank designated for cleaning.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0304">The control unit can include one or more processors and at least one memory. The control unit can be in electrical communication with other components of the vehicle, such as the inspection device, the ranging device, and the battery. The control unit can regulate instructions transmitted to each component of the vehicle to perform a tank inspection. The control unit can be preconfigured by an operator using an external computing device or an administrator device. The control unit can perform a lookup to identify instructions stored in a vehicle resource repository to determine the sequences of instructions to perform for tank inspection. The control unit can be supplied with power from the battery to transmit signals to other components. The control unit can regulate the power supplied to each component.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0305">The vehicle can include a vacuum device coupled to a pump. The vacuum device can be in addition to the brush. In some cases, the vacuum can replace the brush. For example, the control unit can receive sensor data detecting debris on the surface of the tank. Depending on the among of debris, the control unit can initiate the pump. The pump can be a part of the vacuum device. The vacuum device can be connected to an extender similar to the brush. The pump can pull the debris into the vacuum device. The vehicle can include a waste bin to store the debris removed from the tank surface. In some other implementations, the vacuum device can remove the debris from the tank surface for disposition in the tank. In some cases, the tank can include a pipe for disposing the debris, compounds, or substances removed from the tank surface. The vehicle can include a grinder. For example, the vacuum device can be connected to or installed with the grinder. After removing the debris from the tank surface, the debris can be passed to the grinder. The grinder can mince the debris that is in a solid or jello state. In some cases, the grinder can turn solid debris into its liquid state. The grinding process may be done prior to storing the removed debris or depositing back the removed debris into the tank.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0306">The vehicle can be preconfigured to follow instructions to perform tank inspection. The preconfigured settings can include speed, liftoff distance, voltage supply to the inspection device, duration of the inspection, dive plan (e.g., regions of the tank to inspect, movement guide, and zones to avoid in the tank), or other settings optimized for in-service tank inspection. The control unit can send signals to one or more components of the vehicle to execute the instructions. The instruction can include an inspection process, exit procedure, decision block, or other commands to navigate the vehicle to complete the tank inspection. The decision block can refer to instructions that should be executed given a certain case. For example, upon completing the tank inspection by following the dive plan, the control unit can determine one or more uninspected regions or portions within the tank. In some cases, the control unit can determine to inspect the uninspected regions, for example, if the instruction is to perform a full inspection of the tank. In some cases, the control unit can determine not to inspect the uninspected regions, for example, if the area is within an exclusion zone or if the instruction is to inspect within the indicated area.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0307">The vehicle can be transported to an inspection site by using support equipment and a casing to prevent damages to the vehicle. The support equipment can be a cushion, bracket, or paddings to support the vehicle from moving during transportation. The support equipment can be shock-absorbent or impact resistant to prevent damages during transportation. The support equipment can be placed in a casing. The casing can provide insulation to the external environment. Similarly to the support equipment, the casing can be shock-absorbent or impact resistant. The casing may be referred to as a housing or an enclosure to maintain the position of the vehicle during transportation. The casing, the support equipment, and the vehicle can be transported via a trailer, for example. An operator can confirm that the temperature of the vehicle is below a threshold prior to deployment. For example, to avoid an increase in temperature of the flammable fluid, the vehicle can be below 50 degrees Fahrenheit when inserted into the tank.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0308">When arrived at the tank, a crane can lift the vehicle to the roof of the tank via a cable or a rope. The support equipment can be used to assist the vehicle onto the roof of the tank. For example, the cable of the crane can be hooked to the support equipment situating the vehicle. Once lifted to the roof, the vehicle can be lowered into the tank via the lid. The vehicle can initiate a disengagement sequence with the cable of the crane or the support equipment, if used to lower the vehicle into the tank. The vehicle can be partially submerged into the flammable fluid to disengage with the cable. The vehicle as a whole can be engulfed in the flammable fluid prior to the disengagement.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0309">Once inside the tank, the vehicle can utilize one or more sensors to map the tank. The control unit can be preprogrammed to inspect all portions of the tank. In this case, the control unit can generate a dive plan for navigating the vehicle throughout all the areas within the tank. During the transitioning from a first position to a second position, the vehicle can measure the quality of the tank wall (e.g., tank plate or tank floor). The control unit may stop the vehicle to inspect each portion of the tank. In some cases, the control unit may maintain a velocity of the vehicle during the inspection of the tank. The velocity can be predetermined based on the magnetic field strength and plate thickness. For example, the original tank wall thickness can be 4.8 mm and the control unit may supply 10V power to the inspection device (e.g., PECA device). Based on the information, for example, the vehicle can travel at 3 inches per second, 5 inches per second, or 10 inches per sec. Using the inspection device, the control unit can receive PEC data or raw sensor data. The control unit can be configured to process the raw data, for example, to generate an NDT map, plate thickness information, or corrosion level information. The control unit can transmit the raw data to the external computing device to perform the post-processing procedures for the raw data. The control unit and the external computing device can execute one or more features or functionalities interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0310">The control unit can be preprogrammed to only inspect one or more portions of the tank predetermined by the dive plan. The dive plan may be provided to the vehicle prior to deploying the vehicle into the tank. In this case, the control unit may not inspect portions of the tank outside the dive plan. For example, the control unit can use the dive plan to navigate the vehicle throughout regions and areas within the tank. During the path, the control unit can instruct the inspection device to inspect the surrounding areas at the position of the vehicle. In some cases, the inspection device can inspect only at the area at the position of the vehicle. The tank inspection can be completed when the vehicle completed the dive plan.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0311">The vehicle can include one or more propellers. The propellers can be located at any portion of the vehicle, such as the sides, bottom, rear, front, or top. The propellers can be pointed in any direction. Example locations of the propellers can be illustrated at least in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>22</b></figref>. The propeller can spin in any direction to provide a forward or backward push/pull, thereby increasing the velocity of the vehicle. Within the flammable fluid, the propeller can elevate and move the vehicle. The propeller can rotate the vehicle in any axis and move the vehicle in any motion, such as to guide the vehicle from a first position to a second position within the tank. The propeller can be controlled by the control unit, such as the rotation speed and rotation direction.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0312">The battery can be in electrical communication with other components of the vehicle. The battery can be rechargeable outside the tank. The battery can be controlled by the control unit for power distribution to other components. The battery can be housed within the center compartment or the casing of the vehicle in addition to one or more other components of the vehicle. The battery can distribute AC or DC power. The battery can be coupled with a converter to convert the DC power to AC power, vice versa. Based on the liftoff distance and the predetermined plate thickness of the tank, the control unit can determine to provide a predetermined power to the inspection device (e.g., to increase or decrease magnetic field strength and intensity). For example, the battery can provide 6V, 8V, or 10V to the inspection device to inspect the tank plate, based on the liftoff distance and the original plate thickness.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0313">The ranging device can include one or more sensors for depth perception or to collect visual data, such as a proximity sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, light detection and ranging sensor (&#x201c;LiDAR&#x201d;), a camera, or a distance sensor. The ranging device, battery, propeller, control unit, or inspection device can perform features and functionalities similar to the corresponding components, for example, in the ATIS of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0314">The inspection device can be a PECA device. The PECA device can generate a magnetic field for plate thickness measurement and corrosion level detection. The magnetic field generated by the PECA device can penetrate layers and coatings on the interior tank surface. The PECA device can measure the decay rate after applying the magnetic field to the plate. The PECA device can generate the magnetic field after the vehicle stopped moving. Other factors can be taken into consideration before generating the magnetic field, such as meeting the predetermined liftoff distance. For example, the vehicle can travel to a position within the tank (e.g., inspection site). Once arrived and the vehicle stops moving, the control unit can transmit a signal to the inspection device to generate the magnetic field. The magnetic field may be generated for a predetermined duration, such as 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, or 5 seconds. The inspection device can terminate the magnetic field in response to a timeout using the predetermined duration as a preset. The PECA device can collect the magnetic field decay rate in response to the terminated inspection device. Once the decay rate is determined, the control unit can move the vehicle to a different location, e.g., using the propeller and based on a dive plan. The magnetic field intensity and strength may be set based on the liftoff distance and the original plate thickness associated with the tank (e.g., the thickness of the plates used to construct the tank). The liftoff distance can be established based on the predetermined plate thickness. For example, with a predetermined plate thickness of 0.25 inches, the liftoff distance of the PECA device can be 0.5 inches from the plate. The traveling velocity of the vehicle can be based on the predetermined plate thickness.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0315">The pulse eddy current array of the inspection device can include a 7-element array with 7 inches by 1 inch coverage in length or 178 mm. The 7-element array with 7 inches coverage can refer to a dimension of the plate the inspection device can cover. For example, each inspection by the vehicle can cover 7 inches by 1 inches of the tank. The coverage size may be hardware dependent. The coverage size can be limited or adjusted by software including configuration settings for the inspection device. For example, the coverage size can be changed to other dimensions, such as 5 inches by 1 inches, 8 inches by 1 inches, or 10 inches by 1 inches.</p><p id="p-0317" num="0316">The inspection device can include a phased array ultrasonic testing (&#x201c;PAUT&#x201d;) device or system. The PAUT device can include two 32/128 OEM electronic boards phase arrays and eight times 32-element probes (e.g., 256-element) to generate ultrasonic waves to collect plate thickness data. The PAUT device can include a sensing length of at least 1 foot. The control unit can operate the PAUT device similar to the PECA device, such as stopping the vehicle at a position within the tank, initiating the inspection device, collect data, and move to a different position.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0317">Referring now to step <b>2320</b>, the battery of the vehicle can provide power to the propeller, the control unit, the inspection device, and the ranging device. The battery may be supplied to the control unit before other components. For example, the control unit can regulate how much power is being supplied to each component of the vehicle. Changing the amount of power supplied to each component can change its characteristics. For example, increasing power to the propeller can include the rotation speed. In some cases, components of the system can include different power requirements and may include a power limiter, such that the supplied power does not increase beyond the limiter. For example, upon meeting the power requirement for the ranging sensor, additional power will not increase its performance. The battery can be coupled to a surge protector to prevent shock or discharge of electricity.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0318">The battery can increase the intensity of the pulse eddy current of the inspection device based on the amount of power supplied by the battery. For example, based on the original plate thickness and a preset liftoff distance, the control unit can instruct the battery to supply a corresponding amplitude of voltage to the inspection device. The amount of power supplied can be proportional to the magnetic field strength. Based on the amplitude of power supplied to the inspection device, the control unit can configure the liftoff distance based on the original plate thickness. The vehicle can include a table listing associations between the liftoff distance, the magnetic field strength or intensity, and the original plate thickness. For example, with a first liftoff distance and a first plate thickness, the control unit using the table can set the inspection device to a first magnetic field strength by identifying an entry within the table including the first liftoff distance and the first plate thickness.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0319">Referring now to step <b>2330</b>, the control unit can generate a map of the tank based on data received from the ranging device. For example, responsive to the vehicle disengaging from the cable of the crane, the control unit of the vehicle can initiate one or more sequences to prepare for inspection. Generating a map of the tank may be one of the sequences. For example, the control unit may command the propellers to maintain the altitude of the vehicle within the tank containing flammable fluid. The control unit can instruct the propeller to descend the robot towards the floor. During the descent, the control unit can use one or more ranging devices located any on the vehicle to measure the distance to an object in the tank. Based on the collected data from the ranging device, the control unit can process the data to generate a map of the tank.</p><p id="p-0321" num="0320">The control unit can transmit the collected data to the external computing device to process and generate the tank map. The control unit can provide the collected data from the ranging device as input into a machine learning engine. The machine learning engine can operate on the vehicle via installed software. The machine learning engine may be available on the external computing device. For example, the control unit can transmit the collected data to the external computing device via a network interface. In response to receiving the collected data, the external computing device can provide the collected data as input to the machine learning engine. The machine learning engine can use at least one model to generate a map of the tank. The model can be trained with historical tank data to improve accuracy in mapping the tank. Once the generated map is output, the map can be transmitted to the control unit for storage in a vehicle resource repository. The map may also be installed in memory of the external computing device.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0321">The control unit can develop a dive plan in response to generating the tank map. For example, the control unit can identify portions of the tank to inspect. In some cases, the control unit can identify exclusion zones within the map that includes, for example, pipes, columns, or other objects preventing the vehicle from moving through or performing the inspection. For example, after generating the tank map, the control unit can populate the map with track lines, indicating regions and areas for the vehicle to travel. Upon identifying an exclusion zone, the control unit can redirect the track line to move in a different direction or angle. The control unit can repeat the process until the track lines cover the generated map, aside from in the exclusion zone. The control unit can provide a predetermined tolerance distance from the exclusion zone, such as 1 foot, 3 feet, or 5 feet, such as to not damage one or more objects centered at the exclusion zone.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0322">The map can be predetermined or generated by an external computing device. For example, the external computing device can install the map onto the vehicle to being the operation. The map can include a preconfigured dive plan for the vehicle to follow (e.g., path to take, regions to cover, and zones to avoid). The control unit can configure the map based on additional sensor data from the ranging device. For example, with the pre-generated map and using the ranging device, the control unit can update the map upon detection of an object not indicated within the generated map. In another example, the control unit can update the map upon not detecting an object that should be present based on the map.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0323">Referring now to step <b>2340</b>, the control unit can determine a first position of the vehicle on the map of the tank. The first position of the vehicle may refer to the current position of the vehicle after deployment into the tank. The vehicle can include a positioning sensor. The control unit can collect position data from the positioning sensor. Based on the position data from the positioning sensor, the control unit can determine the location of the vehicle. In some cases, the control unit can rely on the ranging device and the tank map to determine the current position of the vehicle. For example, based on the arrangement of objects within the tank (e.g., pipes, constructions, tank structure, or weld seams determined by the ranging device), the control unit can compare the arrangement of objects measured from the ranging device to the generated map. The control unit can pinpoint the location of the vehicle based on the compared arrangement, for example. The location of the vehicle can be indicated by latitude and longitude coordinates.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0324">Referring now to step <b>2350</b>, the control unit can cause the propeller to move the vehicle from the first position to a second position within the tank. For example, the control unit can determine to reposition the vehicle to start the inspection at another position within the tank. If the first position refers to the current position of the vehicle, the second position can refer to the destination of the vehicle. The second position can be located anywhere in the tank. The dive plan can be stored in the vehicle resource repository. The control unit can retrieve the dive plan to identify a starting point to inspect the tank. The control unit can cause the propeller to move the vehicle from the current position to the starting point (e.g., the second position) in response to identifying the starting point. To move the vehicle from the first position to the second position, the control unit can instruct the battery to supply power to one or more propellers of the vehicle. The control unit can manage the speed, travel distance, and direction of the vehicle to arrive at the second position.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0325">The vehicle can start the inspection with the vehicle positioned at the first position. The dive plan can be adjusted or configured based on the first location inspected by the vehicle using the inspection device. For example, the initial dive plan can include inspecting the tank in a clockwise direction starting from the northern region of the tank. If the first position of the vehicle is at the southern side, the control unit can adjust the dive plan to start at the southern side. The adjusted dive plan can be executed to inspect the tank from either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, for example. In some cases, the dive plan can include inspecting the tank by traveling from left to right and top to bottom. When adjusting the dive plan, the control unit can determine the most efficient path for the vehicle to travel, such as to reduce overlapping paths or unnecessary movement.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0326">Referring now to step <b>2360</b>, the inspection device can obtain first inspection data indicative of a quality of a tank wall. The indication of the quality can be at the portion of the tank at the second position within the tank (e.g., the location of the vehicle during the inspection). The inspection device can be electrically connected to the battery and including a pulsed eddy current array. The quality of the tank wall can include a thickness measurement of the tank wall. The quality of the tank wall can include a corrosion level of the tank wall. The corrosion level may be correlated or proportional to the wall thickness. For example, if the remaining thickness of a first portion of the tank wall is high, the corrosion level for the first portion of the tank wall may be low. If the remaining thickness of a second portion of the tank wall is low, the corrosion level for the second portion of the tank wall may be high, thereby indicating that the second portion of the tank wall has been corroded more than the first portion, for example. The thickness measurement and the corrosion level can be determined based on the magnetic field decay rate. The decay rate can be measured in response to terminating the generation of the magnetic field from the inspection device.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0327">Similarly for generating the magnetic field to determine the quality of the tank wall, the inspection device can include the PAUT device to generate ultrasonic waves. These ultrasonic waves can be generated from the 32-element probes and may be directed in a predetermined direction based on the delay time set to each probe. For example, if multiple probes are lined up on the interior tank surface, by increasing the delay from the left probe to the right probe, the direction of the ultrasonic wave may be angled to the left. The opposite is true when increasing the delay from the right-most probe to the left-most probe, as an example in this case.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0328">The control unit can utilize the inspection device to obtain inspection data for different portions of the tank. The portions of the tank may refer to different regions within the tank, which may be subdivided by an operator. The division of each portion can be determined, for example, based on the tank specification. For example, the portions of the tank may include different characteristics or qualities as originally constructed. Some portions of the tank wall may be constructed using thicker plates, among other portions. Therefore, when processing the inspection data, the control unit or the external computing device can account for the original plate thickness for each portion of the tank to determine the thickness percentage or the corrosion level.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0329">The control unit can render an image of the plate thickness using raw sensor data from the inspection device. The control unit can transmit the raw sensor data to the external computing device to generate the render. In the render, the control unit can label defects area within each inspected area having the coverage dimension, such as 7 inches by 1 inch, for example. The label can include a color spectrum indicating differences in corrosion level and plate thickness measurement. In this case, the coverage dimension may be referred to as the inspected region of the tank. Therefore, the labeled defects may be referred to as a defect portion within the inspected region. The labeled wall thickness measurement can indicate an averaged wall thickness measurement within the defect portion. In some other implementations, the labeled wall thickness measurement can indicate the thinnest part of the plate within the defect portion.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0330">The exclusion zone within the tank can be considered as a separate region from the rest of the tank, e.g., the exclusion zone may not be considered as a portion of the tank configured for inspection. The exclusion zone can account for columns, pipes, or other objects within the tank. The control unit can conserve a predetermined distance from the exclusion zone to avoid impact with the object, such as 3 feet, 5 feet, or 10 feet from the exclusion zone. The conserved distance can be considered as part of the exclusion zone. The predetermined conserved distance can be predetermined by the operator. The predetermined conserved distance can be determined based on the size of the robot. For example, the dive plan can indicate positions and travel directions for navigating the vehicle. Each position/location/point along the track lines of the dive plan may indicate positions of the front or the back of the vehicle. In some cases, each point can indicate the positions of the center of the vehicle. Therefore, the control unit can include the size of the vehicle as a factor to avoid impact with an object when executing the dive plan. The control unit can avoid impact by using the range sensor to detect nearby objects and instruct the propeller to stop the vehicle when near an object.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0331">The control unit can transmit inspection data including the first inspection data to an external computing device. The control unit can communicate or share other data with the external computing device. For example, other sensor data, activity log, connection data, firmware version, or completion data. The external computing device can be located external to the tank and used by an operator. The external computing device can receive the inspection data transmitted from the control unit of the vehicle. For example, the control unit can transmit the inspection data to the external computing device using a wireless communication technique, such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or other low bandwidth communications. The external computing device can execute functions, features, software, and process data similar to the control unit of the vehicle. In some cases, the control unit can transmit raw data to the external computing device for processing.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0332">The control unit can transmit the inspection data to the external computing device after completing the tank inspection. The vehicle can be connected to the external computing device before deployment into the tank. The vehicle can be removed from the tank using a crane with a rope. The vehicle can be connected to the external computing device after removed from the tank. The vehicle can be communicatively coupled to the external computing device via at least one cable or connector, such as a fiber-optic tether, USB, or Ethernet cable. The control unit can transfer activity log, sensor data, post-processed render, or other information stored in the vehicle resource repository.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0333">The control unit can transmit the raw sensor data collected from the inspection device to the external computing device. The external computing device can process the raw sensor data to determine different quality metrics for each portion of the portions of the tank. The portions of the tank may refer to individual areas where the vehicle stopped to measure the wall thickness. The portions of the tank may refer to different regions of the tank having different original thickness during the construction of the tank. For example, the wall thickness at a first region can be 10 mm and at a second region can be 5 mm. When processing the raw sensor data collected by the inspection device at these two regions, the external computing device can divide the measured thickness by the original thickness to determine a percentage of thickness left in the first region and the second region. For example, if the raw data indicate a 7 mm thickness in the first region and a 4 mm thickness in the second region, the quality of the first region can be 70%, and the second region can be 80%.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0334">The external computing device can determine an isolated defect or flaws at a portion of the tank based on the collected inspection data. The inspection data for each portion may be referred to as second inspection data, which can be different from the first inspection data at the first position within the tank. For each portion of the tank, the control unit can collect first, second, third, or other counts of inspection data, which may be sequential to when the inspection data are collected. For example, if the coverage area of the 7-element array to measure the wall thickness using the inspection device is 7 inches by 1 inch, the isolated defect can be detected at a portion of the aforementioned coverage area (e.g., within the 7 inches by 1 inch array). Therefore, defects with small dimensions can be identified. Based on the raw data collected from the inspection device, the isolated defect can refer to flaws within the 7 inches by 1-inch array. Such flaws can be of a smaller size than the array, such as 0.5 inches by 0.5 inches in dimension. The external computing device can determine a general wall loss of the tank based on the inspection data. In this implementation, and referring to the previous example, the thickness measurement within the coverage area can be averaged. Therefore, the whole 7 inches by 1 inch rendered data can be averaged to a single value or quality metric.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0335">The external computing device can determine a defect diameter at the second position of the tank based on the inspection data (e.g., first inspection data). The second position can refer to the position of the inspection robot within the tank to initiate the inspection or to collect the inspection data. The defect diameter or the size of the defect can be derived from processing the inspection data. The defect diameter may be referred to as the dimension or the size of the defect (e.g., length and width). The defect diameter can provide dimensions in addition to the defect depth. With the defect diameter and the defect depth, a 3D model representation of the defect can be generated. For example, the control unit can generate the model of the tank with the defect in real-time (e.g., 1 ms, 10 ms, or 50 ms after receiving the inspection data). The external computing device can generate the model of the tank including the defect similar to the control unit.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0336">The external computing device can perform a lookup in a defect table customized for the inspection device to identify an amount of wall loss. The defect table may be referred to as a lookup table or a data structure to determine the wall loss (e.g., a quality metric for the wall). The defect table can be constructed to include minimum detectable defects for custom PECA sensors based on various defects configurations. The defect table may be customized or personalized for the tank inspected by the vehicle. To identify the defects for a particular tank, the defect table may include wall loss percentage corresponding to the defect diameter associated with the tank under inspection. For example, the defect table can include wall loss percentage, such as 10%, 20%, 30%, and so forth. Within the same entry (e.g., row or column) as each wall loss percentage, the defect table can include an associated defect diameter and defect depth. The defect diameter can indicate the size of the defects within the tank wall. The defect depth can indicate the amount of the wall has been corroded. For example, a wall loss of 10% can be associated with a 10 mm wall thickness loss and 0.5 inches of defect diameter, and a wall loss of 30% can introduce a 20 mm wall thickness loss and 0.7 inches of defect diameter. The defect table can indicate the remaining wall thickness and diameter for the non-corroded areas. For example, a wall loss of 10% can indicate 50 mm of wall thickness and 2 inches of the non-corroded diameter of the wall, and a wall loss of 30% can indicate 29 mm of wall thickness and 1.1 inches of the non-corroded diameter.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0337">Referring now to step <b>2370</b>, the control unit can store, in a data structure in memory of the vehicle, the first inspection data corresponding to the second position within the tank. The control unit can store inspection data collected at the first position within the tank. The memory of the vehicle can refer to the vehicle resource repository. The control unit can transmit the collected data or other information thereof from the vehicle resource repository to the external computing device. The external computing device can upload the data received from the vehicle to the cloud or a database external to the vehicle, for example. One the inspection data is stored, the control unit can proceed to inspect other portions of the tank or execute other instructions according to the tank inspection procedures.</p><p id="p-0339" num="0338">Referring now to step <b>2375</b>, the control unit can determine whether the tank inspection is completed. The control unit can rely on a dive plan to determine the completion of the tank inspection.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0339">For example, the control unit can travel and collect data according to the track lines provided in the dive plan. Once the vehicle completed the travel along the track lines, the tank inspection can be considered to be completed, and step <b>2390</b> can be initiated.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0340">The control unit can identify one or more uninspected portions of the tank, not indicated in the dive plan. For example, based on a comparison between the tank map provided by the operator and the tank map generated by the control unit after entering the tank, the control unit can identify portions of the tank (e.g., not including the exclusion zones) that are inspectable or within the reach of the inspection device. These identified portions may not be indicated within the dive plan. Therefore, the control unit may determine whether to inspect or disregard these portions. For example, the control unit can be configured to inspect every portion within the tank within reach of the vehicle or the inspection device. In this case, the control unit can cause the propeller to move the vehicle to or near the uninspected area to perform an additional inspection. In another example, the control unit may be configured to only follow the dive plan. Accordingly, the method can move to step <b>2390</b> in response to completing the dive plan.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0341">In view of the example above, and in some cases, the control unit can transmit a signal to the external computing device notifying the operator of the uninspected area. The operator can determine whether to inspect the remaining portions of the tank. The operator can provide an indication to inspect or not inspect the remaining portions. The external computing device can transmit a response to the control unit with the instructions from the operator. For example, the method can perform step <b>2390</b> if the operator indicates not to inspect the uninspected portions. In another example, the method can proceed to step <b>2380</b> if the operator indicates to inspect the aforementioned portions.</p><p id="p-0343" num="0342">Referring now to step <b>2380</b>, the control unit can determine that the tank inspection is not complete. In response to determining that the tank inspection is not complete, the control unit can cause the propeller to move the vehicle to an uninspected portion of the tank. The uninspected portion of the tank may be the next location according to the dive plan. The uninspected portion may be an additional portion of the tank outside the dive plan. The uninspected portions may not include portions of the exclusion zones (e.g., including the conserved distance from the zones). Once the vehicle moved to the uninspected portion, the method can execute step <b>2360</b>, such as to obtain the inspection data of the tank wall at the uninspected portion. Once step <b>2360</b> is done, the method can re-execute step <b>2370</b> to store the inspection data, and step <b>2375</b> to determine whether the tank inspection is completed.</p><p id="p-0344" num="0343">Referring now to step <b>2390</b>, the control unit can determine that the tank inspection is completed. In response to determining that the tank inspection is completed, the control unit can initiate an exit process. The exit process at this step can be performed similarly to other similar exit processes, such as steps <b>526</b>, <b>624</b>, or <b>822</b>, and may include other procedures to remove the vehicle from the tank, such as in steps <b>718</b> or <b>820</b>. For example, the control unit can transmit a signal to the external computing device to indicate that the inspection is completed. The external computing device can display a notification to the operator indicating a completed inspection. The operator can open the tank lid and a crane can lower a cable or a rope with a hook down into the tank. The control unit can receive an indication of a cable reeled down from the tank roof configured to couple with the vehicle. The control unit can cause the propeller to move the vehicle to the cable, and couple with the cable via a coupling mechanism. In response to coupling with the cable, the control unit can transmit a signal to the external computing device, notifying the operator to pull the vehicle from the tank. The crane can then reel in the cable along with the vehicle to complete the exit process.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0344">The subject matter and the operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer software, firmware, or hardware, including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents, or in combinations of one or more of them.
