Candida </i>species are the 4th most common pathogen isolated in all bloodstream infections. Treatment for invasive candidiasis has a limited (50-70%) success rate, and this is typically only in the healthiest patients. Attributable mortality for invasive candidiasis is substantial (20-30%). The incidence of invasive aspergillosis due to <i>A. fumigatus </i>has increased three-fold in the last decade and its mortality has risen by over 300%. Moreover, current therapy for invasive aspergillosis has a lower 40-50% treatment success rate. Invasive aspergillosis is consistently a leading killer in immunocompromised patients, and moreover, whereas invasive mold infections (fusariosis, scedosporosis, and mucromycosis) have even higher mortality rates and no effective therapeutic options. The current guideline-recommended first line therapeutic for invasive aspergillosis, as well as most other invasive mold infections, is the triazole antifungal voriconazole. However, pan-triazole resistance in <i>Aspergillus </i>is as high as 30% in some locations and amongst certain high-risk patient groups. Recognizing this lack of effective treatments, the <i>Infectious Diseases Society of America </i>highlighted <i>A. fumigatus </i>as one of only six pathogens where a &#x201c;substantive breakthrough is urgently needed.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Amphotericin B (AmB) is an exceptionally promising starting point, because this drug has potent and dose-dependent fungicidal activity against a broad range of fungal pathogens and has evaded resistance for over half a century The fungicidal, as opposed to fungistatic, activity of AmB is essential in immunocompromised patients which lack a robust immune system to help clear an infection. Broad antifungal activity is especially important in critically ill patients when the identity of the pathogen is unknown and immediate empirical therapy is required. An international expert panel recently mandated that novel therapeutic approaches centered around AmB, with no resistance issues, are required. The problem is that AmB is exceptionally toxic, which limits its use to low-dose protocols that often fail to eradicate disease.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A new, paradigm-shifting mechanistic understanding of AmB that evaded the field for half a century was achieved. Previous studies report AmB binding to sterols, which was such thought to primarily drive formation of membrane-permeabilizing pores to kill both fungal and human cells. After 10 years of intensive synthesis-enabled atomistic interrogations of this natural product and frontier SSNMR experiments, it is alternatively discovered that AmB primarily kills both fungal and human cells by forming a cytocidal extramembranous sterol sponge. This large aggregate sits on the surface of lipid bilayers and rapidly extracts membrane sterols, which leads to cell death. Membrane permeabilization is not required. Based on this new mechanism and increasingly refined structural information, it is proposed that a small molecule-based ligand-selective allosteric effect could enable selective binding of ergosterol over cholesterol. Guided by this model, the elimination of cholesterol binding and thus mammalian toxicity in the form of a new derivative, C2&#x2032;epiAmB, was achieved.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A limitation with C2&#x2032;epiAmB, however, is lack of potency against a number of clinically relevant yeast and molds. An AmB derivative that retains potent, broad spectrum, and resistance-evasive fungicidal activity but lacks dose-limiting toxicities would enable a new high dose treatment paradigm with improved clinical efficacy.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, provided herein are compounds of Formula (I):</p><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="52.66mm" wi="112.95mm" file="US20230000891A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0010" num="0000">or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein<br/>R<sup>1 </sup>is substituted or unsubstituted C<sub>1-6 </sub>alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C<sub>2-6 </sub>alkenyl, substituted or unsubstituted C<sub>2-6 </sub>alkynyl, substituted or unsubstituted C<sub>3-10 </sub>carbocyclyl, substituted or unsubstituted 3- to 10-membered heterocyclyl, substituted or unsubstituted C<sub>5-10 </sub>aryl, substituted or unsubstituted 5- to 10-membered heteroaryl;<br/>R<sup>3 </sup>is substituted or unsubstituted amino, substituted or unsubstituted urea, substituted or unsubstituted carbamate or substituted or unsubstituted guanidinyl; and<br/>R<sup>4 </sup>is hydrogen or substituted or unsubstituted C<sub>1-6 </sub>alkyl.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">In another aspect, provided are pharmaceutical compositions, comprising compounds disclosed herein; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">In yet another aspect, provided are methods of treating a fungal infection, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of compounds disclosed herein, thereby treating the fungal infection.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> represents chemical structures of amphotericin B, the primary fungal sterol, ergosterol, and the primary human sterol, cholesterol.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> depicts a two-step &#x201c;Sterol Sponge&#x201d; model for the cytocidal action of AmB.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> represents chemical structures and biophysical activities of AmB, AmdeB, C2&#x2032;deOAmB, and C2&#x2032;epiAmB.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> represents biophysical activities of AmB, AmdeB, C2&#x2032;deOAmB, and C2&#x2032;epiAmB in primary human renal epithelial cells.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> represents ergosterol and cholesterol activities of AmB, AmdeB, C2&#x2032;deOAmB, and C2&#x2032;epiAmB.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is an X-ray crystal structure of N-iodoacyl AmB.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> depicts a proposed structural model for AmB-Erg complex.

It is currently approved for clinical use in the United States for the treatment of progressive, potentially life-threatening fungal infections, including such infections as systemic or deep tissue candidiasis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and mucormycosis, among others. It is generally formulated for intravenous injection. Amphotericin B is commercially available, for example, as Fungizone&#xae; (Squibb), Amphocin&#xae; (Pfizer), Abelcet&#xae; (Enzon), and Ambisome&#xae; (Astellas). Due to its undesirable toxic side effects, dosing is generally limited to a maximum of about 1.0 mg/kg/day and total cumulative doses not to exceed about 3 g in humans.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0035">AmB kills both fungal and human cells by forming a cytocidal extramembranous sterol sponge. Anderson, T. M. et al., <i>Nat Chem Biol </i>2014, 10 (5), 400-6. This large aggregate sits on the surface of lipid bilayers and rapidly extracts membrane sterols, which leads to cell death. Membrane permeabilization is not required. Based on this mechanism, a small molecule-based ligand-selective allosteric effect would enable selective binding of ergosterol over cholesterol and would eliminate the mammalian toxicity of AmB (in the form of C2&#x2032;epiAmB). See Wilcock, B. C. et al., <i>J Am Chem Soc </i>2013, 135 (23), 8488-91. The present invention discloses the K<sub>D</sub>s for the binding of both ergosterol and cholesterol to the AmB sterol sponge, which provides a quantitative and mechanistically-grounded biophysical parameter to guide rational optimization of the therapeutic index of this clinically significant natural product.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0036">The present invention relates, at least in part, to the discovery by the inventors of further derivatives of AmB which also are characterized by improved therapeutic index compared to AmB. The various derivatives, i.e., compounds of the invention, can be semi-synthetic or fully synthetic. An aspect of the invention is the development of a new synthetic derivative of AmB that retains potent binding of ergosterol but shows no detectable binding of cholesterol. This derivative retains fungicidal potency against many yeasts and molds but shows zero detectable mammalian toxicity. This demonstrates that differential binding of ergosterol over cholesterol is possible and provides a non-toxic variant of AmB that preserves desirable antifungal properties. Compounds of the invention enable a new high-dose treatment strategy to eradicate life-threatening invasive fungal infections with a significantly improved safety profile.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0037">Compounds of the invention and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are useful for inhibiting the growth of a fungus.

Fungi include yeasts, molds, and larger organisms including mushrooms. Yeasts and molds are of clinical relevance as infectious agents. Yeasts are typically described as budding forms of fungi. Of particular importance in connection with the invention are species of yeast that can cause infections in mammalian hosts. Such infections most commonly occur in immunocompromised hosts, including hosts with compromised barriers to infection (e.g., burn victims) and hosts with compromised immune systems (e.g., hosts receiving chemotherapy or immune suppressive therapy, and hosts infected with HIV). Pathogenic yeasts include, without limitation, various species of the genus <i>Candida</i>, as well as of <i>Cryptococcus</i>. Of particular note among pathogenic yeasts of the genus <i>Candida </i>are <i>C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. stellatoidea, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. guilliermondii, C. viswanathii</i>, and <i>C. lusitaniae</i>. The genus <i>Cryptococcus </i>specifically includes <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>. Yeast can cause infections of mucosal membranes, for example oral, esophageal, and vaginal infections in humans, as well as infections of bone, blood, urogenital tract, and central nervous system. This list is exemplary and is not limiting in any way.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0040">A number of fungi (apart from yeast) can cause infections in mammalian hosts.

Likewise, the invention may include the preparation of isotopic variants with radioisotopes, in the instance for example, where the resulting compounds may be used for drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radio-active isotopes tritium, i.e., <sup>3</sup>H, and carbon-14, i.e., <sup>14</sup>C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection. Further, compounds may be prepared that are substituted with positron emitting isotopes, such as <sup>11</sup>C, <sup>18</sup>F, <sup>15</sup>O and <sup>13</sup>N, and would be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.

An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+)- or (&#x2212;)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof.

Thus, two structures may be in equilibrium through the movement of it electrons and an atom (usually H). For example, enols and ketones are tautomers because they are rapidly interconverted by treatment with either acid or base. Another example of tautomerism is the aci- and nitro-forms of phenylnitromethane, that are likewise formed by treatment with acid or base. Tautomeric forms may be relevant to the attainment of the optimal chemical reactivity and biological activity of a compound of interest.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0136">As used herein a pure enantiomeric compound is substantially free from other enantiomers or stereoisomers of the compound (i.e., in enantiomeric excess).

The compound of the invention and other therapeutic agent may be administered simultaneously or sequentially. When the other therapeutic agents are administered simultaneously, they can be administered in the same or separate formulations, but they are administered substantially at the same time. The other therapeutic agents are administered sequentially with one another and with compound of the invention, when the administration of the other therapeutic agents and the compound of the invention is temporally separated.

Combined with the teachings provided herein, by choosing among the various active compounds and weighing factors such as potency, relative bioavailability, patient body weight, severity of adverse side-effects and preferred mode of administration, an effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatment regimen can be planned which does not cause substantial unwanted toxicity and yet is effective to treat the particular subject. The effective amount for any particular application can vary depending on such factors as the disease or condition being treated, the particular compound of the invention being administered, the size of the subject, or the severity of the disease or condition. One of ordinary skill in the art can empirically determine the effective amount of a particular compound of the invention and/or other therapeutic agent without necessitating undue experimentation. It is preferred generally that a maximum dose be used, that is, the highest safe dose according to some medical judgment. Multiple doses per day may be contemplated to achieve appropriate systemic levels of compounds. Appropriate systemic levels can be determined by, for example, measurement of the patient's peak or sustained plasma level of the drug. &#x201c;Dose&#x201d; and &#x201c;dosage&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0193">Generally, daily oral doses of active compounds will be, for human subjects, from about 0.01 milligrams/kg per day to 1000 milligrams/kg per day. It is expected that oral doses in the range of 0.5 to 50 milligrams/kg, in one or several administrations per day, will yield the desired results. Dosage may be adjusted appropriately to achieve desired drug levels, local or systemic, depending upon the mode of administration. For example, it is expected that intravenous administration would be from one order to several orders of magnitude lower dose per day. In the event that the response in a subject is insufficient at such doses, even higher doses (or effective higher doses by a different, more localized delivery route) may be employed to the extent that patient tolerance permits. Multiple doses per day are contemplated to achieve appropriate systemic levels of compounds.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0194">In one embodiment, intravenous administration of a compound of the invention may typically be from 0.1 mg/kg/day to 20 mg/kg/day.

For example, a compound of the invention can be formulated as a lyophilized preparation with deoxycholic acid, as a lyophilized preparation of liposome-intercalated or -encapsulated active compound, as a lipid complex in aqueous suspension, or as a cholesteryl sulfate complex. Lyophilized formulations are generally reconstituted in suitable aqueous solution, e.g., in sterile water or saline, shortly prior to administration.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0201">For oral administration, the compounds (i.e., compounds of the invention, and other therapeutic agents) can be formulated readily by combining the active compound(s) with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a subject to be treated.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0202">Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained as solid excipient, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores.

The component or components may be chemically modified so that oral delivery of the derivative is efficacious. Generally, the chemical modification contemplated is the attachment of at least one moiety to the component molecule itself, where said moiety permits (a) inhibition of acid hydrolysis; and (b) uptake into the blood stream from the stomach or intestine. Also desired is the increase in overall stability of the component or components and increase in circulation time in the body. Examples of such moieties include: polyethylene glycol, copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, carboxymethyl cellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and polyproline.

Preferred for pharmaceutical usage, as indicated above, are polyethylene glycol moieties.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0204">For the component (or derivative) the location of release may be the stomach, the small intestine (the duodenum, the jejunum, or the ileum), or the large intestine. One skilled in the art has available formulations which will not dissolve in the stomach, yet will release the material in the duodenum or elsewhere in the intestine. Preferably, the release will avoid the deleterious effects of the stomach environment, either by protection of the compound of the invention (or derivative) or by release of the biologically active material beyond the stomach environment, such as in the intestine.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0205">To ensure full gastric resistance a coating impermeable to at least pH 5.0 is essential. Examples of the more common inert ingredients that are used as enteric coatings are cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP), HPMCP 50, HPMCP 55, polyvinyl acetate phthalate (PVAP), Eudragit L30D, Aquateric, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), Eudragit L, Eudragit S, and shellac.

This can include sugar coatings, or coatings which make the tablet easier to swallow. Capsules may consist of a hard shell (such as gelatin) for delivery of dry therapeutic (e.g., powder); for liquid forms, a soft gelatin shell may be used. The shell material of cachets could be thick starch or other edible paper. For pills, lozenges, molded tablets or tablet triturates, moist massing techniques can be used.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0207">The therapeutic can be included in the formulation as fine multi-particulates in the form of granules or pellets of particle size about 1 mm. The formulation of the material for capsule administration could also be as a powder, lightly compressed plugs or even as tablets.

Lubricants may be used as a layer between the therapeutic and the die wall, and these can include but are not limited to; stearic acid including its magnesium and calcium salts, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), liquid paraffin, vegetable oils and waxes. Soluble lubricants may also be used such as sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium lauryl sulfate, polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights, Carbowax 4000 and 6000.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0213">Glidants that might improve the flow properties of the drug during formulation and to aid rearrangement during compression might be added. The glidants may include starch, talc, pyrogenic silica and hydrated silicoaluminate.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0214">To aid dissolution of the therapeutic into the aqueous environment a surfactant might be added as a wetting agent.

Novel Chemical Design with No Mammalian Toxicity</heading><p id="p-0254" num="0243">Enabled by the disclosed development of frontier synthesis methods for efficient modification of new AmB derivatives, it is alternatively discovered that AmB primarily kills fungal and human cells by binding ergosterol and cholesterol, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>); channel formation is not required. All data are consistent with a &#x201c;sterol sponge&#x201d; model (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>), whereby AmB self-assembles into a large extramembraneous aggregate and rapidly extracts physiologically vital sterols from fungal and human cells, thereby causing cell death. Frontier SSNMR studies further revealed key insights into the structure of AmB sponge-sterol complexes. Anderson, T. M. et al., <i>Nat Chem Biol </i>2014, 10 (5), 400-6.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0244">This key discovery opened a path to the rational development of a non-toxic AmB variant. To probe its predicted role in sterol binding, the hydroxyl group was synthetically deleted at the C2&#x2032; position on the mycosamine appendage. The resulting derivative, C2&#x2032;deOAmB (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), was found to bind ergosterol but, within the detection limits of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), not cholesterol (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). Consistent with the sterol sponge model, this derivative retained good activity against yeast but, most importantly, was nontoxic to human red blood cells and primary (hREC) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0256" num="0245">2-Deoxy glycosides are notoriously challenging to synthesize and lack of scalable access to C2&#x2032;deOAmB has precluded its development. However, these findings led us to a predictive model for guiding the development of more synthetically accessible derivatives with similar selectivity profiles. Crich, D. et. al., <i>The Journal of Organic Chemistry </i>2011, 76 (22), 9193-9209; Hou, D. et al., <i>Carbohyd Res </i>2009, 344 (15), 1911-1940; Rodriguez, M. &#xc1;. Et al., <i>The Journal of Organic Chemistry </i>2005, 70 (25), 10297-10310; and Hou, D., et al., <i>Organic Letters </i>2007, 9 (22), 4487-4490. Specifically, to rationalize the selective toxicity of C2&#x2032;deOAmB for fungal vs. human cells, a model was proposed in which the C2&#x2032;-OH stabilizes a conformer of AmB that readily binds both ergosterol and cholesterol. The deletion of this hydroxyl group favors a shift to a different conformer or set of conformers which retain the capacity to bind ergosterol but not the more sterically bulky cholesterol. Alternatively, this model suggests that deletion of the C2&#x2032;OH of AmB causes a small molecule-based allosteric effect that results in ligand-selective binding. Based on the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of N-iodoacyl AmB (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>), there is a prominent water-bridged hydrogen-bond between the hydroxyl groups at C2&#x2032; and C13 that may serve to stabilize a particular conformation of the mycosamine appendage relative to the polyene macrolide core. This observation, combined with our previous findings that the mycosamine appendage is critical for binding both ergosterol and cholesterol and observations by SSNMR of direct intermolecular contacts between the AmB polyene and the A/B rings of ergosterol, allowed us to propose a specific structural model for both AmB-sterol complexes consistent with all of our data (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). Woerly, E. M. et al, <i>Nat Chem </i>2014, 6 (6), 484-91; Anderson, T. M. et al., <i>Nat Chem Biol </i>2014, 10 (5), 400-6.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0246">Guided by this model, a simple epimerization of the more synthetically accessible C2&#x2032; hydroxyl group, would likewise eliminate the water-bridged C2&#x2032;OH&#x2014;C13OH interaction and cause a shift in the orientation of the mycosamine appendage similar to that predicted in C2&#x2032;deOAmB. The resulting derivative, C2&#x2032;epiAmB (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), selectively binds ergosterol and exerts cytocidal action against fungal but not human cells. Notably, C2&#x2032;epiAmB differs from AmB only in the stereochemistry at a single atom.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0247">A practical 11-step synthesis of C2&#x2032;epiAmB using a frontier site-selective acylation method was developed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). Wilcock, B. C. et al., <i>Nat Chem </i>2012, 4 (12), 996-1003; Uno, B. E. <i>A synthesis enabled understanding of Amphotericin B leading to derivatives with improved therapeutic indices</i>. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2014. The sterol binding and cell killing activities was then determined. As predicted, like C2&#x2032;deOAmB, C2&#x2032;epiAmB was found by ITC to bind ergosterol but not (detectably) cholesterol, and, most importantly, to kill fungal but not human cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0259" num="0248">These ITC studies failed to yield S-shaped isotherms, precluding determination of binding constants and other thermodynamic parameters. However, an alternative method was developed for reproducible formation of homogenous AmB and C2&#x2032;epiAmB sterol sponge aggregates in vitro. Using these preparations, a quantitative UV-Vis and Principle Component (PCA) based assay for determining the apparent K<sub>D</sub>s for the binding of AmB and C2&#x2032;epiAmB to ergosterol and cholesterol (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>D</figref>) was developed. Consistent with the small therapeutic index of this natural product, strong binding of AmB to both ergosterol (K<sub>D, erg</sub>=120 nM) and cholesterol (K<sub>D,chol</sub>=840 nM) was observed. Consistent with evaluating C2&#x2032;epiAmB in vitro, strong binding for C2&#x2032;epiAmB to ergosterol (K<sub>D,erg</sub>=150 nM) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>), but little or no binding of cholesterol (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>) was observed. The data does not permit confident assigning of a K<sub>D </sub>for the latter interaction, but it was estimated that it is at least &#x3e;2000 nM (which is the estimated K<sub>D,chol </sub>if the data was fitted). Since C2&#x2032;epiAmB shows no mammalian toxicity, these mechanistically grounded biophysical parameters can be used as benchmarks to prioritize new hybrid derivatives for further development.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Example 2. AmB Derivatives with No Observed Animal Toxicity</heading><p id="p-0260" num="0249">&#x3e;100 mg of C2&#x2032;epiAmB was prepared, formulated it as the corresponding deoxycholate complex, and evaluated this derivative head-to-head with AmB-deoxycholate for toxicity and efficacy in animal models. Intravenous (IV) administration of AmB-deoxycholate to mice was found to be lethal at 2-4 mg/kg (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, Left). In contrast, no mortality was observed upon IV injection of C2&#x2032;epiAmB-deoxycholate even at 128 mg/kg (the highest dose tested). IV administration of AmB-deoxycholate to rats (2.5 mg/kg) caused significant elevations in Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), Alanine transaminase/Aspartate transaminase (ALT/AST) and mortality (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, Right). Alternatively, no elevations in BUN or ALT/AST and no mortality when rats were treated with IV injections of C2&#x2032;epiAmB at doses of 2, 10, and 17.5 mg/kg (the highest dose that was tested) was observed.

Consistent with literature precedent, we confirmed that AmBisome&#xae; shows significant toxicity in mice at 48 mg/kg as judged by state-of-the art renal genotoxicity biomarkers. Kondo, C. et al., <i>J Toxicol Sci </i>2012, 37 (4), 723-37. Alternatively, mice were injected with the same high dose (48 mg/kg) of C2&#x2032;epiAmB-deoxycholate and observed no significant elevations in these same biomarkers. Thus, C2&#x2032;epiAmB is significantly less toxic than AmBisome&#xae; in mice.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0251">In each case, C2&#x2032;epiAmB is non-toxic to human red blood cells, primary hREC, mice, and rats up to the highest dose tested.

Partially Retained In Vitro Antifungal Activity</heading><p id="p-0263" num="0252">In vitro antifungal activity of C2&#x2032;epiAmB was compared with that of AmB against an extensive series of <i>Candida </i>and <i>Aspergillus </i>clinical isolates (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>) at Evotec (Oxfordshire, UK). C2&#x2032;epiAmB showed good activity against many <i>Candida </i>and several <i>Aspergillus </i>strains. However, there were several strains of <i>A. fumigatus </i>(AF293, A1163, and ATC204305), for which C2&#x2032;epiAmB was 4-fold less potent than AmB, and in one strain (AF91) C2&#x2032;epiAmB was &#x3e;32 times less potent. C2&#x2032;epiAmB was also sent to the US national Fungus Testing Laboratory at UT-San Antonio for antifungal testing against an extended panel of especially challenging 40 <i>Aspergillus </i>clinical isolates, including azole-resistant <i>A. fumigatus, A. flavus</i>, and <i>A. terreus </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>). C2&#x2032;epiAmB was found to be 2-16 times less potent than AmB (average 5.6-fold less potent across all 40 strains). Recently, Steinbach and Burke directly compared the activity of AmB, AmBisome*, caspofungin, voriconazole, and C2&#x2032;epiAmB against an even broader panel of clinically relevant invasive molds (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>). These studies again showed good antifungal potency for C2&#x2032;epiAmB against many strains, including a pan-azole resistant strain (F14196), but also important opportunities for improved activity against <i>Aspergillus. </i></p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example 4. Retained Primary Mechanism of In Vitro Antifungal Activity</heading><p id="p-0264" num="0253">Providing strong evidence for the sterol sponge mechanism, it was previously demonstrated that the antifungal activity of AmB is mitigated via pre-complexing the AmB sterol sponge with ergosterol, thus blocking its ability to extract ergosterol from yeast cells. Anderson, T. M. et al., <i>Nat Chem Biol </i>2014, 10 (5), 400-6. In a follow-up study performed in collaboration with Susan Lindquist at MIT, this mechanism also showed that it is inherently evasive to clinical resistance, because mutating the ergosterol target causes loss of pathogenicity. Davis, S. A., et al., <i>Nat Chem Biol </i>2015, 11 (7), 481-7. To test whether C2&#x2032;epiAmB primarily kills cells via the same sterol sponge mechanism, the C2&#x2032;epiAmB sponge was similarly pre-complexed with ergosterol (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). The same reduction in potency for AmB and C2&#x2032;epiAmB upon ergosterol pre-complexation was observed. Thus, C2&#x2032;epiAmB similarly kills yeast primarily via sterol binding, and, by extension, the new compounds targeted in this application are expected to have a similar barrier to fungal resistance that has been observed for the past 50+ years with AmB.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">Example 5. Non-Toxic Dose-Dependent Efficacy in Murine Invasive Candidiasis</heading><p id="p-0265" num="0254">Finally, the dose-dependent efficacy of C2&#x2032;epiAmB-deoxycholate complex in a murine model of invasive candidiasis was tested (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). Neutropenic ICR/Swiss mice were injected via lateral tail vein with a lethal inoculum of <i>C. albicans </i>and then treated via single IP injection of AmB-deoxycholate (1 or 4 mg/kg) or C2&#x2032;epiAmB-deoxycholate (1, 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg). Previous work from the Andes lab shows dose-dependent efficacy for AmB-deoxycholate. Andes, D. et al., <i>Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy </i>2001, 45 (3), 922-6. In fact, the PD parameter that best correlates with outcome is Cmax&#x2212;/MIC. The same was subsequently observed in a pulmonary model of invasive aspergillosis. Wiederhold, N. P. et al., <i>Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy </i>2006, 50 (2), 469-73. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, C2&#x2032;epiAmB also showed dose-dependent efficacy, with outstanding reductions in fungal burden at the 16 mg/kg dose.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0255">These results show that C2&#x2032;epiAmB is a unique antifungal agent with potent fungicidal activity against several <i>Candida </i>and <i>Aspergillus </i>strains and no detectable mammalian toxicity, a first for an amphotericin derivative.
