Due to the dust, water, mud, rocks, etc., commonly encountered in off-road environments, such CVTs typically comprise a housing or cover designed to protect the components, e.g., primary clutch, secondary clutch, bushings, belts, etc., from the environment. However, such covers substantially enclose the components and trap heat generated during operation of the CVT such that the components do not easily cool off causing degradation in the life of the components. Additionally, in higher horsepower vehicles, greater heat is generated, which will degrade the internal parts of the CVT faster. Known system designs for cooling the internal components of CVTs have a fan located on the inside, or stationary, sheave of the primary clutch and/or the outside, or stationary, sheave of the secondary clutch. However, such locations limit the size that the fan can be and typically require that the fan be integrally formed in the respective sheave.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In various embodiments, the present disclosure provides a continuously variable transmission housing comprising an inner cover; and an outer cover connectable to the inner cover to provide the housing having an interior chamber defined therein.

For example, the statement that the prime mover <b>42</b> is mounted to the chassis <b>14</b> &#x201c;forward of&#x201d; the longitudinal center means the prime mover <b>42</b> is mounted to the chassis <b>14</b> within an area that extends from the longitudinal center of the chassis <b>14</b> to the front of the chassis <b>14</b> at the front of the vehicle <b>10</b> (e.g., adjacent the front wheels <b>22</b> positioned at the front of the vehicle <b>10</b> in the illustrated embodiment).

The housing <b>80</b> is structured to enclose the primary clutch assembly <b>70</b>, secondary clutch assembly <b>74</b>, and drive belt <b>78</b> within an interior chamber <b>82</b> of the housing <b>80</b>. The housing <b>80</b> protects the primary clutch assembly <b>70</b>, the secondary clutch assembly <b>74</b>, the drive belt <b>78</b> from water, mud, dirt and other debris present in the ambient (exterior) environment. In various embodiments, the housing <b>80</b> comprises an inner cover <b>80</b>A and an outer cover <b>80</b>B that is connectable to the first cover <b>80</b>A to define the interior chamber <b>82</b>.

Thereafter, the torque/power received at the secondary clutch assembly <b>74</b> will be delivered to at least one of the rear and/or front axles <b>52</b> and/or <b>62</b>. For example, in various embodiments wherein the drivetrain <b>44</b> includes the first gearbox <b>50</b>, the secondary clutch assembly <b>74</b> can transfer the received torque/power to the first gearbox <b>50</b>, via the first gearbox input shaft <b>94</b>, and consequently to the rear and/or front axles <b>52</b> and/or <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In various embodiments, the primary clutch assembly <b>70</b> is structured and operable to deliver a continuously variable torque to the secondary clutch assembly <b>74</b>.

Put another way, a torque/power transfer ratio of the torque/power received by the primary clutch assembly <b>70</b> from the prime mover <b>42</b> versus the torque/power delivered to the secondary clutch assembly <b>74</b> from the primary clutch assembly <b>70</b> can be continuously varied via operation of the primary clutch assembly <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, in various embodiments, one or both of the primary and secondary clutch assemblies <b>70</b> and/or <b>74</b> can comprise the following components that are structured and operable to function in the manner described below. Particularly, in various embodiments, one or both of the primary and secondary clutch assemblies <b>70</b> and/or <b>74</b> can comprise an intake fan <b>98</b> as described below. However, for simplicity and clarity, by way of example, only the primary clutch assembly <b>70</b> will be described to comprise the intake fan <b>98</b> and the operation and functionally of the intake fan <b>98</b> will be described, by way of example, only with regard to the primary clutch assembly <b>70</b>. However, it will be easily and readily understood by one skilled in the art that the description herein relating to the intake fan <b>98</b> with regard to embodiments of the primary clutch assembly <b>70</b> is merely an example, and such description is equally applicable with regard to embodiments of the secondary clutch <b>74</b> and is wholly within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In various embodiments, the primary clutch assembly <b>70</b> comprises a clutch post <b>102</b>, a stationary (or static) sheave <b>106</b> that is fixedly mounted to the clutch post <b>102</b>, and a movable (or dynamic) sheave <b>110</b> that is movably mounted to the clutch post <b>102</b>. The clutch post <b>102</b>, and hence the primary clutch assembly <b>70</b>, is fixedly connectable to the prime mover output shaft <b>86</b> via a clutch bolt <b>114</b> such that the primary clutch assembly <b>70</b> will rotate in accordance with rotation of the output shaft <b>86</b> and will thereby receive the torque/power generated by the prime mover <b>42</b>. More particularly, the movable sheave <b>110</b> is structured and operable to rotate with the output shaft/clutch post <b>86</b>/<b>102</b> and simultaneously controllably move axially along the clutch post <b>102</b> in the X<sup>+</sup> and X<sup>&#x2212;</sup> directions. The stationary sheave <b>106</b> includes a beveled front face <b>116</b>. Similarly, the movable sheave <b>110</b> comprises a beveled front face <b>118</b> that is disposed opposite (e.g., disposed face to face) the stationary sheave beveled front face <b>116</b>. The movable sheave <b>110</b> further includes a linear movement mechanism <b>122</b> that is structured and operable to controllably move the movable sheave <b>110</b> axially along the clutch post <b>102</b> in the X<sup>+</sup> and X<sup>&#x2212;</sup> directions. A V-shaped channel <b>126</b> is formed between the opposing beveled front faces <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> of the stationary and movable sheaves <b>106</b> and <b>110</b>, and the drive belt <b>78</b> is disposed within the V-shaped channel <b>126</b>. Controlled axial movement of the movable sheave <b>110</b> in the X<sup>+</sup> and X<sup>&#x2212;</sup> directions along the clutch post <b>102</b>, via the linear movement mechanism <b>122</b>, varies a width of the V-shaped channel <b>126</b>. The controlled varying of the channel <b>126</b> varies a diameter, or radial distance from the clutch post <b>102</b>, at which the drive belt <b>78</b> travels within the V-shaped channel <b>126</b>, which in turn various the torque transfer ratio of the primary clutch assembly <b>70</b> to the secondary clutch assembly <b>74</b>. Therefore, the torque/power output by the secondary clutch assembly <b>74</b> (e.g., the torque/power output by the secondary clutch assembly <b>74</b> to the first gearbox <b>50</b>) can be controllably varied by the controlled linear movement of the movable sheave <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In various embodiments, the axial movement of the movable sheave <b>110</b> along the clutch can be controlled by a vehicle controller and/or a CVT controller (not shown). Such a CVT controller can be a controller that is communicatively connected to, or integrated as part of, a main vehicle controller that is typically understood to be an embedded system that controls one or more of electrical systems and/or subsystems the vehicle <b>10</b>. Generally, such a CVT controller can be any suitable hardware and/or software (e.g., software instructions stored on a non-transitory computer readable medium that can be read and performed by one or more processors) based controller that is structured and operable to control operation of the CVT <b>46</b> as described herein. For example, it is envisioned that such a CVT controller can comprise one or more, or be part of, application specific integrated circuit(s) (e.g., ASIC(s)), combinational logic circuit(s); field programmable gate array(s) (FPGA); processor(s) (shared, dedicated, or group) that execute software code; and/or other suitable hardware components that provide the CVT functionality described herein and remain within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As described above, by way of example, in various embodiments, the primary clutch assembly <b>70</b> includes the intake fan <b>98</b>. More particularly, in such embodiments, the intake fan <b>98</b> is fixedly mounted to the clutch post <b>102</b> opposite a back face <b>130</b> of the movable sheave <b>110</b> (e.g., disposed face to face, e.g., disposed with movable sheave back face <b>130</b> facing fan back face <b>134</b>) such that the intake fan <b>98</b> is independent, separate, distinct and spaced apart from the back face <b>130</b> of the movable sheave <b>110</b>. More specifically, the intake fan <b>98</b> is an independent, separate, distinct component of the primary clutch assembly <b>70</b> and is independent, separate and distinct from both the stationary and movable sheaves <b>106</b> and <b>110</b>. The intake fan <b>98</b> can be mounted to the clutch post <b>102</b> in any suitable manner. For example, in various embodiments, the intake fan <b>98</b> can be compressed between a lock washer <b>128</b>, a retaining washer <b>132</b> and a head washer <b>136</b> as the clutch bolt <b>114</b> is tightened to fixedly connect the intake fan <b>98</b> to the clutch post <b>102</b>. The retaining washer <b>132</b> and head washer <b>136</b> allows most or substantially all the compressive force to transfer through the lock washer <b>128</b>, head washer <b>136</b>, and retaining washer <b>132</b> and not through the intake fan <b>98</b>. In various instances, the retainer washer <b>132</b> is structured to ensure that the intake fan <b>98</b> is centered on the clutch post <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In various embodiments, a slack section <b>102</b>A of the clutch post <b>102</b> generally extends beyond the back face <b>130</b> of the movable sheave <b>110</b>. As described above, during operation of the primary clutch assembly <b>70</b>, the movable sheave <b>110</b> controllably moves, or transitions, (via operation of the linear movement mechanism <b>122</b>) along the clutch post <b>102</b> in the X<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and X<sup>+</sup> directions to adjust the space between the beveled front faces <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> to controllably adjust the torque/power transferred to the secondary clutch assembly <b>74</b>. Moreover, as the moveable sheave <b>110</b> moves/transitions in the X<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and X<sup>+</sup> directions along the clutch post <b>102</b>, a length L of the slack section <b>102</b>A will increase and decrease. The length L is defined to be the distance between the back face <b>130</b> of the movable sheave <b>110</b> and a back face <b>134</b> of the intake fan <b>98</b>. For example, the length L of the slack section <b>102</b>A will be a maximum length when the movable sheave <b>110</b> is moved/transitioned as far in the X<sup>&#x2212;</sup> direction toward the stationary sheave <b>106</b> as the operational limits of the primary clutch assembly allow. Conversely, the length L of the slack section <b>102</b>A will be a minimum length when the movable sheave <b>110</b> is moved/transitioned as far in the X<sup>+</sup> direction away from the stationary sheave <b>106</b> as the operational limits of the primary clutch assembly allow.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Still more particularly, the clutch post <b>102</b> is structured to have a length (not shown but understood) such that the length L of the slack section <b>102</b>A allows the moveable sheave <b>110</b> to move as far in the X<sup>+</sup> direction away from the stationary sheave <b>106</b> as the operational limits of the primary clutch assembly allow without the back face <b>130</b> of the moveable sheave <b>110</b> contacting the back face <b>134</b> of the intake fan <b>98</b>. In various embodiments, the slack section of the clutch post <b>102</b> can be between 1.0 inches and 2.50 inches. Furthermore, in various embodiments the minimum length of the clutch post slack length <b>102</b>A (e.g., the length of the slack length L when the movable sheave <b>110</b> is moved/transitioned as far in the X<sup>+</sup> direction away from the stationary sheave <b>106</b> as the operational limits of the primary clutch assembly allow) can be between 0.05 and 0.50 inches. Hence, the length of clutch post <b>102</b> and the length L of the clutch post slack section <b>102</b>A are such that the primary clutch (e.g., the stationary and movable sheaves <b>106</b> and <b>110</b>) can operate (e.g., the movable sheave <b>110</b> can controllably move/transition along the clutch post <b>102</b> the X<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and X<sup>+</sup> directions) without the movable sheave <b>110</b> contacting the intake fan <b>98</b>. Particularly, the length of clutch post <b>102</b> and the length L of the clutch post slack section <b>102</b>A are such that the location and orientation of the intake fan <b>98</b> within the CVT housing <b>80</b> is generally fixed and does not change. More particularly, the location and orientation of the intake fan <b>98</b> relative to an interior face <b>138</b> of the housing outer cover <b>80</b>B is generally fixed and does not change. Still more particularly, the length of clutch post <b>102</b> and the length L of the clutch post slack section <b>102</b>A are such that an outer face <b>142</b> of the intake fan <b>98</b> is generally a fixed distance D from the interior face <b>138</b> of the outer housing cover <b>80</b>B.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The intake fan <b>98</b> comprises a plurality of fins <b>146</b> that define the outer face <b>142</b> of the intake fan <b>98</b>. The size, shape and dimensions of the intake fan <b>98</b> can be any desired size, shape and dimensions suitable for desirably cooling the respective CVT <b>46</b> when operated in the respective application and environment. Additionally, the size, shape, dimensions, number and configuration of the fins <b>146</b> can be any desired size, shape, dimensions, number and configuration suitable for desirably cooling the respective CVT <b>46</b> when operated in the respective application and environment.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In various embodiments, the housing outer cover <b>80</b>B includes an air intake port <b>150</b> that fluidly connects the ambient air from an ambient environment external to the housing <b>80</b> with the interior chamber <b>82</b> of the housing <b>80</b>. The air intake port <b>150</b> is located in the housing outer cover <b>80</b>B such that the intake port <b>150</b> is generally opposite (e.g., disposed face to face) and aligned with a center of the intake fan <b>98</b> and an inner radius of the fins <b>146</b>, (e.g., the intake port <b>150</b> is generally opposite (e.g., disposed face to face) and aligned with a head of the clutch bolt <b>114</b>). As described above, the length of clutch post <b>102</b> and the length L of the clutch post slack section <b>102</b>A are such that the outer face <b>142</b> of the intake fan <b>98</b> is the generally fixed distance D from the interior face <b>138</b> of the outer housing cover <b>80</b>B. Moreover, the distance D has a length such that the space between the intake fan outer face <b>142</b> and the outer housing cover interior face <b>138</b> defines a low pressure gap <b>148</b>. The distance D will also be referred to herein as the width of the low pressure gap <b>148</b>. The width D of the low pressure gap <b>148</b> has a length such that when the intake fan <b>98</b> is rotated, via rotation of the clutch post <b>102</b> by the prime mover output shaft <b>86</b>, an area of low pressure is generated within a low pressure gap <b>148</b>. The area of low pressure in turn generates a vacuum effect, or suction, at the air intake port <b>150</b> and within the low pressure gap <b>148</b>, whereby ambient air will be drawn into the housing interior chamber <b>82</b> at or near the center of the intake fan outer face <b>142</b>. The ambient air drawn into the center of the intake fan <b>98</b> is then forced radially outward by the fins <b>146</b> into the interior chamber <b>82</b>, thereby generating airflow within the interior chamber <b>82</b> that cools the primary and secondary clutch assemblies <b>70</b> and <b>74</b> and the drive belt <b>78</b>, as described below. In various embodiments, the width D of the low pressure gap <b>148</b> can be between approximately 0.010 and 0.30 inches, for example, between approximately 0.10 inches to 0.20 inches, e.g., between approximately 0.050 and 0.10.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As used herein, the term &#x2018;vacuum effect&#x2019; will be understood to mean the suction or drawing of air from a first area (e.g., the ambient environment) to a second area (e.g., the interior chamber <b>82</b> of the housing <b>80</b>) caused by creating a lower pressure within the second area (e.g., within the low pressure gap <b>148</b>) than exists at the first area (e.g., the ambient environment). For example, due to the structure of the intake fan <b>98</b> and width D of the low pressure gap <b>148</b> (e.g., location of the intake fan outer face <b>142</b> relative to the outer cover interior face <b>138</b>), rotation of the intake fan <b>98</b> creates a lower air pressure within the low pressure gap <b>148</b> than is present in the ambient environment external to the housing <b>80</b>, thereby generating a vacuum effect that will draw air from the ambient environment into the housing interior chamber <b>82</b> via the air intake port <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The housing <b>80</b> additionally includes an air exhaust outlet <b>154</b> that fluidly connects the interior chamber <b>82</b> with the ambient environment.
