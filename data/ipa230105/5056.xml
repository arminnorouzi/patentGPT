These traditional means are not adjustable and if credit cards are used, a very high fixed interest rate can be charged. Credit card interest is the principal way in which credit card issuers generate revenue. A card issuer is a bank or credit union that gives a consumer a card and an account number that can be used with various payees to make payments and borrow money. The bank pays the payee and can collect a percentage of the purchase and then charge the cardholder interest over the time the money remains borrowed. A finance charge billed to the cardholder from the credit card company can be equal to daily compound interest. Thus, an APR of 29.99% carries an effective annual rate of 34.96% based upon compounding interest daily for a year with 12 billing periods and 365 days.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A credit card can have a grace period which is a period of time where no interest is charged on an ending statement balance that is paid by the due date. The duration of the credit card grace period can be approximately 30 days or one month. If the required outstanding balance is not paid within the grace period, then the normal interest rate calculation method is used to calculate a revised outstanding balance based upon compound interest. The grace period allows cardholders to use credit cards for the convenience of having one invoice payable once per month rather than having many separate cash or check transactions. The grace period also allows credit card clients to keep money invested at a return until the money must be moved to pay the credit card balance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">What is needed is a system that provides an improved system and method for providing purchasing options for customers to purchase goods and services from merchants with lower interest rates and lower total costs.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is directed towards systems and methods for facilitating the refinancing of purchasing transactions. The system can include one or more system servers that communicate through a network with customer computing devices such as mobile smart phone devices. When a customer wishes to use the refinancing services, an application program (app) can be downloaded to the customer's mobile computing device or other customer computing device. Alternatively, the customer's computing device can communicate with the refinancing system server using a web browser to log into a secure server web page.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The customer can interact with the app's user interface to input personal information which can be used to approve the customer for the refinancing system. The input information can be analyzed by the system to determine a credit risk rating for the customer and screen fraudulent users. Users can also input bank account information through the user interface of the app to link a bank account(s) to the refinancing system, The system can check the user's bank account information and FICO score or equivalent credit risk rating to determine refinancing offers for the customer. Users with higher assets and credit risk ratings can be authorized by the system to receive refinancing for higher purchase values and lower interest rates. In contrast people with fewer assets and lower credit risk ratings can receive refinancing for lower purchase values and higher interest rates. In some cases, the system can determine that the user may not have sufficient assets or credit risk rating, or the system may detect fraudulent activity linked to the user. In those cases, the system may not approve a customer for the refinancing service.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Once a customer is approved for the refinancing service, the system can inform the customer of a range of dollar value that can be refinanced through the user interface of the mobile computing device (or other computing device). For example, the system may display a message stating that the customer is eligible to transfer one recent credit card purchase with a value between $200-$3,000 to a third party refinance service. The user can input information for one or more credit cards. The system server can access the customer's past credit card purchase information and display refinance eligible purchases. The system may also display purchases that are not eligible for refinancing. The user can then select a purchase for refinancing through the user interface on the mobile device. In other embodiments, the customer may select multiple purchases for refinancing which can cumulatively be within the value range authorized by the system.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The user can then be offered loan terms for the refinancing. In some embodiments, the repayment options can vary in duration and interest rate. The refinance loan terms can vary depending upon the credit risk rating of the customer. A customer with a super prime credit risk rating can be offered a higher refinancing amount and lower interest rate than a customer with a prime or subprime credit risk rating. The customer can select the loan repayment terms and pay off the loan according to the selected repayment terms. Examples of the user interface used for selecting the refinance repayment loan terms are described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/712,790, &#x201c;Tools For Purchasing Transactions&#x201d; which is incorporated by reference. The described refinance service can provide longer repayment duration with lower interest rates than credit cards.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The novel features of the invention are set forth with particularity in the appended claims.

The system server may work with other merchant and service provider servers <b>70</b> to process communications from the mobile devices <b>72</b>. For example, in an embodiment, the system server <b>50</b> can provide a &#x201c;white-label&#x201d; for other merchant servers/databases <b>70</b>. The system server <b>50</b> may have a system database <b>52</b> for storing information about the users and their mobile devices <b>72</b>. The system server <b>50</b> can also communicate with other merchant servers/databases <b>70</b> to obtain information and verify information about the mobile devices <b>72</b> and the users of the mobile devices <b>72</b>. The server <b>50</b> is coupled, directly or indirectly, to one or more merchant servers/databases <b>70</b> and a plurality of mobile devices <b>72</b> through a network. The network interface between the system server <b>50</b>, merchant servers/databases <b>70</b> and mobile devices <b>72</b> may include one or more routers that serve to buffer and route the data transmitted between the server and client computers. The network may be the Internet, a Wide Area Network (WAN), a Local Area Network (LAN), or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the system server <b>104</b> is a World-Wide Web (WWW) server that stores data in the form of web pages and transmits these pages as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) files over the Internet <b>110</b> to the client computer(s) <b>102</b>, <b>118</b>. For this embodiment, the client computers <b>102</b>, <b>118</b> typically runs a web browser program <b>114</b> to access the web pages served by system server <b>104</b> and merchant servers <b>106</b> and merchant databases <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, a system server <b>104</b> in network system <b>100</b> is a server that executes financing for the purchase of goods and/or service processing on the client computers <b>102</b>, <b>118</b>. Server process <b>112</b> may represent one or more executable programs modules that are stored within network server <b>104</b> and executed locally within the server. Alternatively, however, it may be stored on a remote storage or processing device coupled to server <b>104</b> or network <b>110</b> and accessed by server <b>104</b> to be locally executed. In a further alternative embodiment, the sales process <b>112</b> may be implemented in a plurality of different program modules, each of which may be executed by two or more distributed server computers coupled to each other, or to network <b>110</b> separately.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For an embodiment in which network <b>110</b> is the Internet, system server <b>104</b> executes a web server process <b>116</b> to provide HTML documents, typically in the form of web pages, to client computers coupled to the network. To access the HTML files provided by server <b>104</b>, client computer <b>102</b> executes a web browser process <b>114</b> that accesses web pages available on server <b>104</b> and other Internet server sites, such as supplemental servers, which may also be a network computer. The system server <b>104</b> can provide a &#x201c;white-label&#x201d; for other merchant servers <b>106</b> that can sell goods or services to clients. Alternatively, in an embodiment, the system server <b>104</b> can provide financing to clients <b>102</b>, <b>118</b> that can be independent of transactions with the merchant servers <b>106</b>. The merchant servers <b>106</b> can be coupled to merchant databases <b>122</b> that store merchant information. The client computer <b>102</b> may access the Internet <b>110</b> through an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Data for any of the customers, goods and services purchased, and merchants may be stored by a data store <b>120</b> that is closely or loosely coupled to any of the server <b>104</b> and/or client <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The client computers <b>102</b>, <b>118</b> may be a smart phone or another computing device such as a computer, personal digital assistant, or similar computing device that provides access to the Internet network <b>110</b> and a sufficient degree of user input and processing capability to execute or access any required client-side application. More specifically, the client computers <b>102</b>, <b>118</b> include a processor, memory, input and display. The client computers <b>102</b> and <b>118</b> may be coupled to the server computer <b>104</b> over a wired connection, a wireless connection or any combination thereof. The client computer <b>118</b> can include a touch screen display, which can function to display user interfaces with loan information and provide an input mechanism for load adjustments.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition to providing communications between the system components, the inventive system can also control and monitor the transfer of funds between the financing service provider, merchants and client customers. For example, when customers obtain credit from the financing service provider, the merchant can be paid directly by the financing service provider by any means such as: electronic funds transfers, wire transfers, checks, or any other payment methods. When customers make payments on the financing used to make a purchase, those payments can similarly be made using debit cards electronic funds transfers, wire transfers, checks, automated checking payments or any other payment methods.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The inventive systems and methods can be used in combination with purchasing systems described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/573,334, &#x201c;System and Method of Transacting&#x201d; filed Dec. 17, 2014, which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The inventive system and method is used for providing financial services for instantaneous credit for financial transactions, which can include purchasing goods or services. The &#x201c;credit determination&#x201d; can be a pre-approval process for shopping at a merchant website or physical store, enabling the merchant to offer, or enabling a customer to ask for credit before or during or after shopping. An offer for potential credit is presented to or accessed by the customer and the customer can &#x201c;apply for credit&#x201d; using their phone number and/or other identifying information (where needed), regardless of Whether or not the customer has shopped with a merchant or the credit provider's payment system before. The credit provider can take the user's identifying information, and/or the merchant information and/or the transaction information (e.g. items already in cart, or items previously purchased) and can provide credit for that customer to spend at that merchant. Credit determination can be based upon customer information such as: FICO score, financial history such as bank/credit accounts, employment duration, job title, mobile phone information, and/or other available information. The customer information may be stored on credit provider databases. In an embodiment, the credit can be contingent upon specific products or services and possibly further limited to specific products or sale items.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The credit provider may require customers with extremely low estimated credit determinations to provide additional information such as a credit card or bank account number before credit is offered. If the customer already has a personal account with the credit provider, the customer can log into the credit provider's website to access the customer's existing account using the passwordless login system. In an embodiment, the system may store customer account information and may allow customers to access their account information through a passwordless login system such as the system described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 14/578,353, &#x201c;System and Method For Passwordless Login&#x201d; filed Dec. 20, 2014, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a system client can be introduced through a website, app or any other on-line portal to a system for refinancing purchases made with a credit card. The benefits of the refinancing can include: eliminating a balance on a credit card which can result in running interest payments and reducing the interest payments that are normally made to the credit card company. The refinancing can be applied to large purchases which can be difficult to pay within a credit card grace period. The introduction page <b>131</b> can include a description of the refinancing program sign up process <b>133</b> which can include: approval, credit card connection and transferring a purchase balance. For approval, the client can sign in with a checking account to get approval for the refinancing. Once the approval has been authorized, the system can connect to credit cards to see which eligible credit card transactions can be applied to the refinancing program. Once the client selects an eligible credit card transaction, the purchase can be transferred to the inventive system and the client can pay for the transaction with a flat interest rate that can be substantially lower than the fees associated with the credit card which can include revolving fees and interest. The refinancing can provide a substantial financial savings and/or an improved ease of use and/or an improved ease of understanding of the refinancing terms to the refinancing program clients. If the client wishes to proceed with the approval process, the &#x201c;get started&#x201d; button <b>135</b> can be actuated.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in an embodiment the refinance program approval process can include inputting a client's checking account information. In the illustrated example, the user interface <b>141</b> can display a listing of possible banks <b>143</b>. The client can click on the client's bank from the list or input the name of the bank in the search box <b>145</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, once the client's bank has been identified and input, the system can display a bank sign-in screen user interface <b>151</b>. The client can sign into the bank by inputting a client username <b>153</b> and a password <b>155</b> for the bank and then clicking on the submit button <b>157</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, if an error has been made with the client name or password, the user interface can display an error message such as, &#x201c;Sign in details invalid. Please try again&#x201d; <b>159</b>. The client can respond by inputting the client username <b>153</b> and password <b>155</b> again. If a maximum number of attempts have been input, the system can stop the client from further attempts to sign into the bank through the user interface <b>151</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, if there is a technical error in the bank sign-in, for example an error in the transmittal of information, the system can display a message informing the client of the error. In this example, the system has displayed the message, &#x201c;Oops! Our connection failed. Please try again&#x201d; <b>152</b>. The client can then check to make sure that the device has an active connection through Wi-Fi or cellular service. Once the client connection is confirmed or reestablished, the client can resubmit the client name <b>153</b> and password <b>155</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, if there is an error at the bank that prevents communications, the system can inform the client. In this example, the system can display the message, &#x201c;The bank is not reachable. Try another bank&#x201d; <b>154</b>. The client can then click on the &#x201c;Go Back&#x201d; button <b>156</b> which can cause the user interface to go back to the previously displayed user interface page. In this example going back can allow a user to select an alternative bank through the user interface illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> for the program approval process. If assistance is needed, the client can click on the &#x201c;Need Help?&#x201d; button <b>158</b>. In response to actuating the &#x201c;Need Help?&#x201d; button <b>158</b>, customer assistance can be provided. If the client is using a smart phone or computer, the customer assistance take the form of live chat, a phone contact by a customer service representative, a text message or other mobile messaging program contact, an email, a link to a FAQ help site, a searchable help index, or any other suitable form of assistance. The &#x201c;Go Back&#x201d; button <b>156</b> and the &#x201c;Need Help?&#x201d; button <b>158</b> are illustrated in other figures in this application.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, a multi-factor authentication may be used to perform the bank sign in process. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>D</figref>, the system and/or bank may ask the client one or more security questions that the client will need to answer correctly to proceed through the bank sign in process through a user interface <b>151</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, in an embodiment the answers to the security questions can be input, through typed text in the answer input areas <b>153</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, in an embodiment a plurality of security question answers can each be associated with a different answer button <b>155</b> that can be selected by the client. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, the security question answers can alternatively be input through a pull down menu with answer choices in an answer input area <b>155</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref>, in an embodiment a plurality of security question answers can each be associated with a different answer button <b>159</b> that can be selected by the client.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The user can submit the input security answers described above by clicking the submit button <b>155</b>. If the answer to the security question is incorrect, the system may inform the client that the answer does not match the bank stored answer. The system can then ask the client to answer another security question. If the follow up answer is correct, the system can proceed to complete the approval process. If the follow up answer is incorrect, the system can inform the client of the error and either provide additional security questions or stop the approval process.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref>, in other embodiments, a bank may require a Token ID. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, the system user interface <b>161</b> asks for a Security Key and provides an input for Token ID and the user can type the Token ID in the Token ID space <b>163</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>, the user interface asks the client to enter a Code in an Image: with an input for the Token ID (like a CAPTCHA) to assist in preventing robots from entering the system. Once the client has input the Token ID, the client can click the SUBMIT button <b>167</b>. The system can process the client input and if the submitted. Token ID is correct, the system can continue the approval process. The Token ID can be a 2-factor authentication device such as a set of printed codes, a code generator, or other method of 2-factor authentication such as sending codes via emails or phone messages (either text or voice), mobile messaging app messages, Facebook messages, or any other sort of message.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Once the system has access to a client's bank account, the system can analyze the client's bank information. The bank access can determine the presence of the client's financial assets and verify the identification of the client. In an embodiment the quantity of assets can indicate the credit worthiness of the refinance applicant. Thus, a client who has more money in a hank account may be given a larger cash value refinance offer than a client who has very little money in a bank account that was used for the sign in. The connection to the bank can be secure, transparent and flexible. In an embodiment, the process can utilize an Internet finance service such as Yodlee to access the client's bank information.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">If there is a minimum predetermined assets such as $500 and a history of regular transfers of funds into and from this account, the system can be approved for refinancing based upon the checking account information. In other embodiments, the system can also require a minimum credit report score. For example, the system may obtain a FICO credit report for the client who is applying for the refinancing program. The FICO score can determine if a client is eligible for the refinance program. In an embodiment, a minimum credit score that will be eligible for the refinance program can be 550. Thus, if a client has less than $500 in a checking account with less than 2 transactions in the last 30 days and/or a FICO score of less than 550, this client may not be eligible for the refinance program and will be informed to either provide information for a different bank or that the client is not eligible for the refinance program.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">If the user has a FICO score of more than 550 the inventive system can determine the refinancing term limitations of a refinancing offer. The lower range of the refinancing offer can be set to a fixed value. For example, a minimum transaction amount can be $50. The administration costs for refinancing of purchases below $50 might be greater than the interest revenues for this offer and therefore smaller value refinancing can be cost prohibitive. In other embodiments, the lower refinancing offer limit can be any other low monetary value such as $20 to $100.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In an embodiment, the system can provide a range of upper limits for purchase refinancing and the upper monetary value of the refinancing offer can depend upon or be proportional to the user's FICO score. Thus, a first user with a higher FICO score can be given a larger refinance value offer than a second user with a lower FICO score. An upper credit limit for a user transaction refinancing for a user having a credit score that is above a super prime loan rating (FICO above 680) can extend up the maximum value allowed by the system. For example, the upper limit for refinancing can go up to $10,000. Thus, if a user has a FICO score of 680 or more and wishes to refinance purchases between $50 and $10,000 the system can authorize this refinancing. If the user's FICO score is lower, the upper limit of the refinancing offer can be lower. For example, a middle refinance range can be offered to primer users with a FICO score between 620-680. in an embodiment the prime FICO score user can be authorized to refinance purchases valued between about $50-$3,000. A subprime user with a low FICO score for example below 620 can be authorized by the system to refinance purchases valued between $50-$500. These FICO score ranges and corresponding refinance value offer ranges can be stored on a lookup table based on the memory or system database of the system server.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although this example shows three different refinance ranges associated with three different ranges of FICO scores, in other embodiments, there can be more refinancing value ranges which can be offered based upon smaller or different ranges of FICO scores or any other consumer credit risk rating scales or systems. In other embodiments, refinance offer value ranges can be fine tuned with transaction information, such as the item, the salary and expense history of a user, etc.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In other embodiments various other methods can be used to determine if a client is eligible for refinancing of eligible purchases. For example, a method for determining credit worthiness is disclosed by co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/917,156, &#x201c;System And Method Of Transacting&#x201d; filed Dec. 17, 2013 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In these embodiments, the refinance credit worthiness can be determined by a client identity, purchasing history, a merchant, a product SKU and possibly other factors. However, because this information can be less reliable than a FICO score, these methods may only be used for refinancing lower value eligible prior purchases.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Based upon the client's bank account information and credit score, the system can approve or reject the client's approval request for refinancing. The system can respond to a client's approval request by: 1) approving a client for the refinance program, 2) requesting more information from the client or 3) not approving the client for the refinance program, or 4) interning the client that he or she is not eligible for the refinance program. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the user interface <b>171</b> can display a message indicating that the client has been approved for the refinancing feature <b>173</b>. The system can also display a button asking the client to link credit cards to the system <b>175</b> so that individual transactions can be reviewed for refinancing.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, if more information is needed for approval, the system can ask the client for more information through a user interface <b>181</b>. In some cases, the bank account information initially provided by the client system may be insufficient for approval. For example, if there are insufficient funds, the system can ask for account information from a different bank. The described above can be repeated with the user clicking the &#x201c;connect another bank account&#x201d; button <b>183</b> to link a new bank account to the system.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some cases, the system may not be able to provide refinancing services. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, if the client has been rejected, the system can display a message informing the client that the system cannot approve the client at this time <b>185</b>. This can occur if there is information that can indicate that the applicant is not a good credit risk. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, in some situations the client may not be eligible for the refinance program. For example, in an embodiment the applicant may be too young in age to be eligible. The system may determine that the applicant is below the age of 21 and would therefore not be approved for a credit card unless a parent or guardian co-signs for the credit card. In these situations, the system may inform the client that he or she is not eligible for the refinance feature at the time of the application with a message that informs the user that he or she is not eligible, but check back later <b>189</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, once the client has been approved, the system's user interface <b>191</b> can ask the client to link credit cards to the refinance program and the client can input the bank that issued the client's credit card in an issuing bank input <b>193</b>. In this example, the user interface displays a list of credit card providers. The client can click on the provider associated with the client's credit card.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the user interface <b>191</b> can display a credit card sign in screen. The client can input the client name in a username input space <b>195</b> and a password in a password input space <b>197</b> that are associated with the credit card. The user can then click on the submit button <b>199</b>. The system can process this information and if the information matches the user's account send a confirmation message that the client name and password are correct and then link the credit card to the refinance program.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, a multi-factor authentication may be required by the system to link credit cards. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, a multi factor authentication may require the client to answer one or more security questions. In the illustrated example, the user interface <b>201</b> can display a first security question <b>203</b> and a second security question <b>207</b>. The user can input the answer to the first security question in the first answer input space <b>205</b> and the answer to the second security question in the second answer input space <b>209</b>. The user can then click on the submit button <b>208</b>. The system can process this information and if the input information is correct, the system can then confirm that the answer(s) to the security question(s) are correct and then link the credit card to the refinance program.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, if the credit card information is correct, the system can display a message <b>211</b> informing the client that the credit card has been linked to the refinance program. With the linked credit card, the system can access the client's current credit card transactions to determine transactions that are eligible for refinancing. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, if any errors were made during the linking the credit card, the system can display a message <b>213</b> informing the client that an error occurred and that the system was not able to connect to the credit card. The system can ask the client to try to connect to the credit card account again and repeat the described process when the &#x201c;Try Again&#x201d; button <b>215</b> is clicked by the user.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition to determining if a client is eligible for the refinancing program, the credit score information can also be used to determine the refinance terms that can be offered to the client. A client with a higher credit score can be offered refinancing for larger purchases than a client with a lower credit score. For example, in an embodiment the system may offer refinancing of: up to $10,000 for a client having a FICO credit report score of about 740 or above, up to $7,000 for a client having a FICO score of between 641-739 and up to $3,000 for a client having a FICO score of between 600-640. There can also be minimum refinancing requirements. For example, the system may not allow a client to refinance a purchase of less than $200. The examples given are for the US market. Amounts for international markets may vary. In other embodiments, there can be more and other dollar amounts and ranges based upon the credit scores and bank account (such as checking account) information that can be used to determine the refinancing terms to be offered for refinancing eligible prior purchases.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, the system can inform the client of the transactions that are eligible for refinancing by displaying a message for the user. In this example, the displayed message <b>217</b> informs the client one recent &#x201c;eligible&#x201d; credit card purchase with a purchase price of $200 to $3,000 is eligible for refinancing. The system can also inform the client that eligible purchases are purchases made within a cost range of $200 to $3,000 and time limit of the last 30 days that are not taxes, payments or similar finance transactions. All purchases that meet the eligible refinance terms are &#x201c;eligible purchases&#x201d; and all purchases that do not meet the eligible purchase terms are &#x201c;ineligible&#x201d; purchases. Once the client understands the purchases that are eligible, the client can click the continue button <b>219</b> to continue with the refinancing process.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, the system user interface can display one or more eligible purchases made with the linked credit card(s) on the user interface. The eligible purchases can be individually displayed with each eligible purchase having a button that allows the client to select the transaction for refinancing. In the illustrated example, the eligible purchases include: 1) a $810.32 purchase made on September 17 from Casper <b>221</b>, 2) a $482.67 purchase made on September 23 from Amazon <b>223</b>, and 3) a $247.51 purchase made on September 22, from Sears <b>225</b>. All of these eligible purchases are made within the last 30 days, are for purchases within the $20-$3,000 range and are not for taxes, payments or similar finance transactions. In the illustrated example, the client would be able to select any single purchase for refinancing. In an embodiment, the user can click on the Transfer button <b>227</b> to proceed with the refinancing of the selected transaction.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In other embodiments, the system may not restrict refinancing to a single purchase. For example, the system may allow the client to refinance multiple eligible purchases if the cumulative refinancing is within the refinance terms. In the illustrated example, the client may be able to refinance all throe of the eligible purchases $810.32+$482.67+$247.51=$1,540.50 because the cumulative value is within the refinance terms. In an embodiment, the user can click on multiple Transfer buttons <b>227</b> to proceed with the refinancing of the user-selected transactions.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The system may also display one or more purchases that are not eligible for refinancing. In this example, the system displays a $546.28 payment on September 17 to Chase Payment <b>229</b>. In an embodiment, the user can ask for a reevaluation of the transaction's eligibility for refinancing. The system displays the text, &#x201c;Should this be eligible?&#x201d; and the user can click on the &#x201c;Let us know&#x201d; button <b>231</b> to initiate a reevaluation process through Which the client can inform the system why the transaction should be an eligible purchase.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this example, all of the eligible and non-eligible purchases are from a single credit card &#x201c;Visa ****1234.&#x201d; However, in other embodiments, if multiple credit cards are linked to the system, purchases from all of the credit cards can be displayed on the eligible transactions page of the user interface.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, in some situations, the client may not have any eligible purchases. The system may display a message informing the client that there are not any eligible purchases right now <b>233</b>. The system can display a link &#x201c;Learn More&#x201d; button <b>235</b> which can be clicked so that the system will provide more information about the rules distinguishing eligible and ineligible purchases.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The system can use a machine analysis to determine if a purchase is eligible or ineligible. In some cases, the system may accidentally categorize a purchase as not being eligible when the purchase should have been eligible for refinancing. The system may display a button that can allow a client to inform the system that a purchase should be eligible. In this example, if the client clicks on a &#x201c;Let us know&#x201d; button <b>231</b>, the client can inform the system why the transaction should be an eligible purchase. In other embodiments, the user can click a &#x201c;Request financing&#x201d; button to initiate the eligibility analysis.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some cases, the system may have misinterpreted client transactions and classified the transactions into an ineligible category. For example, the system may have accidentally interpreted as a client purchase as a payment for another client credit card (for example an Amazon credit card payment) when the purchase was made for purchasing goods (through Amazon). The system or a system administrator can review the client's request and either agree or disagree with the client's classification of the transaction. Once the client submits the eligibility information, the system can display a receipt confirmation message.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, an example of a system message is illustrated. In this example, the system sends a message to the client that thanks the client for letting the system know and informs the client that an email notification will be sent if the eligibility status of the purchase is updated <b>241</b>. If the system agrees with the client, the purchase can be moved to the eligible purchase section so that the client for refinancing can select the purchase.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the illustrated example, the client can select one eligible purchase for refinancing. However, in other embodiments, the system may allow the client to select multiple purchases. The same rules for eligible purchases may be applicable. For example, multiple eligible purchases can be selected for refinancing as long as the cumulative selected purchases are within the eligibility limitations discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some cases there can be connection errors with the credit card information. For example with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, if the Bank Login expires, the system can display a message that informs the client, &#x201c;Your card ending ***1234 got disconnected. Please login again to see eligible purchases&#x201d; <b>243</b>. The system can display a &#x201c;connect card again&#x201d; button <b>245</b> and a &#x201c;cancel&#x201d; button <b>247</b>. Clicking the connect card again button <b>245</b> will cause the system to attempt to login again to the credit card while clicking the cancel button <b>247</b> will cause the system to cancel the connection with the credit card. If the client has linked multiple credit cards and all of the corresponding bank logins expire at the same time, the system can interpret this as a connection error. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, the system can display a disconnection error message to the client. In this example, the system displays the message, &#x201c;Sorry, your connected card got disconnected. Please log in again to see eligible purchases&#x201d; <b>251</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Once the client selects an eligible purchase for refinancing, the system can then provide refinancing terms to the client. In some embodiments, the system may display a plurality of repayment options with different durations. For example, a client may be able to select the duration of the repayment from a few months to a few years. The system may display the interest rate as an annual percentage rate (APR) and the monthly payments required by each repayment option. For example, if the client selects the $810.32 purchase for refinancing the repayment options for can be illustrated in Table 1 below. In an embodiment, the durations and interest rates being offered for repayment can be based upon the credit worthiness of the client. A client with a poor credit score may be offered shorter repayment durations and higher interest rates than a client with good credit score.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Interest </entry><entry>Monthly </entry><entry>Total </entry></row><row><entry>Option</entry><entry>Duration</entry><entry>(APR)</entry><entry>Payment</entry><entry>Payments</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="14pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1</entry><entry>6 </entry><entry>months</entry><entry>6%</entry><entry>$137.43&#x2002;</entry><entry>$824.58</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>1 </entry><entry>year</entry><entry>7%</entry><entry>$70.11</entry><entry>$841.32</entry></row><row><entry>3</entry><entry>1.5 </entry><entry>years</entry><entry>8%</entry><entry>$47.92</entry><entry>$862.56</entry></row><row><entry>4</entry><entry>2 </entry><entry>years</entry><entry>9%</entry><entry>$37.02</entry><entry>$888.48</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">In other embodiments, the interest rates and upper limit refinancing offered can be based upon historical and/or statistical model repayment information rather than the user FICO scores. If there is a high correlation between predicting the likelihood of repayment and user information, the system can utilize this user information to set the interest rates and the upper limit of the refinancing offered.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">Once the client has selected the repayment plan and agreed to the terms of the repayment plan, the system can pay the balance for the selected eligible purchase to the credit card company and can require monthly payments to be paid from the client to the refinance service provider. Various other methods can be used to allow a client to select a payment plan that best suits the client's needs. In other embodiments the system may offer the client a custom repayment plan that can be configured by the client as discussed in co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/992,984, &#x201c;Tools For Purchasing Transactions&#x201d; filed May 14, 2014 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">In an embodiment the client can electronically withdraw the monthly payments from the client's bank checking account when they are due for the duration of the loan. In other embodiments, the client can mail physical checks to pay the monthly amount  due. When the payments are complete, the client can discontinue to make payments to the refinance service provider.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">In an embodiment, the completion of the repayment of the loan can allow the client to refinance another purchase using the same described system. However, in other embodiments, the system may allow for refinancing of other eligible purchases before the repayment of the first loan has been completed.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">A problem with credit cards is that once a credit card holder does not pay the entire balance within the grace period, all purchases from the expiration of the grace period will be charged interest. This type of debt can become &#x201c;revolving credit&#x201d; which can have a very high interest rate, such as an APR of 12-23%. In addition, the actual interest being charged by a credit card issuer can be compounded daily and therefore the effective interest rate can be significantly higher. The present invention can prevent the client from transitioning into having to pay credit card interest by allowing the client to pay off the entire balance when a large purchase is necessary. As discussed, the system can pay a portion of the credit card so that the user can pay off the remainder of the balance. Because the credit card balance has been paid, the credit card interest is not charged to the client. Although the system is loaning the client money for repayment of the eligible purchase, the client will effectively be paying less out of pocket than if the client did not refinance the purchase.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">In an embodiment, the system may be able to make recommendations to the client. For example, when the system accesses the user's credit card information, the system can see a 90-day history of the client transactions. The system can then analyze all of the purchases that were made that are being charged revolving credit card interest and based upon this information the system can determine or calculate the amount of money that the client has spent or will spend on credit card interest before the prior purchases are paid off. In an embodiment, the system can then display an objective comparison of how much money the client would save by utilizing the refinancing program for any of the purchases through a user interface. The display of this information can be in the form of a recommendation based upon the amount of money that can be saved by refinancing. For example, the system may display a message stating, &#x201c;Based upon a 90-day past history analysis of your credit card activity, we recommend refinancing the Sep. 17, 2014, $810.32 eligible prior purchase from Casper using your Visa ****1234 card.&#x201d; If the entire credit card balance is not paid by Oct. 2, 2014, the client will be paying 23% interest on any remaining balance. If the client only makes the minimum payments, for example, $15 per month for this purchase, it will take 8.2 years to pay for this purchase with a total interest charge of $8853.76. In an embodiment, the system can make a direct comparison of the difference between refinancing and not refinancing. With reference to Table 2 below, the monthly payments for an $810.32 purchase are calculated based upon an interest rate of 23% or whatever interest the credit card is actually charging the client. The system can utilize the same durations and then calculate the total (or monthly) savings that would be achieved by refinancing the purchase. Based upon this information, the client can make an informed decision about refinancing eligible prior purchases.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Interest</entry><entry>Monthly</entry><entry>Total</entry><entry>Refinance</entry></row><row><entry>Option</entry><entry>Duration</entry><entry>(APR)</entry><entry>Payment</entry><entry>Payments</entry><entry>Savings</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1</entry><entry>6 </entry><entry>months</entry><entry>23%</entry><entry>$144.19&#x2002;</entry><entry>$865.14</entry><entry>&#x2002;$40.56</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>1 </entry><entry>year</entry><entry>23%</entry><entry>$76.20</entry><entry>$914.40</entry><entry>&#x2002;$73.08</entry></row><row><entry>3</entry><entry>1.5 </entry><entry>years</entry><entry>23%</entry><entry>$53.63</entry><entry>$965.34</entry><entry>$102.78</entry></row><row><entry>4</entry><entry>2 </entry><entry>years</entry><entry>23%</entry><entry>$42.42</entry><entry>$1,018&#x2003;&#x2002;&#x2009;</entry><entry>$129.60</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0083" num="0080">The examples and illustrations included herein show, by way of illustration and not of limitation, specific embodiments in which the subject matter may be practiced.
