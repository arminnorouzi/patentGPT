In the step of folding the lateral walls upwards relative to the bottom wall, in the lateral walls themselves wrinkled zones are created, suitable for compensating for the smaller extent of the surface caused by the folding (the area of the lateral walls is less than that of the main annular portion). In many applications, the main annular portion is surrounded by a further secondary annular portion suitable for constituting the perimetric flange of the tray, which extends outwards starting from the upper edge of the lateral walls. Since the perimetric flange also extends in plan view less than the secondary annular portion from which it is obtained, the wrinkled zones also continue on the annular flange. An example of a container according to the first type is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In contrast, in the second known type the tray comprises a main panel, and a plurality of secondary panels which extend outwards from the main panel. The main panel is the one which in the tray is positioned at the bottom wall, whilst the secondary panels are those which are positioned at the lateral walls. Depending on the embodiments, the secondary panels may or may not comprise outer projections intended to form the upper flange.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Unlike those of the first type described above, the trays of the second type do not usually have wrinkled zones, and the lateral walls or the perimetric flange are made to extend with a degree of continuity exclusively by attempting to bring the edges of the adjacent panels as close to each other as possible before applying the layer of thermoplastic material. Examples of containers which use trays of the second type are described in the following documents: U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,358,900, 3,489,331, 4,046,310, FR 2406522, U.S. Pat. No. 5,253,801, FR 2826938, FR 2933329, WO 2012/049005 and WO 2018/017783.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the third known type the tray again comprises a main panel, and a plurality of secondary panels which extend from the main panel. In this case the main panel is that which in the tray is positioned at the upper flange and is constituted of a frame without interruptions, whilst the secondary panels define the lateral walls and the bottom wall. Some examples of containers of the third type are described in patent application EP 3693284 A1, others, characterised by the use of two separate pieces of material for making the tray, are described in patent application WO 99/67143.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Irrespective of the type of container, the method for making it involves first forming of the tray starting from the paper and cardboard industry article from which it must be obtained. In the most widespread applications, this result is achieved by positioning the paper and cardboard industry article over a suitably shaped mould, and pushing the paper and cardboard industry article into the mould by means of a suitable punch. The action of the punch causes folding of the various panels in the case of containers of the second and third type described above, whilst it causes forming by shaping of the single panel and forming of the wrinkled zones, in the case of the containers of the first type described above.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Then the tray is inserted in a thermoforming mould and the layer of thermoplastic material is thermoformed on the tray. For that purpose, a sheet of thermoplastic material is positioned over the tray and in contact with its flange, after which the mould is closed securely clamping, between the two movable parts of the mould, both the flange of the tray and the sheet of thermoplastic material. The sheet is then heated and, by means of a vacuum between the sheet of thermoplastic material and the tray or an overpressure on the opposite side, is made to stick to the lateral walls and to the bottom wall of the tray. In contrast, at the flange, sticking of the heated sheet to the tray is obtained thanks to the mechanical pressure applied by the mould. However all of the known types of containers have several major disadvantages.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In fact, the containers for which this invention is intended are usually intended to allow the packaging of food products in a controlled atmosphere by sealing a protective film to the layer of thermoplastic material, containing the food product between them. With all of the types of containers the sealing usually takes place at the perimetric flange, even if in some cases it may also extend on the rest of the free surface of the container (known as Skin packaging). Regarding the containers of the first and of the second type, over the years it has been possible to ascertain that the presence of the tray at the perimetric flange, although desirable in order to guarantee container mechanical stiffness, makes the operations for sealing the upper protective film very critical. In fact at, respectively, the wrinkled zones or the discontinuity zones of the flange of the tray, the sealing may in many cases be either ineffective (that is to say, leaving small gaps for the passage of air) or in any case weak (that is to say, such that it easily yields as a result of handling by users).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">This problem is particularly felt with containers of the first type where the wrinkled zones are constituted of a sequence of protuberances and hollows very close together which cause a considerable variability in the thickness of the material of the flange extending over just a few millimetres.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Use of containers of the first type for packaging in a controlled atmosphere therefore never really caught on, on the market. Containers of this type are therefore mainly used for other applications in which the upper sealing is not required.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a different way, containers of the second and of the third type have the shared disadvantage of some degree of construction complication regarding the tray, which negatively impacts production costs, compared with those of the first type.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this context the technical purpose which forms the basis of this invention is to provide a method and an apparatus for making a container comprising a tray internally covered with a layer of thermoplastic material which overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In particular the technical purpose of this invention is to provide a method and an apparatus for making a container comprising a tray internally covered with a layer of thermoplastic material, which allow a container to be obtained whose performance is similar to that of the best prior art containers, but at a cost comparable to that of the least expensive containers.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The technical purpose specified and the aims indicated are substantially achieved by a method and an apparatus for making a container comprising a tray internally covered with a layer of thermoplastic material, as described in the appended independent claims. Particularly preferred embodiments are described in the appended dependent claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further features and the advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the detailed description of several preferred, non-limiting embodiments of a method and an apparatus for making a container comprising a tray internally covered with a layer of thermoplastic material, illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a top view of an example of a tray usable in the context of the method according to this invention;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side view of the tray of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a front view vertical section of an apparatus according to this invention during a first operating step;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an enlarged view of the detail IV-IV of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> during a subsequent second operating step;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an enlarged view of the detail VI-VI of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> during a subsequent third operating step;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an enlarged view of the detail VIII-VIII of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> during a subsequent fourth operating step;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an enlarged view of the detail X-X of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> during a subsequent fifth operating step;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is an enlarged view of the detail XII-XII of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> during a subsequent sixth operating step; and</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is an enlarged view of the detail XIV-XIV of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>14</b></figref> the thick line represents the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b>; it should be noticed that the thickness shown in the figures is not the real thickness but is only intended to allow the film to be distinguished from the other lines in the drawing. In fact, the real thickness is much less.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The following is a description initially of the method according to this invention, and then of the apparatus. It should be noticed that the apparatus is capable of implementing the method according to this invention, and that what will be described relative, respectively, to the method and to the apparatus, shall be understood to also apply, if technically applicable, respectively to the apparatus and to the method.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the context of the following description, the terms &#x201c;mechanical&#x201d; and mechanically&#x201d;, combined with verbs such as press, retain or clamp, shall be understood in the sense that the actions indicated by those verbs are performed by mechanical devices which make physical contact with the parts on which those actions are applied.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Before going into the merit of the detailed description of this invention, it must be emphasised that it is based on the insight of being able to make containers of the first known type described above, in a way that is technically different from what has been done until now, which allows the containers made in this way to be used for optimum quality packaging in a controlled atmosphere. As described in more detail below, the innovative insight which forms the basis of this invention was that of using a completely new way of applying the layer of thermoplastic material to the upper flange of the tray, that is to say, using exclusively thermoforming, without applying any mechanical pressure on the layer of thermoplastic material at the upper flange of the tray.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The starting point for implementing the method according to this invention is therefore that of taking a tray <b>2</b> constituted of a single sheet of folded and shaped cellulose material (that is to say, similar to that of the known first type of containers described above), and in which wrinkled zones <b>3</b> are present which make it possible to compensate for the different extent that said sheet of cellulose material had before being shaped. In general the tray <b>2</b> comprises a bottom wall <b>4</b>, a lateral wall <b>5</b> which extends upwards from the bottom wall <b>4</b> and an annular flange <b>6</b> which extends outwards starting from an upper part of the lateral wall <b>5</b> as illustrated by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, in which the bottom wall <b>4</b> has a rectangular perimeter with rounded corners. As already indicated, the bottom wall <b>4</b>, the lateral wall <b>5</b> and the annular flange <b>6</b> are constituted of a single sheet of material, folded and shaped in such a way that the annular flange <b>6</b> and the lateral wall <b>5</b> have wrinkled zones <b>3</b>. As in the case of the tray <b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the wrinkled zones <b>3</b> originate at zones in which the perimeter of the bottom wall <b>4</b> extends in a way that is not straight. Returning to the method according to this invention, it comprises first a positioning step, in which the tray <b>2</b> is positioned in a thermoforming mould <b>7</b>. Advantageously, and in a known way, for that purpose use will be made of a thermoforming mould <b>7</b> suitably sized for the tray <b>2</b> of interest.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Preferably, use will be made of a mould which has a first peripheral portion <b>8</b> configured specifically to support from below the annular flange <b>6</b> of the tray <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Then, the method comprises a covering step during which a sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> is thermoformed on the tray <b>2</b> inside the thermoforming mould <b>7</b>. During the covering step the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> is made to stick to the bottom wall <b>4</b>, to the lateral wall <b>5</b> and to the annular flange <b>6</b> of the tray <b>2</b> forming the layer of thermoplastic material <b>9</b> which covers the inside of it (it should be noticed that in the context of this description the definition sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> is used to indicate the material before the thermoforming, whilst the definition layer of thermoplastic material <b>9</b> indicates the material thermoformed on the tray <b>2</b>). According to the main innovative aspect of this invention, the covering step is carried while preventing the thermoforming mould <b>7</b> from making contact with the layer of thermoplastic material <b>9</b> at least at the wrinkled zones <b>3</b> of the annular flange <b>6</b>. However, preferably, the covering step is carried out while preventing the thermoforming mould <b>7</b> from making contact with the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> at the entire annular flange <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In other words, unlike what has been known until now, in the method according to this invention the step of thermoforming the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> inside the tray <b>2</b> is carried out without mechanically clamping the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> on the flange of the tray <b>2</b>. Consequently any parts of the shaped mould facing the first peripheral portion <b>8</b> will always be kept at a distance from the latter which is greater than the sum of the maximum nominal thickness of the annular flange <b>6</b>, the thickness of the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> and a safety margin (advantageously greater than or equal to two tenths of a millimetre).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Therefore, according to this invention, in order to keep the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> correctly positioned during the covering step, the method requires the use of a sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> wider than the outer perimeter of the annular flange <b>6</b> of the tray <b>2</b>, and for this to be mechanically retained (for example by the mould), outside the zone affected by the thermoforming.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the preferred embodiments, during the covering step the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> is retained by the thermoforming mould <b>7</b> at a first zone <b>10</b> of the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b>, which is placed outside the zone of the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> which, during the covering step, is made to stick to the annular flange <b>6</b> (the latter, hereinafter, will be indicated as the second zone <b>11</b>).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> is constituted of a continuous sheet unwound from a roll.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, after the covering step, the method also comprises a cutting step in which the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> is cut at an edge zone <b>12</b> of it which is outside its second zone <b>11</b>, and inside the first zone <b>10</b> at which it is mechanically retained (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">If the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> is obtained from a continuous sheet unwound from a roll, the cutting step may be carried out either without interrupting the continuity of the continuous sheet, that is to say, by cutting out &#x201c;windows&#x201d; in the continuous sheet, or by severing the continuous sheet and obtaining a series of pieces.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thanks to the absence of mechanical clamping at the annular flange <b>6</b> of the tray <b>2</b>, at the wrinkled zones <b>3</b> of the annular flange <b>6</b> the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> is applied to the annular flange <b>6</b> in such a way that it remains resting on the crests formed by the material of the tray <b>2</b>, without those crests being crushed as in contrast occurs when sticking in the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> to the annular flange <b>6</b> of the tray <b>2</b> is obtained by means of mechanically clamping the two. In some embodiments at the end of the covering step the sticking of the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> to the flange of the tray <b>2</b> is only partial. In other embodiments in contrast it may be complete.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, once the tray <b>2</b> has been covered with the layer of thermoplastic material <b>9</b>, the container can be considered complete and ready for a future use. In fact, at the moment of use, once a product has been positioned inside the container, the latter can be sealed with an upper film, proceeding as described below.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In contrast, in other embodiments, the method requires the container to be completed by inserting the product in it and sealing it. In that case, after the covering step, the method comprises a positioning step during which the product to be packaged is positioned in the tray <b>2</b> internally covered with the layer of thermoplastic material <b>9</b>, in particular at the bottom wall <b>4</b>. Then the method comprises a sealing step during which a sealing film is positioned over the tray <b>2</b> and is fixed to the layer of thermoplastic material <b>9</b> at least at the annular flange <b>6</b> of the tray <b>2</b> (however, more extensive sticking in accordance with the Skin technique is possible). Advantageously fixing is achieved by heat-sealing the upper film to the layer of thermoplastic material <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">For that purpose, during the sealing step the sealing film is heated and mechanically pressed onto the layer of thermoplastic material <b>9</b> at the annular flange <b>6</b>. Preferably, at the same time the layer of thermoplastic material <b>9</b> is pressed onto the annular flange <b>6</b> of the tray <b>2</b>. In the preferred embodiments all of this is achieved by mechanically clamping together the annular flange <b>6</b>, the layer of thermoplastic material <b>9</b> and the upper film. If at the end of the covering step the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>9</b> does not completely stick to the annular flange <b>6</b> of the tray <b>2</b> at the wrinkled zones <b>3</b>, complete sticking is achieved as a result of the sealing step, carried out by mechanically clamping together the annular flange <b>6</b>, the layer of thermoplastic material <b>9</b> and the upper film.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Moving on to the apparatus <b>13</b> according to this invention, as already indicated above, it is configured to implement the method described so far.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The apparatus <b>13</b> comprises first a thermoforming mould <b>7</b> which includes a first part <b>14</b> and a second part <b>15</b>. At least one of either the first part <b>14</b> or the second part <b>15</b> is movable relative to the other between a home position and an operating position. When they are in the home position the first part <b>14</b> and the second part <b>15</b> are at a distance from each other and allow access to the inner part of the thermoforming mould <b>7</b>. When they are in the operating position, the first part <b>14</b> and the second part <b>15</b> are coupled to each other in a gas-tight way and the thermoforming mould <b>7</b> is closed.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The first part <b>14</b> defines a housing <b>16</b> configured to house a tray <b>2</b> of a predetermined type (which will have all of the characteristics indicated above which are required for execution of the method according to this invention), whilst the second part <b>15</b> constitutes a cover for the housing <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the first part <b>14</b> a first peripheral portion <b>8</b> is identifiable which is configured to support, in use, the annular flange <b>6</b> of the tray <b>2</b>. Therefore, the first peripheral portion <b>8</b> is placed substantially along the outline of the housing <b>16</b> for the tray <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">When the first part <b>14</b> and the second part <b>15</b> are in the operating position, identifiable in the second part <b>15</b> there is a second peripheral portion <b>17</b> which corresponds to the portion of the second part <b>15</b> which is facing the first peripheral portion <b>8</b> (in the embodiments in which the mould is positioned horizontally, the second peripheral portion <b>17</b> is the one vertically aligned with the first peripheral portion <b>8</b>).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to the main innovative aspect of this invention, when the first part <b>14</b> and the second part <b>15</b> are in the operating position, the second peripheral portion <b>17</b> is at a distance from the first peripheral portion <b>8</b> in such a way that it does not make contact with the layer of thermoplastic material <b>9</b>, once the latter has been applied to the tray <b>2</b> and is stuck to it, at least at the wrinkled zones <b>3</b> of the annular flange <b>6</b>, but preferably at the entire annular flange <b>6</b>. As explained above, in order to obtain that result the second peripheral portion <b>17</b> will always be kept at a distance from the first peripheral portion <b>8</b> which is greater than the sum of the maximum nominal thickness of the annular flange <b>6</b> of the tray <b>2</b> which the apparatus <b>13</b> is intended to process, the thickness of the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> and a safety margin (advantageously greater than or equal to two tenths of a millimetre). In other words, it will always be the case that between the first peripheral portion <b>8</b> and the second peripheral portion <b>17</b> there is always a distance such that in use there is always an empty space <b>22</b> present between the second peripheral portion <b>17</b> and the layer of thermoplastic material <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments the second peripheral portion <b>17</b> is fixed relative to the rest of the second part <b>15</b> of the thermoforming mould <b>7</b> and therefore cannot vary its distance from the first peripheral portion <b>8</b> when the first part <b>14</b> and the second part <b>15</b> are in the operating position.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In other embodiments, in contrast, the second peripheral portion <b>17</b> is movable relative to the rest of the second part <b>15</b> of the thermoforming mould <b>7</b>. In particular, when the second part <b>15</b> is in the operating position, the second peripheral portion <b>17</b> is movable, relative to the rest of the second part <b>15</b>, towards and away from the first part <b>14</b>. In more detail, the second peripheral portion <b>17</b> is movable between a distal position and a proximal position. When it is in the proximal position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>), the second peripheral portion <b>17</b> is closer to the first peripheral portion <b>8</b> than when it is in the distal position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments not illustrated, the shifting of the second peripheral portion <b>17</b> to the proximal position occurs before the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> is applied to the tray <b>2</b>; in that case, during the shifting of the second peripheral portion <b>17</b> from the distal position to the proximal position (with the first part <b>14</b> and the second part <b>15</b> in the operating position), the second peripheral portion <b>17</b> shifts the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> towards the first peripheral portion <b>8</b> but without making it make contact with it or with the tray <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In other embodiments, such as that illustrated in the accompanying figures, the shifting of the second peripheral portion <b>17</b> to the proximal position in contrast occurs after the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> has already been applied to the tray <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>); advantageously in fact in this case associated with the second peripheral portion <b>17</b> are the cutting means <b>18</b> for the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> which are described below, and the shifting serves to move the cutting means <b>18</b> towards the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b>. In general, advantageously, once the first part <b>14</b> and the second part <b>15</b> have moved from the home position to the operating position, the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> is clamped between the first part <b>14</b> and the second part <b>15</b>. In particular, the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> is clamped between a first clamping portion <b>19</b> fixed to the first part <b>14</b> and a second clamping portion <b>20</b> fixed to the second part <b>15</b>, where the first clamping portion <b>19</b> and the second clamping portion <b>20</b> are positioned outside, respectively, the first peripheral portion <b>8</b> and the second peripheral portion <b>17</b>, relative to the housing <b>16</b> defined by the first part <b>14</b> of the thermoforming mould <b>7</b>. By retaining the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> between them, the first clamping portion <b>19</b> and the second clamping portion <b>20</b> guarantee that the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> remains taut over the tray <b>2</b>, when the first part <b>14</b> and the second part <b>15</b> of the thermoforming mould <b>7</b> reach the operating position.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, the first clamping portion <b>19</b> and the second clamping portion <b>20</b> extend in an annular fashion around a central axis of the housing <b>16</b> (perpendicular to a central point of the bottom wall <b>4</b>), in such a way as to clamp the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> along a continuous perimeter.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In other embodiments, particularly suitable for the case in which the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> is obtained by unwinding a reel, the first clamping portion <b>19</b> and the second clamping portion <b>20</b> may comprise only respective upstream portions and downstream portions (and therefore not have an annular shape), which are positioned respectively upstream and downstream of the housing <b>16</b> relative to a direction of unwinding of the reel (for example one to the left and one to the right of the housing <b>16</b>, in the case of the mould illustrated in the accompanying figures considering that the direction of unwinding goes from left to right or vice versa).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The apparatus <b>13</b> also comprises positioning means (not illustrated) configured to position a sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> between the first part <b>14</b> and the second part <b>15</b>, when they are in the home position and to keep it in that position during the passage of the first part <b>14</b> and/or of the second part <b>15</b> from the home position to the operating position. In use, the passage of the first part <b>14</b> and/or of the second part <b>15</b> from the home position to the operating position, causes clamping of the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> between the first part <b>14</b> and the second part <b>15</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). In this condition it is possible that the second peripheral portion <b>17</b> is in contact with the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Advantageously, the means for positioning the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> may be made in a similar way to the retaining means commonly used in packaging machines for retaining a sealing film over a tray to be sealed.

Therefore, the cutting means <b>18</b> are positioned outside the first peripheral portion <b>8</b> and the second peripheral portion <b>17</b>, advantageously between the retaining means and the first peripheral portion <b>8</b> and the second peripheral portion <b>17</b>. Furthermore, when the first part <b>14</b> and the second part <b>15</b> are in the operating position, the cutting means <b>18</b> are switchable between an inactive configuration in which they are at a distance from the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>), and an active configuration in which in use they interfere with the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>), so that the switching of the cutting means <b>18</b> from the inactive configuration to the active configuration in use causes the cutting of the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Furthermore, the apparatus <b>13</b> comprises heating means (not illustrated since they are of the known type) for heating the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> which are configured to heat the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> when it is clamped between the first part <b>14</b> and the second part <b>15</b>, to bring it to the temperature necessary for its thermoforming on the tray <b>2</b>. In the preferred embodiment the heating means heat the entire second part <b>15</b> at its surface facing the housing <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Depending on the embodiments, the apparatus <b>13</b> may also comprise suction means (not illustrated since they are of the known type) which are associated with the first part <b>14</b> and/or blowing means (not illustrated since they are of the known type) which are associated with the second part <b>15</b> of the thermoforming mould <b>7</b>. The suction means are configured to create in use a vacuum between the heated sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> and the first part <b>14</b> of the thermoforming mould <b>7</b>; for that purpose they may comprise a suction unit and a plurality of ducts which connect the suction unit to a plurality of different points of the housing <b>16</b>. In turn, the blowing means are configured to feed pressurised air between the second part <b>15</b> and the heated sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b>; for that purpose, the blowing means may comprise an air pressurisation device connected by means of one or more ducts to the second part <b>15</b> over the housing <b>16</b>. Both the suction means and the blowing means are suitable for deforming the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> and making it stick to the bottom wall <b>4</b>, to the lateral wall <b>5</b> and to the annular flange <b>6</b> of the tray <b>2</b>, thereby making the layer of thermoplastic material <b>9</b> stuck to the tray <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the preferred embodiment illustrated in the accompanying figures, there are also auxiliary suction means present (not illustrated since they are of the known type) which are configured to create in use a vacuum between the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> not yet completely heated and the second part <b>15</b> of the thermoforming mould <b>7</b>, to make the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> stick to the second part <b>15</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) and to guarantee the heating of it necessary for the subsequent step of sticking to the tray <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>).

With the first part <b>14</b> and the second part <b>15</b> in the home position, a tray <b>2</b> is inserted in the housing <b>16</b> defined by the first part <b>14</b>, thereby implementing the positioning step.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Then the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> is positioned over the tray <b>2</b> between the first part <b>14</b> and the second part <b>15</b> and, advantageously, is held taut by the positioning means (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Subsequently, the first part <b>14</b> and the second part <b>15</b> are moved to the operating position; at the same time the retaining means lock the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>). The second peripheral portion <b>17</b> is in the distal position.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">After an initial heating of the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> by the heating means, a vacuum is created between the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> and the second part <b>15</b> of the thermoforming mould <b>7</b>, in such a way as to deform the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> making it stick to the second part <b>15</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The contact between the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b> and the second part <b>15</b> guarantees that the sheet is heated to the correct temperature for the subsequent step of actual thermoforming.

All of this takes place while preventing any contact between the mould, and in particular its second peripheral portion <b>17</b>, and the second zone <b>11</b> of the sheet of thermoplastic material <b>1</b>, that is to say, that applied to the flange of the tray <b>2</b> (either only at the wrinkled zones <b>3</b> or, preferably, at the entire annular flange <b>6</b>) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the embodiment illustrated in the accompanying figures, at that point the second peripheral portion <b>17</b> is brought into its proximal position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b></figref> and <b>12</b>).
