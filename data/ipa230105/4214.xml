More specifically, the technology relates to a head-mounted display apparatus that detects a change in position of the head-mounted display apparatus relative to a head, in particular an eyeball, an image display system including the head-mounted display apparatus, and an image display method of adjusting a projection position of image display light on the basis of the change in position of the head-mounted display apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Recently, a technique for displaying an image superimposed on an external landscape, such as an actual landscape, has drawn attention. The technique is also referred to as an augmented reality (AR) technique. An example product using the AR technique is a head-mounted display. The head-mounted display is worn on the head of a user when used. An image display method using the head-mounted display causes external light and light from the head-mounted display to reach the eyes of the use so that the user recognizes that an image formed by the light from the display is superimposed on an external image.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The head-mounted display projects image display light to the eyes of a user wearing the head-mounted display on the head. Unfortunately, the mounting position of the head-mounted display relative to the head sometimes deviates when the user moves the head, for example. Further, when the user wearing the head-mounted display apparatus moves (in particular, when the user exercises), the head-mounted display apparatus may deviate from the head due to its weight. Many head-mounted display apparatuses include a line-of-sight detection mechanism or a line-of-sight following mechanism for AR information, for example. In this case, the head-mounted display apparatus has a large weight, which is particularly likely to cause the deviation. As measures to address such a deviation, some techniques for detecting the mounting deviation and correcting a display image on the basis of image information on eyeballs have been proposed. For example, an image display unit disclosed in PTL 1 described below includes a calculation unit that calculates the amount of deviation of the position of the pupil of the observer's eye caused by the mounting deviation, and changes image light depending on the amount of deviation of the position of the pupil of the observer's eye.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="2">[PTL]</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0004">[PTL 1] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2017-135605</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The detection of the mounting deviation based on the image information on the eyeball sometimes fails to accurately measure the mounting deviation. For example, human biological changes and/or individual differences can hinder accurate measurement of the mounting deviation. Examples of the biological changes may include a change in size of the pupil, for example. Additionally, examples of the individual differences may include effects of hair and/or eyelashes on the image of the eyeball, the opening and closing frequency of an eyelid, or blocking of a pupil by blinking.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Measuring the mounting deviation accurately is particularly important for the head-mounted display apparatus of a retinal direct drawing scheme. The image displaying by the retinal direct drawing scheme needs to collect image display light at or near the pupil and determine an accurate position of the pupil. For example, when a pupil has a diameter of about 2 mm in a bright location, the position of the pupil needs to be determined with an accuracy of 1 mm or less. If the mounting deviation is not accurately determined, the head-mounted display apparatus finds it difficult to present an image to the user.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the technology

Second Embodiment (Image Display System)</heading><heading id="h-0013" level="2">3. Third Embodiment (Image Display Method)</heading><heading id="h-0014" level="1">1. First Embodiment (Head-Mounted Display Apparatus)</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0049">(1) Description of First Embodiment</p><p id="p-0042" num="0050">A head-mounted display apparatus according to the technology includes a sensor that detects a change in position of the head-mounted display apparatus relative to a head. For example, the sensor may detect the change in position of the head-mounted display apparatus relative to the head on the basis of a change in position of a portion where the sensor is provided relative to the position. The head-mounted display apparatus may change a projection position to which the head-mounted display apparatus projects image display light on the basis of the change in position detected by the sensor.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0051">Since the sensor detects the change in position of the head-mounted display apparatus relative to the head, the head-mounted display apparatus according to the technology makes it possible to accurately determine a mounting deviation of the head-mounted display apparatus. This allows the image display light to be projected to an appropriate position, improving accuracy in detecting a line of sight. Further, the determination of the mounting deviation according to the technology are not affected by or are less susceptible to human biological changes or individual differences.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0052">The sensor does not have to be a sensor that detects a reference axis of an eyeball of the user wearing the head-mounted display apparatus. The term &#x201c;reference axis of an eyeball&#x201d; used herein refers to a concept including a visual axis (also referred to as a line of sight), an optical axis, a pupil center axis, a line of fixation, a fixation line, and a line of aim. A technique has been known for detecting (or estimating) the line of sight among the reference axes of the eyeball. The detection of the change in position of the sensor does not have to be based on the detection of the reference axis of the eyeball nor the detection of the line of sight. It is to be noted that the phrase &#x201c;the sensor does not detect the reference axis&#x201d; does not mean that the head-mounted display apparatus should not include a line-of-sight detector. For example, the phrase means that the detection of the change in position of the sensor is performed independently from the line-of-sight detector.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0053">Additionally, the sensor does not have to use the image information on the eye of the user wearing the head-mounted display apparatus. The image information on the eye may be, for example, image information acquired by an imaging device or a photodiode.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0054">According to one embodiment of the technology, the sensor may be provided on a portion of the head-mounted display apparatus in contact with the head. In this embodiment, the sensor may detect a contact pressure of the portion on the head, for example.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0055">According to another embodiment of the technology, the sensor may be provided on a portion of the head-mounted display apparatus not in contact with the head. In this embodiment, the sensor may detect a change in position of the portion relative to a head reference position.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0056">Details of the sensor that may be used in these embodiments are described in (3) below.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0057">According to one embodiment of the technology, the head-mounted display apparatus may include image display unit. The image display unit may be configured to collect image display light at or near a pupil and irradiate the retina with the image display light to provide a Maxwellian view. To present the user an image in the Maxwellian view, the image display light needs to be collected at or near the pupil as described above. If the mounting deviation is not accurately determined, the image display light can be hindered from being collected at an appropriate position. The head-mounted display apparatus according to the technology makes it possible to accurately determine a mounting deviation, and is thus suitable for displaying an image in the Maxwellian view.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0058">A Maxwellian view optical system is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0059">Image display light projected from the image display unit <b>11</b> reaches an eye <b>13</b> through a hologram lens <b>12</b> in the Maxwellian view optical system, for example. The image display light is collected at or near the pupil, and incident on the retina. Using the Maxwellian view optical system, one dot of a display image (a minimum display unit) passes through one point on a crystalline lens. The image of one dot on the retina is unlikely to be affected by the condition of the crystalline lens. This allows even a user with myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism, for example, to recognize an image clearly. Additionally, a virtual image viewed as if being floating in the space is a focus free image. Thus, the virtual image comes into focus wherever the virtual image is located distant from the eye. Using the Maxwellian view optical system, the image display light may be collected at or near the pupil or at a position shifted from the pupil by about several millimeters to several ten millimeters (e.g., 1 mm to 20 mm, in particular, 2 mm to 15 mm) in the optical axis direction. It is possible to achieve the Maxwellian view even when the focus is not located on the pupil as in the latter case.

The imaging line-of-sight detector may include, for example, a combination of a light source and an imaging element.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0118">The light source is configured to emit light to the left eye. Preferably, the light source is an infrared light illumination source.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0119">The imaging element may be configured to, for example, acquire an image from which a reflected image of the light source on the eyeball (particularly the cornea) (a so-called Purkinje image) and the center of the pupil are retrieved. The imaging element may be, for example, an infrared light imaging element.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0120">The imaging line-of-sight detector may estimate the optical axis of an eyeball on the basis of the Purkinje image and the image described above.

The mounting deviation can result in a shift in the positional relationship, changing the position where the Purkinje image is generated. Additionally, the line-of-sight detection is likely to be susceptible to effects of blinking, hair, or eyelashes. Further, the line-of-sight detection generally involves calibration for correcting individual differences.

Accordingly, it is possible to perform the line-of-sight detection with high accuracy by preparing a correction value based on the mounting deviation in advance (e.g., storing the correction value in a storage) and performing correction using the correction value when the mounting deviation is generated, for example. Additionally, the mounting deviation detection is unlikely to be susceptible to effects of blinking, hair, or eyelashes. Further, it is also possible to reduce the number of executions of the calibration by performing the correction based on the detected mounting deviation.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0123">(2-4) Projection Position Adjustment Mechanism</p><p id="p-0116" num="0124">The head-mounted display apparatus <b>100</b> may further include projection position adjustment mechanisms <b>105</b>L-<b>1</b>, <b>105</b>L-<b>2</b>, <b>105</b>R-<b>1</b>, and <b>105</b>R-<b>2</b> that adjust a projection position of image display light outputted from the head-mounted display apparatus <b>100</b>.

That is, Steps S<b>103</b> and <b>104</b> may be performed while the image display unit is continuously projecting the image display light. This allows the projection position of the image display light to be adjusted on the basis of the change in position of the head-mounted display apparatus <b>100</b> relative to the head while images are presented to the user without any interruption. Accordingly, the user may recognize that the image is moving following the line of sight, for example.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0168">Alternatively, after the change in position is detected in Step S<b>103</b>, the presentation of the image by the image display unit may be temporary suspended. For example, when the change in position of the head-mounted display apparatus <b>100</b> relative to the head is large, the image may move outside the visual range of the user. In such a case, the image control unit <b>181</b> may stop presenting the image on the basis of the large change in position detected in Step S<b>103</b>, and restart the presentation of the image after the adjustment in Step S<b>104</b> is completed.
