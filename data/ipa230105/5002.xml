Meanwhile, the company <b>20</b> may support the frontline sponsor <b>10</b> by adding new recruits to their downline sponsor <b>30</b>, S<b>109</b>. The frontline sponsor <b>10</b> can obtain benefits from the company <b>20</b> based on the downline sponsor <b>30</b> who has been added by the company <b>20</b>. In other words, when the company <b>20</b> provides recruiting commissions to the frontline sponsor, the number of the downline sponsor includes one who is recruited by the company <b>20</b> as well as one who is recruited by the frontline sponsor <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">Likewise, when the company <b>20</b> provides the recruiting commission to the downline sponsor <b>30</b>, the number of the downline sponsor <b>30</b>, who is below the downline sponsor <b>30</b> whom the second recruiting commission is provided to, includes one who is recruited by the company <b>20</b> as well as one who is recruited by the downline sponsor <b>30</b> whom the recruiting commission is provided to. For example, when the downline sponsor <b>30</b>, who has been added by the company <b>20</b>, recruits another downline sponsor <b>30</b>, the frontline sponsor <b>10</b> also gains additional commissions from this.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">After enrolling the frontline sponsor, a new recruit becomes the downline sponsor <b>30</b> after signing up by purchasing products and making an agreement with the company <b>20</b>, S<b>111</b>. Specifically, the company <b>20</b> enrolls and places one or two downline sponsors <b>30</b>, who are recruited either by the company <b>20</b> or the frontline sponsor <b>10</b>, in a second level <b>2</b>L directly below the first level <b>1</b>L in the placement tree. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> together, the frontline sponsor <b>10</b> is positioned in the first level <b>1</b>L, and one downline sponsor <b>30</b> is positioned in the second level <b>2</b>L. This means that one downline sponsor <b>30</b> in the second level <b>2</b>L is directly below the frontline sponsor <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">In this instance, downline sponsor <b>30</b> may be recruited by either by the company <b>20</b> or the frontline sponsor <b>10</b>. The downline sponsor <b>30</b> is enrolled in the business by purchasing a product of the company <b>20</b> and making the agreement with the company <b>20</b> through a downline sponsor terminal <b>103</b> connectable to the main server <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">The present invention allows not only binary but also single or multiple recruiting system. In some embodiments, at least one position in a higher level has a single position in a lower level, that is immediately below the higher level, of the plurality of levels.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">Likewise, the company <b>20</b> enrolls and places at least one downline sponsor <b>30</b> in at least one level, such as a third level <b>3</b>L, a fourth level <b>3</b>L, a fifth level <b>5</b>L, and so on, under the second level <b>2</b>L in the placement tree. The downline sponsor <b>30</b> under the second level <b>2</b>L is recruited either by the company <b>20</b> or the downline sponsor <b>30</b> who is in a position directly above;</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">The downline sponsor <b>30</b> may sell products to customers S<b>113</b>, and recruit people as their downline sponsor S<b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">Then, the company <b>20</b> re-enrolls the frontline sponsor <b>10</b> as an avatar sponsor <b>10</b>A<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>A<b>2</b>, <b>10</b>A<b>3</b>, <b>10</b>A<b>4</b> and placing the avatar sponsor <b>10</b>A<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>A<b>2</b>, <b>10</b>A<b>3</b>, <b>10</b>A<b>4</b> in a position in any level under the first level <b>1</b>L in the placement tree S<b>119</b>. Specifically, as the number of downline sponsor <b>30</b> increases and reaches a certain level, the frontline sponsor <b>10</b> needs to re-enroll or sign up to the business as an avatar sponsor by purchasing products and making an agreement with the company <b>20</b>, S<b>119</b>. The avatar sponsor indicates the frontline sponsor <b>10</b> who re-enrolls as a downline sponsor under his or her own line. The frontline sponsor <b>10</b> has a responsibility to be the avatar sponsor at some certain points.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">In some embodiments, the plurality of levels in the placement tree includes a plurality of re-enrolling levels that the frontline sponsor <b>10</b> re-enrolls himself or herself as the avatar sponsor <b>10</b>A<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>A<b>2</b>, <b>10</b>A<b>3</b>, <b>10</b>A<b>4</b>. For example, the plurality of re-enrolling levels includes: a fifth level <b>5</b>L and levels for multiples of five, such as a tenth level <b>10</b>L, a fifteenth level, and a seventh level <b>7</b>L and levels for seven plus multiples of five, such as a twelfth level <b>12</b>L, a seventeenth level. While at least one downline sponsor <b>30</b> is filled in the second, the third, and the fourth level <b>2</b>L, <b>3</b>L, <b>4</b>L, the frontline sponsor <b>10</b> is required to re-enroll as the avatar sponsor <b>10</b>A<b>1</b> in the fifth level <b>5</b>L. The avatar sponsor system allows the frontline sponsor <b>10</b> to earn double additional commissions as well as the company <b>20</b> can make continuous and secure profits from periodical re-enrolling and purchase of the products by the frontline sponsor <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">The frontline sponsor <b>10</b> may have a responsibility of becoming an avatar sponsor <b>10</b>A<b>2</b> in a seventh level <b>7</b>L as well. In addition, the responsibility of becoming an avatar sponsor may be occurred every five levels from the fifth and the seventh level <b>5</b>L, <b>7</b>L. Thus, the responsibility of becoming an avatar sponsor <b>10</b>A<b>3</b>, <b>10</b>A<b>4</b> may be occurred in tenth and the twelfth level <b>10</b>L, <b>12</b>L. The requirements or levels that the responsibility of becoming an avatar sponsor is occurred may be various and not limited to the levels mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">Meanwhile, as the frontline sponsor <b>10</b> continues selling and recruiting S<b>123</b>, the company <b>20</b> provides a bonus to the frontline sponsor <b>10</b> based on at least one of: the number of the downline sponsor <b>30</b>, the levels placed by the downline sponsor <b>30</b>, the number of customers who purchases a product of the company <b>20</b> from the frontline sponsor <b>10</b>, and the number of the downline sponsor <b>30</b> who is recruited by the frontline sponsor <b>10</b>, S<b>121</b>.
