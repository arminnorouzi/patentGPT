The entire disclosure of the above-referenced application is incorporated herein by this reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to the field of eye tracking. In particular, the present disclosure relates to eye tracking systems and methods for validating detected blink.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In eye tracking applications, digital images are retrieved of the eyes of a user and the digital images are analysed in order to estimate the gaze direction of the user. The estimation of the gaze direction may be based on computer-based image analysis of features of the imaged eye.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One known example method of eye tracking includes the use of infrared light and an image sensor. The infrared light is directed towards the pupil of a user and the reflection of the light is captured by an image sensor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many eye tracking systems estimate gaze direction based on identification of a pupil position together with glints or corneal reflections. Therefore, accuracy in the estimation of gaze direction may depend upon an accuracy of the identification or detection of the pupil position and/or the corneal reflections. One or more spurious image features such as stray reflections may be present in the digital images which can detrimentally affect eye feature identification. For example, spurious image features can result in incorrect glint to illuminator matching and /or an incorrect pupil position, resulting in an erroneous gaze determination. It can be difficult to determine when such errors have occurred and eye tracking systems can get stuck in an erroneous tracking sequence.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Portable or wearable eye tracking devices have also been previously described. One such eye tracking system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,041,787 (which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). A wearable eye tracking device is described using illuminators and image sensors for determining gaze direction.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure there is provided an eye tracking system comprising a controller configured to: receive a blink-signal that represents whether or not a blink has been detected in a current-image; receive a quality-indicator that represents the quality of data in the current-image; and set a validated-blink-signal to a validated-blink-value if the blink-signal indicates that a blink has been detected and the quality-indicator is less than a validated-blink-threshold. Advantageously, such an eye tracking system does not validate any (unvalidated) blink detections that identified by the blink-signal that do not significantly affect the quality of the image (as defined by the quality-indicator). Therefore, validated blink detection only occurs when the detected blink has had a significant detrimental effect on the quality of the current-image. This enables improved performance of a downstream processing operation such as a gaze tracker, as discussed in detail below.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The quality-indicator may comprise a confidence-value associated with an output of a pupil detection algorithm that is applied to the current-image. The controller may be further configured to: set a quality-indicator-baseline based on the quality-indicator for one or more previous images; and set the validated-blink-threshold based on the quality-indicator-baseline. The controller may be further configured to set the quality-indicator-baseline based on the quality-indicator for one or more previous images for which the blink-signal indicates that a blink has not been detected. The controller may be further configured to set the quality-indicator-baseline based on the quality-indicator for one or more previous images for which: i) the blink-signal indicates that a blink has been detected, and ii) the quality-indicator is higher than a baseline-update-threshold.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The controller may be further configured to set the validated-blink-threshold as the higher of the quality-indicator-baseline minus a min_required_confidence_drop and a minimum-validated-blink-threshold-level. The min_required_confidence_drop may be a minimum drop in the quality-indicator below the quality-indicator-baseline that will result in the quality-indicator being considered too low (i.e. less than the validated-blink-threshold). The controller may be further configured to set the quality-indicator-baseline based on the quality-indicators of a plurality of previous images. The controller may be further configured to set the quality-indicator-baseline based on a filtered combination of the quality-indicators of the plurality of previous images.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The controller may be further configured to: determine if the blink-signal indicates that a blink has been detected; if the blink-signal indicates that a blink has been detected, then determine if the quality-indicator is less than the validated-blink-threshold; and if the quality-indicator is less than the validated-blink-threshold, then set the validated-blink-signal to the validated-blink-value. The controller may be further configured to set the validated-blink-signal to a no-blink-value if the blink-signal indicates that a blink has not been detected. The controller may be further configured to set the validated-blink-signal to the no-blink-value if the blink-signal indicates that a blink has not been detected, irrespective of whether or not the quality-indicator is greater than the validated-blink-threshold. The controller may be further configured to set the validated-blink-signal to the no-blink-value if the blink-signal indicates that a blink has not been detected or the quality-indicator is greater than the validated-blink-threshold.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The eye tracking system may further comprise: a gaze tracker that is configured to apply a gaze tracking algorithm, wherein the gaze tracker is configured to: for an image for which the associated validated-blink-signal does not have a validated-blink-value: apply the gaze tracking algorithm in order to provide an updated gaze-signal for the image; and for an image for which the associated validated-blink-signal does have a validated-blink-value: provide a gaze-signal for the image based on the gaze-signal for one or more previous images. The quality-indicator may comprise one or more of: a gaze-quality-parameter associated with a gaze-signal that is provided as an output of a gaze tracking algorithm that is applied to the current-image; a pupil-contrast-indicator that represents the contrast between the pupil and other features of the eye in the current-image; a confidence-value associated with a determined position of the cornea in the current-image; and a gaze-signal that is provided as an output of a gaze tracking algorithm that is applied to the current-image, for comparison with one or more validated-blink-thresholds to determine if the gaze-signal is out of bounds.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">There is also provided a head-mounted device comprising any eye tracking system disclosed herein. According to a further aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a method of operating an eye tracking system, the method comprising: receiving a blink-signal that represents whether or not a blink has been detected in a current-image; receiving a quality-indicator that represents the quality of data in the current-image; and setting a validated-blink-signal to a validated-blink-value if the blink-signal indicates that a blink has been detected and the quality-indicator is less than a validated-blink-threshold. According to a further aspect of the disclosure, there is provided one or more non-transitory computer-readable storage media storing computer-executable instructions that, when executed by a computing system, causes the computing system to perform any method disclosed herein.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">One or more embodiments will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic view of an eye tracking system which may be used to capture a sequence of images that can be used by example embodiments;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example image of a pair of eyes;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example of an eye tracking system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates schematically a process flow that can be performed by an eye tracking system of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a plot that will used to describe an example of how the validated-blink-threshold can be dynamically set;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows plots of the same signals that are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, and illustrates a gaze confidence drop after the blink detection in the (unvalidated) blink-signal;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows plots of the same signals that are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, and illustrates a gaze confidence drop for longer than the blink detection in the (unvalidated) blink-signal;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows plots of the same signals that are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, and illustrates a gaze confidence drop before the blink detection in the (unvalidated) blink-signal;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows plots of the same signals that are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, and illustrates a low gaze confidence baseline;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates an example algorithm of the present disclosure expressed as a state machine; and</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates the functionality of the state machine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> as a flow chart.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a simplified view of an eye tracking system <b>100</b> (which may also be referred to as a gaze tracking system) in a head-mounted device in the form of a virtual or augmented reality (VR or AR) device or VR or AR glasses or anything related, such as extended reality (XR) or mixed reality (MR) headsets. The system <b>100</b> comprises an image sensor <b>120</b> (e.g. a camera) for capturing images of the eyes of the user. The system may optionally include one or more illuminators <b>110</b>-<b>119</b> for illuminating the eyes of a user, which may for example be light emitting diodes emitting light in the infrared frequency band, or in the near infrared frequency band and which may be physically arranged in a variety of configurations. The image sensor <b>120</b> may for example be an image sensor of any type, such as a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor or a charged coupled device (CCD) image sensor.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The image sensor may consist of an integrated circuit containing an array of pixel sensors, each pixel containing a photodetector and an active amplifier. The image sensor may be capable of converting light into digital signals. In one or more examples, it could be an Infrared image sensor or IR image sensor, an RGB sensor, an RGBW sensor or an RGB or RGBW sensor with IR filter.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The eye tracking system <b>100</b> may comprise circuitry or one or more controllers <b>125</b>, for example including a receiver <b>126</b> and processing circuitry <b>127</b>, for receiving and processing the images captured by the image sensor <b>120</b>. The circuitry <b>125</b> may for example be connected to the image sensor <b>120</b> and the optional one or more illuminators <b>110</b>-<b>119</b> via a wired or a wireless connection and be co-located with the image sensor <b>120</b> and the one or more illuminators <b>110</b>-<b>119</b> or located at a distance, e.g. in a different device. In another example, the circuitry <b>125</b> may be provided in one or more stacked layers below the light sensitive surface of the light sensor <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The eye tracking system <b>100</b> may include a display (not shown) for presenting information and/or visual stimuli to the user. The display may comprise a VR display which presents imagery and substantially blocks the user's view of the real-world or an AR display which presents imagery that is to be perceived as overlaid over the user's view of the real-world.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The location of the image sensor <b>120</b> for one eye in such a system <b>100</b> is generally away from the line of sight for the user in order not to obscure the display for that eye. This configuration may be, for example, enabled by means of so-called hot mirrors which reflect a portion of the light and allows the rest of the light to pass, e.g. infrared light is reflected, and visible light is allowed to pass.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">While in the above example the images of the user's eye are captured by a head-mounted image sensor <b>120</b>, in other examples the images may be captured by an image sensor that is not head-mounted. Such a non-head-mounted system may be referred to as a remote system.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an eye tracking system, a gaze signal can be computed per each eye of the user (left and right). The quality of these gaze signals can be reduced by disturbances in the input images (such as image noise) and by incorrect algorithm behaviour (such as incorrect predictions). A goal of the eye tracking system is to deliver a gaze signal that is as good as possible, both in terms of accuracy (bias error) and precision (variance error). For many applications it can be sufficient to deliver only one gaze signal per time instance, rather than both the gaze of the left and right eyes individually. Further, the combined gaze signal can be provided in combination with the left and right signals. Such a gaze signal can be referred to as a combined gaze signal.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a simplified example of an image <b>229</b> of a pair of eyes, captured by an eye tracking system such as the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The image <b>229</b> can be considered as including a right-eye-image <b>228</b>, of a person's right eye, and a left-eye-image <b>234</b>, of the person's left eye. In this example the right-eye-image <b>228</b> and the left-eye-image <b>234</b> are both parts of a larger image of both of the person's eyes. In other examples, separate image sensors may be used to acquire the right-eye-image <b>228</b> and the left-eye-image <b>234</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The system may employ image processing (such as digital image processing) for extracting features in the image. The system may for example identify the location of the pupil <b>230</b>, <b>236</b> in the one or more images captured by the image sensor. The system may determine the location of the pupil <b>230</b>, <b>236</b> using a pupil detection process. The system may also identify corneal reflections <b>232</b>, <b>238</b> located in close proximity to the pupil <b>230</b>, <b>236</b>. The system may estimate a corneal centre or eye ball centre based on the corneal reflections <b>232</b>, <b>238</b>. For example, the system may match each of the individual corneal reflections <b>232</b>, <b>238</b> for each eye with a corresponding illuminator and determine the corneal centre of each eye based on the matching. The system can then determine a gaze ray (which may also be referred to as a gaze vector) for each eye including a position vector and a direction vector. The gaze ray may be based on a gaze origin and gaze direction which can be determined from the respective glint to illuminator matching/corneal centres and the determined pupil position. The gaze direction and gaze origin may themselves be separate vectors. The gaze rays for each eye may be combined to provide a combined gaze ray.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As mentioned above, any errors in glint to illuminator matching (which may simply be referred to as glint matching) or pupil position determination can result in an incorrect gaze determination. The results of glint matching and pupil detection can be considered as binary. For glint matching, either the glint matching is correct and a cornea position is determined that is good enough for accurate gaze computation, or it is incorrect which results in a cornea position that cannot be used to accurately map gaze. Similarly, for pupil detection, either the detected pupil is close enough for circle fitting to accurately identify a pupil, or it is incorrect such that the correct pupil cannot be identified and cannot be used to accurately map gaze. However, errors in determining these intermediate parameters can be difficult to detect. As a result, some systems can get stuck in an incorrect tracking regime and provide an insufficient gaze determination. This can be particularly detrimental for many eye tracking applications.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In particular, gaze estimation is often very unstable during blinking and squinting. This causes significant problems for foveated rendering, in which an image quality is reduced in the user's peripheral vision as determined by their calculated gaze. In the use case of foveated rendering, unstable gaze estimation will cause the foveation area to jump, causing noticeable graphic artifacts and a bad user experience. This can be mitigated by using a blink detector to lock the foveation area during a blink.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Blink detection can also be used within the application of social interactions in VR since it allows for a more complete visualization of the eyes of a virtual avatar.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In order to detect blinks fast enough for locking the foveation area, blink detectors can be tuned to be sensitive, but this can cause false blink detections due to semi-blinks, squinting or saccades. Any amount false positive blink detections are undesirable. In the use case that relates to foveated rendering, the foveation area can get locked where the user is not focusing thereby causing a bad user experience due to poor resolution or graphic artifacts. In the use case of visualising blinks on an avatar, a false blink detection will cause the avatar to blink even though the user is not.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example of an eye tracking system <b>339</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

The blink-signal <b>341</b> represents whether or not a blink has been detected in a current-image <b>347</b>. The current-image <b>347</b> is an image of an eye of a user, and can be considered as the most recently received image in a stream of images/frames. The blink-signal <b>341</b> in one implementation can take one of the following two values: TRUE, to indicate that a blink has been detected; and FALSE, to indicate that a blink has not been detected. In this example, the blink-signal <b>341</b> is provided as the output of a blink detector <b>342</b>. Any blink detector <b>342</b> that is known in the art can be used to provide the blink-signal <b>341</b> for the validated blink detector <b>340</b>. The blink detector <b>342</b> may or may not be considered to be part of the eye tracking system <b>339</b>. That is, in some examples the blink detector <b>342</b> can be provided separately from the eye tracking system <b>339</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The validated blink detector <b>340</b> also receives a quality-indicator <b>343</b> that represents the quality of data in the current-image <b>347</b>. As will be discussed in detail below, the quality-indicator <b>343</b> can represent the quality of data that can be extracted from the current-image <b>347</b>, such as a confidence-value associated with an output of a pupil detection algorithm that is applied to the current-image <b>347</b>. Beneficially the quality-indicator <b>343</b> can represent the quality of specific data in the current-image <b>347</b> that is expected to be affected by a blink. The output of a pupil detection algorithm is one example such specific data because the pupil will become gradually occluded by the blink and therefore will become undetectable.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The validated blink detector <b>340</b> can then set a validated-blink-signal <b>344</b> to a validated-blink-value (e.g. TRUE) if: i) the blink-signal <b>341</b> indicates that a blink has been detected; and ii) the quality-indicator <b>343</b> is less than a validated-blink-threshold. In this way, the validated-blink-signal <b>344</b> is only set as the validated-blink-value when the blink detector detects a blink (as represented by the blink-signal <b>341</b>) AND the quality-indicator <b>343</b> drops to a relatively low level. Therefore, any blink detections that are made by the blink detector <b>342</b> that do not significantly affect the quality of the image (as defined by the quality-indicator <b>343</b>) are not validated as blinks, such that the validated-blink-signal <b>344</b> is not set to a validated-blink-value. Therefore, the validated blink detection can be considered as providing a potentially delayed version of the blink detection that is performed by the blink detector <b>342</b>, such that the validated blink detection is only flagged when the detected blink has had a significant detrimental effect on the quality of the current-image <b>347</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the eye tracking system <b>339</b> also includes a gaze tracker <b>345</b>. The gaze tracker <b>345</b> can apply a gaze tracking algorithm to provide a gaze-signal <b>346</b> as an output, for example to estimate a gaze direction from an image of a user's eye. Gaze trackers <b>345</b> and gaze tracking algorithms are known in the art. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the gaze tracker <b>345</b> receives the validated-blink-signal <b>344</b> from the validated blink detector <b>340</b>. For a current-image <b>347</b> for which the associated validated-blink-signal <b>344</b> does not have a validated-blink-value: the gaze tracker <b>345</b> applies the gaze tracking algorithm in order to provide an updated gaze-signal <b>346</b> for the current-image <b>347</b>. For a current-image <b>347</b> for which the associated validated-blink-signal <b>344</b> does have a validated-blink-value: the gaze tracker <b>345</b> provides a gaze-signal <b>346</b> for the current-image <b>347</b> based on the gaze-signal for one or more previous images. In this way, the gaze-tracker <b>345</b> does not update the gaze-signal <b>345</b> for a current-image <b>347</b> that has a validated blink because there is a risk that the gaze-signal <b>346</b> will not be accurately calculated. Instead, the gaze tracker <b>345</b> can maintain (or adapt) an earlier gaze-signal such that a gaze-signal <b>346</b> is still provided as an output, but it is not based on the most recent current-image <b>347</b> (that is considered potentially erroneous).

This may be caused by one of many reasons such as poor exposure in the image or poor pupil contrast (e.g. due to low image quality or some traits of the user), for example, and is not necessarily directly affected by whether or not there is a blink. Furthermore, such reasons for a low gaze-confidence-value <b>950</b> (or other quality-indicator) aren't necessarily linear and therefore they cannot readily be combined to provide an overall quality-indicator value. Since the gaze-confidence-value <b>950</b> is so low, the validated-blink-threshold <b>951</b> is fixed at the min-threshold <b>953</b> for the duration of the plot. Therefore, as soon as the blink-signal <b>941</b> transitions from False to True the validated-blink-signal <b>944</b> also transitions from False to True because the gaze-confidence-value <b>950</b> is already less than the validated-blink-threshold <b>951</b>. This functionality can be useful because without the min-threshold <b>953</b> it could be impossible for the validated-blink-signal <b>944</b> to be set True. For instance, because the validated-blink-threshold <b>951</b> is so low (because it is offset from an already low gaze_confidence_baseline <b>952</b> by the min_required_confidence_drop) that the gaze-confidence-value <b>950</b> could never drop below it. Therefore, without the min-threshold a true blink might not be noticeable in the quality-indicator when it is already low.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0083">As indicated above any of the quality-indicators described herein can be implemented in a number of different ways, including one or more of the following, either individually or in combination.

This can be especially useful for a pupil locator. (Unvalidated) blinks that are detected too early can be postponed to a time when the pupil occlusion becomes large enough for the pupil detection to become unstable, as represented by a drop in the quality-factor.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
