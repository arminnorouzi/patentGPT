More specifically, the present invention relates to a novel lottery vending machine that includes an integrated coin counter and cryptocurrency transaction capability. The machine increases lottery ticket sales for the state by enticing individuals who want to convert coins into cash, lottery tickets, or cryptocurrency. The machine features a coin receptacle or slot and a coin counter for coins and a connection with cryptocurrency exchange for buying tickets using cryptocurrency, converting coins into cryptocurrency, and/or accumulating coins for purchase of lottery tickets. Accordingly, the present disclosure makes specific reference thereto. Nonetheless, it is to be appreciated that aspects of the present invention are also equally applicable to other like applications, devices, and methods of manufacture.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">By way of background, lottery providers and operators have traditionally used external lottery processing systems to operate lottery games and process lottery-related transactions. Generally, lottery retailers distribute tickets, collect payments, and earn payments from lottery operators. Presently, lottery vending machines are more commonly used by individual users/consumers. The lottery vending machines can be installed in multiple locations, thereby allowing easy and autonomous accessibility. Further, the vending machines do not require to be attended by retailers or operators. However, presently available lottery vending machines are limited to only accept cash and to dispense lottery tickets in exchange of same.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Lottery enthusiasts many times have coins that they want to use for lottery tickets. Such individuals desire to use their coins for buying lottery tickets, which is a feature not offered by current vending machines. Therefore, individuals need to find a separate coin counting machine or another commercial exchange to convert coins into cash, and then use the cash to purchase the lottery tickets. Even in places where lottery vending machines are placed, space is typically not adequate to place a separate coin counting machine next to the lottery vending machine. Individuals desire a single machine that can dispense lottery tickets and count coins. This would also increase sales revenue of lottery operators as individuals will end up buying more tickets through convenient use of coins.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the advent of cryptocurrencies, individuals want to use their cryptocurrency accounts to buy lottery tickets and interchange coins with crypto and vice versa. Existing lottery vending machines do not have the capability to handle cryptocurrency transactions, and therefore the use of cryptocurrency is not possible for purchasing lottery tickets or converting from coins on such vending machines.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there exists a long felt need in the art for a lottery vending machine that combines the functions of selling lottery tickets and counting/summing coins. There is also a long felt need in the art for a lottery vending machine that supports cryptocurrency transactions. Additionally, there is a long felt need in the art for a lottery vending machine that can be easily placed in small or confined spaces. Moreover, there is a long felt need in the art for a lottery machine that entices individuals to buy lottery tickets who want to convert coins into lottery tickets. Further, there is a long felt need in the art for a lottery dispensing machine that offers a way to count, total and display coin currency amounts. Furthermore, there is a long felt need in the art for an improved lottery vending machine that saves time for users in buying lottery tickets and counting coins. Finally, there is a long felt need in the art for a lottery machine that reduces the current footprint of having two different machines to count coins and sell lottery tickets.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The subject matter disclosed and claimed herein, in one embodiment thereof, comprises a coin counting lottery vending machine with integrated cryptocurrency capability. The coin counting lottery vending machine includes a display showing lottery tickets for selection by a user of the machine, a cash deposit slot for receiving or depositing bills for purchasing tickets, a ticket scanner to check the winning status of a previously purchased ticket, a ticket slot for receiving play slips for draw tickets, a coin receptacle for receiving or depositing coins, a coin counter for counting and summing up the received coins, a touch screen display for displaying one or more counts of coins, value of coins, and options for transactions. The machine is further configured to dispense a cash voucher/currency equivalent to received coins when a cash transaction option is selected by the user on the touch screen, dispense a lottery ticket when lottery ticket purchase option is selected by the user on the touch screen and purchasing cryptocurrency when cryptocurrency option is selected by the user. The machine can be connected to a central server and a cryptocurrency exchange for providing tickets and performing cryptocurrency transactions.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this manner, the coin counting lottery machine of the present invention accomplishes all of the forgoing objectives and provides users with a lottery vending machine that provides a convenient way for a user to both cash in coins and purchase lottery tickets, while also providing cryptocurrency transactions. The machine saves users time by combining two tasks of buying lottery tickets and finding a coin counting and summing machine. The machine helps in increasing revenues and capture more monies by adding in the coin counting feature to entice more lottery ticket buyers.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosed innovation.
