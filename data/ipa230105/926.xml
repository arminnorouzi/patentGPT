More particularly, the disclosure relates to specific compounds and combinations of these compounds for improving sex hormone production from cells differentiated using such treatments.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Stem cells have the potential to self-renew (divide) and differentiate into specialized cell types.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are a group of clonogenic cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation displaying phenotypic characteristics of multilineage mesoderm-type cells, such as osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. Under defined in vitro conditions, MSC have the capacity to differentiate into ectodermal and endodermal-type cellular lineages. In mammals, MSC have been isolated from many tissue sources such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, skin, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, umbilical cord blood, liver, lung, nasal septum, synovial membrane, and amniotic membrane.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Several studies have reported protocols to differentiate stem cells into Leydig-like cells (Miyamoto, et al. 2011; Yazawa, et al. 2016; Yazawa, et al. 2011; Yazawa, et al. 2006).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Studies also have reported protocols to differentiate post-natal cells such as fibroblasts into Leydig-like cells (Hou, et al. 2018).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">These methods involve stimulation via developmental transcription factors, including the nuclear receptor 5A subfamily (NR5A) proteins&#x2014;steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) and/or liver-specific receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1), GATA4 and/or NGFI-B together with cAMP treatment (Hou et al. 2018; Miyamoto et al. 2011; Yazawa et al. 2016; Yazawa, et al. 2009; Yazawa et al. 2011; Yazawa et al. 2006).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Injection of such cells can increase circulating sex steroid concentrations in rodents (Yang, et al. 2017; Yang, et al. 2015; Yazawa et al. 2016).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Wilms tumor gene, Wt1, is abundantly expressed in testis Sertoli cells. Wt1 is required for the lineage specification of both Sertoli and granulosa cells by repressing Sf1 expression (Chen, et al. 2017). Developmentally, if Wt1 expression is suppressed, the expression of Sf1 drives somatic cells to differentiate into steroidogenic cells instead of supporting cells (Chen et al. 2017). However, SF-1 is essential for Sertoli cell maturation and spermatogenesis, during post-natal testis development (Kato, et al. 2012).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Deletion of the Wt1 results in defects in testosterone biosynthesis, perhaps via a downregulation in the expression of luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) on Leydig cells and desert hedgehog (Dhh) expression in Sertoli cells (Chen, et al. 2014).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Fetal Leydig cells synthesize only androstenedione as they lack Hsd17b3 expression. Fetal Sertoli cells convert androstenedione to testosterone, whereas adult Leydig cells synthesize testosterone by themselves (Shima, et al. 2013).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The inventors have discovered compounds that differentiate stem cells into hormone-producing stem cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). These compounds induce the production of sex steroids, including progesterone, 17&#x3b2;-estradiol, and testosterone.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Namely, the present invention is a method for differentiating stem cells into multiple linages including Leydig-like and Sertoli-like cells (hormone-producing cells), comprising stimulating the stem cells via a NR5A transcription factor and WT-1 expression. Furthermore, said method may comprise further stimulating the MSC by cAMP.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The inventors have discovered cocktails of compounds that result in markedly improved hormone production from stem cells differentiated with these compounds.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The stem cells can be MSCs derived from bone marrow of fat, or induced pluripotent stem cells.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention is a method for producing hormone-producing cells, comprising generating hormone-producing cells by implementing said method in vitro.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Moreover, the present invention is for stem cells obtained from humans or other animals.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Embodiments of the present disclosure are capable of utilizing said cells for balancing and maintaining in balance the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, at least to some extent.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An embodiment of the invention pertains to a method of treating a patient. In this method, a HPG axis of the patient in need thereof is rebalanced by administering a therapeutically effective amount of hormone-producing cells.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another embodiment of the invention relates to a method of reducing endocrine dyscrasia (dyosis) in a patient. In this method, a HPG axis of the patient in need thereof is rebalanced by administering a therapeutically effective amount of hormone-producing cells.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Yet another embodiment of the invention pertains to a method of reducing rejection in a patient in need of a tissue-specific stem cell transplant. In this method, a HPG axis of the patient in need thereof is rebalanced by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a hormone-producing cell and administering a second stem cell that is tissue-specific to the patient.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Yet another embodiment of the invention relates to a method of preventing or slowing dyosis in a patient. In this method, a therapeutically effective amount of at least one physiological agent that regulates or increases the production of hormones produced by the gonads is administered to a patient.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, certain embodiments of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof herein may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.

This is achieved by delivering donor cells into the human or animal body to increase the production and secretion of sex hormones into the circulation to levels near young adult reproductive levels, thereby reinitiating negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary to rebalance the HPG axis hormone synthesis and secretion to levels near young adult reproductive levels. This in effect prevents dyotic (death) signaling that results from the dysregulation of the HPG axis (Atwood and Bowen 2011; Atwood, et al. 2017; Bowen and Atwood 2004). This will prevent and treat hypogonadism, prevent, and treat symptoms associated with female reproductive endocrine dyscrasia and symptoms associated with male reproductive endocrine dyscrasia, and prevent or delay the onset of age-related diseases and extend longevity.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0062">The invention encompasses a method of preventing or reversing the dysregulation of the HPG axis by repopulating the ovaries with follicular cells, and the testes with Leydig, Sertoli and other support cells.

Rebalancing the endocrine HPG axis will allow for the rebalancing of the tissue specific &#x2018;mini-HPG&#x2019; axes present in tissues throughout the body (Meethal et al. 2009b). This will rebalance reproductive hormone signaling to cells in all tissues of the body.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0066">The present invention encompasses a method of maintaining HPG axis hormones in balance to extend longevity for purposes of extending longevity of animals with agricultural applications, such as increasing yields of wool, cashmere or other fibers per animal. Similar applications apply to egg and milk production.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0067">This can be achieved by injecting into a subject donor cells that can repopulate the gonads with cell types capable of producing reproductive hormones required to balance the HPG axis. For male subject, donor cells capable of differentiating into germ cells (spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoon), Sertoli cells, myoid cells, Leydig cells, stromal cells, macrophage cells and/or epithelial cells and integrating into the tissue to restore function. For female subject, donor cells capable of differentiating into germ cells (oogonial stem cells), granulosa cells, cumulus cells, thecal cells, stromal cells, epithelial cells, macrophage cells and/or oocyte cells, and integrating into the tissue to restore function.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0068">The differentiation of donor cells into more than one gonadal cell type is required to allow complete rebalancing of the axis. For example, while Leydig cells primarily produce androgens, Sertoli cells produce large quantities of inhibins, both of which are required for HPG axis rebalancing in males. A combination of gonadal cells is optimal for complete rebalancing of the axis.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0069">An embodiment of the present invention includes administering, to a subject, donor cells that decrease or regulate the blood levels, production, function or activity of gonadal hormone to be near the blood levels, production, function or activity occurring during fetal life or at or around the height of the subject's reproductive period, which in humans usually corresponds to about 18 to 35 years of age.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0070">In another embodiment, the present invention encompasses administering, to a subject, donor cells that decrease or regulate the blood levels, production, function or activity of kisspeptin, GnRH, LH or FSH to be approximately as low as possible without significant adverse side effects, preferably to be undetectable or nearly undetectable by conventional detection techniques known in the art, which, at the present time, is less than 0.7 mIU/mL for both LH and FSH. In another embodiment, the present invention encompasses administering, to a subject, donor cells that regulate the function or activity of activin to be approximately as low as possible without significant adverse side effects, preferably to be undetectable or nearly undetectable by conventional detection techniques known in the art. In another embodiment, the present invention encompasses administering donor cells that increase or regulate the blood levels, production, function, or activity of inhibin, follistatin, myostatin or BMP4 to be approximately as high as possible without significant adverse side effects.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0071">In other embodiments of the present invention, the blood levels, production, function, or activity of gonadal hormones are continuously regulated, by monitoring the blood levels, production, function, or activity and making adjustments to the donor cell or donor cells being administered via a feedback control system.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0072">Embodiments of the present invention include administration of one or more stem or differentiated cell types that can be used to increase or regulate the blood and/or tissue levels, production, function, or activity of gonadal hormones. Studies have shown that increasing the levels of circulating sex steroids and inhibins will result in significant decreases in GnRH, LH and FSH levels and a rebalancing of the HPG axis (Hayes, et al. 1998; Thorner et al. 1998; Ying 1988). Through a negative feedback loop, the presence of sex steroid hormones such as estrogen, testosterone or progesterone signals the hypothalamus to decrease the secretion of GnRH (Gharib, et al. 1990; Steiner, et al. 1982). The subsequent decrease in GnRH decreases the secretion of LH and FSH (Thorner et al. 1998). For example, sex steroids, inhibins and follistatin have been shown to provide negative feedback regulation of GnRH and FSH synthesis and secretion (Bagatell, et al. 1994; Boepple, et al. 2008; Dubey, et al. 1987; Hayes, et al. 2001b; Illingworth, et al. 1996; Lambert-Messerlian, et al. 1994; Marynick, et al. 1979; Pitteloud, et al. 2008a, b; Schnorr, et al. 2001; Sherins and Loriaux 1973; Winters, et al. 1979a; Winters, et al. 1979b) while sex steroids appear to primarily provide negative feedback for the regulation of GnRH and LH synthesis and secretion (Bagatell et al. 1994; Hayes, et al. 2001a; Santen 1975; Schnorr et al. 2001; Veldhuis, et al. 1992). In females, sex steroids, inhibins and follistatin have been shown to provide negative feedback regulation of FSH (le Nestour, et al. 1993; Welt, et al. 1997) and LH (Jaffe and Keye 1974, 1975; Jaffe, et al. 1976; Keye and Jaffe 1974, 1975, 1976; Liu and Yen 1983; Taylor, et al. 1995; Young and Jaffe 1976) synthesis and secretion.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0073">Embodiments of the present invention also encompass rebalancing of the HPG axis such that the axis and related hormonal concentrations are balanced for that person. The production of sex hormones by donor cells is expected to be different for different individuals in order to reach optimal balancing of that person's HPG axis. Thus, the circulating and tissue concentrations of sex hormones in one person's balanced HPG axis is expected to be different to that of another person whose axis is also balanced.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0074">Embodiments of the present invention also encompass the minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour and day-to-day variations in HPG axis hormone production to allow the axis to remain in balance.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0075">Embodiments of the present invention also encompass modulating the concentrations and ratios of hormones of the HPG axis at any stage of the life cycle, including the embryo, fetus, childhood, puberty, adulthood or during senescence.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0076">Embodiments of the present invention also encompass modulating the concentrations and ratios of hormones of the HPG axis during gender transition from male to female, or female to male.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0077">Embodiments of the present invention also encompass returning the ratios of sex hormones back to near the ratios occurring during fetal life or at or near the time of greatest reproductive function of the subject. For example, the ratio of testosterone:FSH during the male reproductive period is &#x2dc;11 (6.5 ng/mL:0.6 ng/mL), while that during the post-reproductive period (post-menopause) is &#x2dc;1 (2.3 ng/mL:2.3 ng/mL). In this example, treatment would aim to return the ratio of these hormones back to 11. Further embodiments to this invention would encompass returning all the sex hormone ratios back to those during fetal life or at the time of greatest reproductive function of the subject.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0078">Embodiments of the present invention also encompass administration of purified and mixed donor cell populations derived from the tissues of an individual who will receive the donor cells.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0079">Embodiments of the present invention also encompass administration to an individual purified and mixed donor cell populations derived from multiple tissues of one or more individuals.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0080">Embodiments of the present invention encompass administration of autologous or allogenic donor cell populations into the gonads for the prevention or treatment of hypogonadism, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, andropause, menopause and related conditions, and for the prevention and treatment of diseases associated with senescence and aging.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0081">Embodiments of the present invention also encompass administration of donor cell populations into the gonads prior to administration of donor cell populations (e.g. stem cell therapy, iPS therapy, or implantation/injection of differentiated cells including stem cells that have been differentiated in vitro) into other tissues of the body.

Cells are then subjected to flow cytometry to isolate MSC that are then injected (10,000-1 billion cells/treatment) into the interstitium of one or both testes or ovaries of the donor. In the testes, cells can be injected into the seminal vesicle lobules, septa, tunica albuginea, straight tubule, rete testes, efferent ductile and/or epididymis. In the ovary, cells can be injected into the ovarian cortex. If the number of isolated MSCs is insufficient, MSCs are expanded in culture first prior to injection into the gonads.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0087">Stem cells and educated stem cells (e.g. MSCs differentiated into hormone-producing stem cells) injected into the testes localize to the testicular interstitium and seminiferous tubules and differentiate into Leydig cells and spermatogonia/spermatocytes, respectively (Lo, et al. 2004; Yazawa et al. 2006). Stem cells injected into the ovaries increase follicle numbers (Abd-Allah, et al. 2013). Hormonal factors secreted within the gonads direct the differentiation and integration of such stem cells for the replenishment of germ cells, Leydig, Sertoli and other cells in the testes, and replenishment of follicular cells (germ cells, granulosa, thecal and other cells) in the ovaries. Hormones secreted by the transplanted cells and their progeny in turn rebalance the HPG axis.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0088">This technique may be performed autologously, i.e. isolating cells from the same individual who will receive the cells; allogeneically, i.e. cells isolated from one individual are injected into another individual (human or animal); or both autologously and allogeneically, i.e. isolated cells from the recipient and from another individual(s) are injected into the recipient.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0089">In this example, MCSs, from which gonadal tissues are derived during embryogenesis, are purified from tissues other than the gonads and then injected into the gonads.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0090">MSCs in a suitable buffer, or encapsulated in a hydrogel or other matrix (e.g. fibrin, collagen) prior to injection, may be injected into the gonads (testes or ovaries).

Tissue concentrations of reproductive hormones can be measured in tissues to confirm that the hormones of the &#x2018;mini-HPG-axis in that tissue have rebalanced (returned to young adult reproductive concentrations). If the HPG axis has not completely rebalanced, a second or subsequent injection can be given until such time as the HPG axis is balanced and dyotic signaling has decreased. This provides a preventative and treatment for hypogonadism (primary) and of age-related reproductive endocrine dyscrasia.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 2: MSC Education into Hormone-Producing Cells</heading><p id="p-0088" num="0094">MSCs or other stem cell populations are differentiated in vitro into discrete precursor or differentiated cell types including germ cells (spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoon), Sertoli cells, myoid cells, Leydig cells, stromal cells, macrophage cells and/or epithelial cells in the case of the male; or germ cells (oogonial stem cells), granulosa cells, cumulus cells, thecal cells, stromal cells, epithelial cells, macrophage cells and/or oocyte cells, in the case of the female, and one or preferably more of these cell types are injected into the gonads and/or other tissues and circulating and tissue sex hormone concentrations measured as in the methods described in Example 1, for rebalancing of the HPG axis.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0095">Bone marrow derived hMSC are grown to confluence in T75 flasks using Minimum Essential Medium (MEM)&#x2014;Alpha 1, with Earle's salts, Glutagro Supplement, L-alanyl-L-glutamine, MEM nonessential amino acids and HyClone fetal bovine serum prior to treatment with differentiation factors.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0096">MSCs are differentiated into hormone-producing cells over 7-21 days in a water-jacketed CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator (Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, Mass.) at 37&#xb0; C. with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>by treatment with RJW100 (5 &#x3bc;M), PE (20 &#x3bc;M); E2 (400 nM); DPN (10 &#x3bc;M); 4-HP (200 nM), and RSV (3.52 &#x3bc;M).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0097">Hormone production can be induced in educated cells by treatment with N6, 2&#x2032;-O-dibutyryladenosine 3&#x2032;, 5&#x2032;-cyclic monophosphate sodium (dbcAMP), or following treatment with LH, FSH and/or hCG, for 1-3 days in serum supplement-free media.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0098">Sex steroid and protein hormone concentrations are measured in the media.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0099">Cells are then injected into a patient, including the gonads or fat pad, and the patient can be treated with gonadotropins (LH, FSH and/or hCG) to aid in repopulation, cell differentiation and hormone production.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 3</heading><p id="p-0094" num="0100">Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells created from the recipient or another donor can be cultured to produce sufficient cell numbers to be injected into either one or both of the gonads, and/or injected into the circulation, and/or other tissues of the body and circulating and tissue sex hormone concentrations measured as described in Example 1 to rebalance the HPG axis.
