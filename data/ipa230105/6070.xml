According to the method of forming the semiconductor structure in the present disclosure, a channel layer is formed in a transistor surface area. By adjusting the oxidation rate of the channel layer and reducing the difference in oxidation rate between the channel layer and a substrate, a first transition oxide layer covering the channel layer and a second transition oxide layer covering the surface of a second area of the substrate may be formed at the same time, and furthermore, the thickness of the first transition oxide layer and the thickness of the second transition oxide layer may be adjusted to be consistent.
