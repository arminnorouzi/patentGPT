id="p-0051" num="0152">The present disclosure provides compounds and methods for restoring wild-type function to mutant p53. The compounds of the present disclosure can bind to mutant p53 and restore the ability of the p53 mutant to bind DNA. The restoration of activity of the p53 mutant can allow for the activation of downstream effectors of p53 leading to inhibition of cancer progression. The disclosure further provides methods of treatment of a cancerous lesion or a tumor harboring a p53 mutation.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0153">Cancer is a collection of related diseases characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of cells with the potential to metastasize throughout the body. Cancer can be classified into five broad categories including, for example: carcinomas, which can arise from cells that cover internal and external parts of the body such as the lung, breast, and colon; sarcomas, which can arise from cells that are located in bone, cartilage, fat, connective tissue, muscle, and other supportive tissues; lymphomas, which can arise in the lymph nodes and immune system tissues; leukemia, which can arise in the bone marrow and accumulate in the bloodstream; and adenomas, which can arise in the thyroid, the pituitary gland, the adrenal gland, and other glandular tissues.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0154">Although different cancers can develop in virtually any of the body's tissues, and contain unique features, the basic processes that cause cancer can be similar in all forms of the disease. Cancer begins when a cell breaks free from the normal restraints on cell division and begins to grow and divide out of control. Genetic mutations in the cell can preclude the ability of the cell to repair damaged DNA or initiate apoptosis and can result in uncontrolled growth and division of cells.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0155">The ability of tumor cell populations to multiply is determined not only by the rate of cell proliferation but also by the rate of cell attrition. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, represents a major mechanism of cellular attrition. Cancer cells can evade apoptosis through a variety of strategies, for example, through the suppression of p53 function, thereby suppressing expression of pro-apoptotic proteins.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0156">Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can regulate the proliferation of cells. Genetic mutations can affect oncogenes and tumor suppressors, potentially activating or suppressing activity abnormally, further facilitating uncontrolled cell division. Whereas oncogenes assist in cellular growth, tumor suppressor genes slow cell division by repairing damaged DNA and activating apoptosis. Cellular oncogenes that can be mutated in cancer include, for example, Cdk1, Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk4, Cdk6, EGFR, PDGFR, VEGF, HER2, Raf kinase, K-Ras, and myc. Tumor suppressor genes that can be mutated in cancer include, for example, BRCA1, BRCA2, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C, Retinoblastoma protein (pRb), PTEN, p16, p27, p53, and p73.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0157">Tumor suppressor p53.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0158">The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a 393 amino acid transcription factor that can regulate cell growth in response to cellular stresses including, for example, UV radiation, hypoxia, oncogene activation, and DNA damage. p53 has various mechanisms for inhibiting the progression of cancer including, for example, initiation of apoptosis, maintenance of genomic stability, cell cycle arrest, induction of senescence, and inhibition of angiogenesis. Due to the critical role of p53 in tumor suppression, p53 is inactivated in almost all cancers either by direct mutation or through perturbation of associated signaling pathways involved in tumor suppression. Homozygous loss of the p53 gene occurs in almost all types of cancer, including carcinomas of the breast, colon, and lung. The presence of certain p53 mutations in several types of human cancer can correlate with less favorable patient prognosis.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0159">In the absence of stress signals, p53 levels are maintained at low levels via the interaction of p53 with Mdm2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. In an unstressed cell, Mdm2 can target p53 for degradation by the proteasome. Under stress conditions, the interaction between Mdm2 and p53 is disrupted, and p53 accumulates. The critical event leading to the activation of p53 is phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of p53 by protein kinases, thereby transducing upstream stress signals. The phosphorylation of p53 leads to a conformational change, which can promote DNA binding by p53 and allow transcription of downstream effectors. The activation of p53 can induce, for example, the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, cell cycle arrest, senescence, and DNA repair. p53 can activate proteins involved in the above pathways including, for example, Fas/Apo1, KILLER/DR5, Bax, Puma, Noxa, Bid, caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7, caspase-8, caspase-9, and p21 (WAF1). Additionally, p53 can repress the transcription of a variety of genes including, for example, c-MYC, Cyclin B, VEGF, RAD51, and hTERT.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0160">Each chain of the p53 tetramer is composed of several functional domains including the transactivation domain (amino acids 1-100), the DNA-binding domain (amino acids 101-306), and the tetramerization domain (amino acids 307-355), which are highly mobile and largely unstructured. Most p53 cancer mutations are located in the DNA-binding core domain of the protein, which contains a central &#x3b2;-sandwich of anti-parallel &#x3b2;-sheets that serves as a basic scaffold for the DNA-binding surface. The DNA-binding surface is composed of two &#x3b2;-turn loops, L2 and L3, which are stabilized by a zinc ion, for example, at Arg175 and Arg248, and a loop-sheet-helix motif. Altogether, these structural elements form an extended DNA-binding surface that is rich in positively-charged amino acids and makes specific contact with various p53 response elements.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0161">Due to the prevalence of p53 mutations in virtually every type of cancer, the reactivation of wild type p53 function in a cancerous cell can be an effective therapy. Mutations in p53 located in the DNA-binding domain of the protein or periphery of the DNA-binding surface result in aberrant protein folding required for DNA recognition and binding. Mutations in p53 can occur, for example, at amino acids Val143, His168, Arg175, Tyr220, Gly245, Arg248, Arg249, Phe270, Arg273, and Arg282. p53 mutations that can abrogate the activity of p53 include, for example, R175H, Y220C, G245S, R248Q, R248W, R273H, and R282H. These p53 mutations can either distort the structure of the DNA-binding site or thermodynamically destabilize the folded protein at body temperature. Wild-type function of p53 mutants can be recovered by binding of the p53 mutant to a compound that can shift the folding-unfolding equilibrium towards the folded state, thereby reducing the rate of unfolding and destabilization.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0162">Non-limiting examples of amino acids include: alanine (A, Ala); arginine (R, Arg); asparagine (N, Asn); aspartic acid (D, Asp); cysteine (C, Cys); glutamic acid (E, Glu); glutamine (Q, Gln); glycine (G, Gly); histidine (H, His); isoleucine (I, Ile); leucine (L, Leu); lysine (K, Lys); methionine (M, Met); phenylalanine (F, Phe); proline (P, Pro); serine (S, Ser); threonine (T, Thr); tryptophan (W, Trp); tyrosine (Y, Tyr); and valine (V, Val).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0163">Mechanism of compounds of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0164">The compounds of the present disclosure can selectively bind to a p53 mutant and can recover wild-type activity of the p53 mutant including, for example, DNA binding function and activation of downstream targets involved in tumor suppression. In some embodiments, a compound of the disclosure selectively binds to the p53 Y220C mutant. The Y220C mutant is a temperature sensitive mutant, which binds to DNA at lower temperature and is denatured at body temperature. A compound of the disclosure can stabilize the Y220C mutant to reduce the likelihood of denaturation of the protein at body temperature.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0165">Located in the periphery of the p53 &#x3b2;-sandwich connecting &#x3b2;-strands S7 and S8, the aromatic ring of Y220 is an integral part of the hydrophobic core of the &#x3b2;-sandwich. The Y220C mutation can be highly destabilizing, due to the formation of an internal surface cavity. A compound of the disclosure can bind to and occupy this surface crevice to stabilize the &#x3b2;-sandwich, thereby restoring wild-type p53 DNA-binding activity.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0166">To determine the ability of a compound of the disclosure to bind and stabilize mutant p53, assays can be employed to detect, for example, a conformational change in the p53 mutant or activation of wild-type p53 targets. Conformational changes in p53 can be measured by, for example, differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR), or X-ray crystallography. Additionally, antibodies specific for the wild type of mutant conformation of p53 can be used to detect a conformational change via, for example, immunoprecipitation (IP), immunofluorescence (IF), or immunoblotting.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0167">Methods used to detect the ability of the p53 mutant to bind DNA can include, for example, DNA affinity immunoblotting, modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF), and a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0168">To determine whether a compound described herein is able to reactivate the transcriptional activity of p53, the activation of downstream targets in the p53 signaling cascade can be measured. Activation of p53 effector proteins can be detected by, for example, immunohistochemistry (IHC-P), reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and western blotting. The activation of p53 can also be measured by the induction of apoptosis via the caspase cascade and using methods including, for example, Annexin V staining, TUNEL assays, pro-caspase and caspase levels, and cytochrome c levels. Another consequence of p53 activation is senescence, which can be measured using methods such as &#x3b2;-galactosidase staining.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0169">A p53 mutant that can be used to determine the effectiveness of a compound of the disclosure to increase the DNA binding ability of a p53 mutant is a p53 truncation mutant, which contains only amino acids 94-312, encompassing the DNA-binding domain of p53. For example, the sequence of the p53 Y220C mutant used for testing compound efficacy can be:</p><p id="p-0069" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0"

In unit dosage form, the formulation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of one or more compounds. The unit dosage can be in the form of a package containing discrete quantities of the formulation. Non-limiting examples are packaged injectables, vials, or ampoules. Aqueous suspension compositions can be packaged in single-dose non-reclosable containers. Multiple-dose reclosable containers can be used, for example, in combination with or without a preservative. Formulations for injection can be presented in unit dosage form, for example, in ampoules, or in multi-dose containers with a preservative.</p><p id="p-0470" num="0489">Pharmaceutical compositions provided herein, can be administered in conjunction with other therapies, for example, chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, anti-inflammatory agents, and selected vitamins.

The use of liposomes as drug carriers can increase the therapeutic index of the compounds. Liposomes are composed of natural phospholipids and can contain mixed lipid chains with surfactant properties (e.g., egg phosphatidylethanolamine). A liposome design can employ surface ligands for attaching to unhealthy tissue. Non-limiting examples of liposomes include the multilamellar vesicle (MLV), the small unilamellar vesicle (SUV), and the large unilamellar vesicle (LUV). Liposomal physicochemical properties can be modulated to optimize penetration through biological barriers and retention at the site of administration, and to reduce a likelihood of developing premature degradation and toxicity to non-target tissues. Optimal liposomal properties depend on the administration route: large-sized liposomes show good retention upon local injection, small-sized liposomes are better suited to achieve passive targeting. PEGylation reduces the uptake of the liposomes by the liver and spleen, and increases the circulation time, resulting in increased localization at the inflamed site due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Additionally, liposomal surfaces can be modified to achieve selective delivery of the encapsulated drug to specific target cells. Non-limiting examples of targeting ligands include monoclonal antibodies, vitamins, peptides, and polysaccharides specific for receptors concentrated on the surface of cells associated with the disease.</p><p id="p-0475" num="0494">Non-limiting examples of dosage forms suitable for use in the disclosure include liquid, elixir, nanosuspension, aqueous or oily suspensions, drops, syrups, and any combination thereof.

Energy Transfer) assay in which recombinant His-tag Y220C p53 DBD protein binds to biotin-labeled consensus DNA. Binding of recombinant His-tag Y220C p53 DBD protein and biotin-labeled consensus DNA was registered by the FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) between allophycocyanin (APC) conjugated anti-His tag antibody and Europium-(Eu) conjugated Streptavidin.</p><p id="p-1716" num="1689">The compounds of TABLES 1-9 (2 mM stock in dimethylsulfoxide) were diluted 3-fold in series in dimethylsulfoxide. 1.2 &#x3bc;L of a compound solution was added to each well of 384-well polypropylene black plates (NUNC). Thirty &#x3bc;L per well of 181 nM recombinant His-tag Y220C p53 DBD protein (amino acids #94-312; SEQ ID NO: 1) and 6.1 nM of APC conjugated anti-His tag antibody (Columbia Biosciences) in ice-cold Assay Buffer 1 (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 75 mM KCl, 0.75 mM DTT and 0.2 mg/mL BSA) were added. As a background control, 30 &#x3bc;L of Assay Buffer 1 containing 6.1 nM of APC anti-His antibody (No Y220C protein) was also added into a second set of serially diluted compound plates. The samples were spun by centrifuge at 1,200 rpm (Eppendorf 5810R Plate centrifuge) for 1 minute and incubated at room temperature (20&#xb0; C.) for 15 min. The samples were then further incubated at either 27&#xb0; C. or 29&#xb0; C. for 60 min. Five microliters per well of 311 nM biotin labeled consensus DNA (a DNA duplex with 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032; sequence of ATTAGGCATGTCTAGGCATGTCTAGG (SEQ ID NO. 2) and biotin attached to the 3&#x2032; end of the complementary DNA) and 4.9 nM Europium (Eu) conjugated Streptavidin (Eu-SA, Perkin Elmer) in Assay Buffer 2 (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 75 mM KCl and 0.2 mg/mL BSA) were added to the wells. The samples were spun by centrifuge at 1,200 rpm for 1 min and incubated at room temperature (20&#xb0; C.) for 20 min. Assay signals were monitored by reading excitation at 340 nm, and emission fluorescence at 615 nm and 665 nm on an Envision@ reader.
