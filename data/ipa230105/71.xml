Furthermore, the present invention refers to the use of such an agricultural composition for UV-A and/or UV-B protection of plants and parts thereof as well as to the use of the combination of at least one wax and at least one lignin as UV-A and/or UV-B protecting agent, wherein the ratio of wax:lignin is from 100:1 to 100:200 based on the dry weight of the wax and the lignin.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is well known that the sunlight energy and mainly the ultraviolet portion of the sun's spectrum has a damaging effect on plants and parts thereof. In particular, the ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation which ranges from 280 to 320 nm and the ultraviolet A (UV-A) radiation which ranges from &#x3e;320 to 400 nm both cause sunburn to plants and parts thereof. Especially, when the shaded air temperature is above a temperature of ca. 30&#xb0; C., plants and parts thereof and especially fruits can be damaged due to sunburn. The consequence of such a &#x201c;fruit sunburn&#x201d; is a damage of the fruits and a decrease of the total production yield, causing an economic impact, mainly in hot summer seasons.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to protect at least the part of the plants and parts thereof and especially, the fruits which are exposed to sun light against UV-B as well as UV-A radiation. In the art several attempts have been made to provide such UV protection.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, CN 203 538 002 refers to a pomegranate cultivation bag capable of preventing sunburn, wherein one side of the pomegranate cultivation bag is reflective, and the other side is transparent. During a high temperature season, the pomegranate cultivation bag is sleeved over a pomegranate with the reflective side facing the sun to reflect most of sun light in the noon to prevent sunburn of the pomegranate, and partial sun light reflected by a reflective plastic film irradiates on the leaves at the shady side of a fruit tree to increase the photosynthesis of the entire orchard. However, such a procedure is complex, time-consuming and labor-intensive, since every plant or fruit has to be treated individually by hand.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another option to reduce the probability of sunburn is the using of mineral particles, usually clay or calcium carbonate, which form a film on the plants and parts thereof that reflect/block the damaging UV radiation. Such sunscreen compositions for applications to plants are known, for example from US 2012/0052187 A1 that refers to a sunscreen composition comprising Titanium Dioxide (TiO2), Zinc Oxide (ZnO), Silicon Dioxide (SiO2), a surfactant, wetting agent, dispersant (SWD) and water. The composition forms a suspension concentrate when combined that when diluted in water provides a solution that provides uniform coverage using convention spraying equipment.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">WO 2010/008476 A1 refers to a method for increasing a yield of a crop including controlling plant tissue stress by at least partially coating a plant tissue with a composition comprising an agricultural sunscreen formulation and a second agricultural chemical. The agricultural sunscreen formulation may comprise 40 to 80 wt.-% calcium carbonate, 1 to 5 wt.-% bicarbonate and 15 to 59 wt.-% water.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the main disadvantage of such particle films is the &#x201c;white-washed&#x201d; appearance of the treated plants and fruits. Such a white to greyish film on plants and fruits looks unappetizing and is rejected by consumers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A potential alternative to such &#x201c;white-washed&#x201d; films are wax-based products, such as carnauba wax, which appear essentially transparent after the application. Such wax-based sunscreens are, for example, known from U.S. Pat. No. 7,222,455 B2 that refers to methods and compositions for suppressing cracking, stem browning, and water loss in fruit or vegetables, such as cherries. The methods comprise applying to fruits or vegetables an amount of a wax emulsion comprising from about 0.125% to about 25% (weight/weight) of carnauba wax, from about 0.1% to about 16% (weight/weight) of oleic acid, and from about 0.03% to about 6% (weight/weight) of morpholine, and from about 53% to about 99.7% (weight/weight) of water.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,694 B2 refers to a system for coating sticky fruit, which system comprises a first composition including a vegetable wax, a vegetable oil and a wetting agent and a second composition including a protein, said first composition being applied to said fruit before said second composition, said first and second compositions being applied in an amount sufficient to give fruit that is no longer sticky. The vegetable wax could be, for example, carnauba wax.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In such compositions the vegetable wax such as the carnauba wax is usually the main active ingredient against the sun damage. However, some waxes filter out a significant fraction of UV-B but are less efficient against UV-A radiation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, there is a continuous need in the art for adequate formulations or compositions providing sufficient or improved UV-B and/or UV-A protection to plants and parts thereof.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, it is an objective of the present invention to provide an agricultural composition for providing sufficient or improved UV-B and/or UV-A protection to plants and parts thereof, especially to fruits. In particular, it is an objective of the present invention to provide an agricultural composition that is translucent or at least provides only a pale film or shimmer on the plants and parts thereof that are treated with such a composition. A further object of the present invention is that the compounds used in these agricultural compositions are non-toxic to humans, do not provide a harmful effect on the environment and preferably are approved by the food act to be used on plants and parts thereof, especially on fruits. Another object of the present invention is that the compositions should be easily and quickly produced, cheap and especially easy to handle. It is especially preferred that the compositions are sprayable and that they stick to the plants and parts thereof and don't get washed off easily by rain.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">These and other objectives of the present invention can be solved by an agricultural composition for providing UV-A and/or UV-B protection to plants and parts thereof as described in the present invention and defined in the claims. Advantageous embodiments of the invention are defined in the corresponding sub-claims.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to one embodiment of the present invention an agricultural composition for providing UV-A and/or UV-B protection to plants and parts thereof is provided the composition comprising at least one wax, at least one lignin, at least one emulsifier, water, optionally calcium carbonate, and optionally a solvent; wherein the ratio of wax:lignin in the composition is from 100:1 to 100:200 based on the dry weight of the wax and the lignin.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The inventors surprisingly found out that the foregoing agricultural composition provides sufficient or improved UV-B and/or UV-A protection to plants and parts thereof, especially to fruits. Especially, the inventors surprisingly found that when at least one wax is used in combination with at least one lignin, wherein the ratio of wax:lignin in the composition is from 100:1 to 100:200 based on the dry weight of the wax and the lignin, the agricultural composition provides improved UV-B and/or UV-A protection to plants and parts thereof. Furthermore, the agricultural composition of the present invention is translucent or at least provides only a pale film or shimmer on the plants and parts thereof that are treated with such a composition. The compounds used in these agricultural compositions are non-toxic to humans, generally speaking do not provide a harmful effect on the environment and preferably are approved by the food act to be used on plants and parts thereof, especially on fruits.
