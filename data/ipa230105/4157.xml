Among the autonomous vehicles are trucks used for long-distance load deliveries. Trucking industry is sensitive to various costs such as fuel costs, maintenance, and repairs. To improve fuel efficiency, reduce collision risk, and reduce wear-and-tear of vehicles, human truck drivers use a variety of driving techniques, such as maintaining a constant speed whenever possible, accelerating through downhill sections of the road in order to acquire an additional momentum to carry the vehicle into subsequent uphill sections, and other techniques, which can be equally useful for autonomous vehicles. Successful implementations of such methods, however, can depend on the road and vehicle conditions. Higher efficiency is usually achieved when traffic is light. Conversely, presence of a large number of other trucks, carrying different loads and moving with different speeds, as well as passenger cars, motorhomes, and other vehicles is often detrimental to driving performance. Challenging weather conditions can introduce further uncertainty and increase costs while negatively affecting expected delivery times.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The disclosure is illustrated by way of examples, and not by way of limitation, and can be more fully understood with references to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the figures, in which:</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating components of an example architecture of a system that provides mass distribution-informed optimization for an autonomous vehicle (AV), in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating components of an example architecture of a system and example data flows pertaining to mass distribution-informed optimization, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a flow diagram of an example method of performing mass distribution-informed optimization, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-D</figref> are diagrams illustrating components for determining mass distribution data for AVs, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a block diagram of an example computer device within which a set of instructions, for causing the machine to perform any of the one or more methodologies discussed herein can be executed, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, disclosed is a method including identifying sensor data associated with corresponding distal ends of one or more axles of an autonomous vehicle (AV).

The vehicle contacts the roadway via the wheels. One or more wheels are coupled to each distal end of each axle. The axle transmits driving torque from the vehicle to the corresponding wheels and/or maintains the position of the wheels relative to each other and to the vehicle body. Axle load of a wheeled vehicle is the total weight bearing on the roadway for all wheels connected to a given axle. Vehicles can have different mass distributions based on the construction of a vehicle (e.g., tractor, one or more trailers) and the cargo (e.g., cargo weight, cargo distribution, etc.) being carried by the vehicle. Mass distribution is associated with different loads on different distal ends of axles. Mass distribution can include a center of gravity (COG) of the vehicle. Different mass distributions can cause vehicles to have different likelihoods of rolling over, being able to perform an evasive maneuver, etc. For example, a vehicle that has a greater load on the left sides of the axles than the right sides of the axles may have a greater likelihood of rolling over. In another example, a vehicle that has a higher COG (e.g., transporting hanging meat) may have a greater likelihood of rolling over than a vehicle that has a lower COG.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">An autonomous vehicle (AV) performs vehicle actions, such as braking, steering, and drive torque application (e.g., throttling), to move the AV from the starting location to the destination location along a route. The AV receives route data (e.g., from a server) that includes particular roads to travel from the starting location to the destination location. The AV also receives sensor data from a perception system (e.g., vehicle sensors) that indicates locations of other objects. The AV uses the sensor data and the route data to control the AV. Conventional AVs travel the same regardless of the mass distribution of the AV. This can cause AVs to either travel overly conservatively (e.g., assuming the worst case scenario of mass distribution) or to travel dangerously (e.g., assuming a best case scenario of mass distribution). An AV travelling overly conservatively results in inefficient use of time, fuel inefficiency, and wear-and-tear on the vehicle. An AV travelling dangerously can cause the vehicle to roll over, be in a collision, etc.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Aspects of the disclosure address the above challenges along with others, by performing mass distribution-informed optimization for controlling of the AV.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, a processing device (e.g., located in a server or onboard the AV) identifies sensor data that is associated with corresponding distal ends of one or more axles of the AV. The sensor data may include weights at each distal end of the axles (e.g., responsive to driving over scales). The sensor data may include pressure of bladders at each distal end of the axles (e.g., responsive to the bladders levelling the trailer). The sensor data may include displacement data of each distal end of the axles (e.g., a laser pointing at the trailer or the ground). The sensor data may include displacement data of the suspension (e.g., springs) at each distal end of the axles. At least a portion of the sensor data may be received when the AV is stationary. At least a portion of the sensor data may be received when the AV is on a substantially horizontal surface (e.g., level surface). At least a portion of the sensor data may be received when the AV is on a non-horizontal surface (e.g., on a gradient, on a tilt-table). At least a portion of the sensor data may be received when the AV is travelling (e.g., accelerating, braking, turning, etc.).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The processing device determines, based on the sensor data, mass distribution data of the AV. The mass distribution data is associated with a first load proximate a first distal end of a first axle of the AV and a second load proximate a second distal end of the first axle of the AV. In some embodiments, the mass distribution data includes one or more of a vertical COG of the AV, a lateral (side-to-side) COG of the AV, a longitudinal (front-to-back) COG of the AV, mass values associated with different distal ends of one or more axles of the AV, ratio of loads on different distal ends of one or more axles, suspension stiffness data of the AV, moment of inertia data of the AV, and/or roll stiffness data of the AV. In some embodiments, the mass distribution data is of a tractor (e.g., vehicle) (e.g., COG of the tractor). In some embodiments, the mass distribution data is of a single trailer (e.g., COG of a single trailer). In some embodiments, the mass distribution data is of multiple trailers (e.g., COG of a combination of trailers). In some embodiments, the mass distribution data is of a combination of a tractor and one or more trailers (e.g., COG of a combination of the tractor and one or more trailers).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The processing device causes, based on the mass distribution data, performance of a corrective action associated with the AV. A corrective action may be a main action (e.g., no first action to be corrected) or a corrective action may be a subsequent action (e.g., one or more first actions to be corrected). A corrective action may be referred to as an action, a driving action, a planning action, a routing action, a motion control action, and/or the like. Performance of the corrective action may be associated with one or more of selecting or updating a route based on the mass distribution data, determining handling maneuver limits (e.g., limits on acceleration, limits on braking, limits on turning, jerk limits, braking jerk limits, lateral jerk limits, etc.) based on the mass distribution data, determining a change in load of the AV (e.g., loss of cargo, shifting of cargo) based on the mass distribution data, identifying a malfunctioning component of the AV based on the mass distribution data, diagnosing issues with the AV based on the mass distribution data, rejecting a load based on the mass distribution data, providing an alert based on the mass distribution data, and/or the like. In some embodiments, performance of the corrective action includes generating mass distribution-informed strategy data (e.g., handling maneuver limits, acceleration limits, braking limits, turning limits, etc.) and causing the AV to travel a route based on the mass distribution-informed strategy data.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Aspects and embodiments disclosed herein provide numerous advantages over existing technologies. By determining mass distribution data of the AV, dangerous maneuvers can be avoided which avoids vehicle roll-overs, collisions, wear-and-tear on the vehicle, and/or the like. By determining mass distribution data of the AV, overly conservative travelling can be avoided which increases fuel-efficiency, uses less time, avoids wear-and-tear on the vehicle, and/or the like. By determining corrective actions based on the mass distribution data, a load of an AV can be rejected or adjusted and/or a route can be updated to improve fuel and time efficiency. By determining corrective actions based on the mass distribution data, changes in mass distribution (e.g., falling objects, shift of objects, etc.) can be determined.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating components of an example architecture <b>100</b> of a system that provides mass distribution-informed optimization for an autonomous vehicle (AV) <b>101</b>, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. Although alternatively referred to as &#x201c;trucks,&#x201d; autonomous vehicles can include any motor vehicles, such as cars, tractors (with or without trailers), buses, motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, recreational vehicles, any specialized farming or construction vehicles, and the like), or any other self-propelled vehicles capable of being operated in a self-driving mode (without a human input or with a reduced human input). Autonomous vehicles can include vehicles with various levels of autonomy, such as level 2 (partial autonomy) through level 5 (full autonomy). Autonomous vehicles can include vehicles using an internal combustion engine (e.g., gas engine, diesel engine, etc.), an electric engine (motor), or combination thereof (e.g., hybrid AV). AV <b>101</b> can be capable of traveling on paved and/or unpaved roadways, off-road, on various surfaces encountered on farming (or other agricultural) land, within a driving environment (including indoor environment) of an industrial plant, and so on.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">AV <b>101</b> can include a sensing system <b>120</b>. The sensing system <b>120</b> can include various electromagnetic (e.g., optical) and non-electromagnetic (e.g., acoustic) sensing subsystems and/or devices that can be used in object sensing to facilitate autonomous driving, e.g., distance sensing, velocity sensing, acceleration sensing, rotational motion sensing, and so on. For example, optical sensing can utilize a range of light visible to a human eye (e.g., the 380 to 400 nanometer (nm) wavelength range), the UV range (below 380 nm), the infrared range (above 400 nm), the radio frequency range (above 1 m), etc. In embodiments, &#x201c;optical&#x201d; can include any other suitable range of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The sensing system <b>120</b> can include one or more LiDAR sensors <b>122</b> (e.g., a LiDAR rangefinders), which can be laser-based units capable of determining distances (e.g., using time-of-flight (ToF) technology) to the objects in the environment around AV <b>101</b>. For example, LiDAR sensor(s) <b>122</b> can emit one or more laser signals (pulses) that travel to an object and then detect arrived signals reflected from the object. By determining a time delay between the signal emission and the arrival of the retro-reflected waves, a ToF LiDAR sensors <b>122</b> can determine the distance to the object. LiDAR sensor(s) <b>122</b> can emit signals in various directions to obtain a wide view of the outside environment. LiDAR sensor(s) <b>122</b> can utilize wavelengths of electromagnetic waves that are shorter than the wavelength of the radio waves and can, therefore, provide a higher spatial resolution and sensitivity compared with the radar unit <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, LiDAR sensor(s) <b>122</b> can be (or include) coherent LiDAR sensor(s), such as a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) LiDAR sensor(s). FMCW LiDAR sensor(s) (or some other coherent LiDAR sensors) can use optical heterodyne detection for instant velocity determination. LiDAR sensor(s) <b>122</b> can include one or more laser sources producing and emitting signals and one or more detectors of the signals reflected back from the objects, one or more spectral filters to filter out spurious electromagnetic waves having wavelengths (frequencies) that are different from the wavelengths (frequencies) of the emitted signals, one or more directional filters (e.g., apertures, diffraction gratings, and so on) to filter out electromagnetic waves that arrive at the detectors along directions different from the directions of the emitted signals, and other components that can enhance sensing capabilities of the LiDAR sensor(s) <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, LiDAR sensor(s) <b>122</b> can ensure a 360-degree view in a horizontal direction and up to 90 degrees in the vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The sensing system <b>120</b> can include one or more radar units <b>124</b>, which can be any system that utilizes radio or microwave frequency signals to sense objects within the driving environment of the AV <b>101</b>. The radar unit(s) <b>124</b> can be configured to sense both the spatial locations of the objects (including their spatial dimensions) and their velocities (e.g., using the Doppler shift technology), such as translational velocities and angular (rotational) velocities. Sensing system <b>120</b> can also include one or more sonars <b>126</b>, which can be ultrasonic sonars, in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Sensing system <b>120</b> can further include one or more cameras <b>128</b> to capture images of the driving environment. The images can be two-dimensional projections of the driving environment (or parts of the driving environment) onto a projecting plane (flat or non-flat, e.g. fisheye) of the cameras. Some of cameras <b>128</b> of sensing system <b>120</b> can be video cameras configured to capture a continuous (or quasi-continuous) stream of images of the driving environment.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The sensing data obtained by sensing system <b>120</b> can be processed by a perception system <b>130</b> that can be configured to detect and track objects in the driving environment and to identify the detected objects. For example, perception system <b>130</b> can analyze images captured by cameras <b>128</b> and can be capable of detecting traffic light signals, road signs, roadway layouts (e.g., boundaries of traffic lanes, topologies of intersections, designations of parking places, and so on), presence of obstacles, and the like. Perception system <b>130</b> can further receive the LiDAR sensing data (coherent Doppler data and incoherent ToF data) to determine distances to various objects in the environment and velocities of such objects. In some embodiments, perception system <b>130</b> can use the LiDAR data in combination with the data captured by the camera(s) <b>128</b>. In one example, the camera(s) <b>128</b> can detect an image of a rock partially obstructing a traffic lane. Using the data from the camera(s) <b>128</b>, the perception system <b>130</b> can be capable of determining the angular size of the rock, but not the linear size of the rock.

The sensor data can be stored in at least one data repository and can be retrieved form the at least one data repository. The processing logic can receive some or all of the sensor data from various components of an AV (e.g., mass distribution sensors of the AV), components that are not part of the AV (e.g., scales on which the AV is disposed), and/or from a server. The sensor data can include one or more of mass values at different distal ends of axles, weight values at different distal ends of axles, mass ratios of different distal ends of axles, weight ratios of different distal ends of axles, pressure values at different distal ends of axles responsive to the AV being leveled, displacement values at different distal ends of axles, suspension thickness values at different distal ends of axles, motion data (e.g., oscillation data of suspension springs, Eigen frequency data of the AV, frequency data of oscillation of the AV, frequency data of moment of the AV, etc.), and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some examples, the sensors are used to weigh the AV at individual wheels of the AV before the AV departs. In some examples, the sensors are air suspension bag pressure sensors (e.g., pressure sensors at bladders used to level the AV) that are used to determine the load of each axle (e.g., each distal end of each axle). Air pressure may be measured on each side of the trailer suspension to determine side-to-side (e.g., lateral) load. In some examples, sensor data from sensors that measure suspension deflection on the AV (e.g., tractor and/or trailer) is combined with suspension stiffness data (e.g., of suspension springs or air pressure bladders). In some examples, suspension deflection can be measured using laser sensors aimed at the AV (e.g., tractor, trailer) or surface under the AV (e.g., ground, roadway, etc.). In some examples sensors provide sensor data associated with the load on each axle (e.g., each distal end of each axle) in response to certain braking and/or acceleration maneuvers. The AV can proactively perform such pre-defined maneuvers (e.g., braking, accelerating, longitudinal motion, lateral motion, cornering, etc.) to determine mass distribution data (e.g., COG) by detecting how the load is transferred back and forth between axles and side-to-side between the wheels. The maneuvers may be performed early on in a driving mission (e.g., travelling a route).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">At operation <b>304</b>, the processing logic determines, based on the sensor data, mass distribution data of the AV. In some embodiments, the mass distribution data is one or more values or ratios associated with the distribution of the mass of the load of the AV (e.g., tractor and/or one or more trailers) over various axles and wheels of the AV. The mass distribution data can be used to choose an appropriate driving mode and level of risk (e.g., limiting trajectory of the AV).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The mass distribution data is associated with a first load proximate a first distal end of an axle of the AV and a second load proximate a second distal end of the axle of the AV. The mass distribution data may include one or more of vertical COG, lateral COG, longitudinal COG, mass values associated with different distal ends of axles, a ratio of a first load proximate a first distal end of an axle and a second load proximate a second distal end of the axle, suspension stiffness data of the AV, moment of inertia data of the AV, roll stiffness of the AV, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">At operation <b>306</b>, the processing logic determines, based on the mass distribution data a corrective action to be performed in association with the AV. The determining that a corrective action is to be performed may include one or more of determining a change in load (e.g., mass distribution data) of the AV, identifying a malfunctioning component of the AV, diagnosing a chassis issue (e.g., chassis property) of the AV), determining mass distribution data of an AV does not meet a threshold mass distribution, determining the AV is to travel an updated route, determining the AV is to travel with updated handling maneuver limits, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">At operation <b>308</b>, the processing logic causes performance of the corrective action. The corrective action can include one or more providing an alert, preventing travel of the AV, causing verification of load (e.g., location or positioning of cargo) of the AV, travel of the AV to a location to be inspected, causing the AV to travel based on mass distribution-informed strategy data (e.g., acceleration limits, braking limits, turning limits, which lanes to use, handling maneuver limits, etc.), selecting or updating a route for the AV to travel, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some embodiments, processing logic generates, based on the mass distribution data, mass distribution-informed strategy data for segments of a route to be travelled by an AV. In some embodiments, the mass distribution-informed strategy data includes context and/or constraints to improve actuator usage for one or more segments of the route.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Route data, topographic data, map data (e.g., roadway data, maximum and minimum speed limits, etc.), vehicle data (e.g., current vehicle configuration, total mass, wheelbase, etc.), best practices (e.g., professional driver strategies, heuristics, etc.), historical data (e.g., traffic, weather, etc.), sensor data, mass distribution data, and/or the like can be provided to the processing logic. The processing logic can incorporate this data to create the mass distribution-informed strategy data for the segments of the route. The mass distribution-informed strategy data for the segments of the route can include improved road and trajectory constraints for the routing module (e.g., altered location based maximum road speed limits, adapted location based trajectory limits, etc.) and additional context or constraints for the motion control module to improve actuator usage (e.g., recommended gear selection or representation of grade severity such as distance plus steepness, location based actuator strategies such as transmission, etc.).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, the mass distribution-informed strategy data includes a corresponding type of braking for one or more segments of the route. In some examples, the mass distribution-informed strategy data recommends friction braking (e.g., using friction brake pads) for a short downhill grade). In some examples, the mass distribution-informed strategy data recommends downshifting (e.g., putting the AV in a lower gear) and/or engine braking instead of friction braking for a longer downhill grade. For a corresponding segment, the mass distribution-informed strategy data may recommend one or more of regenerative braking, friction braking, engine braking, downshifting, exhaust braking, or using drive line retarders.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, the mass distribution-informed strategy data includes a corresponding calculated maximum speed (e.g., lower than the regulatory maximum speed) for one or more segments of the route based on physical limitations of the AV. In some example, the calculated maximum speed is based on the total mass of the AV, the engine capabilities of the AV, etc.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, the mass distribution-informed strategy data includes a corresponding gear (e.g., gear ratio) to be used for one or more segments of the route. In some embodiments, the corresponding gear is based on one or more of the calculated maximum speed, downshifting, deceleration, etc.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, the mass distribution-informed strategy data includes a corresponding rate of change of speed (e.g., acceleration, deceleration) for one or more segments of the route.
