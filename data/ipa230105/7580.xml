Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, or the like). Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems, and Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE/LTE-Advanced is a set of enhancements to the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wireless network may include one or more base stations that support communication for a user equipment (UE) or multiple UEs. A UE may communicate with a base station via downlink communications and uplink communications. &#x201c;Downlink&#x201d; (or &#x201c;DL&#x201d;) refers to a communication link from the base station to the UE, and &#x201c;uplink&#x201d; (or &#x201c;UL&#x201d;) refers to a communication link from the UE to the base station.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different UEs to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and/or global level. NR, which may be referred to as 5G, is a set of enhancements to the LTE mobile standard promulgated by the 3GPP. NR is designed to better support mobile broadband internet access by improving spectral efficiency, lowering costs, improving services, making use of new spectrum, and better integrating with other open standards using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with a cyclic prefix (CP) (CP-OFDM) on the downlink, using CP-OFDM and/or single-carrier frequency division multiplexing (SC-FDM) (also known as discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM)) on the uplink, as well as supporting beamforming, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology, and carrier aggregation. As the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase, further improvements in LTE, NR, and other radio access technologies remain useful.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some aspects described herein relate to a method of wireless communication performed by a user equipment (UE).

The wireless network <b>100</b> may be or may include elements of a 5G (e.g., NR) network and/or a 4G (e.g., Long Term Evolution (LTE)) network, among other examples. The wireless network <b>100</b> may include one or more base stations <b>110</b> (shown as a BS <b>110</b><i>a</i>, a BS <b>110</b><i>b</i>, a BS <b>110</b><i>c</i>, and a BS <b>110</b><i>d</i>), a user equipment (UE) <b>120</b> or multiple UEs <b>120</b> (shown as a UE <b>120</b><i>a</i>, a UE <b>120</b><i>b</i>, a UE <b>120</b><i>c</i>, a UE <b>120</b><i>d</i>, and a UE <b>120</b><i>e</i>), and/or other network entities. A base station <b>110</b> is an entity that communicates with UEs <b>120</b>. A base station <b>110</b> (sometimes referred to as a BS) may include, for example, an NR base station, an LTE base station, a Node B, an eNB (e.g., in 4G), a gNB (e.g., in 5G), an access point, and/or a transmission reception point (TRP). Each base station <b>110</b> may provide communication coverage for a particular geographic area. In the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; can refer to a coverage area of a base station <b>110</b> and/or a base station subsystem serving this coverage area, depending on the context in which the term is used.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A base station <b>110</b> may provide communication coverage for a macro cell, a pico cell, a femto cell, and/or another type of cell. A macro cell may cover a relatively large geographic area (e.g., several kilometers in radius) and may allow unrestricted access by UEs <b>120</b> with service subscriptions. A pico cell may cover a relatively small geographic area and may allow unrestricted access by UEs <b>120</b> with service subscription. A femto cell may cover a relatively small geographic area (e.g., a home) and may allow restricted access by UEs <b>120</b> having association with the femto cell (e.g., UEs <b>120</b> in a closed subscriber group (CSG)). A base station <b>110</b> for a macro cell may be referred to as a macro base station. A base station <b>110</b> for a pico cell may be referred to as a pico base station. A base station <b>110</b> for a femto cell may be referred to as a femto base station or an in-home base station. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be a macro base station for a macro cell <b>102</b><i>a</i>, the BS <b>110</b><i>b </i>may be a pico base station for a pico cell <b>102</b><i>b</i>, and the BS <b>110</b><i>c </i>may be a femto base station for a femto cell <b>102</b><i>c</i>. A base station may support one or multiple (e.g., three) cells.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some examples, a cell may not necessarily be stationary, and the geographic area of the cell may move according to the location of a base station <b>110</b> that is mobile (e.g., a mobile base station). In some examples, the base stations <b>110</b> may be interconnected to one another and/or to one or more other base stations <b>110</b> or network nodes (not shown) in the wireless network <b>100</b> through various types of backhaul interfaces, such as a direct physical connection or a virtual network, using any suitable transport network.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The wireless network <b>100</b> may include one or more relay stations. A relay station is an entity that can receive a transmission of data from an upstream station (e.g., a base station <b>110</b> or a UE <b>120</b>) and send a transmission of the data to a downstream station (e.g., a UE <b>120</b> or a base station <b>110</b>). A relay station may be a UE <b>120</b> that can relay transmissions for other UEs <b>120</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the BS <b>110</b><i>d </i>(e.g., a relay base station) may communicate with the BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>(e.g., a macro base station) and the UE <b>120</b><i>d </i>in order to facilitate communication between the BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>and the UE <b>120</b><i>d</i>. A base station <b>110</b> that relays communications may be referred to as a relay station, a relay base station, a relay, or the like.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The wireless network <b>100</b> may be a heterogeneous network that includes base stations <b>110</b> of different types, such as macro base stations, pico base stations, femto base stations, relay base stations, or the like. These different types of base stations <b>110</b> may have different transmit power levels, different coverage areas, and/or different impacts on interference in the wireless network <b>100</b>. For example, macro base stations may have a high transmit power level (e.g., 5 to 40 watts) whereas pico base stations, femto base stations, and relay base stations may have lower transmit power levels (e.g., 0.1 to 2 watts).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A network controller <b>130</b> may couple to or communicate with a set of base stations <b>110</b> and may provide coordination and control for these base stations <b>110</b>. The network controller <b>130</b> may communicate with the base stations <b>110</b> via a backhaul communication link. The base stations <b>110</b> may communicate with one another directly or indirectly via a wireless or wireline backhaul communication link.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The UEs <b>120</b> may be dispersed throughout the wireless network <b>100</b>, and each UE <b>120</b> may be stationary or mobile. A UE <b>120</b> may include, for example, an access terminal, a terminal, a mobile station, and/or a subscriber unit. A UE <b>120</b> may be a cellular phone (e.g., a smart phone), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem, a wireless communication device, a handheld device, a laptop computer, a cordless phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a tablet, a camera, a gaming device, a netbook, a smartbook, an ultrabook, a medical device, a biometric device, a wearable device (e.g., a smart watch, smart clothing, smart glasses, a smart wristband, smart jewelry (e.g., a smart ring or a smart bracelet)), an entertainment device (e.g., a music device, a video device, and/or a satellite radio), a vehicular component or sensor, a smart meter/sensor, industrial manufacturing equipment, a global positioning system device, and/or any other suitable device that is configured to communicate via a wireless medium.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Some UEs <b>120</b> may be considered machine-type communication (MTC) or evolved or enhanced machine-type communication (eMTC) UEs. An MTC UE and/or an eMTC UE may include, for example, a robot, a drone, a remote device, a sensor, a meter, a monitor, and/or a location tag, that may communicate with a base station, another device (e.g., a remote device), or some other entity. Some UEs <b>120</b> may be considered Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, and/or may be implemented as NB-IoT (narrowband IoT) devices. Some UEs <b>120</b> may be considered a Customer Premises Equipment. A UE <b>120</b> may be included inside a housing that houses components of the UE <b>120</b>, such as processor components and/or memory components. In some examples, the processor components and the memory components may be coupled together. For example, the processor components (e.g., one or more processors) and the memory components (e.g., a memory) may be operatively coupled, communicatively coupled, electronically coupled, and/or electrically coupled.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In general, any number of wireless networks <b>100</b> may be deployed in a given geographic area. Each wireless network <b>100</b> may support a particular RAT and may operate on one or more frequencies. A RAT may be referred to as a radio technology, an air interface, or the like. A frequency may be referred to as a carrier, a frequency channel, or the like. Each frequency may support a single RAT in a given geographic area in order to avoid interference between wireless networks of different RATs. In some cases, NR or 5G RAT networks may be deployed.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some examples, two or more UEs <b>120</b> (e.g., shown as UE <b>120</b><i>a </i>and UE <b>120</b><i>e</i>) may communicate directly using one or more sidelink channels (e.g., without using a base station <b>110</b> as an intermediary to communicate with one another). For example, the UEs <b>120</b> may communicate using peer-to-peer (P2P) communications, device-to-device (D2D) communications, a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) protocol (e.g., which may include a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) protocol, a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) protocol, or a vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) protocol), and/or a mesh network. In such examples, a UE <b>120</b> may perform scheduling operations, resource selection operations, and/or other operations described elsewhere herein as being performed by the base station <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Devices of the wireless network <b>100</b> may communicate using the electromagnetic spectrum, which may be subdivided by frequency or wavelength into various classes, bands, channels, or the like. For example, devices of the wireless network <b>100</b> may communicate using one or more operating bands. In 5G NR, two initial operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR1 (410 MHz-7.125 GHz) and FR2 (24.25 GHz-52.6 GHz). It should be understood that although a portion of FR1 is greater than 6 GHz, FR1 is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;Sub-6 GHz&#x201d; band in various documents and articles. A similar nomenclature issue sometimes occurs with regard to FR2, which is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band in documents and articles, despite being different from the extremely high frequency (EHF) band (30 GHz-300 GHz) which is identified by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The frequencies between FR1 and FR2 are often referred to as mid-band frequencies. Recent 5G NR studies have identified an operating band for these mid-band frequencies as frequency range designation FR3 (7.125 GHz-24.25 GHz). Frequency bands falling within FR3 may inherit FR1 characteristics and/or FR2 characteristics, and thus may effectively extend features of FR1 and/or FR2 into mid-band frequencies. In addition, higher frequency bands are currently being explored to extend 5G NR operation beyond 52.6 GHz. For example, three higher operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR4a or FR4-1 (52.6 GHz-71 GHz), FR4 (52.6 GHz-114.25 GHz), and FR5 (114.25 GHz-300 GHz). Each of these higher frequency bands falls within the EHF band.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">With the above examples in mind, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;sub-6 GHz&#x201d; or the like, if used herein, may broadly represent frequencies that may be less than 6 GHz, may be within FR1, or may include mid-band frequencies. Further, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; or the like, if used herein, may broadly represent frequencies that may include mid-band frequencies, may be within FR2, FR4, FR4-a or FR4-1, and/or FR5, or may be within the EHF band. It is contemplated that the frequencies included in these operating bands (e.g., FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR4-a, FR4-1, and/or FR5) may be modified, and techniques described herein are applicable to those modified frequency ranges.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some aspects, the UE <b>120</b> may include a communication manager <b>140</b>.

A base station of the NR network may include multiple active array units (AAUs) to support NR communications, and the AAUs may consume 90% of the power used by the NR base station. An NR base station may consume more than 3 times the power consumed by an LTE base station, because the NR base station may operate in a higher band, over a larger bandwidth, and with more TRPs. High power consumption involves high operating expenses that reduce operator profits. Furthermore, high power consumption may impact the environment because electricity generation may increase carbon emissions.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to various aspects described herein, the NR network may optimize power consumption as part of a green NR network. An NR base station of the NR network (e.g., base station <b>110</b>), or at least a portion of the AAU of the base station <b>110</b>, may sleep or wake up as needed. For example, the base station <b>110</b> may use 0-8 antenna ports, rather than 64 antenna ports, from midnight to 3 am. To further reduce power, the base station <b>110</b> may transmit synchronization signal blocks (SSBs) every 160 milliseconds (ms) rather than every 20 ms. The base station <b>110</b> conserves power in sleep mode, and the base station <b>110</b> in a sleep mode may be referred to as a &#x201c;dormant cell.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some aspects, the base station <b>110</b> may be a base station that provides a coverage cell (e.g., primary cell (PCell), or controls one or more TRPs for transmitting SSB broadcasts or connecting UEs. In some aspects, the base station <b>110</b> may be a base station that provides a capacity boosting cell or controls capacity boosting TRPs (e.g., secondary cell (SCell)). A capacity boosting base station may be in the sleep mode and may enter the active mode when needed. For example, the capacity boosting base station may be employed at stadium events, where large numbers of UEs are congregating. The capacity boosting base station may enter the sleep mode after the event ends.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The base station <b>110</b> is to be in the active mode when transmitting periodic SSB broadcasts (and other system information), when monitoring for physical RACH (PRACH) messages from UEs in PRACH occasions, and when monitoring for small data transmissions (SDTs). If there are UEs that are to enter into a connected state or transmit an SDT, the base station <b>110</b> is expected to be in the active mode. Accordingly, the base station <b>110</b> may wake up in response to a physical layer WUS from the UE <b>120</b>. The WUS for the base station <b>110</b> may enable the base station <b>110</b> to sleep to reduce network power consumption and to improve network energy efficiency. The WUS may also enable predicted sleep periods for the base station <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some aspects, the UE <b>120</b> may transmit the WUS as a proactive signal, such as before a first step of a 4-step RACH procedure or a 2-step RACH procedure. The first step of the 4-step RACH procedure may include the UE <b>120</b> transmitting a preamble (sometimes referred to as a random access preamble, a PRACH preamble, or a RAM preamble), which may be referred to as a message 1, msg1, MSG1, a first message, or an initial message in a four-step RACH procedure. The first step of the 2-step RACH procedure may include the UE <b>120</b> transmitting a random access message (RAM) preamble and a RAM payload. The RAM may be referred to as message A, msgA, a first message, or an initial message in a 2-step RACH procedure.

The UE <b>120</b> may be aware of the dormancy of the base station <b>110</b> and, as shown by reference number <b>305</b>, may prepare to wake up the base station <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown by reference number <b>310</b>, the UE <b>120</b> may transmit a WUS.

WUS occasions may be dedicated for transmission and reception of a WUS. The base station <b>110</b> may reach a certain level of activity during a WUS occasion in order to monitor for the WUS. Each WUS occasion may be a time-frequency resource that occurs for a configured duration at a configured periodicity. The configured duration and period may be part of a WUS occasion numerology. The base station <b>110</b> may configure the UE <b>120</b> with a set of WUS occasions and/or with the WUS occasion numerology. The UE <b>120</b> may also obtain the WUS occasion numerology from stored configuration information (according to standardized parameters).

In a one-to-many mapping, one SSB may be mapped to multiple WUS occasions. In a many-to-one mapping, multiple SSBs may be mapped to one WUS occasion.

For example, the WUS may be step 0 of a RACH procedure and include a preamble that is transmitted before the preamble of a first step of the RACH procedure.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The base station <b>110</b> may detect the WUS in WUS occasion <b>314</b>. As shown by reference number <b>320</b>, the base station <b>110</b> may enter an active mode from the sleep mode or otherwise dormant state. The base station <b>110</b> may determine an active time, including a start time for the active mode and/or a duration of the active mode. The base station may generate a confirmation message, which may include an active time indication that specifies the start time and/or duration for the active mode.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown by reference number <b>325</b>, the base station <b>110</b> may transmit the confirmation message. The confirmation message may be downlink control information (DCI) that schedules a paging physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) or a paging early indication (PEI). The confirmation message may be a reference signal (e.g., a new reference signal designated for responding to a WUS) or a message on a channel that is designated for a response to a WUS. The base station <b>110</b> may broadcast the confirmation message to multiple UEs. The base station <b>110</b> may also receive confirmation messages.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The WUS may include other information. In some aspects, the WUS may include a request for PRACH message repetition. PRACH message repetition involves repeating the same PRACH message multiple times. This may help to improve reception of the PRACH message from UEs at a cell edge. The UE <b>120</b> may include the request for PRACH message repetition based at least in part on a trigger, such as an SSB RSRP satisfying a signal threshold (e.g., minimum RSRP). The trigger may also be the UE <b>120</b> satisfying a power class threshold (e.g., minimum UE power class). The UE <b>120</b> may also use other criteria (e.g., RSRQ, RSSI, signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)) to trigger the request for PRACH message repetition. In some aspects, the WUS may indicate a UE capability for supporting PRACH message repetition. Note that the request for PRACH message repetition may be an implicit indication of a UE capability of the UE <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some aspects, the UE <b>120</b> may select the WUS from two or more sets of WUSs or WUS resources. For example, one WUS set may be for only waking up a base station (cell) and one WUS set may be for waking up the base station and requesting PRACH message repetition. The sets of WUSs may include WUSs that are associated with different WUS occasions. The sets of WUSs may also include different signals or different sequences for WUSs. Different WUSs may be transmitted in the same WUS occasion.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some aspects, the UE <b>120</b> may select a transmit power for the WUS. The transmit power for the WUS may be the same or different than a transmit power for a communication (e.g., Msg1, MsgA) that follows the WUS. As shown by reference number <b>330</b>, the UE <b>120</b> may transmit the communication. The transmit power for the communication may be based at least in part on the transmit power for the WUS. In some aspects, there may be a power offset between the transmit power for the communication and the transmit power for the WUS. The UE <b>120</b> may transmit the WUS and the communication based at least in part on the power offset. In some aspects, the base station <b>110</b> may also transmit communications, such as a Msg2 or a MsgB.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As indicated above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is provided as an example.
