In the U.S. alone it is estimated that over 4 million people suffer from peripheral artery disease which, in severe cases, is treated with surgery or even amputation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Flat lesions represent a significant challenge in gastroenterology. Removing of sessile and flat polyps, which may be associated with high risk for malignancy, requires, in most cases, usage of different techniques than those used for removing common polyps. These techniques may lead to the referral of patients to surgery instead of removal by the gastroenterologist. Other challenging lesions are nonpolypoid colorectal neoplasms (NP-CRNs). Barrett's esophagus is another common chronic condition. The prevalence in the U.S. population is estimated to be in the range of 1-2% of the adult population. Barrett's esophagus condition may lead to violent esophageal cancer, which is said to result in over 12,000 deaths per year in the U.S. alone and around 100,000 in China.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Laser and Mechanical Based Solutions for Angioplasty, Atherectomy and Thrombectomy:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The current state of the art in laser ablation technology for vascular intervention is based on use of an Excimer lasers with dedicated catheters such as Spectranetics' CVX-300&#xae; laser and TURBO-Booster&#xae; catheter. These technologies are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,673,064, 7,811,281 and 7,572,254. Due to technical and safety considerations, the excimer laser used, generally, is often a Xenon Chloride laser operative at 308 nm with pulse widths in the range of 100 nanoseconds. These technologies are not ideal and have some limitations. For example, when dealing with heavy calcified plaques, there is a risk of perforation and damage from debris/plaque fragments. Therefore, the procedure requires a complex, large and costly system and the length of the procedure is quite significant in a manner that seems to limit its wide clinical utility. In addition, the technique had difficulties in treatment of large vessels such as SFA (Superficial Femoral Artery) which is very important in management of peripheral artery disease (PAD) wherein vessels larger than 4-5 mm in diameter and long lesions have to be treated.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One of the reasons for the length of the process is that even one of the most advanced solutions, combining the TURBO-Booster&#xae; and the TURBO Laser Elite catheters, may require a number of steps starting with atherectomy to create an initial pilot channel through the whole lesion, for example using the laser catheter alone, and only at later stages the laser catheter is loaded into the introducer sheath. The use of the catheter is based on several passages, each after rotation of the catheter. See Schwarzwalder U, Zeller T, Tech Vase Intery Radiol. 2010 March; 13(1):43-53.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additional limitations of this solution include ineffective removal of arterial debris and high risk of artery walls injury, as mentioned, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,962,585:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">&#x201c;An Excimer Laser Coronary Angioplasty system and procedure offered by Spectranetics of Colorado Springs, Colo., involves the insertion into an artery of a laser catheter containing a bundle of optical fibers and a stent with a guide wire. The laser catheter is advanced in the artery until the guide wire crosses a blockage, at which time bursts of ultraviolet (cool) laser light is transmitted through the fiber optic fibers to open a hole in the blockage. Thereafter, an x-ray contrast dye is injected into the blood stream to determine the extent to which the artery has been opened. This procedure does not remove substantial amounts of blockage because ultra violet radiation is too cool to melt the blockage. Rather, a hole is blasted through the blockage to accommodate the admission of a stent.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">While the catherization system includes a filter, the filter is not sufficient to catch all debris which may flow downstream.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">Such prior systems have failed because they have not effectively removed arterial blockage from the artery walls, and have not effectively removed arterial debris from the artery once the arterial blockage has been dislodged. In addition, such prior systems have not adequately protected the artery walls from physical or thermal injury. Further, many of the prior art devices embody numerous parts which tend to fail or shatter in a high temperature/high vacuum environment.&#x201d; (id, p. 1, ln. 19)</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0012">An alternative approach using IR laser for thermal heating of a tip used to cut the plaques to be removed with suction is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,962,585. This approach may suffer from the limitations and risk involved with plaque removal based on non-selective heating. The approach proposed in this case is to use arterial guards in the outer part of the catheter that may limit the passage of the catheter and avoid getting closer to the walls. Other attempts to use thermal effects include a hybrid thermal probe, wherein most of the laser energy (Argon or Nd:YAG) is used to heat the hot tip in the catheter, and part of it escapes as laser light. Clinical results were not satisfactory to enable routine clinical use.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">Additional prior approaches include use of a laser to core the plaque and use of mechanical means to &#x201c;ingest&#x201d; and remove the plaque. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,979,939. In Canadian Patent No. 1,326,800 a fiber is introduced to create an opening through which the distal rotary is introduced and the second fiber is used to vaporize the material collected by the blade. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0125253 discloses a dual tip catheter for treating chronic total occlusions through which a fiber may be introduced.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0014">In view of the complexity and limitations of the laser based technologies, the systems based on excimer laser have had limited spread in clinical use, and alternative mechanical methods for atherectomy have been developed, for example, wherein the plaques are &#x201c;shaved&#x201d; (the EV3 product), &#x201c;drilled&#x201d; (the Pathway product) or &#x201c;sanded&#x201d; with a rotating diamond coated brush (the CSI product). Each of these techniques may often suffer from inherent limitations such as procedure length, injury to the blood vessels, difficulty in dealing with calcified plaques in certain cases and, on the contrary, dealing with soft plaque (see Schwarzwalder U, Zeller T, Tech Vase Intery Radiol. 2010 March; 13(1):43-53) or discarding of plaque material into the blood stream</p><p id="p-0013" num="0015">It should be noted that it is assumed by experts in the area that injury of healthy tissue and the characteristics of the tissue after plaque is removed may affect the healing (and initial hyperplasia) and the rate of restenosis which seems to be a limitation of some of the above-mentioned techniques. Furthermore, in view of the limited capabilities to remove plaque with many prior techniques, their current utility is limited mainly for use in conjunction with low pressure balloon angioplasty used after plaque is partially removed. The balloon then opens the vessel with the remaining plaque material.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0016">The need to deal with complete or partial blockage in vessels applies also to artificial grafts, such as those implanted in the legs for bypass, for hemodialyisis access and more.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0017">In-stent-restenosis. It is known in the art that in a significant percentage of the patients that underwent stent implantation, restenosis occurs within a few years after implantation. This is a major issue with bare-metal stents (BMS) and even introduction of drug eluting stents (DES) that show a robust decrease of restenosis still does not completely solve the problem.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">Acute blockage of vessels. There is also a need for tools that quickly open blood vessels in patients that suffer from ischemic stroke (caused by blockage of a blood vessel) or in heart attacks with the minimal risk of perforation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019">Removal of pacemaker and defibrillator leads. Presently there is a growing need to remove pacemaker and defibrillators leads in a subset of patients due to several reasons such lead fracture, abrasion of the insulation causing shorting and infections. Approximately 5 million leads are implanted worldwide and it is estimated that 4-7% will have to be removed at certain time point. It is estimated that over 100,000 leads were extracted in the US and Europe in 2010.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">There are several approaches to remove transvenously introduced ICD leads. If leads have been in place for only a short period, they can frequently be removed by simple traction. After the leads are in place for long time scar tissue may withholds the leads during traction, the force applied to the leads is limited by the tensile strength of the insulation and conductor coils, therefore locking stylets and sheaths are used to enable a more forceful tension, but successful lead removal can still be very problematic when the leads is attached to sensitive tissue such myocardial wall. In severe cases lead extraction may require open surgery. The Spectranetics Excimer Laser and Cook Medical's Evolution products are currently used for lead removal using transcatheter techniques. The &#x201c;debulking&#x201d; of the lead using an excimer laser has yielded good clinical results but requires a large and expensive laser that does not allow wide use in any cardiology unit and a relative long learning curve is required.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">There is a need for an effective and safe solution for removal of pacemakers and defibrillator leads in patients.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">Management of Barrette's Esophagus. Barrett's Esophagus (BE) is a common disorder that is a major risk factor for esophagus cancer. The prevalence of the disorder is estimated to be in the range of 1-2%. See Ronkainen J, Aro P, Storskrubb T, et al. (December 2005) &#x201c;Prevalence of Barrett's esophagus in the general population: an endoscopic study&#x201d;, Gastroenterology 129 (6): 1825-31. The range of severity can vary from early stage to different grades of dysplasia to cancer. Prior attempts to manage this condition with Argon coagulation yielded controversial results. Alternative methods are based on RF ablation (RFA) (Halo&#xae; System), photodynamic therapy (PDT), cryo, thermal therapy or surgery as endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). No method resulted in wide clinical acceptance that can enable routine use in a broad population instead of &#x201c;waiting and watching&#x201d; in early stages in the disease and specific therapies including esophagus resection in more sever conditions.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">Furthermore, as no single technique has been established as the preferred method, a combination of techniques is used in certain cases. For example, there may be a consensus that RFA is useful for patients with BE and high-grade dysplasia (HGD), BE and intramucosal carcinoma as an adjunct to endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). The use of RFA for BE with low-grade dysplasia (LGD) or intestinal metaplasia is not clearly established, see David E. Fleischer_Virender K. Sharma, Interventional and Therapeutic Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Front Gastrointest Res. Basel, Karger, 2010, vol 27, pp 140-146. On the other hand, EMR sometimes does not allow removing all of the Barrett's lining but can be successful in removing a small cancer or a localized area of high-grade dysplasia. Because it does not remove all of the Barrett's lining, the Barrett's lining left behind can develop other areas of high-grade dysplasia or cancer. Therefore, EMR is sometimes combined with photodynamic therapy in an attempt to remove remaining Barrett's tissue or with RF ablation. Conversely, several photodynamic therapy studies have also reported that a few patients have a situation in which the Barrett's lining does not completely go away but is still there, underneath the new normal-appearing squamous lining (and detected when biopsy is performed that shows that small areas of Barrett's lining are still there underneath the new squamous lining.) In such a case, another course of treatment with another technique might be beneficial.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">Complications of the current available techniques include perforations (making a hole in the esophagus), bleeding, strictures, light sensitivity in PDT and even death.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025">Removal of challenging lesions in intestine and stomach. Some of the polyps and adenomas (benign tumors) detected with an increasing percent in colonoscopy, with different imaging techniques, do not have a conventional &#x201c;pedunculated&#x201d; shape. Polyps that are not attached to the surface by a narrow elongated stalk are called sessile. Other polyps are not significantly elevated from the adjacent mucosa are called flat. Accordingly, the removal of large sessile and flat colorectal is more difficult than removal of pedunculated polyps and in many cases require using special endoscopy techniques to avoid perforation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026">These lesions may be associated with high clinical risk. The incidence of cancer with submucosal invasion appears to be higher in flat-type lateral spreading tumors.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027">Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) is becoming the standard technique for resection of large sessile and flat colorectal lesions. For the more challenging lesions, Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) can be used. ESD can be performed using a viscous injection solution for sustained submucosal lifting, a diathermy knife, and a plastic hood to help retract the polyp as it is dissected away from the muscularis propria.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028">Although these techniques are feasible anywhere in the colon, currently these techniques are technically challenging and time consuming and ESD carries a relatively high rate of major complication. Laser ablation is usually not perceived as an adequate solution for this application, as there is a need to assure adequate (i.e. complete) removal of pathological tissue and preferably to collect resected samples for histological analysis</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029">There is thus an unmet need in the art for devices, systems and methods that would allow efficient and effective vascular interventions as well as removal of challenging lesions in the gastroenterology (GI) track (mainly in colon and stomach) and Barrett's esophagus management.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0030">Removal of challenging lesions in gynecology and urology. There is a need for effective and safe tools for removal of pathological tissue in gynecology (cervical uterus) and urology (urinary bladder, prostate), wherein the depth of resection can be controlled while risk of perforation and bleeding is minimized.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0031">There is provided, in accordance with some embodiments, a catheter for debulking of an undesired deposit from an inner surface of at least one of a blood vessel wall and a stent located in a blood vessel, the catheter having a tip section comprising: circumferentially-directed laser optics;

For example, present embodiments may be useful in various vascular applications, such as atherectomy, angioplasty, debulking of plaque in in-stent restenosis, leads extraction, thrombectomy in chronic peripheral and coronary artery diseases and for management of acute blockage of vessels in coronary and neurovascular applications. Another example is the use of embodiments in gastroenterology, such as for removal of sessile and flat lesions in the GI track, Barrett's Esophagus management and in analogous applications requiring removal of tissue from the inner walls in gynecology and urology interventions.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0126">The hybrid catheter may be based on a combination of laser and mechanical removal (also &#x201c;debulking&#x201d;) of an undesired material from a bodily lumen. In vascular interventions, the catheter may be configured to weaken and/or even cut and detach undesired material with a laser and then, even in cases where the plaque material was not entirely removed, detaching the rest of the plaque material by mechanical means, such as using a blade. The laser may change the mechanical characteristics of tissue, and thereby improve performance of mechanical tools such as various types of blades or shavers. By way of example, the laser may make a soft tissue crispier so it can be effectively crushed using the mechanical tool.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0127">Advantageously, usage of the present catheter may obviate the need to photo-ablate (evaporate) most or all of the undesired material. Accordingly, the process may be faster and result in lesser by-products than in common laser ablation, lesser associated mechanical stress and lesser other side effects such as thermal injury resulting from photo ablation. The process may allow using smaller lasers wherein energy is focused at a smaller area and wherein mechanical tools remove traces remaining in the treated area and facilitate further penetration of the laser beam to proceed in effective ablation. In addition, challenging calcified tissue may be successfully treated, despite the difficulty in many of today's common mechanical or excimer lasers to delicately detach such tissue from the vessel's walls. The present catheter, advantageously, provides for controlled cutting of plaque with minimal or no damage to the vessel's walls.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0128">This hybrid catheter disclosed herein may be used (for example in atherectomy) alone and/or in conjunction with low pressure balloon angioplasty, stenting, for treating in-stent restenosis with no damage to the stent, and/or for treatment of acute blockages due to plaques and or thrombus (thrombectomy).</p><p id="p-0127" num="0129">The terms &#x201c;cut&#x201d;, &#x201c;dissect&#x201d;, &#x201c;resect&#x201d;, &#x201c;detach&#x201d;, &#x201c;debulk&#x201d; and &#x201c;remove&#x201d; may be used here interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0130">According to some embodiments, the catheter comprises a tip section, which may be essentially in a cylindrical shape, having circumferentially-directed laser optics, optionally in the form of one or more optical fibers, configured to deliver laser radiation, and a circular-action cutter including one or more blades configured to assist in cutting and/or detaching undesired materials (also &#x201c;deposits&#x201d;) from an inner surface of a blood vessel. The one or more optical fibers may be circumferentially-directed, namely, they may be located along an inner surface of the cylindrical tip section, which is near the periphery of the tip section. Alternatively, the circumferentially-directed optical fibers may be located elsewhere but directed, by way of orientation and/or optical focusing, to radiate an area in front of the circumference of the tip section.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0131">The circular-action cutter may be located in a central part of the tip section, for example, surrounded by the optical fibers. Alternatively, the circular-action cutter may be located in the periphery of the tip section and the one or more optical fibers are located in a central part of the tip section, for example, surrounded by blades.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0132">According to some embodiments, the one or more optical fibers and the one or more blades are located in the periphery of the tip section.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0133">According to some embodiments, the one or more optical fibers and the one or more blades are located in a central part of the tip section.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0134">According to some embodiments, the circular-action cutter lays on a spring so that a maximum force applied by the cutter is predetermined in order to avoid potential damage, yet be effective. The tip section may include an inner channel maintained at a relative low pressure to suck the undesired material which may be plaque, thrombus material, debris, saline solution used for cleaning and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0135">Optionally, a motor is provided to rotate the circular-action cutter in order to improve fragment cutting and/or detaching. Additionally or alternatively, the motor or a different motor may be used to rapidly vibrate the circular-action cutter in order to improve fragment cutting and/or detaching.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0136">Optionally, the circular-action cutter is heated to improve its performance. This may be done by an external heat source, electrical means and/or by the laser radiation.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0137">According to some embodiments, the catheter tip may be expandable, such that its diameter may be increased after its introduction into the vessel.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0138">According to some embodiments, the catheter tip may include means for deflection, such that effective working area will be larger than the catheter diameter and enable off-axis work.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0139">According to some embodiments, the catheter may be useful in cases of Chronic Total Occlusions (CTO), where a guidewire cannot normally be used to pass lesions totally blocking the vessel, and therefore atherectomy is often not feasible, since usage of a guidewire often dictates a certain relative position, and angle in particular, of the catheter's tip section versus the vessel.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0140">An example of an appropriate laser of some embodiments is a solid state ultraviolet (UV) laser emitting pulses in approximately 355 nm and/or 266 nm. An example of an appropriate laser is the Qauntel CFR400, emitting 50 mJ, 10 ns pulses of 355 nm at 50 Hz and/or 40 mJ of 266 nm at 40 Hz. Another example is an Excimer laser.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0141">In case of using significantly high repetition rates, thermal effects in the tissue may become a problem This can be at least partially resolved by minimizing ablation area (depth and width), use of short laser pulses and with saline flushing.

Additionally or alternatively, radiation at around 2 microns may be used, with a preference for thulium laser emitting at 1910-1940 nm range wherein there is higher absorption of water preferably combined with Q-switched modulation wherein ablation is more effective and reduces lateral damage. For 3 micron emission, an Er:YAG may be used, or another source such as a Mid-IR Holmium Fiber Laser Directly Pumped with Diode Laser that emits at 2840 nm using fluoride fibers [see <i>Optics Letters</i>, Sep. 1, 2007, pp. 2496-2498].</p><p id="p-0142" num="0144">Yet another example is usage of a third harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser at 355 nm, preferably a compact, all solid state, diode pumped laser.

Optionally, very short pulse widths (such as &#x3c;1O ns) are used, in order to obtain a higher power density, and, in particular, to be able to ablate calcified plaques. In accordance with some embodiments, the energy per pulse is in the range of 10-1O0 mJ and the pulse frequency is in the range of 10-1O0 Hz.

The present embodiments, however, may successfully utilize third harmonic Nd:YAG lasers instead of complex and expensive Excimer lasers. The present embodiments address several problems. For example, in some embodiments, it may not be necessary to laser-ablate all the material whose removal is desired, but rather the laser and the mechanical cutter may share the task; the laser may ablate and/or weaken at least some of the material, while the mechanical cutter completes the job by finally detaching the material from the walls.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0147">In some embodiments, a laser that emits radiation in 266 nm may be used. This wavelength has a shorter penetration rate in addition use of compact Excimer laser emitting radiation at 308 nm, as currently used, can be utilized with the current embodiments. According to some embodiments, a system may include means that enable an operator to switch between 266 nm and 355 nm, generated from the same Nd:YAG laser, and means to control power, repetition rate and/or exposure/illumination of specific fiber groups.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0148">An alternative embodiment of the present invention replaces UV lasers with a laser with radiation in the 2 micron or 2.8-3 microns, in which ablation is very effective.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0149">Holmium lasers are conventionally used for 2 microns but Thulium lasers have a stronger water absorption and smaller absorption length, which makes them especially suitable for some embodiments.

An advantage of an embodiment using a laser in the region of 2.9-3 micron is that the absorption is very high and results in very short length of absorption, in the order of 15 microns only.

The laser beam may be directed through fibers each having a core diameter optionally in the range of 40-250 microns. In a configuration where the catheter's circumference is, for example, 15 mm, using fibers with an outer diameter of 50 microns will result in using approximately 300 fibers with a cross-section area smaller than 1 mm<sup>2</sup>, so that for a coupling efficiency of 75%, the energy at the exit of each fiber will be close to 40 mj/mm when pumped with a 50 mJ laser. Adequate fibers for some embodiments may be all-silica fibers with a pure silica core. These fibers can usually withstand about 5 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>in the input. Some embodiments include fibers with a numerical aperture (NA) in the range of 0.12-0.22. An example of a relevant fiber is FiberTech Optica's SUV1O0/ll0AN fiber for UV application and the low OH version SIR100/140AN for use with laser in the 1900-2100 nm range or Infrared Fiber Systems, IR Photonics and A.RT. Photonics GmbH fibers for transmission of radiation in the 2900-3000 range.

According to some embodiments, high peak power is maintained and accordingly the catheter may include means for delivery of the laser power through relatively bigger optical fibers, e.g. 100 or even 300 micron fibers that do not extend all the way to the end of the tip section, as schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>E</figref>.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0167"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows a tip section <b>300</b> which includes a hollow reflective light concentrator <b>304</b><i>a </i>with a straight profile or a concave profile (as shown), used to concentrate light from at least two fibers (shown jointly at <b>304</b>).

The use of a larger catheter holds the advantage of enhancing the intervention process, but raises an issue of a large opening required for introduction into the vessel and/or accessibility within the vessel itself. Therefore, according to some embodiments, the diameter of the catheter, at least at its tip section, may be expandable. A first example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, which is a cross-sectional view of an expandable tip section <b>500</b>.

When the catheter reaches the debulking site, tip section <b>500</b> is expanded, to form an outwardly-tapered shape. This expansion may be achieved by introducing a mechanical element which applies pressure on one or more parts in tip section <b>500</b>. Fibers <b>504</b> that transmit the laser beam, may then be inserted into the catheter's walls. Since when the tip section <b>500</b> is expended the distance between the fibers also extends, more fibers may be inserted into the walls.

Nitinol may be used in a structure of a mesh or a braid, to provide sufficient radial force while enabling contraction with low enough radial forces when the catheter is retracted. Some flexibility may still remain at the tip section, to allow accommodation to the physiological shape of lumen. The tip may also include means for controlled deflection.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0176">In some embodiments, the catheter may perform local delivery of drugs which reduce the incident of restenosis, such as Paclitaxel and its derivatives, or soluble forms such as Coroxane.

This may be accomplished by means such as pressure-controlled drug administration, administration below the surface and/or selection of adequate drug forms.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0179">In order to increase absorption of plaque material, the treatment procedure may include administration of one or more substances that increase absorption of plaque at 335 nm such as treating with tetracycline for which the uptake by plaque is a few times larger than in normal tissue.

The motivation is to remove the undesired pathological tissue with minimal complications (e.g., in case of Barrett's esophagus, without esophageal perforations and strictures). This clinical application may require modified embodiments of the hybrid catheters disclosed herein in accordance with some embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrate catheters for detaching undesired tissue from an inner wall of a body cavity, for example, but not limited to, Barrett's esophagus management, according to embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0191">The first embodiment is a hybrid catheter which combines a utility of laser radiation to ablate and cut/detach the undesired pathological tissue or modify its mechanical characteristics and mechanical means such a blade or a sharp edge of a wall of the catheter to complete the detaching. This way, the tissue is resected/dissected using the laser radiation and the blade/wall's edge. Thus the blade/wall's edge does not need to be too sharp and are thus configured to cut the tissue without the risk of potential perforation or damage to the body cavity.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0192">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, which shows an exemplary tip section <b>1000</b> of a hybrid device in perspective view, mounted on an endoscope <b>1500</b>, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. The remainder of the catheter namely&#x2014;its shaft (not shown) may, in some embodiments, be biocompatible housing, optionally coated so as to reduce friction with the cavity's wall. Endoscope <b>1500</b> may be any commercially available scope having, inter alia, working channel <b>1502</b>, for insertion of medical tools, water/air injector(s) <b>1504</b> for cleaning and insufflation, and illuminators <b>1506</b>. Endoscope <b>1500</b> may also include a camera <b>1508</b> including CCD, CMOS or MOS sensors for example and optics.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0193">Tip section <b>1000</b> is positioned at the distal end of the hybrid catheter, the end which is inserted into the body cavity such as the esophagus. Tip section <b>1000</b> has a shape of a sector of a cylinder and is generally configured to be mounted on top of an endoscope (for example, as used in upper endoscopy or colonoscopy). The shape of tip section <b>1000</b> is also configured match the typical anatomy of the body cavity to which it is intended to be inserted. Of course, the tip section of the hybrid catheter (device) may have other appropriate shapes and forms, and can mounted in certain embodiments on another working tool that is used to manipulate it while the process is monitored with another camera such as in laparoscopic procedures. Tip section <b>1000</b> may include two walls, an external wall <b>1002</b> and an internal wall <b>1004</b>. One of the walls (external wall <b>1002</b> and an internal wall <b>1004</b>) or both of them may have sharp distal edges to facilitate cutting through the undesired tissue. One of the walls (external wall <b>1002</b> and an internal wall <b>1004</b>) or both of them may be coated with a material that provides sharper edges. At least one optic fiber(s), typically a plurality of optical fiber(s) <b>1006</b> are positioned between external wall <b>1002</b> and an internal wall <b>1004</b>. Alternatively, in an embodiment (not shown), there may exist only one wall and the optic fibers may be located along an internal or an external surface thereof. Alternatively, in an embodiment (not shown), there may exist a cutter (similar to the cutter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref> only having a shape of a sector of a cylinder). In another embodiment, external wall <b>1002</b>, an internal wall <b>1004</b> and/or a cutter (blade) may have two positions, retracted position and protruded position (configured for cutting).</p><p id="p-0192" num="0194">The external wall <b>1002</b>, an internal wall <b>1004</b> and/or a cutter (blade) are configured (such as by virtue of sharpness) to cut through the undesired tissue and thereby detach at least a part of the undesired tissue from the inner wall of the body cavity. If a blade is present, it may be a rotary-action blade and/or a vibrating blade. According to some embodiments, optical fibers <b>1006</b> are configured to transmit laser radiation configured to modify an area of the undesired tissue thereby preparing said area for penetration of external wall <b>1002</b>, an internal wall <b>1004</b> and/or a cutter (blade).</p><p id="p-0193" num="0195">According to some embodiments, the blade may be mounted in a spring so that when force is applied beyond a certain predetermined level the blade enters into its compartment (shifts to retracted position). Alternatively, in another embodiment the position of the blade may be controlled by a physician. This way, the blade is not sharp enough to cut the tissue without the laser so as to avoid potential perforation. Flushing of saline or another appropriate solution at the edge of the catheter may be used to maintain an optical clean path, remove unnecessary material and reduce potential thermal damage and use a &#x201c;water spray&#x201d; effect with mid-IR radiation sources.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0196">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, which shows a hybrid catheter mounted on an endoscope, during a procedure of detaching/resecting (&#x201c;peeling&#x201d;) an undesired tissue, according to some embodiments. Hybrid catheter <b>1001</b> includes a tip section <b>1000</b>, transmitting laser radiation and cutting through the tissue. In this figure, hybrid catheter <b>1001</b> is used to remove the Barrett's tissue <b>1008</b>. The illustration shows that different layers can be targeted and removed. Barrett's tissue <b>1008</b> (or any other undesired tissue) is cut by catheter and lifted. The catheter, such as catheter <b>1001</b>, may be (not necessarily) assembled on a commercially available endoscope, such as endoscope <b>1600</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). According to some embodiments, the tip section of the hybrid catheter (particularly but not limited to) in interventions in the GI track may be position in predetermined angle versus the scope axis and thereby predetermining the depth of penetration of the tip according to the peeling depth required.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0197">&#x201c;Peeling&#x201d; like mode can be thought of in analogy to a &#x201c;carpenter plane&#x201d; but using a &#x201c;hybrid blade&#x201d;. The depth of peeling can be adjusted according to the clinical condition such as the depth for Barrett's removal or required according to the stage of the disease and similarly in flat lesion in other places of the GI track. Accordingly the position of the blade knife can be adjusted as well as the distance between the blade and the plane. The catheter with a hybrid blade can be located at a predetermined angle/position and distance from the plane of the endoscope or another tool used to hold the tip. In this embodiment that catheter can be used to make the initial incision of the tissue as a few laser pulses are used to enable generation of a cut to allow the blade to cut through the required layers and then followed by movement of the catheter with the help of the scope over the organ in forward or backwards direction according to the position angle of the catheter.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0198">In accordance with some embodiments the catheter is inserted through the working channel of a standard endoscope or through a special opening made in a dedicated scope. Some embodiments include using a tip with a memory shape that is contracted for introduction through the working channel and is expanded when it exits the endoscope tip. Such a catheter may be based on use of Nitinol. These embodiments enable the physician to perform a diagnostic procedure and, if a pathology 1s found, to introduce the resection catheter.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0199">In another embodiment depending on the pathology the laser wavelength can be selected to enable reduced tissue penetration or surface ablation such as in 355 nm or 2.8-3 microns lasers or deeper with the 266 nm laser. For below the surface tissue interaction an embodiment of the invention includes a use of a mid-IR laser which had a longer penetration depth. A Thulium laser (potentially a Thulium fiber laser@ lambda=1908-1940 nm, wherein wavelength is matched according to the embodiment to compensate for water absorption wavelength change depending on temperature) may be used for this application since it has a better matching with water absorption length around 2 microns compared to Holmium:YAG and accordingly penetration depth is limited to a few hundred microns and also pulse rate can be increased comparing to Holmium without thermal damage.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0200">One of the potential advantages in using the &#x201c;hybrid catheter&#x201d; for debulking of required tissue from lumens such as in the GI track is the side effect of the laser and this is enhancing homeostasis and avoid bleeding. Depending on the specific laser used the effect may not be sufficient to avoid bleeding and some embodiments may include use of an additional laser for the purpose of hemostasis preferably delivered through the same optical fibers.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0201">In accordance with some embodiments, the catheter is connected to a suction pump that generates low pressure to collect undesired material, saline and/or the like through the catheter. The pump may be a peristaltic pump, which mounts externally to the fluid path, to avoid any contamination of the pump. Optionally, this obviates the need to use disposable parts.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0202">The hybrid catheter blade can also be used for improved biopsy procedures enabling relative large sample to be collected for further histology analysis and thereby decrease sampling errors, which are associated with high risk in patients with BE or in gynecology and urology applications.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0203">According to some embodiments, the hybrid catheter may further include imaging means to detect the required area that has to be treated and to monitor the process on-line, thereby enabling effective &#x201c;focal therapy&#x201d; according to the diseases severity from early stage such as Barrett's esophagus without dysplasia to more advanced disease with minimal complications, as it limits damage to the surrounding healthy tissue and avoid mucosal perforation. Similar considerations may apply in gynecology and urology applications. Means to obtain images of the working area may include, for example, commercial fiberscope such Medit INC F2.4 (2.4 mm 45 degrees FOV, with 30,000 pixels) or Olympus LF-2 (designed for tracheal intubation) that can be inserted into 5 mm tubes and includes a 1.5 mm channel for easier aspiration/instillation of fluids, providing images with 90 degrees field of view from &#x3e;3 mm so the fiber can be placed accordingly. As disclosed hereinabove, the hybrid catheter may be combined with a commercial endoscope, such as a gastroscope preferably such that has enhanced imaging capabilities such a narrow band imaging (NBI) to detect the pathological areas with higher resolution. For example, an Olympus GIF-H180J model (or equivalent) may be used, which has a 9.9 mm diameter at the distal end so the hybrid catheter can be attached to the walls in a manner that it can be conveniently introduced to the body. This enables four-way angulations (210&#xb0; up, 90&#xb0; down, and 100&#xb0; right/left) a 140&#xb0; field of view and close-up high resolution image can be obtained as close as 2 mm from the tissue, so the laser blade catheter can be attached accordingly to the tip of the scope (relatively advanced in few mm at the front).</p><p id="p-0202" num="0204">There is provided herein, in accordance with some embodiments, a hybrid catheter having a tip section having optical fibers for transmitting (pulse) laser radiation and inner and/or outer walls having facet that are sharp enough to complete the cutting and debulking (extracting) of leads initiated by the laser but not sharp enough to work alone in order to maintain the procedure's safety. Using the hybrid catheter allows decreasing the requirements from the laser and thus enables use of small solid state lasers, in such way that when the debulking of the leads is not completed by laser cutting the tissue surrounding the leads is performed mechanically (by sharp wall(s) and/or by a blade).</p><p id="p-0203" num="0205">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref>, which show cross section illustrations of three types of a hybrid catheter for pacemaker and ICD (Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator) lead extraction.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0206"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref> shows a cross section of hybrid catheter <b>2002</b> over lead <b>2000</b> which is to be extracted. Catheter <b>2002</b> has a tip section <b>2004</b>, typically having a circular cross section. Tip section <b>2004</b> comprises an inner wall <b>2006</b> and an outer wall <b>2008</b>, at least one of which having a sharp (for example tapered) distal end which thus function like blades. Optical fiber(s) <b>2010</b> are located between inner wall <b>2006</b> and outer wall <b>2008</b> and are configured to transmit laser radiation through the distal end of tip section <b>2004</b> (as marked by the arrows). The laser radiation modifies (e.g., ablate, partially ablate, weaken, cut, etc.) the tissue surrounding the lead and thereby preparing the tissue for penetration of the sharp distal edge of inner wall <b>2006</b> and outer wall <b>2008</b>, such that walls are configured to cut through the modified tissue and thereby detach lead <b>2000</b> from the tissue.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0207">According to some embodiment, the catheter may include means to hold the lead in order to extract it from the body.
