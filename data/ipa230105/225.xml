The contact lens fluid is, for example, a saline solution which keeps the contact lens elastic, moist and sterile.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Diffusion of the contact lens fluid or constituents thereof out of the contact lens package would lead to a change in concentration of the remaining contact lens fluid in the contact lens package and thereby influence the shelf life of the packaged contact lens. In order to avoid this and ensure a sufficiently long shelf life of the packaged contact lens, contact lens packages must exhibit a sufficient barrier effect.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The barrier effect can, for example, be achieved by formation of the accommodation element from a multi-ply plastic film composite. However, such accommodation elements are costly and elaborate to produce and are only poorly recyclable.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, accommodation elements of contact lens packages are usually produced by means of injection moulding and have a relatively great wall thickness of, for example, from 0.8 mm to 1 mm in order to provide the necessary barrier effect. The material requirements and the resulting material costs are consequently enormous, especially when the number of units is very high.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present disclosure to provide a method and a packaging machine for producing contact lens packages, and contact lens packages which allow cost-effective production of contact lens packages having a sufficient barrier effect.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an aspect of the disclosure, a method for producing contact lens packages comprises the steps of:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">forming an accommodation element having at least one cup;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">coating the accommodation element, at least in a region of the at least one cup, with a coating containing silicon oxide or aluminium oxide;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">filling the at least one cup with a contact lens fluid and a contact lens; and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">applying a cover film to the accommodation element to close the at least one cup.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">What is produced in this way is a contact lens package having, at least in the region of the cup accommodating the contact lens fluid, a coating containing silicon oxide or aluminium oxide. The coating is configured to seal off the accommodation element in the region of the cup. The silicon oxide- or aluminium oxide-containing coating has excellent barrier properties that greatly reduce or even eliminate diffusion of the contact lens fluid or constituents thereof. As a result, the wall thickness of the contact lens package can be distinctly reduced, for example to about a third of the wall thickness of conventional contact lens packages, thereby making it possible to drastically reduce the material requirements and thus the costs. Compared to a multi-ply plastic film composite, the contact lens packages are also better recyclable. Moreover, both the reduced material requirements and the better recyclability are environmentally advantageous.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The silicon oxide can, in particular, comprise silicon monoxide or silicon dioxide. In a preferred embodiment, the coating solely consists of silicon oxide, in particular silicon dioxide. At the very least, the silicon oxide forms a major constituent of the coating in order to provide the necessary barrier effect of the coating.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The aluminium oxide can, in particular, comprise Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. In a preferred embodiment, the coating solely consists of aluminium oxide. At the very least, the aluminium oxide forms a major constituent of the coating in order to provide the necessary barrier effect of the coating.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The contact lens fluid is preferably a saline solution comprising water and sodium chloride. However, the contact lens fluid can also be a different known contact lens fluid.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the herein described method steps of all the embodiments are, in each case, carried out in the order specified. Regardless of this, all the herein described method steps are preferably executed automatically, i.e. by machine. For example, the forming of the accommodation element is effected by means of a forming station of a packaging machine, the coating of the accommodation element is effected by means of a coating station of said packaging machine, the filling of the cup is effected by means of a filling station of said packaging machine, and applying the cover film is effected by means of a sealing station of said packaging machine.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The efficiency of the method can be increased by respectively executing the method for a plurality of accommodation elements. Instead of the one accommodation element, there is then the respective occurrence of the plurality of accommodation elements, which includes the one accommodation element. To this end, each method step can be executed simultaneously for the plurality of accommodation elements. The method steps can also be repeated for each accommodation element or for respectively a plurality of accommodation elements. This applies to all the herein described embodiments of the method.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Regardless of this, the accommodation element can have a plurality of cups. For example, the accommodation element has two cups, one of which can contain a contact lens for the left eye and the other of which can contain a contact lens for the right eye. The accommodation element can also have more than two cups which, for example, can each contain a contact lens of the same strength.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The coating of the accommodation element in the region of the at least one cup comprises the coating of at least the cup inner surface. The cup inner surface is the side of the cup that, together with the cover film, forms a cavity in which the contact lens fluid and the contact lens are accommodated. The cup inner surface is therefore in contact with the contact lens fluid. Preferably, the cup inner surface of the at least one cup is completely coated with the coating.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The accommodation element comprises, moreover, a flange which surrounds the at least one cup. The application of the cover film preferably comprises the attachment of the cover film to the flange, especially the (heat) sealing or adhesive bonding of the cover film to the flange. As a result, the cover film can be completely sealingly connected to the accommodation element around the at least one cup.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It may be desirable for regions outside the cup, and especially the region of the flange in which the cover film is applied, not to be coated so as to allow simpler and better connection of the cover film to the accommodation element. The coating of the accommodation element is then preferably effected solely in the region of the cup, especially solely on the cup inner surface.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Whereas accommodation elements of contact lens packages have hitherto usually been formed by means of injection moulding because of the great wall thickness, it is now possible for the first time through the method according to the disclosure and the thereby realizable lower wall thickness to produce accommodation elements of contact lens packages by thermoforming from a preferably single-ply film web.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a preferred embodiment, the formation of the accommodation element therefore comprises the following steps:</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">providing a film web; and</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">thermoforming the at least one cup into the film web.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The thermoforming preferably comprises the heating of the film web and the deep drawing of the at least one cup in the heated film web. The deep drawing can be effected by means of a forming device and/or compressed air or vacuum. The forming device can comprise a punch and a die and, if desired, be supported by the use of compressed air or vacuum. The forming device can also comprise only a die, into which the film web is formed by means of compressed air or vacuum.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The use of the silicon oxide- or aluminium oxide-containing coating means that the accommodation element of the contact lens package can be formed from a comparatively thin film. It is preferred that the accommodation element has, at least in the region of the at least one cup, a wall thickness which is between 0.05 mm and 0.6 mm, more preferably between 0.1 mm and 0.5 mm and even more preferably between 0.2 mm and 0.4 mm.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the case of thermoforming, the film web preferably has a thickness which is between 0.05 mm and 0.6 mm, more preferably between 0.1 mm and 0.5 mm and even more preferably between 0.2 mm and 0.4 mm.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The accommodation element and thus the film web possibly used is preferably formed from a plastic selected from the group of the polyolefins or the polyhalogen olefins or from a combination thereof. Particularly preferably, the plastic is selected from a group comprising: polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), polyamide (PA) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Preferably, the accommodation element and thus the film web possibly used solely comprises a layer of the particular plastic and, in particular, does not comprise composite material or a multi-ply structure of different materials.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Preferably, the formation of the accommodation element additionally comprises the punching of the accommodation element out of the film web before the coating of the accommodation element. This can ensure that the coating is not damaged or destroyed during punching. However, it is also conceivable that the method comprises the punching of the accommodation element out of the film web after the coating of the accommodation element.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The punching is preferably effected by means of a punching device. Upon punching, the accommodation element is completely separated from the film web. However, it is also conceivable to punch out a plurality of accommodation elements joined together or integral with one another.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In order to make the method as efficient as possible and to facilitate coating, the method preferably additionally comprises, before the coating of the accommodation element, the steps of:</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">grasping the accommodation element by means of a handling device; and</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">inserting the grasped accommodation element into a support by means of the handling device.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">This has the advantage that multiple accommodation elements continue to be processed in singularized form and not in bulk, which might lead to damage of accommodation elements if they have a wall thickness of, for example, 0.3 mm. Moreover, the transfer of the accommodation elements for coating can thereby take place automatically. The support can preferably accommodate a plurality of accommodation elements.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the case of thermoforming, the grasping and insertion of the accommodation element preferably takes place after punching. In particular, the accommodation elements can then be grasped in the punching device by means of the handling device and removed from the punching device.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The handling device can be designed as a gripping device or as a suction device. Relevant devices are also known to a person skilled in the art as &#x201c;pick-and-place&#x201d; devices.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Suitable general conditions for coating of the accommodation element can be created if the method additionally comprises, before the coating of the accommodation element, the arrangement of the accommodation element in a coating chamber, and the coating of the accommodation element is effected in the coating chamber. In the coating chamber, the general conditions, such as, for example, pressure and the atmosphere surrounding the accommodation element, can be influenced and set particularly easily.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For movement of the accommodation element into the coating chamber, the coating chamber can preferably be opened and closed. For example, the coating chamber has for this purpose at least one, preferably two closable openings, through which the accommodation element can be moved into the coating chamber and out of the coating chamber. It is also conceivable that part of the coating chamber is movable and is, for example, moved over the accommodation element.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The arrangement of the accommodation element in the coating chamber preferably comprises the movement of the support, into which the accommodation element has been inserted, into the coating chamber. Preferably, a plurality of accommodation elements has been inserted into the support.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The coating of the accommodation element or generation of the coating can be effected by means of physical vapour deposition.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The coating of the accommodation element or generation of the coating can, however, also be effected by means of chemical vapour deposition. In one embodiment, the coating of the accommodation element or generation of the coating is preferably effected by the PECVD method (plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition) or the PICVD method (plasma impulse chemical vapour deposition). These methods have the advantage that they allow the formation of very thin and very uniform coatings of high quality, even on curved substrates, such as the accommodation element having the at least one cup. For details about the PECVD method and the PICVD method, reference is made by way of example to &#x201c;Unger, E. (1991), Die Erzeugung d&#xfc;nner Schichten. Das PECVD-Verfahren: Gasphasenabscheidung in einem Plasma [Generating thin layers. The PECVD method: vapour deposition in a plasma], in Chemie in unserer Zeit [Modern chemistry], volume 25, issue 3&#x201d; and &#x201c;Bach et al. (2003), Thin Films on Glass, Germany, Springer Berlin Heidelberg&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The method preferably additionally comprises, after the arrangement of the accommodation element in the coating chamber and before the coating of the accommodation element, the steps of:</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">generating a subatmospheric pressure in the coating chamber; and</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">introducing a process gas into the coating chamber.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The subatmospheric pressure is preferably between 1*10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>and 1*10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>mbar, more preferably between 2*10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>and 1*10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>mbar and even more preferably between 2*10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>and 1*10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>mbar.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The process gas preferably contains oxygen and a silicon- or aluminium-containing gas. The process gas can, for example, comprise monosilane SiH<sub>4</sub>, nitric oxide NO and/or tetraethyl orthosilicate Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The coating of the accommodation element then preferably comprises the generation of a plasma in the coating chamber and, as a result, the generation of the coating. The plasma can be generated in the coating chamber with supply of energy by means of microwave radiation or by means of electrodes.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">An exemplary reaction which can take place for generation of a silicon oxide-containing coating is</p><p id="p-0052" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>SiH<sub>4</sub>+4NO&#x2192;SiO<sub>2</sub>+2H<sub>2</sub>O+2N<sub>2 </sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">wherein SiH<sub>4 </sub>and NO are supplied in gaseous form and silicon dioxide SiO<sub>2 </sub>is formed.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">Just a very thin silicon oxide- or aluminium oxide-containing coating is sufficient to achieve the necessary barrier effect. Preferably, the coating has a layer thickness which is between 2 nm and 500 nm, more preferably between 10 nm and 250 nm and even more preferably between 20 nm and 80 nm. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the layer thickness of the coating is between 40 nm and 60 nm or between 45 nm and 55 nm. Coatings of such a thickness can be generated easily using the stated methods.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">Preferably, the accommodation element is accommodated in the support during coating. As described above, the accommodation element was preferably moved into the coating chamber by means of the support. In order to make the method as efficient as possible, it is additionally preferred that the filling of the at least one cup of the accommodation element comprises the movement of the support through a filling station and that the application of the cover film to the accommodation element comprises the movement of the support through a sealing station. This means that the accommodation element in the support is moved through further processing stations without the need for handling or transfer of the delicate accommodation elements. Moreover, this means that at no time in the method are the accommodation elements arranged in bulk, thus eliminating the elaborate step of singularization of the accommodation elements before filling and closing the accommodation elements, which step is usually necessary in the case of injection-moulded accommodation elements.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">If the accommodation element has a plurality of cups and/or if multiple accommodation elements are connected to one another, it may be desirable to be able to detach individual cups or accommodation elements. If the cover film has been applied to the accommodation element, the method can then additionally comprise the introduction of a material weakening, in particular a perforation or groove, between the individual cups of an accommodation element or the individual accommodation elements.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">Altogether, a very efficient method for producing cost-effective contact lens packages is therefore provided.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">According to an aspect of the disclosure, a contact lens package comprises an accommodation element which has at least one cup for accommodation of a contact lens fluid and a contact lens, and a cover film which is connected to the accommodation element in order to close the at least one cup. The accommodation element has, at least in the region of the at least one cup, a coating containing silicon oxide or aluminium oxide.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">What is provided in this way is a contact lens package having, at least in the region of the cup accommodating the contact lens fluid, a coating containing silicon oxide or aluminum oxide. The coating is configured to seal off the accommodation element in the region of the cup. The silicon oxide- or aluminium oxide-containing coating has excellent barrier properties that greatly reduce or even eliminate diffusion of the contact lens fluid or constituents thereof. As a result, the wall thickness of the contact lens package can be distinctly reduced, for example to about a third of the wall thickness of conventional contact lens packages, thereby making it possible to drastically reduce the material requirements and thus the costs. Compared to a multi-ply plastic film composite, the contact lens packages are also better recyclable. Both the reduced material requirements and the better recyclability are environmentally advantageous.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">The contact lens package is preferably produced by means of the above-described method.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">All the features which have been described with regard to the contact lens package and, in particular, the coating in connection with the method are analogously applicable to the contact lens package and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">The at least one cup contains the contact lens fluid and a contact lens. The contact lens fluid is preferably a saline solution comprising water and sodium chloride. However, the contact lens fluid can also be a different known contact lens fluid.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">The contact lens package can also comprise a plurality of inter-connected accommodation elements.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">The accommodation element can have a plurality of cups. For example, the accommodation element has two cups, one of which can contain a contact lens for the left eye and the other of which can contain a contact lens for the right eye. The accommodation element can also have two or more cups which, for example, can each contain a contact lens of the same strength.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">The at least one cup preferably has a diameter which is between 5 mm and 35 mm, more preferably between 18 mm and 28 mm and even more preferably between 20 mm and 22 mm.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">A depth of the at least one cup is preferably between 1 mm and 15 mm, more preferably between 3 mm and 10 mm and even more preferably between 5 mm and 6 mm.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">Preferably, at least one cup inner surface of the at least one cup has the coating. The cup inner surface is the side of the cup that, together with the cover film, forms a cavity in which the contact lens fluid and the contact lens are accommodated. The cup inner surface is therefore in contact with the contact lens fluid. Preferably, the cup inner surface is completely coated with the coating.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">The accommodation element comprises, moreover, the flange which surrounds the at least one cup. The cover film is preferably attached to the flange, especially (heat) sealed or adhesively bonded to the flange. Ideally, the cover film is completely sealingly connected to the accommodation element around the at least one cup.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">It is conceivable that regions outside the cup, and especially the region of the flange in which the cover film is applied, do not have a coating. This can allow simpler and better connection of the cover film to the accommodation element. Preferably, it is then solely the region of the cup, especially solely the cup inner surface, that has the coating.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">In order to ensure a sufficient seal of the contact lens package and to allow simple connection of the cover film to the accommodation element and simple opening of the contact lens package by removal of the cover film, the cover film can be formed by an aluminium composite film. For example, such a composite film comprises a layer of polypropylene PP, a layer of aluminium and a layer of polyethylene PE. Regardless of the structure of the cover film and of these materials, it is also conceivable that the cover film has a coating containing silicon oxide or aluminium oxide. In particular, a side of the cover film that is facing the at least one cup then has the coating. Apart from that, reference is made to the remarks concerning coating the accommodation element that apply analogously.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">Great material savings can be achieved if the accommodation element preferably has, in the region of the at least one cup, a wall thickness which is between 0.05 mm and 0.6 mm, more preferably between 0.1 mm and 0.5 mm and even more preferably between 0.2 mm and 0.4 mm.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">The accommodation element is preferably formed from a plastic selected from the group of the polyolefins or the polyhalogen olefins or from a combination thereof.

The accommodation element <b>4</b> can also have a plurality of cups <b>6</b>.
