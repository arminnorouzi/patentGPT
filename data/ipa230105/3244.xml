No. 15/843,789, filed on Dec. 15, 2017, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application relates in general to drive systems for threaded fasteners, tools for their manufacture, and drivers for applying torque to such fasteners. More specifically this application relates to fasteners that are constructed with straight walled recesses. In particular a fastener system is constructed wherein the driver and fastener engage with improved stability of axial alignment and stick fit.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Threaded fasteners commonly used in industrial applications typically are driven by power tools at high speeds and under high torque loads. Such conditions present difficult design considerations, particularly with respect to the drive systems and, more particularly, with threaded fasteners having a driver engageable recess in the fastener head or a driver engageable exterior contour to the fastener head. Ideally, such a drive system needs to be easily manufactured, both as to recess and head geometry, as well as to associated tooling for forming the fastener head and the drivers for engaging the recess or head geometry. The strength of the head of the fastener should not be adversely affected by the recess. The driver, when mated, should distribute the stress loads uniformly to avoid formation of highly localized regions of stress that might result in deformation of the drive surfaces, or driver, or both, leading to premature failure of the drive system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The fastener system should resist cam-out of the driver from the recess when the fastener is driven. In many applications, it is very important that the fastener must be capable of withstanding several cycles, as in applications where the fasteners must be removed in order to repair or replace parts or to remove and replace access panels. The fastener drive system ideally should be capable of such repeated cycling, particularly in applications where the recess may be coated and in environments where the recess may become contaminated, painted, corroded or otherwise adversely affected in use. In such applications and environments, it is essential that the drive system maintain driving engagement while applying torque in a removal direction. It may be necessary for the drive system to be capable of applying even higher levels of torque when removing the fastener, as may occur when the fastener is over-tightened during initial assembly, or where corrosion develops at the interface at the engaged threads, or if thermal cycling of the assembled components has placed increased stress on the fastener. These, and other, characteristics often present competing considerations; and compromises of one in favor of another may have to be made.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A variety of recess and driver configurations are in common use, including a number of cross-recesses, such as those described in US patent Re. 24,878 (Smith et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 3,237,506 (Muenchinger) and U.S. Pat. No. 2,474,994 (Tomalis). Other fastener geometries include multi-lobe geometries of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,763,725 (Reiland) and ribbed drive systems as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,187,892 (Simmons). Also among the common recess configurations is the &#x201c;Allen&#x201d; system which is essentially a straight walled hexagonally shaped socket receptive to a similarly shaped driver. Fastener systems having multiple lobes with spirally configured drive surfaces are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,957,645 (Stacy), 7,293,949 (Dilling), 8,291,795 (Hughes), each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and each of which will be referred to herein as example standard spiral drives.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">With the exception of the ribbed systems, the walls and faces of the driver and recess typically are designed to fit closely with each other in an effort to achieve face-to-face contact of the driving and driven surfaces. With cross-recess fasteners, such face-to-face engagement can occur only, if at all, when the driver is properly aligned and seated within the recess. As a practical matter, however, in order to enable the driver to be inserted into the recess, there necessarily must be some clearance between the two.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The necessity for such clearance is even more critical with recesses having substantially axially aligned (straight) drive walls, as in the Reiland '725 patent and Allen head systems. In all of these systems, the practical result of the necessity for such clearance is that substantial face-to-face, broad area contact between the driver and recess surfaces is seldom achieved, if at all. With most drive systems for threaded fasteners, the driver mates with the recess in the head in a manner that results in point or line contact rather than face-to-face broad area contact. The actual area of contact typically is substantially less than full face-to-face contact. Consequently, when torque is applied by the driver, the forces applied to the screw head tend to be concentrated in localized areas with resulting high localized stresses and unstable axial alignment. Such localized high stress can plastically deform the recess, forming ramps or other deformations that result in premature, unintended disengagement of the driver from the recess.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A fastener system for maximizing the engageable surface area between the driver and drive surfaces is described in the Stacy '645 patent, which is commonly owned with the subject application. The disclosure of the '645 patent is incorporated in this application by reference. The recess and driver of the '645 patent are constructed with spirally configured engaging surfaces that are substantially aligned parallel with the axis of the fastener and may be classified generically as a straight walled fastener system. A more robust.embodiment of the spiral drive fastener system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,891,274 (Dilling) and 8,291,795 (Hughes), commonly owned with the subject application. The disclosures of the Dilling &#x2032;274 and Hughes '795 patents are also incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The advantages of the invention described in the '645 patent are achieved by configuring the driving and driven surfaces of the driver and fastener, respectively, to conform to a segment of a spiral and, particularly, in a spiral configuration that enables a substantial and generous clearance between the driver and the recess during insertion and removal of the driver, but in which the fully seated driver is permitted to rotate to take up that clearance. The spiral configurations of the drive walls of the driver and the driver-engageable walls of the recess are such that when the spiral walls engage, they do so over a relatively broad area thereby applying and distributing the stress over that broad area. The spirally configured driving and driven walls are oriented to direct a major portion of the applied torque substantially normal to the fastener radius with little, if any, reliance on frictional, near-tangential engagement.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another example of a straight walled fastener system is the system described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,584,667, issued to Reiland. This reference is incorporated herein by reference. The Reiland '667 patent describes a fastener system in which the driving surface geometries consist of a series of semi-cylindrical surfaces arranged substantially in the shape of a hexagon. The Reiland fastener systems are generically referred to as hex-lobular (or hexalobular) and have driving surfaces that are parallel with the axis of the fastener.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Although straight walled fasteners are in successful general use in many applications, they may experience difficulties resulting from axial misalignment between driver and fastener. In addition it has been difficult to obtain a reliable friction engagement that provides a stick fit feature. A stick fit feature is desired to hold the fastener on the driver in alignment, while the installation of the fastener is initiated. This is especially useful in high volume assembly line operations that use power driven bits to apply torque to the fastener. Axial alignment and stick fit are also important as the fastener length is extended.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In many applications in which a straight walled drive system is used, the driver may be power driven or required to be inserted in locations of limited access or with robotic tools. In such situations, there is a need to releasably engage the fastener on the driver in advance of installation so that the driver can be used as an insertion tool, as well as a driver. In these applications, the driver is inserted into the fastener to establish a &#x201c;stick fit.&#x201d; For stick fit, the holding force between the driver and the fastener is sufficient to hold the fastener to the driver, and when the driver is moved into position to insert the fastener into the work piece. After insertion of the fastener into the work piece, the force exerted on the fastener by the work piece is sufficient to release the stick fit as the driver is removed. This &#x201c;stick fit&#x201d; feature has been attempted in several different types of fasteners, for example, in fastener/driver systems having a cruciform (cross shaped geometry), several are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,084,478 (Simmons) and <b>4</b>,<b>457</b>,<b>654</b> (Sygnator). A fastener system having a square drive geometry is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 6,199,455 (Wagner). It is observed that the stick fit efforts focus on the drive surfaces.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Six lobed recesses with inclined surfaces and matching driver are shown in US publication 2016/0305462 (Wunderlich) and U.S. Pat. No. 8,955,417 (Stiebitz). In Wunderlich and Stiebitz, the internal radius of the recess lobes are separated by an inclined surface with corresponding inclined surfaces in a special matching driver. It is observed that the configurations do not disclose a stick fit frictional interface.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">U.S. Pat. No. 5,509,334 (Shinjo &#x2032;334) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,435,680 (Schuster), show additional six lobed recesses with an inclined surface and matching driver. In Shinjo &#x2032;334 and Schuster, the internal radius of the recess lobes are separated by an inclined surface which matches to a corresponding inclined surface in a special matching driver. It is observed that these configurations teach a tight engagement with driver and recess but do not disclose a stick fit as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A similar, but eight pointed, recess is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,219,253 (Shinjo &#x2032;253). It too has a configuration that does not disclose a stick fit.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The &#x201c;stick fit&#x201d; feature allows the fastener to be releasably engaged on the driver to enable manipulation of the driver and fastener as a unit in hard to reach, automated, and other applications. Once installed, the fastener and driver may be disengaged with minimal effort.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The reference Larson, (U.S. Pat. No. 4,269,246), is of interest in that it employs a partially tapered driver to enhance engagement. In Larson, the internal radius of the driver flutes are disposed parallel to the axis of the driver while the crest of the lobe is tapered inward toward the tip. The expressed purpose of this is to avoid premature interference between bit and recess. It is observed that the configuration results in a line contact between driver and recess both circumferentially and axially and will not enhance stability or frictional engagement.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Also of interest is the reference Goss, U.S. Pat. No. 5,461,952. In Goss a trailing side wall of the driver is tapered to provide a gradually thickening lobe geometry that generates a friction engagement on a drive surface. Since only one side wall is tapered the engagement with the straight sided drive surface becomes a circumferential line contact. Again only the bit is reconfigured. This is because there is a reluctance to alter the recess geometry as it would result in a loss of compatibility with existing drivers. Backward compatibility is a design advantage in any improved fastener system, in particular straight walled systems.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A fastener system configured to provide stick fit in a straight walled fastener is described in the reference Dilling, U.S. Pat. No. 7,293,949, commonly owned with this application. In the Dilling '949 patent interference surfaces are constructed on inner non-driving transition surfaces between the wings of the fastener recess. However, it has been found that even more improvement with added stability is desirable. Added stability is particularly useful when the fastener recess is non-uniform. Non-uniformity may occur due to a number of reasons. Examples include, but are not limited to, machine tolerances during manufacturing, un-even plating, uneven coatings, painting after fastener insertion, or deformation during insertion or previous installation or removal cycles.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It would be desirable to provide improvements in recessed head fasteners and drivers by which the foregoing and other difficulties are reduced or eliminated and stability is increased.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Various embodiments described herein provide a fastener system having straight walled driving surfaces that provides a reliable stick fit feature, while also improving stability of engagement between the system components. An important feature of the new system is to allow engagement of existing standard straight walled drivers in the new system. In order to accomplish this goal, a new recess, a new recess and driver system, a new punch for forming a recess, and methods of using each are described below.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A stick fit feature is desired to hold the fastener on the driver in alignment, while the installation of the fastener is initiated. This is especially useful in high volume assembly line operations that use power driven bits to apply torque to the fastener. Axial alignment and stick fit are also important as the fastener length is extended.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The straight walled fastener systems of this application are generally constructed with a recess having multiple wings extending radially outward from a central axis and a driver having matching multiple lobes that mate with the wings of the recess. Each of the wings and lobes have driven surfaces consisting of an installation surface and a removal surface depending on the direction of torque applied. These drive surfaces are constructed substantially in a parallel aligned relation to the central axis of the fastener system. Adjacent installation and removal surface of the same wing or lobe are separated at the outer radius by a non-driving wing outer end wall. The diameter formed by the outer radius will be referred to herein as the &#x201c;A&#x201d; dimension, as shown in the figures. Adjacent wings are separated at the inner radius by a non-driving transition contour. The diameter formed by the inner radius will be referred to herein as the &#x201c;B&#x201d; dimension, as shown in the figures.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">To generate an interference fit and provide stick fit, a wedge formed in the transition contour to present a tapered interface surface is formed on the &#x201c;B&#x201d; dimension surface of the recess wings. The recess is narrowed in the &#x201c;B&#x201d; dimension relative to the standard straight walled recess to provide engagement of a standard straight walled driver. In another aspect, the &#x201c;A&#x201d; dimension is also enlarged to provide additional compatibility with other standard straight walled drivers. The artisan will understand that reference herein to a &#x201c;standard&#x201d; driver and recess refers to the prevailing industry accepted sizes in the relevant market. Certain specific examples of standard recesses and drivers are referenced below. The described recess provides backwards capability, so as to allow the use of a standard driver in the recess of this application.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">To form the mating interface of the driver and fastener, the recess wing transition contours are tapered inward. The interface tapers radially inward from proximate the top of the recess to proximate the bottom of the recess.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The tapered interface surface provides stability to the driver to prevent improper alignment. When the recess and driver are improperly aligned the mating may result in localized areas with high stresses and more severe unstable axial alignment. Such localized high stresses can plastically deform the recess, forming ramps or other deformations that result in premature, unintended disengagement of the driver from the recess and/or damage to the driver.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Localized high stresses may result from a number of factors such as design of the recess, inconsistencies in the manufacture of the fastener or the driver, as well as difficulties encountered in the field. Field-encountered difficulties may include, for example, misalignment of the driver and fastener or inability to fully seat the driver in the recess because of paint or other debris that may have collected in the recess. Even slight misalignment between the driver and the fastener, or a variation of the fastener or driver from design specifications, can result in substantial reduction in the area of contact between the driver and fastener, in many cases resulting in near point-like contact of several portions of the driver and fastener. Application of high torque under such circumstances necessarily results in concentrated stresses in the materials of the driver and the recess that, in turn, can lead to failure of the material, either by plastic deformation or fracture. Even slight plastic deformation of the engagement surfaces of the recess and driver can adversely affect system performance. If the recess deforms to define ramp-like surfaces inclined from the vertical, the driver may &#x201c;cam-out&#x201d; of the recess under the influence of the applied load. Such cam-out is undesirable, not only because it results in premature or uncontrollable disengagement of the driver and recess, but also because the suddenly disengaged driver can slip onto and damage the work piece. Additionally, excessive stress in the driver blade while driving the fastener can cause the blade to deform in a manner that reduces the surface area contact with the fastener and effectively shifts the region of contact radially inwardly, thereby reducing the effectiveness of driver-recess engagement and increasing the risk of failure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The disclosure of this application provides a fastener having a shank having a central longitudinal axis, a head at an end of the shank, the head having a recess centered on the axis, the recess having a plurality of wings radiating outwardly from the axis, the recess having a recess outer radius defined by a radial distance from the axis to the outer-most extent of the wings, each of the wings having an installation driving surface and a removal driving surface, the wing driving surfaces being constructed in substantially parallel alignment with the central longitudinal axis.

The fastener <b>20</b> includes a shank <b>24</b> having a central longitudinal axis <b>26</b>. A head <b>22</b> is positioned at an end <b>25</b> of the shank <b>24</b>. The head <b>22</b> has a six lobed star recess <b>40</b> centered on the axis <b>26</b>. The recess <b>40</b> has six wings <b>42</b> radiating outwardly from the axis <b>26</b>. The recess <b>40</b> has a recess outer radius <b>57</b> defined by a radial distance from the axis <b>26</b> to the outer-most extent of the wings. Each of the wings <b>42</b> has an installation driving surface <b>43</b> and a removal driving surface <b>44</b> (collectively drive walls) which are separated by a wing outer end wall <b>41</b>. The wing driving surfaces <b>43</b>, <b>44</b> are constructed in substantially parallel alignment with the central longitudinal axis <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The installation driving surface <b>43</b> and removal driving surface <b>44</b> of adjacent wings <b>42</b> are separated by a respective transition contour <b>45</b>, the transition contour forming the radially inward-most portions of the wings <b>42</b>. A wedge is formed in the transition contour to present a tapered interface surface <b>50</b>. The interface surface <b>50</b> is a non-driving surface. Each interface surface <b>50</b> has a top <b>51</b>, a bottom <b>52</b> and a pair of opposed edges <b>53</b>, <b>55</b>. Each opposed edge <b>53</b>, <b>55</b> creates a transition from each installation and removal surfaces to the interface surface. The advantages of the edges <b>53</b>, <b>55</b> will be discussed below. The width <b>58</b> of the interface surface tapers from wider at the top <b>51</b> of the interface surface, which is shown proximate the top <b>48</b> of the recess <b>40</b> to narrower at the bottom <b>52</b> of the interface surface, which is shown proximate the bottom <b>46</b> of the recess <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The recess extends into the head <b>22</b> to a recess bottom <b>46</b>, which may include a bottom chamfer cone <b>49</b> transitioning from interface surfaces <b>50</b> and the bottom of the drive walls <b>43</b>, <b>44</b> and wing outer end walls <b>41</b> to the recess bottom <b>46</b>. There is a top chamfer cone <b>47</b> transitioning from the head top surface <b>21</b> to the top <b>48</b> of the recess. However, alternative embodiments may not include top chamfer cone <b>47</b>. It should be noted that in alternative embodiments the top <b>51</b> and bottom <b>52</b> of the interface surface need not be proximate to the top <b>48</b> and bottom <b>46</b> of the recess <b>40</b>, respectively. In such embodiments the top <b>51</b> and bottom <b>52</b> of each interface surface may be offset from the top <b>48</b> and bottom <b>46</b> of the recess, respectively.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The interface surfaces <b>50</b> are positioned a root (or bottom) radial distance <b>56</b> from the axis <b>26</b> at the bottom <b>52</b> of the interface surface.

The top radial distance <b>59</b> is larger than the recess inner radius (root or bottom radial distance) <b>56</b>. The ratio of the recess inner radius <b>56</b> to the recess outer radius <b>57</b> is from about 0.60 to about 0.65. In another example, the ratio of the recess inner radius <b>56</b> to the recess outer radius <b>57</b> is from 0.60 to 0.65.

One example standard hexalobular recess, also referred to as a Torx&#xae; recess, are those fasteners made in accordance with the ISO 10664:2014 and NAS1800 (REV. 4) standards and each of those standards are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Each size of a standard hexalobular recess has a correspondingly mated standard hexalobular driver. Another example of a standard six lobed recess, and corresponding driver, is described in the Hughes '795 patent. Each of these recess together will be referred to herein as example standard six lobed recesses and their corresponding drivers as example standard six lobed drivers.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The term &#x201c;straight walled drive surfaces&#x201d; may be used herein to refer to fastener systems in which the driving surfaces are substantially in alignment, i.e., parallel with the longitudinal axis of the fastener. It is accepted in the fastener industry that statements, such as &#x201c;parallel alignment&#x201d; are subject to some deviation tolerances, as it is understood that such alignment is subject to manufacturing tolerances and may vary slightly in actual practice. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example standard hexalobular recess, which is also described in the Hughes '795 patent (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, element <b>30</b>). With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> of the present application, fastener systems with a standard hexalobular recess are constructed having a fastener <b>120</b> and a mating driver bit (not shown). The fastener <b>120</b> is constructed having a head <b>122</b> and a threaded shank (not shown). In this example, a hexalobular configured recess <b>140</b> is formed in the head <b>122</b> with drive surfaces aligned in parallel with the axis <b>126</b> of the fastener <b>120</b> (straight walled). The recess <b>140</b> has a recess outer radius <b>157</b> defined by a radial distance from the axis <b>126</b> to the outer-most extent of the wings <b>142</b>. Installation and removal surfaces <b>143</b>, <b>144</b> of adjacent wings are separated by transition contours <b>145</b> and installation and removal surfaces <b>143</b>, <b>144</b> of the same wing are each separated by a wing outer end wall <b>141</b>. The recess has a recess inner radius <b>156</b> defined by the radial distance from the axis <b>126</b> to the transition contours <b>145</b>. The ratio of the recess inner radius <b>156</b> to the recess outer radius <b>157</b> of the standard hexalobular driver is between 0.70-0.75 (depending on the size of the driver), see, for example, Shinjo &#x2032;<b>334</b>, ISO 10664:2014, and NAS1800 (REV. 4) standards, which is larger than the ratio of the recess inner radius <b>56</b> to the recess outer radius <b>57</b> of recess <b>40</b> of the present application. As will be discussed below, the smaller recess inner radius <b>56</b> to recess outer radius <b>57</b> ratio of example recess <b>40</b> results in a number of advantageous benefits including improved torque per lobe of a mated driver.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic view showing the recess <b>40</b> profile of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (an example recess of the present application) overlaid with the recess <b>140</b> profile of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> (a standard hexalobular recess). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an expanded view of detail VI of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.

Each of these features, i.e., the smaller inner radius <b>56</b> and larger outer radius <b>57</b> result in an increased drive wall and provides an improved driver to recess driving torque per lobe.

The driver <b>220</b> includes features that match those of the standard recess <b>140</b> including, for example, a central longitudinal axis <b>226</b>, a central portion, and a plurality of lobes <b>242</b> radiating outwardly from the central portion which match the recess wings <b>142</b>. Each of the lobes <b>242</b> have corresponding installation and removal surfaces <b>243</b>,<b>244</b>. In addition, the driver <b>220</b> also includes a transition contour <b>245</b> located between adjacent lobes <b>242</b> and lobe outer end walls <b>241</b> located between installation and removal surfaces <b>243</b>, <b>244</b> of the same lobe <b>242</b>. Each of the surfaces of the lobes <b>242</b> are constructed in parallel alignment with the driver longitudinal axis <b>226</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As noted above, and as a practical matter, in order to enable the standard hexalobular driver <b>220</b> to be inserted into the standard hexalobular recess <b>140</b>, there necessarily must be some clearance <b>250</b> between the two. The clearance is the same around the circumference of the driver <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a view taken along section line VIII-VIII of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. In addition to the standard hexalobular driver <b>220</b> and the standard hexalobular recess <b>140</b> each having straight drive walls, each of the recess transition contour <b>145</b> and driver transition contour <b>245</b> are straight walled, i.e., each are parallel (within machining tolerances) with respect to axis <b>126</b>. Therefore, the clearance <b>250</b> remains constant, provided the standard driver <b>220</b> is coaxial with the standard recess <b>140</b>, and will not enhance the stability or frictional engagement of the driver/recess engagement. Although the clearance <b>250</b> allows the standard driver <b>220</b> to be easily inserted into the standard recess <b>140</b>, the driver <b>220</b> is easily accidently misaligned or rocked in the recess <b>140</b> (axis <b>226</b> is not aligned with axis <b>126</b>). Rocking contributes to concentrating forces on the screw head in localized areas with resulting high localized stresses and unstable alignment. Such localized high stress can plastically deform the recess, forming ramps or other deformations that result in premature, unintended disengagement of the driver from the recess and cause cam-out and driver/recess damage.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows the same standard hexalobular driver <b>220</b> in a mated engagement with an example recess <b>40</b>. The example recess <b>40</b> is configured to receive in a mated engagement any driver made to correspond to the hexalobular recess standards discussed above. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the recess <b>40</b> is constructed with a tapered interference surface <b>50</b> formed in the &#x201c;B&#x201d; dimension surface of the recess transition contour <b>45</b>. As discussed earlier, the inner radius <b>56</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of recess <b>40</b> is smaller than the inner radius <b>156</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) of the standard hexalobular recess. This is a result of the tapered interface surface/wedge <b>50</b> being tapered toward the axis <b>26</b>. Further, the recess inner radius <b>56</b> is smaller than the top radial distance <b>59</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The recess is narrowed relative to the standard hexalobular recess <b>140</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) to provide a frictional engagement when the fastener <b>20</b> and driver <b>220</b> are in the mated engagement. The driver <b>220</b> has an inner radius <b>256</b> greater than recess inner radius <b>56</b> and less then top radial distance <b>59</b> resulting in a negative clearance, i.e., interference at interface regions <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, discussed below. As shown, the &#x201c;A&#x201d; dimension is also enlarged relative to the standard hexalobular recess <b>140</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) in order to allow greater compatibility with other standard six lobed drivers, for example those described in the Hughes '795 patent. However, in alternative embodiments only the &#x201c;B&#x201d; dimension is narrowed and the &#x201c;A&#x201d; dimension is held to the standard recess size for a fastener of the type illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, which may improve the stability of the alignment of standard hexalobular drivers at the expense of additional compatibility.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, the tapered interface surfaces <b>50</b> are constructed to provide a significant frictional engagement (&#x201c;stick fit&#x201d;) at edges <b>53</b>, <b>55</b> resulting in two separate interface regions <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>. Because opposed edge <b>53</b>, <b>55</b> are at the transition from each installation and removal surfaces to the interface surface, less material is required to deform upon insertion of a driver to acquire a sufficient stick-fit. Contacting in a lower portion of the recess also provides for a smaller area of contact also improving stick-fit. The two interface regions <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> provide an increase in the stability of the contact between the recess <b>40</b> and driver <b>220</b> by providing two points of stability at each interface surface <b>50</b>, thus improving axial alignment and reducing the risk of cam out. By having two interface regions as opposed to a single line or surface contact better stability is provided. The stick fit is created where the straight walled transition contour <b>245</b> contacts tapered interface surface <b>50</b>. It should be noted that some incline in the driver wall may still provide sufficient stick fit, provided there is sufficient contact at interface regions <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>. The improved stick fit of the example recess <b>40</b> will increase the speed of application of fasteners to the work piece as well as decrease cam-out and driver/recess damage. The degree of stick fit can be adjusted during manufacturing of the recess by adjusting the taper angle <b>54</b>. Each interface region <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> may be various combinations of point and line contacts along edges <b>53</b>,<b>55</b> depending on the particular configuration of the standard six lobed driver. Regardless of the type of contact, there are two interface regions <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> between each tapered interface surface <b>50</b> and driver transition contour <b>245</b>. The two interface regions <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> provide increased stability to the mated engagement of the driver bit and the recess as compared to prior known recesses by helping minimize rocking of the driver within the recess, thus greatly improving axial alignment and engagement of the lobes with the wings. This is particularly useful when the fastener <b>20</b> is non-uniform. Non-uniformity may occur due to a number of reasons. Examples include, but are not limited to, machine tolerances during manufacturing, un-even plating, uneven coatings, painting after fastener insertion, or deformation during insertion or previous installation or removal cycles. Example coatings include, but are not limited to, electro-zinc &#x26; clear, electro-zinc &#x26; yellow, electro-zinc &#x26; wax, mechanical zinc &#x26; clear, mechanical zinc &#x26; yellow, black phosphate, black phosphate and oil, oil, wax, nickel, cadmium &#x26; wax, hot-dip galvanized, dacrotizing. It should be noted that in some examples, such as when the driver and fastener are not in complete axial alignment or due to manufacturing tolerance in use there may not be established two interface regions in each and every recess wing. Nevertheless, stick-fit and stability advantages may still be realized with sufficient interface regions throughout the mated engagement.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In addition to the increased stability provided by the frictional interface at the interface regions <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, the inner radius <b>56</b> of recess <b>40</b> is smaller than the inner radius <b>156</b> of the standard hexalobular recess <b>140</b>. That smaller inner radius <b>56</b> in combination with the tapered interface surface <b>50</b> results in contact with the driver closer to the center axis <b>226</b>. This provides additional drive wall for transferring torque as shown as driver lobe engagement length <b>310</b>. This results in a drive-wall-ratio of the driver lobe engagement length <b>310</b> to &#x201c;AT&#x201d; dimension of from about 0.15 to about 0.21. In one particular embodiment, the drive-wall-ratio is preferably from about 0.17 to about 0.19, and more preferably about 0.18. An increased drive-wall-ratio improves bit to recess driving torque per lobe. This increase drive-wall-ratio is an advantage as compared to standard six lobe recess that utilize a 0.11 drive-wall-ratio according to the hexalobular recess standards when mated with a standard hexalobular driver</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a view taken along section line X-X of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> through diametrically opposed interface regions <b>302</b>. It shows the frictional engagement between the driver bit end and the tapered interface surface <b>50</b> at interface region <b>302</b> occurs in the lower part of the recess. In an alternative embodiment, the tapered interface surface <b>50</b> at interface region <b>304</b> occurs in the lower one third of the recess. A small clearance <b>310</b> between the driver <b>220</b> and the recess <b>40</b> is provided upon mating to ensure contact at interface regions <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> instead of bottoming out, to allow clearance for plating build up in the bottom of the recess, and also to prevent damage to the driver <b>220</b> tip.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>12</b></figref> shows another standard six lobed driver <b>420</b>, namely the six lobed driver described in the Hughes '795 patent, in mating engagement with recess <b>40</b>. Because of the improved configuration of recess <b>40</b>, fastener <b>20</b> is able to provide mating engagement with multiple six lobed drivers, including the Hughes '795 patent driver. The driver <b>420</b> includes a central longitudinal axis <b>426</b>, a central portion, and a plurality of lobes <b>442</b> radiating outwardly from the central portion. Adjacent lobes <b>442</b> are separated by transition contours <b>445</b>. The lobes <b>442</b> have been expanded in the &#x201c;AH&#x201d; dimension between opposing lobe outer end walls <b>441</b> as compared to the standard hexalobular driver <b>220</b> and as described in the Hughes '795 patent.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The driver <b>420</b> has an inner radius <b>456</b> greater than recess inner radius <b>56</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and less then top radial distance <b>59</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b></figref>) resulting in a negative clearance, i.e., interference at interface regions <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>.

Punches may be formed according to conventional punch-forming techniques such as use of hobbing dies.

A spiral recess <b>840</b> (in phantom), for example like the embodiments described in the Stacy '645 patent, and a high strength spiral recess <b>940</b>, for example like the embodiments described in the Dilling '274 patent and the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>.

Such configurations as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> are also applicable to a fastener recess, projection, or their respective drivers as it is understood that only a small clearance between fastener and driver is provided for insertion and removal of the driver. It should be noted that, in accordance with the present disclosure, the recesses are constructed with disclosed interface surfaces/wedges. For example, such that the driver bit end has a radius at the transition contour (half of the driver &#x201c;B&#x201d; dimension), which is greater than the recess root radial distance of the improved recess and less than the improved recess top radial distance. For simplicity, the tapered interface surface (e.g., <b>650</b>, <b>750</b> of corresponding fasteners <b>620</b> and <b>720</b>) are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0106">The spiral recess <b>840</b> is shown in phantom having wings <b>842</b> extending outward from a core <b>812</b> with a radius (R<sub>2</sub>&#x2032;) and defined by installation drive surfaces <b>843</b> and removal drive surfaces <b>844</b>. As will be discussed further below, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b></figref>, at least one of the side walls, e.g., drive surfaces <b>843</b>, <b>844</b>, defines a segment of a spiral.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> illustrates, in polar coordinates, an ideal spiral having desirable characteristics for use in the spiral configurations in that it can be oriented with respect to the axis of rotation corresponding to the longitudinal axis of a threaded fastener and that, when so rotated, as through an angle &#x3b8;, will remain parallel to and spaced from the unrotated spiral. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, the ideal spiral indicated at position A, when rotated through an angle &#x3b8; to the position indicated at B, will remain parallel to that of position A but will be spaced from that of position A by a gap indicated at C. Although the magnitude of the gap C will increase as the rotation angle &#x3b8; is increased, for any given angle of &#x3b8;, the gap C will remain constant over the spiral length. The geometry of the constant gap spiral is defined by the following equation, expressed in polar coordinates:</p><p id="p-0110" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3b8;<i>R/R</i><sub>i</sub>)<sup>2</sup>&#x2212;1+Arcsin(<i>R/R</i><sub>i</sub>)<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#x2212;(&#x3c0;/2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0111" num="0108">where:</p><p id="p-0112" num="0000">&#x3b8;=the rotation angle (in radians) of a ray crossing the curve at a distance r from the axis of rotation; R<sub>i</sub>=the initial radius as measured from the axis of rotation to the initial point of the spiral; and R=the radius of the spiral at a rotation angle &#x3b8;, also measured from the axis of rotation.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0109">From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that when the driver is formed with drive walls embodying the constant gap spiral and is driven to engage the spiral walls of the recess, the spiral drive wall on the driver will engage fully and simultaneously, the corresponding spiral drive wall on the recess. The polar coordinate graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is intended merely to illustrate an ideal spiral in which the gap between rotated positions of the spiral is constant, i.e., a constant gap spiral, so that the spirals may be considered as paralleling.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0110">In accordance with the disclosure, the spiral face(s) on the drive wall of a wing of the recess is located so that the initial point <b>1054</b> of the spiral is radially spaced from the central axis <b>1044</b> of the recess by a radius R<sub>i </sub>In accordance with the invention, those portions of the spiral faces that are located closer to the initial point <b>1054</b> will transmit a greater portion of the applied torque in a direction that will rotatably drive the screw than more outwardly located portions. The spiral driver face and driver engageable recess will be most effective in transmitting torque by configuring those faces to conform to the portions of the spiral that are more closely disposed to the initial point <b>1054</b>. In accordance with the invention, the force transmitting walls should be curved to conform to that portion of the spiral that extends from R=1 on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> to no more than about R=3.5 (indicated at point <b>1062</b>) and, more preferably, within the range of R=1 to about R=2. Considered in terms of the angle of the circular arc subtended by the desired inner portion of the spiral, the angle may include, at a maximum, about 125&#xb0;, more preferably about 90&#xb0; or less and, most preferably, about 45&#xb0; or less.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> and <b>22</b></figref> are force diagrams showing the force components acting at an arbitrary point along a curved surface of an engaged driver and recess walls. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> illustrates a force diagram for the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> shows a driver <b>1034</b>B having a removal drive wall <b>1048</b>B in face-to-face engagement, along the curved interface <b>1068</b>, with the removal wall <b>1026</b>B of a recessed fastener head <b>1016</b>B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> represents, diagrammatically, the force vectors when a counterclockwise torque, as suggested at <b>1070</b> is applied, about the axis <b>1044</b>B of the screw. At a selected point of interest <b>1072</b>, the driver <b>1034</b>B applies a force <b>1074</b> to the recess face <b>1026</b>B along a direction that is normal to the interface <b>1068</b>. Normal force <b>1074</b> resolves into a component <b>1076</b> that applies only torque to the screw and another component <b>1078</b> that generates radially outward compressive stress, but no torque. Additionally, the normal force <b>1074</b> results in the development of a frictional force <b>1080</b> directed along a tangent <b>1082</b> to the interface <b>1068</b>. The frictional force <b>1080</b>, in turn, resolves into a component <b>1084</b> that is additive to the torque component <b>1076</b> and another component <b>1086</b> that opposes and is subtractive with respect to the radial outward component <b>1078</b>. The magnitude of the frictional force <b>1080</b> relative to the normal force <b>1074</b> depends on the coefficient of friction that, of course, will vary with the surface smoothness, lubricity and material of the screw. The coefficient of friction may, for example, range between about 0.1 and 0.4, with a coefficient of friction of 0.4 having been selected in the development of the force diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> and <b>22</b></figref>. Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> illustrates that with the geometry of the drive and driven walls of the present invention, the torque is produced primarily by the normal force component <b>1074</b>, even with a high frictional coefficient, assumed for purposes of illustration. The torque transmission capability of a fastener embodying the invention does not depend, to any significant degree, on the vector component <b>1084</b> of the frictional force.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> is a force diagram similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> but depicting the effect of a driver-recess curved interface <b>1068</b>&#x2032; that is oriented so that a tangent <b>1082</b>&#x2032; to the curved interface <b>1068</b>&#x2032; at a point <b>1072</b>&#x2032; will be oriented more nearly perpendicular to a radius drawn from the screw axis <b>1044</b>B&#x2032; to the point <b>1072</b>&#x2032;. Such an arrangement is typified by that described in Bradshaw U.S. Pat. No. 2,248,695. From a comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, it will be apparent that the prior art configuration results in a substantially higher radially outward loading of the screw head, as evidenced between the differences in length of the vector components <b>1078</b>&#x2032; and <b>1086</b>&#x2032;, and is primarily dependent upon variable and often unpredictable frictional phenomena for producing torque. The reliance, in the prior art, on friction is apparent by comparing the relative contributions of the frictional component <b>1084</b>&#x2032; with the component <b>1076</b>&#x2032;. From the foregoing, it may be appreciated that a line perpendicular to a tangent to the spiral segment will make an angle &#x3b1; to a radius from the longitudinal axis to the point of tangency representative of the degree to which the force applied by the driver will be transmitted as torque to the fastener. In disclosed embodiments herein, that angle &#x3b1; should not be less than 17&#xb0; and, preferably, is substantially more than 17&#xb0;. Among the significant objectives of the present invention is to provide a drive system by which high torque can be transmitted from a driver to the fastener with reduced risk of yielding or fracturing the screw head and without significant reliance on frictional characteristics.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0113">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> the spiral recess <b>840</b> and high strength spiral recess <b>940</b> in which the wings <b>842</b>, <b>942</b> include spiral drive walls both in the installation and the removal directions but in which one of the drive walls in each wing is of greater torque capacity than the other. The recesses <b>840</b>, <b>940</b> and provide greater torque capacity in the removal direction because the removal drive walls have a greater arc length and corresponding area than do the installation drive walls. Because the forces are applied over a greater surface area in the removal direction greater torque may be applied in that direction.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0114">Although the invention may be most efficiently practiced with the constant gap spiral described above, systems may be provided that incorporate spirals that vary somewhat from the most preferable substantially constant gap spiral while still providing significant advantages over the prior art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> illustrates such examples of such recesses <b>840</b>, <b>940</b>. For example, the recesses are shown having four wings <b>842</b>, <b>942</b>, each having a removal drive wall <b>844</b>,<b>944</b> configured to have a constant gap spiral and an installation drive wall <b>843</b>,<b>943</b> having a different spiral configuration that is oriented to direct the major proportion of force from the driver to the recess in a torque producing direction. In one example, the transition contours <b>845</b> of the installation and removal surfaces on each of the driver and recess wings may be formed in an arcuate contour.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0115">With respect to high strength recess <b>940</b>, it is observed that the cross sectional shape of high strength recess <b>940</b> is constructed with an increased core radius (R<sub>2</sub>) over the spiral recess <b>840</b> (R<sub>2</sub>&#x2032;). The overall radius R<sub>1 </sub>remains unchanged, thereby requiring a shortening of the height h of wing <b>942</b> in order to accommodate the enlarged core radius R<sub>2</sub>. This results in a reduced surface area for the driving surfaces with an anticipated deficit to performance. The cross section of wing <b>942</b> is further modified by moving the installation and removal surfaces <b>943</b> and <b>944</b> outward in a parallel manner to form a truncated wing shape with a wing outer end wall <b>941</b>. The wing outer end wall <b>941</b> is constructed to conform to a segment of a circle, concentric with the core <b>912</b>, having a diameter larger than the core diameter. The drive surfaces <b>943</b> and <b>944</b> are constructed to intersect the core diameter in a transition contour <b>945</b> between adjacent wings, for example, wings <b>942</b><i>a </i>and <b>942</b><i>d </i>with transition contour <b>945</b><i>d</i>. The transition contour <b>945</b> has a concave form that conforms to the core diameter.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0116">The wings <b>942</b><i>a,b,c,d </i>are defined respectively by installation drive surfaces <b>943</b><i>a,b,c,d</i>, wing outer end walls <b>941</b><i>a,b,c,d</i>, and removal drive surfaces <b>944</b><i>a,b,c,d</i>. Adjacent wings intersect the core circumference <b>912</b> in transition contours <b>945</b><i>a,b,c,d. </i></p><p id="p-0121" num="0117">Instead of a deficit in performance, these changes have resulted in a startling increase in driver strength and a significant rise in seating torque capability for spiral drive fastener systems. The reduction in drive surface area is offset by the improved distribution characteristics from the drive surfaces to the core.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0118">The increased strength of the high strength recess <b>940</b> and corresponding driver and the increased seating torque, may be attributed to the recess and driver being constructed with a core diameter that is increased over prior art spiral fastener systems. It would have been logical to try to maintain the area of the drive surfaces by constructing the transition surface as a convex continuation of the installation and removal surfaces <b>943</b> and <b>944</b> similar to the prior art designs. Instead, the drive surfaces <b>943</b> and <b>9944</b> are constructed to intersect the core diameter in a transition contour <b>945</b> between the wings <b>942</b> that has a concave form conforming to the core diameter. This adds to core strength, but further truncates the wing cross section and reduces drive surface area. In addition, by truncating the outer tip of the wing cross section and moving the drive surfaces outward in parallel with prior art configurations, the wing may be enlarged and formed with a blunt tip, the strength of the system may be further increased. It is observed that the center of mass of the wing will also be moved outward, thereby effecting an improved load distribution.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0119">This is accompanied by a shortening of the radial extension of the wing of both recess and driver cross sections beyond the core diameter. The wing cross section of the driver/recess is further modified by moving the installation and removal surfaces in a parallel manner to form a truncated wing shape with a blunt tip. The blunt tip is constructed to conform to a circle, concentric with the core, with a diameter larger than the core diameter.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0120">To accomplish this the cross section of the wing portion of the high strength recess <b>940</b> (and therefore also the wing portion of the corresponding driver) is truncated both outward from the core circumference <b>912</b> and inward from wing outer end wall <b>941</b>. In this manner, the wings <b>942</b> are constructed so that the ratio of core radius R<sub>2 </sub>to the wing tip radius R<sub>1 </sub>is greater than 0.55 and the transition contour <b>945</b> between the wings <b>942</b> is a concave segment of the core circumference. Preferably the ratio of R<sub>2</sub>/R<sub>1 </sub>is in the range of 0.65 to 0.70. In addition the width w of the wings <b>942</b>, is enlarged while maintaining the profile of the drive surfaces to be consistent with prior art fastener systems. The ratio h/w of the height h of the wing cross section to its width w is constructed to be approximately equal to or less than 0.5. In&#x2032; comparison, for example referring to recess <b>840</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, the ratio R&#x2032;<sub>2</sub>/R<sub>1 </sub>may be calculated to be approximately 0.46 and the ratio of spiral recess <b>840</b> (h&#x2032;/w&#x2032;) may be calculated to be approximately 0.93. These modified dimensions have proven to provide a significant advantageous improvement in bit strength to recess <b>940</b>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> shows a six-winged example of a spirally configured recess <b>1140</b> within a head of fastener <b>1120</b> and a corresponding driver <b>1121</b>.
