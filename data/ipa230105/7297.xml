Depending on the network conditions, the appropriate bitrate-resolution pair referred to as a representation is selected and delivered to the end-user. Traditional approaches mainly use a single bitrate ladder for all video contents, or they use a limited number of fixed bitrate ladders for different video genres. For example, a conventional approach classifies video content into three different categories including, animation, sport, and movie and encode each genre into a different fixed bitrate ladder. However, due to the huge diversity in video characteristics, this &#x201c;one-size-fits-all&#x201d; bitrate ladder needs further improvement.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Using a fixed bitrate ladder for all video content is far from optimal&#x2014;a less complex video may suffer from over-allocating bitrate, leading to bandwidth waste, and conversely, under-allocating bitrate for high complex videos results in a lower Quality of Experience (QoE). An optimal bitrate ladder requires different bitrates for a certain perceived video quality.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to the bitrate, the impact of spatial resolution on the perceived video quality is another consideration for better QoE. The usual trend is that lower resolutions outperform higher resolutions at lower bitrates, and as the bitrate increases, the resolution is switched to a higher resolution. The lower resolution version of each video content is affected by compression and upsampling artifacts, while the highest resolution version is only affected by compression artifacts. At lower bitrates, the lower resolution versions have better quality than the highest resolution version due to the smaller number of pixels, which results in a higher quality video than the highest resolution version encoded at the same bitrate, even when upsampling is applied. However, as the bitrate increases, higher resolution versions will outperform lower resolution versions in terms of quality. This has motivated researchers to optimize the bitrate ladder per video content and per-title encoding. Typically, for each video content, the bitrate ladder is optimized over (i) bitrate and (ii) resolution.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Per-title encoding can significantly reduce the storage and delivery costs of video streams and increase QoE based on the fact that in a given bitrate range, each resolution performs better than others in a specific region and these regions are dependent on the video content. To compare the quality of different resolutions, all resolutions are upscaled to that of the original video and scaled objective metrics are calculated. Therefore, each video segment is encoded at a number of quality levels and bitrate-resolution pairs per each quality level. The resolution and bitrate are limited to a finite set. The encodings are selected based on the following criteria: (i) the selected bitrate-resolution pair should be of the highest possible quality; (ii) there should be a perceptual gap between adjacent selected bitrates.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another conventional approach, the encodings are selected between two quality levels: (i) upper quality, where there is no visible quality improvement beyond that; (ii) lower quality, where encoding artifacts become visible lower than that. N encodings are selected between these two quality levels to form the bitrate ladder. An example of selecting four encodings for their per-title bitrate ladder is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In this example, the upper quality PSNR has been set to 45 dB, and the lower quality PSNR has been set to 35 dB, and N is equal to 4. MiPSO utilizes a multi-period per-scene optimization procedure that optimizes the bitrate ladder for (i) maximum possible quality or (ii) minimum possible bitrate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Considering r resolutions, and b bitrates, finding the per-title bitrate ladder requires r&#xd7;b encodings to be encoded. To avoid a brute force encoding of all bitrate-resolution pairs, some methods pre-analyze the video contents. A content-gnostic method that utilizes machine learning to find the bitrate range for each resolution that outperforms the other resolutions also has been introduced. This approach requires 94.2% fewer pre-encodes compared to the brute force approach while reaching a 0.51 BD-Rate loss.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Current per-title encoding schemes encode the same video content (or snippets/subsets thereof) at various bitrates and spatial resolutions to find the optimal bitrate ladder for each video file. Based on the bitrate-quality relationship, a convex-hull is formed for each content and the optimal bitrate ladder is defined. Compared to traditional approaches, in which a predefined, content-agnostic (&#x201c;fit-to-all&#x201d;) encoding ladder was applied to all video contents, per-title encoding can result in a significant decrease in the storage and delivery costs of video streams and increase the quality of service (QoS). In current per-title encoding schemes, the bitrate ladder is optimized using only spatial resolution, while we argue that with the emergence of high frame rate videos, this principle can be extended to the temporal resolution.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The usual trend is that lower resolutions outperform higher resolutions at lower bitrates, and as the bitrate increases, the resolution is switched to a higher resolution. The lower resolution version of each video content is affected by compression and upsampling artifacts, while the highest resolution version is only affected by compression artifacts. At lower bitrates, the lower resolution versions have better quality than the highest resolution version due to the smaller number of pixels, which results in a higher quality video than the highest resolution version encoded at the same bitrate, even when upsampling is applied. However, as the bitrate increases, higher resolution versions will outperform lower resolution versions in terms of quality. As an example, two videos, namely Golf and Jockey from UVG and BVI-HFR datasets were encoded at two resolutions (i.e., 1080p and 540p), and their encoding efficiency is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. For Golf, there is a change over at approx. 1400 kbps between RD curves at 540p and 1080p resolutions. At lower bitrates than this intersection, 540p outperforms 1080p resolution, while 1080p will be superior at higher bitrates. On the other hand, for Jockey, 540p is superior at the given bitrate. This content-based behavior motivated researchers to optimize the bitrate ladder per video content and per-title encoding was introduced. In general, for each video content, the bitrate ladder is optimized over (i) bitrate and (ii) resolution.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Per-title encoding can significantly reduce the storage and delivery costs of video streams and increase QoE.

A method for per-title encoding may include: receiving a video input comprising a plurality of video segments; spatially downscaling the video input to generate a first downscaled representation of the video input; temporally downscaling the first downscaled representation of the video input to generate a second downscaled representation of the video input; encoding the second downscaled representation of the video input to generate an encoded video; temporally upscaling the encoded video to generate a first upscaled encoded video; and spatially upscaling the first upscaled encoded video to generate a second upscaled encoded video. In some examples, the spatially downscaling the video input comprises reducing the resolution of the video input such that the first downscaled representation of the video input has a lower resolution than the video input. In some examples, reducing the resolution of the video input comprises reducing the resolution of each of the plurality of video segments. In some examples, the temporally downscaling the first downscaled representation of the video input comprises reducing the number of frames in the first downscaled representation such that the second downscaled representation has fewer frames than the video input. In some examples, reducing the number of frames in the first downscaled representation of the video input comprises reducing the number of frames of each of the plurality of video segments. In some examples, the temporally upscaling the encoded video comprises duplicating frames. In some examples, the temporally upscaling the encoded video comprises frame averaging. In some examples, the temporally upscaling the encoded video comprises video interpolation. In some examples, the temporally upscaling the encoded video comprises bicubic interpolation. In some examples, the first upscaled encoded video has the same number of frames as the video input. In some examples, the second upscaled encoded video has the same resolution as the video input.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some examples, the method also includes calculating an objective metric using the second upscaled encoded video. In some examples, the objective metric comprises a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). In some examples, the objective metric comprises a video multimethod assessment fusion (VMAF). In some examples, the encoding is performed according to an H.26x standard. In some examples, the encoded video comprises an uncompressed encoding.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A system for per-title encoding may include: a memory comprising non-transitory computer-readable storage medium configured to store a plurality of video segments and data associated with the plurality of video segments; one or more processors configured to execute instructions stored on the memory to: receive a video input comprising the plurality of video segments, spatially downscale the video input to generate a first downscaled representation of the video input, temporally downscale the first downscaled representation of the video input to generate a second downscaled representation of the video input, encode the second downscaled representation of the video input to generate an encoded video, temporally upscale the encoded video to generate a first upscaled encoded video, and spatially upscale the first upscaled encoded video to generate a second upscaled encoded video.

This invention employs sophisticated techniques in order to find the optimal bitrate ladder for each video file using both spatial and temporal resolutions. Per-title encoding using Spatio-Temporal Resolutions (PSTR) optimizes the bitrate ladder over both spatial and temporal resolutions. In this invention, based on a given input (e.g., original) video sequence with high temporal (e.g., 60-120 fps and higher) and spatial (e.g., 720p-1080p and higher) resolutions, each sequence or segment of the input video sequence may be downscaled spatially and temporally to lower spatial resolutions and frame rates to find optimal spatial and temporal resolutions for each bitrate.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, and described below, to find the optimal spatial and temporal resolutions for each bitrate, each video segment may be spatially and temporally downscaled. An optimal spatial and temporal resolutions for each bitrate may be selected from two or more spatial resolutions (e.g., 1080p, 720p, 540p, etc.) and two or more framerates (e.g., 120 fps, 60 fps, 30 fps, etc.).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Per-title encoding using PSTR optimizes the bitrate ladder over both spatial and temporal resolutions. This approach significantly improves the performance of bitrate savings by considering the temporal resolution in addition to the spatial resolution. In some examples, using lower spatial resolution and frame rates at lower bitrates and higher spatial resolution and frame rates at higher bitrates yields improved quality. Using methods described herein, improvements to the impact of temporal resolution on video compression and perceived video quality are shown in HFR videos.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Under a low bitrate constraint, a lower spatial resolution is often beneficial over a lower framerate. Furthermore, a low framerate may be beneficial for video sequences with high temporal activity, and a high framerate may be beneficial for video sequences with low temporal activity. In some examples, a parametric model may be used to predict the perceived video quality considering: (i) bitrates, (ii) framerate, (iii) display sizes, and (iv) video content. In some examples, a subjective test may be conducted on compressed videos at different (i) quantization levels, (ii) framerates, and (iii) spatial resolutions. Temporal resolution has a high impact on video compression and the perceived video quality. Therefore, the methods described herein optimize the bitrate ladder over both spatial and temporal resolutions.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">At higher bitrates, usually, there are enough bits to allocate to all frames and their pixels. At lower bitrates, however, the lack of an adequate bitrate budget results in inferior video quality. To overcome this problem, video frames are usually downscaled to get enough bitrate budget. However, an upscaling artifact is added when the compressed video at a lower resolution is restored to its original resolution. Therefore, there is often a trade-off between the perceived video quality of the compressed video in its original resolution and an upscaled version of the video when it is compressed at a lower resolution. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a chart showing perceived video quality to framerates using prior art methods. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, without consideration of temporal resolution, encoding at higher spatial resolutions typically results in higher quality at all bitrates. This trade-off depends on the content and may be improved by per-title encoding. It may be further improved by consideration of temporal resolutions, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">To avoid high compression artifacts on a video compressed in high resolution and framerate, videos can also be downsampled in time (e.g., by framerate reduction). With frame dropping, bitrate budget may be allocated to remaining frames for quality improvement. However, a temporal artifact is often added when the video is temporally upscaled back to its native framerate. Again, a trade-off is made between the perceived video quality of the compressed video at its original framerate and the video compressed at a lower framerate that is temporally upscaled. Typically, higher framerates are advantageous at higher bitrates, in particular in simple sequences with camera motions. However, at lower bitrates, a lower framerate video may perform better than higher framerate video in terms of encoding efficiency.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a chart showing perceived video quality when per-title encoding using spatial and temporal resolution downscaling, in accordance with one or more embodiments. Perceived video quality may be represented using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), video multimethod assessment fusion (VMAF), and other objective metrics. The chart shows two exemplary videos were encoded at their original spatial resolution (e.g., 1080p or other high spatial resolution) and at two different framerates (e.g., line <b>103</b><i>a </i>showing scaled VMAF for a first video encoded at 60 fps, line <b>103</b><i>b </i>showing scaled VMAF of the first video encoded at 120 fps, line <b>104</b><i>a </i>showing scaled VMAF for a second video encoded at 60 fps, and line <b>104</b><i>b </i>showing scaled VMAF for the second video encoded at 120 fps). Similar to spatial resolution, the quality of each framerate outperforms the other in a specific region. For example, at lower bitrates, lower framerates (e.g., lines <b>103</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>a</i>) perform better, whereas at higher bitrates, higher framerates (e.g., lines <b>103</b><i>b </i>and <b>104</b><i>b</i>). Likewise to spatial resolution, each framerate's superior region depends on the video content. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, for the first video, the cross-over between lines <b>103</b><i>a </i>and <b>103</b><i>b </i>happens at a higher bitrate at a higher bitrate (approximately 5300 kbps), whereas for the second video, the cross-over between lines <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>happens at a lower bitrate (approximately 810 kbps).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Considering the impact of framerate, in PSTR, the perceived video quality or QoE is considered as a function of three parameters: (i) bitrate (b), (ii) spatial resolution (r), and (iii) framerate (f):</p><p id="p-0038" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>QoE=<i>F</i>(<i>b, r, f</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0039" num="0000">while in conventional methods QoE is defined as a function of b and r, i.e., QoE=F(b, r). Therefore, we optimize the bitrate ladder over these parameters, i.e., b, r, and f. To design the PSTR bitrate ladder and form the convex hull, the following parameters are determined for each video content:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0037">b: a set of bitrates or quality levels.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0038">r: a set of spatial resolutions.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0039">f: a set of framerates.<br/>and the original video is temporally and spatially downscaled to generate r&#xd7;f uncompressed encodings. Because of practical constraints, these sets are limited to finite sets. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example of generated encodings, wherein the original video is temporally and spatially downscaled to generate N&#xd7;M uncompressed encodings&#x2014;the original video being temporally downscaled from framerates f<sub>1 </sub>to f<sub>N </sub>and spatially downscaled from resolutions r<sub>1 </sub>to r<sub>M</sub>. All of them are encoded at b bitrates or quality levels resulting in a total of r&#xd7;f&#xd7;b encodings. From these encodings, bitrate-resolution-framerate triples that are closer to the convex hull are selected to form the per-title bitrate ladder.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0040" num="0040">Note that optimization over f framerates will require a compression of r&#xd7;f&#xd7;b encodings, i.e., f times more encodings than conventional methods (i.e., r&#xd7;b), resulting in additional computations. However, the optimal bitrate-resolution-framerate triple can be estimated using prediction methods (e.g., machine learning) to avoid a brute force process. To reduce the framerate, frame dropping or frame averaging may be used. Frame dropping is a computationally inexpensive task.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0041">To evaluate the quality of the encodings, for encodings where the resolution or framerate does not match that of the original video, encoded video may be spatially and/or temporally upscaled. An example of an objective metric calculation when implementing method for per-title encoding using spatial and temporal resolutions, as disclosed herein, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In diagram <b>400</b>, the original video input <b>402</b> (e.g., 1080p, 60 fps) comprising a plurality of video segments may be spatially downscaled to video representation <b>404</b> (e.g., 540p, 60 fps) with a lower spatial resolution than video input <b>402</b>. Video representation <b>404</b> may be temporally downscaled to video representation <b>406</b> (e.g., 540p, 30 fps) with a lower temporal resolution (e.g., fewer frames), and video representation <b>406</b> may be encoded at encoder/decoder <b>408</b> (e.g., using H.26x standards, such as H.261, H.262, H.263, Advanced Video Coding (AVC), High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), and the like). Thereafter, encoded video <b>416</b> may be inversely upscaled temporally (e.g., by duplicating frames, frame averaging, video interpolation, and the like) to generate video representation <b>414</b> (e.g., 540p, 30 fps) and spatially upscaled to generate output video <b>412</b>, which matches the resolution and framerate of the original video. Objective metrics of both original video <b>402</b> and output video <b>412</b> may be calculated by objective metrics calculator <b>410</b>, such objective metrics may include peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and video multimethod assessment fusion (VMAF), among others. To avoid the costly impact of sophisticated spatial and temporal resolution upscaling methods a bicubic interpolation and frame duplicating method, along with other methods such as averaging or video interpolation methods, may be used.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0042">Example Data</p><p id="p-0043" num="0043">In an example, nine HFR videos with 1080p and 120 fps from two datasets, i.e., BVI-HFR and UVG. Spatial Information (SI), and Temporal Information (TI) of these test videos are shown in Table 1 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. From each video, its first four seconds have been selected. These video segments are spatially and temporally downscaled to generate nine uncompressed encodings per each video. In other examples, video segments may be downscaled to generate more or less than nine encodings per video.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0044">Many objective metrics have been introduced to mimic human vision. Some of them take framerate into consideration. Benchmarking objective metrics indicate that peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and video multimethod assessment fusion (VMAF) are among the top highly correlated objective metrics.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0045">In an example, a set of three parameters may be used to optimize the bitrate ladder in PSTR, i.e., bitrate, resolution, and framerate. Three spatial resolutions (r=3), namely 1080p, 540p, and 270p and three framerates (f=3), namely 120 fps, 60 fps, and 30 fps resulting in 9 uncompressed encodings. In other examples, more or less spatial resolutions and framerates may be used to result in more or less encodings (e.g., r=2 or 4 or more, f=2 or 4 or more). For bitrate, a fixed set of bitrates (e.g., 45, 350, 550, 990, 1700, 2400, 3200, 4500, and 5800 kbps) adopted from HLS bitrate ladder for HEVC may be used. Each of the nine generated uncompressed encodings that differ from the others in resolution and/or framerate may be encoded at the nine different bitrates resulting in a total of 3&#xd7;3&#xd7;9=81 compressed encodings per video sequence. The bitrate-resolution-framerate triples that are as close as possible to the convex hull are selected for each bitrate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>D</figref> is a series of charts showing exemplary RD curves and convex hulls for an exemplary video sequence according to PSNR and VMAF, in accordance with one or more embodiments. The selected bitrate-resolution-framerate triples confirm the impact of both spatial and temporal resolutions on the bitrate ladder optimization. As described herein bitrate-resolution-framerate triples are dependent on the video content. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a comparison is made between BD-Rates calculated according to: (i) conventional (i.e., &#x201c;state-of-the-art&#x201d;) methods wherein we optimize the bitrate ladder only over the spatial resolution&#x2014;to form a convex hull, we select the bitrate-resolution-framerate triples using a framerate of 120 fps, and (ii) PSTR, wherein we optimize the bitrate ladder over both spatial and temporal resolutions, as described herein (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref>). Table 1 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> summarizes bitrate savings (BD-Rate) against encoding at 1080p and 120 fps for a variety of example videos with varying video content. PSTR doubles the bitrate saving on average compared to conventional methods using both PSNR or VMAF as objective metrics. These results demonstrate that the temporal resolution can have a similar impact on the per-title encoding as the spatial resolution has. For some sequences, PSTR is significantly better than the conventional method, which shows the dependency of improvement on the video content. As shown in Table 1, for sequences with lower TI, the bitrate saving of PSTR over the state-of-the-art method is higher.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0046">Example Methods</p><p id="p-0047" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref> are flow diagrams illustrating exemplary methods for per-title encoding using spatial and temporal resolutions, in accordance with one or more embodiments.
