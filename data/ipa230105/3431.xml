Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a view showing a state in which a door is opened. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a partial enlarged view of an ice-maker according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">For convenience of description and understanding, directions will be defined. Hereinafter, based on a bottom face on which the refrigerator is installed, a direction toward the bottom face may be referred to as a downward direction, and a direction toward a top face of a cabinet <b>2</b>, which is opposite to the bottom face, may be referred to as an upward direction. Further, when an undefined direction is described, the direction may be described by being defined based on each drawing.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, a refrigerator <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may include a cabinet <b>2</b> for defining a storage space therein, and a door for opening and closing the storage space.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In detail, the cabinet <b>2</b> defines the storage space vertically divided by a barrier. A refrigerating compartment <b>3</b> may be defined at an upper portion of the storage space, and a freezing compartment <b>4</b> may be defined at a lower portion of the storage space.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">An accommodation member such as a drawer, a shelf, a basket, and the like may be disposed in each of the refrigerating compartment <b>3</b> and the freezing compartment <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The door may include a refrigerating compartment door <b>5</b> shielding the refrigerating compartment <b>3</b> and a freezing compartment door <b>6</b> shielding the freezing compartment <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The refrigerating compartment door <b>5</b> includes a pair of left and right doors, which may be opened and closed by pivoting. Further, the freezing compartment door <b>6</b> may be disposed to be retractable or extendable like a drawer.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In another example, the arrangement of the refrigerating compartment <b>3</b> and the freezing compartment <b>4</b> and the shape of the door may be changed based on kinds of the refrigerators. However, the present disclosure may not be limited thereto, and may be applied to various kinds of refrigerators. For example, the freezing compartment <b>4</b> and the refrigerating compartment <b>3</b> may be arranged horizontally, or the freezing compartment <b>4</b> may be disposed above the refrigerating compartment <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In one example, one of the pair of refrigerating compartment doors <b>5</b> on both sides may have an ice-making chamber <b>8</b> defined therein for receiving a main ice-maker <b>81</b>. The ice-making chamber <b>8</b> may receive cold-air from an evaporator (not shown) in the cabinet <b>2</b> to allow ice to be made in the main ice-maker <b>81</b>, and may define an insulated space together with the refrigerating compartment <b>3</b>. In another example, depending on a structure of the refrigerator, the ice-making chamber may be defined inside the refrigerating compartment <b>3</b> rather than the refrigerating compartment door <b>5</b>, and the main ice-maker <b>81</b> may be disposed inside the ice-making chamber.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">A dispenser <b>7</b> may be disposed on one side of the refrigerating compartment door <b>5</b>, which corresponds to a position of the ice-making chamber <b>8</b>. The dispenser <b>7</b> may be capable of dispensing water or ice, and may have a structure in communication with the ice-making chamber <b>8</b> to enable dispensing of ice made in the ice-maker <b>81</b>.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In one example, the freezing compartment <b>4</b> may be equipped with an ice-maker <b>100</b>. The ice-maker <b>100</b>, which makes ice using water supplied, may produce ice in a spherical shape. The ice-maker <b>100</b> may be referred to as an auxiliary ice-maker because the ice-maker <b>100</b> usually generates less ice than the main ice-maker <b>81</b> or is used less than the main ice-maker <b>81</b>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The freezing compartment <b>4</b> may be equipped with a duct <b>44</b> for supplying cold-air to the freezing compartment <b>100</b>. Thus, a portion of the cold-air generated in the evaporator and supplied to the freezing compartment <b>4</b> may be flowed toward the ice-maker <b>100</b> to make ice in an indirect cooling manner.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Further, an ice bin <b>102</b> in which the made ice is stored after being transferred from the ice maker <b>100</b> may be further provided below the ice maker <b>100</b>. Further, the ice bin <b>102</b> may be disposed in a freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b> which is extended from the freezing compartment <b>4</b>. Further, the ice bin <b>102</b> may be configured to be retracted and extended together with the freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b> to allow a user to take out the stored ice.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Thus, the ice-maker <b>100</b> and the ice bin <b>102</b> may be viewed as at least a portion of which is received in the freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b>. Further, a large portion of the ice-maker <b>100</b> and the ice bin <b>102</b> may be hidden when viewed from the outside. Further, the ice stored in the ice bin <b>102</b> may be easily taken out by the retraction and extension of the freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In another example, the ice made in the ice-maker <b>100</b> or the ice stored in the ice bin <b>102</b> may be transferred to the dispenser <b>7</b> by transfer means and dispensed through the dispenser <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In another example, the refrigerator <b>1</b> may not include the dispenser <b>7</b> and the main ice-maker <b>81</b>, but include only the ice-maker <b>1</b>. The ice-maker <b>100</b> may be disposed in the ice-making chamber <b>8</b> in place of the main ice-maker <b>81</b>.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Hereinafter, the mounting structure of the ice-maker <b>100</b> will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Hereinafter, a mounting structure of the ice-maker <b>100</b> will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a partial perspective view illustrating an interior of a freezing compartment according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of a grill pan and an ice duct according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the storage space inside the cabinet <b>2</b> may be defined by an inner casing <b>21</b>. Further, the inner casing <b>21</b> defines the vertically divided storage space, that is, the refrigerating compartment <b>3</b> and freezing compartment <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">A portion of a top face of the freezing compartment <b>4</b> may be opened, and a mounting cover <b>43</b> may be formed at a position corresponding to a position where the ice-maker <b>100</b> is mounted. The mounting cover <b>43</b> may be coupled and fixed to the inner casing <b>21</b>, and define a space further recessed upwardly from the top face of the freezing compartment <b>4</b> to secure a space in which the ice-maker <b>100</b> is disposed. Further, the mounting cover <b>43</b> may include a structure for fixing and mounting the ice-maker <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Further, the mounting cover <b>43</b> may further include a cover recess <b>431</b> defined therein, which may be further recessed upwards to receive an upper ejector <b>300</b> to be described below. Since the upper ejector <b>300</b> has a structure that protrudes upward from the top face of the ice-maker <b>100</b>, the upper ejector <b>300</b> may be received in the cover recess <b>431</b> to minimize a space used by the ice-maker <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Further, the mounting cover <b>43</b> may have a water-supply hole <b>432</b> defined therein for supplying water to the ice-maker <b>100</b>. Although not shown, a pipe for supplying the water toward the ice-maker <b>100</b> may penetrate the water-supply hole <b>432</b>. Further, an electrical-wire in connection with the ice-maker <b>100</b> may pass through the mounting cover <b>43</b>. Further, because of the connector connected to the electrical-wire, the ice-maker <b>100</b> may be in a state of being electrically connected and being able to be powered.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">A rear wall face of the freezing compartment <b>4</b> may be formed by a grill pan <b>42</b>. The grill pan <b>42</b> may divide the space in the inner casing <b>21</b> horizontally, and may define, at rearward of the freezing compartment, a space for receiving an evaporator (not shown) that generates the cold-air and a blower fan (not shown) that circulates the cold-air therein.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">The grill pan <b>42</b> may include cold-air ejectors <b>421</b> and <b>422</b> and a cold-air absorber <b>423</b>. Thus, the cold-air ejectors <b>421</b> and <b>422</b> and the cold-air absorber <b>423</b> may allow air circulation between the freezing compartment <b>4</b> and the space in which the evaporator is placed, and may cool the freezing compartment <b>4</b>. The cold-air ejectors <b>421</b> and <b>422</b> may be formed in a grill shape. The cold-air may be evenly discharged into the freezing compartment <b>4</b> through the upper cold-air ejector <b>421</b> and the lower cold-air ejector <b>422</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In particular, the upper cold-air ejector <b>421</b> may be disposed at a top of the freezing compartment <b>4</b>. Further, the cold-air discharged from the upper cold-air ejector <b>421</b> may be used to cool the ice-maker <b>100</b> and the ice bin <b>102</b> arranged at an upper portion of the freezing compartment <b>4</b>. In particular, the upper cold-air ejector <b>421</b> may include the cold-air duct <b>44</b> for supplying the cold-air to the ice-maker <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The cold-air duct <b>44</b> may connect the upper cold-air ejector <b>421</b> to the cold-air hole <b>134</b> of the ice-maker <b>100</b>. That is, the cold-air duct <b>44</b> may connect the upper cold-air ejector <b>421</b> located at a center of the freezing compartment <b>4</b> in the horizontal direction and the ice-maker <b>100</b> located at an upper end of the freezing compartment <b>4</b>, so that a portion of the cold-air discharged from the upper cold-air ejector <b>421</b> may be supplied directly into the ice-maker <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">The cold-air duct <b>44</b> may be disposed at one end of the upper cold-air ejector <b>421</b> which extends in the horizontal direction. That is, the cold-air discharged from the upper cold-air ejector <b>421</b> is discharged to the freezing compartment <b>4</b>, and cold-air discharged from one side close to the cold-air duct <b>44</b> of the cold-air may be directed to the ice-maker <b>100</b> through the cold-air duct <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Thus, a rear end of the cold-air duct <b>44</b> may be recessed to receive one end of the upper cold-air ejector <b>421</b>. Further, an opened rear face of the cold-air duct <b>44</b> may be shaped in a shape corresponding to a shape of the grill pan <b>42</b>, and may be in contact with the grill pan <b>42</b> to prevent the cold-air from leaking. Further, a coupled portion <b>444</b> may be formed at a rear end of the cold-air duct <b>44</b>, and may be fixed to a front face of the grill pan <b>42</b> by a screw.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">A cross-section of the cold-air duct <b>44</b> may decrease forwardly. Further, a duct outlet <b>446</b> on a front face of the cold-air duct <b>44</b> may be inserted into the cold-air hole <b>134</b> to concentrically supply the cold-air into the ice-maker <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In one example, the cold-air duct <b>44</b> may be constituted by an upper duct <b>443</b> forming an upper portion of the cold-air duct <b>44</b> and a lower duct <b>442</b> forming a lower portion of the cold-air duct <b>44</b>, and may define a whole cold-air passage by coupling of the upper duct <b>443</b> and the lower duct <b>442</b>. Further, the upper duct <b>443</b> and lower duct <b>442</b> may be coupled to each other by a connector <b>443</b>. The connector <b>443</b>, which has a hooking structure like a hook, may be formed on each of the upper duct <b>443</b> and the lower duct <b>442</b>.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional side view of a freezing compartment in a state in which a freezing compartment drawer and an ice bin are retracted therein, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a partially-cut perspective view of a freezing compartment in a state in which a freezing compartment drawer and an ice bin are extended therefrom.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">As shown in the drawings, the ice-maker <b>100</b> may be mounted on the top face of the freezing compartment <b>4</b>. That is, the upper casing <b>120</b>, which forms an outer shape of the ice-maker <b>100</b>, may be mounted on the mounting cover <b>43</b>.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In one example, the refrigerator <b>1</b> is installed to be tilted such that a front end of the cabinet <b>2</b> is slightly higher than a rear end thereof, so that the door <b>6</b> may be closed by a self weight after opening. Thus, the top face of the freezing compartment <b>4</b> may also be tilted relative to a ground on which the refrigerator <b>1</b> is installed, at the same slope as the cabinet <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">In this connection, when the ice-maker <b>100</b> is mounted flush with the top face of the freezing compartment <b>4</b>, a water level of the water supplied inside the ice-maker <b>100</b> may also be tilted, which may result in a problem of a difference in a size of ice cubes respectively made in the chambers. In particular, in a case of the ice-maker <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment for making the spherical ice, when the water level is tilted, amounts of water received in the chambers are different from each other, so that a uniform spherical ice may not be made.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">In order to avoid such problems, the ice-maker <b>100</b> may be mounted to be tilted relative to the top face of the freezing compartment <b>4</b>, that is, based on top and bottom faces of the cabinet <b>2</b>. In detail, the ice-maker <b>100</b> may be mounted to be in a state in which the top face of the upper casing <b>120</b> is pivoted counterclockwise (when viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) by a set angle &#x3b1; based on the top face of the freezing compartment <b>4</b> or the top face of the mounting cover <b>43</b>. In this connection, the set angle &#x3b1; may be equal to the slope of the cabinet <b>2</b>, and may be approximately 0.7&#xb0; to 0.8&#xb0;. Further, the front end of the upper casing <b>120</b> may be approximately 3 mm to 5 mm lower than the rear end thereof.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">In a state of being mounted in the freezing compartment <b>4</b>, the ice-maker <b>100</b> may be tilted by the set angle &#x3b1;, so that the ice-maker <b>100</b> may be horizontal to the ground on which the refrigerator <b>1</b> is installed. Thus, the level of the water supplied into the ice-maker <b>100</b> may become level with the ground, and the same amount of water may be received in the plurality of chambers to make ice of uniform size.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">Further, in a state in which the ice-maker <b>100</b> is mounted, the cold-air hole <b>134</b> at the rear end of the upper casing <b>120</b> may be connected to the upper cold-air ejector <b>421</b>. Thus, the cold-air for the ice-making may be concentrically supplied to an inner upper portion of the upper casing <b>120</b> to increase an ice-making efficiency.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">In one example, the ice bin <b>102</b> may be mounted inside the freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b>. The ice bin <b>102</b> is positioned correctly below the ice-maker <b>100</b> in a state in which the freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b> is retracted. To this end, the freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b> may have a bin mounting guide <b>411</b> which guides a mounting position of the ice bin <b>102</b>. The bin mounting guides <b>411</b> may respectively protrude upwardly from positions corresponding to four corners of the bottom face of the ice bin <b>102</b>, and may be arranged to enclose the four corners of the bottom face of the ice bin <b>102</b>. Thus, the ice bin <b>102</b> may remain in position in a state of being mounted in the freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b>, and may be positioned vertically below the ice-maker <b>100</b> in a state in which the freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b> is retracted.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a bottom of the ice-maker <b>100</b> may be received inside the ice bin <b>102</b> in a state in which the freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b> is retracted. That is, the bottom of the ice-maker <b>100</b> may be located inside the ice bin <b>102</b> and the freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b>. Thus, the ice removed from the ice-maker <b>100</b> may fall and be stored in the ice bin <b>102</b>. Further, a volume loss inside the freezing compartment <b>4</b> due to arrangement of the ice-maker <b>100</b> and the ice bin <b>102</b> may be minimized by minimizing the space between the ice-maker <b>100</b> and the ice bin <b>102</b>. In another example, the bottom of the ice-maker <b>100</b> and the bottom face of the ice bin <b>102</b> may be spaced apart each other by an appropriate distance to ensure a distance for storing an appropriate amount of ice.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">In one example, in a state in which the ice-maker <b>100</b> is mounted therein, the freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b> may be extended or retracted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Further, in this connection, at least a portion of rear faces of the ice bin <b>102</b> and the freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b> may be opened to prevent interference with the ice-maker <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">In detail, a drawer opening <b>412</b> and a bin opening <b>102</b><i>a </i>may be respectively defined in the rear faces of the freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b> and the ice bin <b>102</b> corresponding to the position of the ice-maker <b>100</b>. The drawer opening <b>412</b> and the bin opening <b>102</b><i>a </i>may be respectively defined at positions facing each other. Further, the drawer opening <b>412</b> and the bin opening <b>102</b><i>a </i>may be respectively defined to open from the top of the freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b> and the top of the ice bin <b>102</b> to positions lower than the bottom of the ice-maker <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">Thus, even when the freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b> is extended in a state in which the ice-maker <b>100</b> is mounted therein, the ice-maker <b>100</b> may be prevented from interfering with the ice bin <b>102</b> and the freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">In particular, even in a state in which the ice-maker <b>100</b> removes the ice and the lower assembly <b>200</b> is pivoted, or in a state in which an ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> is pivoted to detect an ice-full state, the drawer opening <b>412</b> and the bin opening <b>102</b><i>a </i>may be in a shape of being recessed further downward from the bottom of the ice-maker <b>100</b> to prevent interference with the freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b> or the ice bin <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">A drawer opening guide <b>412</b><i>a </i>extending rearward along a perimeter of the drawer opening <b>412</b> may be formed.

In this connection, a coupling hook <b>140</b><i>a </i>on the vertical extension <b>140</b> may be coupled with the mounting cover <b>43</b>, so that the ice-maker <b>100</b> may be in an additional provisionally-fixed state. In this state, the screw may be fastened to the threaded portion <b>142</b><i>a</i>, so that the front end of the upper casing <b>120</b> may be coupled to the inner casing <b>21</b> or mounting cover <b>43</b>, thereby completing the installation of the ice-maker <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0253">In other words, the ice-maker <b>100</b> may be mounted by fastening the rear end of the ice-maker <b>100</b> and fixing the front end thereof with the screw without any complicated structure or component for mounting the ice-maker <b>100</b>. The ice-maker <b>100</b> may be easily detached in a reverse order.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0254">In one example, an edge rib <b>120</b><i>d </i>may be formed along a perimeter of the horizontal extension <b>142</b>.

Therefore, it will be apparent that an ice formation speed in the first ice chamber <b>111</b><i>a</i>, where the cold-air is concentratedly supplied, will be high in an early state of the ice-making.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0295">In detail, the ice inside the ice chamber <b>111</b> may be made in an indirect cooling scheme. In particular, the supply of the cold-air is concentrated on the upper tray <b>150</b> side, and the lower tray <b>250</b> is naturally cooled by the cold-air in the refrigerator. In particular, in the present embodiment, in order to make the transparent spherical ice, the lower tray <b>250</b> is periodically heated by the lower heater <b>296</b> disposed in the lower tray <b>250</b>, so that the ice formation starts from the top of the ice chamber <b>111</b> and gradually proceeds downward. Thus, bubbles generated during the ice formation inside the ice chamber <b>111</b> may be concentrated in a lower portion of the lower tray <b>250</b>, so that ice transparent except for a bottom thereof where the bubbles are concentrated may be made.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0296">Due to the nature of such cooling scheme, the ice formation occurs first in the upper tray <b>150</b>. The cold-air is concentrated in the first ice chamber <b>111</b><i>a</i>, so that the ice formation may occur quickly in the first ice chamber <b>111</b><i>a</i>. Further, due to the sequential flow of the cold-air, the ice formation begins sequentially in upper portions of the second ice chamber <b>111</b><i>b </i>and the third ice chamber <b>111</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0298" num="0297">Water expands in a process of being phase-changed into ice. When an ice making speed is high in the first ice chamber <b>111</b><i>a</i>, an expansion force of the water is applied to the second ice chamber <b>111</b><i>b </i>and the third ice chamber <b>111</b><i>c</i>. Then, the water in the first ice chamber <b>111</b><i>a </i>passes between the upper tray <b>150</b> and the lower tray <b>250</b> and flows toward the second ice chamber <b>111</b><i>b</i>, and then the water in the second ice chamber <b>111</b><i>b </i>may sequentially flows toward the third ice chamber <b>111</b><i>c</i>. As a result, water of an amount greater than the set amount may be supplied into the third ice chamber <b>111</b><i>c</i>. Thus, ice made in the third ice chamber <b>111</b><i>c </i>may not have a relatively complete spherical shape, and may have a size different from that of ice cubes made in other ice chambers <b>111</b><i>a </i>and <b>111</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0299" num="0298">In order to prevent such a problem, the ice formation in the first ice chamber <b>111</b><i>a </i>should be prevented from being performed relatively faster, and preferably, the ice formation speed should be uniform in the ice chambers <b>111</b>. Further, the ice formation may occur in the second ice chamber <b>111</b><i>b </i>first rather than in the first ice chamber <b>111</b><i>a </i>to prevent water from concentrating into one ice chamber <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0299">To this end, a shield <b>125</b> may be formed in the tray opening <b>123</b> corresponding to the first ice chamber <b>111</b><i>a</i>, and may minimize an area of exposure of the upper tray <b>150</b> corresponding to the first ice chamber <b>111</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0301" num="0300">In detail, the shield <b>125</b> may be formed in the cavity <b>122</b> corresponding to the first ice chamber <b>111</b><i>a</i>, and a bottom of the cavity <b>122</b>, which defines the tray opening <b>123</b>, may extend toward a center portion thereof to form the shield <b>125</b>.

Further, the deformation of the upper tray <b>150</b> may be prevented and the upper tray <b>150</b> may be maintained in a fixed shape, so that the ice made in the first ice chamber <b>111</b><i>a </i>may be ensured to have the spherical shape always.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0306">In one example, a shield cut <b>125</b><i>b </i>may be defined in one side of the shield <b>125</b>.

In this case, the second connection rib <b>162</b> is unable to return to its original position after the ice-removal, causing defects during the ice-making. On the contrary, when the cut <b>126</b><i>e </i>is too wide, the thermal insulation effect may be significantly reduced due to the inflow of the cold-air.</p><p id="p-0412" num="0411">Thus, in the present embodiment, a width of the cut <b>126</b><i>e </i>may decrease upwardly.

Further, a height of the fourth connection rib <b>155</b><i>b </i>may be smaller than that of the first connection rib <b>155</b><i>a</i>, so that the fourth connection rib <b>155</b><i>b </i>may be in contact with the bottom face of the shield without interfering with the top of the shield <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0416" num="0415">The fourth connection ribs <b>155</b><i>b </i>may be respectively located at both left and right sides around the second connection rib <b>162</b>.

The fourth connection ribs <b>155</b><i>b </i>may be in close contact with the inner face of the shield <b>126</b>. Thus, a space between the shield <b>126</b> and the top face of the first upper chamber <b>152</b><i>a </i>may be shielded to prevent the cold-air from entering through the cut <b>126</b><i>e. </i></p><p id="p-0417" num="0416">The shield <b>126</b> and the top face of the first upper chamber <b>152</b><i>a </i>may be somewhat spaced apart from each other, and an air layer may be formed therebetween.

The inner rib <b>253</b><i>b </i>and the outer rib <b>253</b><i>a </i>are spaced apart from each other to define a groove therebetween.

When the spaces G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> between the side wall <b>260</b> and the chamber wall <b>153</b> are too narrow, interference with the upper tray <b>150</b> may occur during the pivoting process of the lower tray <b>250</b>. Further, when the spaces G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> between the side wall <b>260</b> and the chamber wall <b>153</b> are too wide, during the water supplying into the lower chamber <b>252</b>, an excessive amount of water is flowed into the spaces G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> and lost, and thus, an excessive amount of ice debris is generated. Therefore, widths of the spaces G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> between the side wall <b>260</b> and the chamber wall <b>153</b> may be equal to or less than about 0.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0532" num="0531">In one example, the curved wall <b>153</b><i>b </i>of the upper tray <b>150</b> and the curved wall <b>260</b><i>b </i>of the lower tray <b>250</b> of the side wall <b>260</b> and the chamber wall <b>153</b> may be formed to have the same curvature.

The elastic member <b>360</b> provides an elastic force to the lower support <b>270</b> to keep the upper tray <b>150</b> and the lower tray <b>250</b> in contact with each other in a pressed state.</p><p id="p-0552" num="0551">The elastic member <b>360</b> may provide an elastic force that allows the lower assembly <b>200</b> to be in a close contact with the upper assembly <b>200</b> in a closed state.

The pivoting of the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> and second pivoting arm <b>352</b> may cause the elastic member <b>360</b> to be tensioned. Further, the lower assembly <b>200</b> may be further pivoted in the closing direction by the elastic force provided by the elastic member <b>360</b>.</p><p id="p-0554" num="0553">When the elastic member <b>360</b> is not provided and the lower assembly <b>200</b> is further pivoted by the driver <b>180</b> to press the lower assembly to the upper assembly <b>110</b>, an excessive load may be concentrated on the driver <b>180</b>. Further, when the water is phase-changed and expands and the lower tray <b>250</b> pivots in the open direction, a reverse force is applied to the gear of the driver <b>180</b>, so that the driver <b>180</b> may be damaged. Further, when the driver <b>180</b> is turned off, the lower tray <b>250</b> sags due to a play of the gears. However, all of these problems may be solved when the lower assembly <b>200</b> is pulled to be closed contacted by the elastic force provided by the elastic member <b>360</b>.</p><p id="p-0555" num="0554">That is, the lower assembly <b>200</b> may be provided with the elastic force through the elastic member <b>360</b> in a tensioned state without additional power from the driver <b>180</b>, and may allow the lower assembly <b>200</b> to be closer to the upper assembly <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0556" num="0555">Further, even when the lower tray <b>250</b> is stopped by the driver <b>180</b> before being fully pressed against the upper tray <b>150</b>, an elastic restoring force of the elastic member <b>360</b> allows the lower tray <b>250</b> to be pivoted further to be completely in contact with the upper tray <b>150</b>.

Further, the upper face <b>300</b> may descend to a required position, and at the same time, the upper ejector <b>300</b> may not be moved to an excessively high position when the upper ejector <b>300</b> moves upward. Therefore, heights of the upper ejector <b>300</b> and the unit guides <b>181</b> and <b>182</b> that are exposed upwardly of the ice-maker <b>100</b> may be further lowered, so that an upper space lost when the ice-maker <b>100</b> is installed in the freezing compartment <b>4</b> may be minimized.</p><p id="p-0561" num="0560">The link shaft <b>288</b> protrudes vertically outward from an outer face of the lower support <b>270</b>.

The lower assembly <b>200</b> may be fully opened by the operation of the driver <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0570" num="0569">When the lower assembly <b>200</b> opens in the open direction, the bottom of the link <b>356</b> pivots with the lower tray <b>250</b>. Further, the top of the link <b>356</b> moves downward. The top of the link <b>356</b> may be connected to the ejector body <b>310</b> to move the upper ejector <b>300</b> downward, and may be moved downward without being guided by the unit guides <b>181</b> and <b>182</b>.</p><p id="p-0571" num="0570">When the lower assembly <b>200</b> is fully pivoted, the ejecting pin <b>320</b> of the upper ejector <b>300</b> may pass through the ejector-receiving opening <b>154</b> and move to the bottom of the upper chamber <b>152</b> or a position adjacent thereto to remove the ice from the upper chamber <b>152</b>. In this connection, the link <b>356</b> is also pivoted to the maximum angle, but the link <b>356</b> has a bent shape, and at the same time, the link shaft <b>288</b> may be located forwards and downwards of each of the hinge bodies <b>281</b> and <b>282</b>, so that interference of the link <b>356</b> with other components may be prevented.</p><p id="p-0572" num="0571">In one example, the lower assembly <b>200</b> may partially sag while in a closed state. In detail, in the present embodiment, the driver <b>180</b> has a structure of being connected to the second pivoting arm <b>352</b> among the pivoting arms <b>351</b> and <b>352</b> on both sides, and the second pivoting arm <b>352</b> has a structure of being connected to the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> by the connection shaft <b>370</b>. Therefore, the pivoting force is transmitted to the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> through the connection shaft <b>370</b>, so that the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> and the second pivoting arm <b>352</b> may pivot simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0573" num="0572">However, the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> has a structure of being connected to the connection shaft <b>370</b>, Further, for the connection, a tolerance inevitably occurs at a connected portion. Such tolerance may cause slippage during the pivoting of the connection shaft <b>370</b>.</p><p id="p-0574" num="0573">In addition, since the lower assembly <b>200</b> extends in the direction of power transmission, a portion of the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> positioned at a relatively far may sag, and a torque may not be 100% transmitted thereto.</p><p id="p-0575" num="0574">Because of such structure, when the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> pivots less than the second pivoting arm <b>352</b>, the upper tray <b>150</b> and the lower tray <b>250</b> are not completely in contact with each other and sealed, and there is a region partially open between the upper tray <b>150</b> and the lower tray <b>250</b> at a side close to the first pivoting arm <b>351</b>. Therefore, when the lower tray <b>250</b> sags or tilts, and thus, a water surface inside the ice chamber <b>111</b> is tilted, the spherical ice of a uniform size and shape may not be generated. Further, when water leaks through open portion, more serious problems may be caused.</p><p id="p-0576" num="0575">To avoid such problem, a vertical level of the extended top of the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> may be different from that of the extended top of the second pivoting arm <b>352</b>.</p><p id="p-0577" num="0576">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>48</b>, <b>49</b>, and <b>50</b></figref>, a vertical level h<b>2</b> from the bottom face of the lower assembly <b>200</b> to the elastic member connector <b>351</b><i>c </i>of the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> may be higher than a vertical level h<b>3</b> from the bottom face of the lower assembly <b>200</b> to the elastic member connector <b>352</b><i>c </i>of the second pivoting arm <b>352</b>.</p><p id="p-0578" num="0577">Thus, when the lower assembly <b>200</b> pivots to be closed, the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> and second pivoting arm <b>352</b> pivot together. Further, because the vertical level of the first pivoting arm is high, when the lower tray <b>250</b> and the upper tray <b>150</b> begin to be in contact with each other, the elastic member <b>360</b> connected to the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> is further tensioned.</p><p id="p-0579" num="0578">That is, in a state in which the lower tray <b>250</b> is completely in contact with the upper tray <b>150</b>, the elastic force of the elastic member <b>360</b> of the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> becomes greater. This compensates for the sagging of the lower tray <b>250</b> at the first pivoting arm <b>351</b>. Thus, the entirety of the top face of the lower tray <b>250</b> may be in close contact and sealed with the bottom face of the upper tray <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0580" num="0579">In particular, in a structure where the driver <b>180</b> is located on one side of the lower tray <b>250</b> and is directly connected only to the second pivoting arm <b>352</b>, due to the tolerance occurred in the assembly of the connection shaft <b>370</b>, the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> may be less pivoted. However, as in the embodiment of the present disclosure, the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> pivots the lower tray <b>250</b> with a force greater than that of the second pivoting arm <b>352</b>, so that the lower tray <b>250</b> is prevented from sagging or less pivoting.</p><p id="p-0581" num="0580">In another example, the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> and second pivoting arm <b>352</b> may be pivotably coupled both ends of the connection shaft <b>370</b> respectively to be alternated with each other by a set angle with respect to the connection shaft <b>370</b>. Thus, the top of the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> may be positioned higher than the top of the second pivoting arm <b>352</b>.</p><p id="p-0582" num="0581">Further, in another example, shapes of the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> and the second pivoting arm <b>352</b> may be different from each other such that the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> extends longer than the second pivoting arm <b>352</b>, and thus, a point where the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> is connected to the elastic member <b>360</b> becomes higher than a point where the second pivoting arm <b>352</b> is connected to the elastic member <b>360</b>.</p><p id="p-0583" num="0582">Further, in another example, an elastic modulus of the elastic member <b>360</b> connected to the first pivoting arm <b>351</b> may be made larger than an elastic modulus of the elastic member <b>360</b> connected to the second pivoting arm <b>352</b>.</p><p id="p-0584" num="0583">When the lower assembly <b>200</b> is completely closed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>, the top of the lower casing <b>210</b> and the bottom of the upper support <b>170</b> may be spaced apart from each other by a predetermined distance h<b>4</b>.

Therefore, even when the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> pivots as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b></figref> to detect the ice-full state, the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> may effectively detect whether the ice stored in the ice bin <b>102</b> has reached the predefined vertical level without interfering with other components. The lower assembly <b>200</b> and the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> may pivot counterclockwise at a degree greater than a degree as shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b></figref>. In one example, the lower assembly <b>200</b> and the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> may pivot by about 140&#xb0; for effective ice-removal.</p><p id="p-0616" num="0615">A length L<b>1</b> of the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> may be defined as the vertical distance from the pivoting shaft of the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> to the detection body <b>710</b>. Further, the length of the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> may be larger than the distance L<b>2</b> of the bottom branch of the lower assembly <b>200</b>. If the length L<b>1</b> of the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> is smaller than the distance L<b>2</b> of the end branch of the lower assembly <b>200</b>, the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> and the lower assembly <b>200</b> may interfere with each other in the process in which the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> and the lower assembly <b>200</b> pivot.</p><p id="p-0617" num="0616">To the contrary, if the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> is too long and when the lever <b>799</b> extends to the location of the ice I placed at the bottom of the ice bin <b>102</b>, there is a high probability of false detection. The ice made in this embodiment may be spherical and thus may roll and move inside the ice bin. Therefore, if the length of the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> is long enough to detect ice at the bottom of the ice bin <b>102</b>, there is a possibility of misdetection of the ice-full state due to the detection of the rolling ice even though the ice bin is not in an actual ice-full state.</p><p id="p-0618" num="0617">Therefore, the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> may extend to a position higher by the diameter of the ice so that the lever may not detect the ice laid in one layer on the bottom of the ice bin <b>102</b>. In one example, the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> may extend to reach a position higher than the height L<b>5</b> by the diameter of the ice I from the bottom of the ice bin <b>102</b> upon the ice-full state detection.</p><p id="p-0619" num="0618">That is, the ice may be stored at the bottom face of the ice bin <b>102</b>. Before the ice I entirely fills the first layer, the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> will not detect the ice-full state even when the lever pivots. When the refrigerator continues the ice-making and ice-removal processes, the ice spreads widely on the bottom face of the ice bin <b>102</b> instead of accumulating on the bottom of the ice bin <b>102</b> due to the characteristics of the spherical ice that is removed into the ice bin and thus sequentially forms an ice stack of multiple layers on the bottom face of the ice bin. Further, during the pivoting process of the lower assembly <b>200</b> or the movement process of the freezing compartment drawer <b>41</b>, the first layer ice I inside the ice bin <b>102</b> rolls to fill an empty space therein.</p><p id="p-0620" num="0619">Once the first layer on the bottom of the ice bin <b>102</b> is fully filled with the ice, the removed ice may be stacked on top of the ice I of the first layer. In this connection, the vertical dimension of the ice in the second layer is not twice the diameter of the ice, but may be a sum of the diameter of an single ice and about &#xbd; to &#xbe; of the diameter of the ice. This is because the ice of the second layer is settled into a valley formed between the ices of the first layer.</p><p id="p-0621" num="0620">In one example, when the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> detects the ice portion just above the height L<b>5</b> of the ice I of the first layer, the detection may be erroneous when the ice height of the first layer is increased due to ice debris, etc. Thus, it would be desirable for the lever <b>700</b> to detect the ice portion higher than the height L<b>5</b> of the ice I of the first layer by a predefined distance.</p><p id="p-0622" num="0621">Thus, the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> may be formed to extend to any point which is higher than the height L<b>5</b> by the diameter of the ice and is lower than the height L<b>6</b> which is a sum of the &#xbd; to 4/3 of the diameter of the single ice and the diameter of the single ice.</p><p id="p-0623" num="0622">In one example, the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> is short as possible as as long as it does not interfere with the lower tray <b>250</b>, thereby to secure the ice making amount. To prevent the erroneous detection due to the height difference caused by residual debris ices, the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> may have a length such that it extends to the top of the distance range L<b>6</b>. The top level of the vertical dimension L<b>6</b> may be equal to a sum of the &#xbd; to 4/3 of the diameter of the single ice and the diameter of the single ice.</p><p id="p-0624" num="0623">In this embodiment, an example in which the lever <b>799</b> detects the ice of the second layer is described. In a refrigerator having the ice bin <b>102</b> being a large vertical dimension and having an large amounts of spherical ices stored in the ice bin <b>102</b>, the lever <b>700</b> may detect the ice of the third layer or the ice of a higher layer. In this case, the ice-full state detection lever <b>700</b> may extend to a vertical level equal to a sum of the &#xbd; to 4/3 of the diameter of the single ice and the diameters of the n ices from the bottom of the ice bin.</p><p id="p-0625" num="0624">Hereinafter, the lower ejector <b>400</b> will be described with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0626" num="0625"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>58</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view showing a coupling structure of an upper casing and a lower ejector according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

Thus, in the ice-making process, bubbles in the ice chamber <b>111</b> are moved downward. Thus, when the ice-making process is completed, a portion of the spherical ice except for the lowest portion may become transparent. That is, according to this embodiment, a substantially transparent spherical ice may be produced. In the present embodiment, the substantially transparent sphere shaped ice is not perfectly transparent but has a degree of transparency at which the ice may be commonly referred to as transparent ice.
