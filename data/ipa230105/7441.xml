Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In tracking the location of an electronic device in an indoor space, the electronic device may use magnetic data, the value of which is distorted by a magnetic characteristic of a steel frame or a steel structure related to the indoor space. For example, the electronic device may record magnetic data measured at a particular location of the indoor space as a feature point of the particular location, and determine the similarity between magnetic data measured at a predetermined location and the feature point recorded with respect to the corresponding position, so as to track the location of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above information is presented as background information only to assist with an understanding of the disclosure. No determination has been made, and no assertion is made, as to whether any of the above might be applicable as prior art with regard to the disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a motion (e.g., arm swing) of the body of a user holding an electronic device, the electronic device may be repeatedly moved and stopped, and measure, based on a time period related to data measurement at the location of the stop, multiple pieces of data, at least some of which have different values. However, the multiple pieces of data measured at the location at which the electronic device stops need to be considered as a single piece of data indicating a data characteristic of the location at which the electronic device stops, for comparison with a feature point recorded at the corresponding location, and thus separate processing of the multiple pieces of data may be required.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Aspects of the disclosure are to address at least the above-mentioned problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described below. Accordingly, an aspect of the disclosure is to provide a method for data processing used for location determination, and an electronic device supporting same, wherein comparison with a recorded feature point may be supported with high reliability through processing of multiple pieces of data measured as the electronic device moves, based on moving and stopping of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additional aspects will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the presented embodiments.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, an electronic device is provided.
