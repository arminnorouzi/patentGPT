The present disclosure particularly relates to methods and systems for controlling wind turbines to avoid tripping of the wind turbines.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Modern wind turbines are commonly used to supply electricity into the electrical grid. Wind turbines of this kind generally comprise a tower and a rotor arranged on the tower. The rotor, which typically comprises a hub and a plurality of blades, is set into rotation under the influence of the wind on the blades. This rotation generates a torque that is normally transmitted through a rotor shaft to a generator, either directly or through a gearbox. This way, the generator produces electricity which can be supplied to the electrical grid.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wind turbines further typically comprises a power electronic converter for converting electrical power generated by the generator to a converted AC (&#x201c;Alternating Current&#x201d;) power of predetermined frequency and voltage. The converted AC power is then supplied to a main wind turbine transformer having a low voltage side and a high voltage side for transforming the converted AC power to a higher voltage and delivering the power to the grid.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Different topologies for wind turbine generators and power electronic converters are known. One such topology is a DFIG (&#x201c;Doubly Fed Induction Generator&#x201d;). In the DFIG configuration, a stator of the generator is directly connected to the grid. The rotor of the generator comprises a plurality of coils. These coils are electrically connected to the grid through a power electronic converter comprising a rotor side converter, a DC-link, and a grid side converter.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another known topology, the rotor of the generator carries a plurality of permanent magnets. The stator of the rotor is connected to the grid through a so-called &#x201c;full converter&#x201d;. The full converter includes a machine side converter, a DC-link, and a grid side converter.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A wind turbine further typically comprises a wind turbine controller. The wind turbine controller may be configured to determine suitable actuator setpoints for the wind turbine based on the prevailing circumstances. The actuator setpoints for modern variable speed wind turbines include e.g. the generator torque and the pitch angle of the blades. Through control of the pitch angle(s) of the blade(s) and the generator torque, the speed of the rotor may be controlled, as well as the electrical power output, aerodynamic thrust and further mechanical loads. The purpose of the control system is generally to maximize electrical power output while at the same time keeping loads in the wind turbine at an acceptable level.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Normal or standard operation of a wind turbine may generally be along a predefined power curve, which prescribes the operation of the wind turbine as a function of the prevailing wind speed. Normal operation includes different operational ranges. In lower wind speed ranges, the objective is generally to maximize electrical power output. In higher wind speed ranges, particularly wind speeds above nominal wind speed, the operation of the wind turbine is focused on keeping loads under control, while maintaining electrical power output at a predetermined level.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As mentioned before, the actuator setpoints of torque and pitch (but also other actuators such as yaw) may be changed in accordance with circumstances. Such circumstances may include e.g. the average wind speed, turbulence, wind shear, air density and other meteorological conditions but also internal conditions like vibrations, mechanical loading or component temperatures etc. They may also include specific external demands to reduce noise, an interruption of operation for maintenance, grid based situations of e.g. demand of reduction of active power, or a grid event such as a low voltage event, a zero voltage event, an increase in grid frequency or other.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The wind turbine controller may be programmed to, based on a set of measured variables received from a variety of sensors, send signals to various systems (such as e.g. the generator, the pitch system and a yaw system) to influence the operation of the wind turbine. The sensors may include rotor speed sensor, load sensors (strain gauges or accelerometers), anemometer, weathervane, and others.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Different circumstances can cause tripping of the wind turbine. A trip may herein be regarded as a sudden or immediate shutdown of a wind turbine in response to an exceptional or unexpected event or a series of events. The wind turbine operation is thus interrupted, and until the wind turbine restarts, no power is delivered to the grid.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">High currents, and particularly currents above a predefined threshold, and/or currents that are above a predefined threshold for a specific period of time can lead to tripping of the converter, and thereby to tripping of the wind turbines.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an aspect of the present disclosure, a wind turbine is provided, which comprises a wind turbine rotor with a plurality of blades supported on a support structure, and a generator operatively coupled to the wind turbine rotor for generating electrical power. The wind turbine further comprises a power electronic converter for converting electrical power generated by the generator to a converted AC power of predetermined frequency and voltage. The wind turbine further comprises a wind turbine controller configured to receive values of one or more operational parameters of the wind turbine from one or more sensors and the controller is further configured to temporarily increase a speed of the generator to above a nominal speed if the values of the operational parameters satisfy a potential trip criterion.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with this aspect, a wind turbine is provided which is capable of delaying and/or avoiding tripping of the wind turbine, and particularly tripping of the wind turbine caused by an undesired event in the power electronic converter. By temporarily increasing the rotational speed of the wind turbine, currents can be lowered in the machine side converter, thereby avoiding or delaying a trip of the converter.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A trip criterion may herein be regarded as one value or a combination of multiple values of operational parameters, variables, or actuator setpoints of the wind turbine, that will cause tripping of a wind turbine component and/or the wind turbine.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A potential trip criterion may herein be regarded as one value or a combination of multiple values of operational parameters, variables or actuator setpoints that, if they continue over time, will lead to a satisfaction of a trip criterion.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a further aspect, a method for controlling a wind turbine is provided. The method comprises receiving values of operational parameters of the wind turbine and determining that one or more of the operational parameters satisfy a potential trip criterion for potentially tripping the wind turbine. The method further comprises sending instructions to wind turbine actuators to temporarily increase a speed of a wind turbine rotor of the wind turbine to a level above a nominal rotor speed and determining that the operational parameters do not satisfy the potential trip criterion anymore. The method then further comprises sending instructions to wind turbine actuators to reduce the speed of the wind turbine rotor to the nominal rotor speed.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A method in accordance with this aspect may be implemented in a wind turbine controller.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In yet a further aspect, a method for operating a wind turbine is provided. The method comprises determining one or more of the following operational parameters: currents in a machine side converter, ambient temperature and wind speed. The method comprises determining that the operational parameters fulfil a criterion for an operational change. The method further comprises increasing a speed of the generator to a level above a nominal generator speed and decreasing the speed of the generator to the nominal generator speed or below when the operational parameters fulfil a criterion for returning to default operation.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An operational change may herein be regarded as a change of operational settings of the wind turbine i.e. a change in actuator setpoints and/or boundary conditions governing the operation of the wind turbine.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically illustrates a perspective view of one example of a wind turbine;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a simplified, internal view of one example of the nacelle of the wind turbine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> schematically illustrates the occurrence of current levels in a machine side converter at different ambient temperatures;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> schematically illustrates a relation between generator rotor speed and current levels in a machine side converter;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> illustrates an example of a method for controlling a wind turbine;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> schematically illustrates examples of a standard and a modified operation of a wind turbine; and</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> schematically illustrates an example of a method for operating a wind turbine.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not as a limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an example of a wind turbine <b>10</b>. In the example, the wind turbine <b>10</b> is a horizontal-axis wind turbine. Alternatively, the wind turbine <b>10</b> may be a vertical-axis wind turbine. In the example, the wind turbine <b>10</b> includes a tower <b>100</b> that extends from a support system <b>14</b> on a ground <b>12</b>, a nacelle <b>16</b> mounted on tower <b>100</b>, and a rotor <b>18</b> that is coupled to nacelle <b>16</b>. FIG. <b>1</b> specifically depicts an onshore wind turbine, but the present disclosure also relates to offshore wind turbines.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The rotor <b>18</b> includes a rotatable hub <b>20</b> and at least one rotor blade <b>22</b> coupled to and extending outward from the hub <b>20</b>. In the example, the rotor <b>18</b> has three rotor blades <b>22</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the rotor <b>18</b> includes more or less than three rotor blades <b>22</b>. The tower <b>100</b> may be fabricated from tubular steel to define a cavity (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) between a support system <b>14</b> and the nacelle <b>16</b> arranged at a top end <b>102</b> of tower <b>100</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the tower <b>100</b> is any suitable type of a tower having any suitable height. According to an alternative, the tower can be a hybrid tower comprising a portion made of concrete and a tubular steel portion. Also, the tower can be a partial or full lattice tower.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The rotor blades <b>22</b> are spaced about the hub <b>20</b> to facilitate rotating the rotor <b>18</b> to enable kinetic energy to be transferred from the wind into usable mechanical energy, and subsequently, electrical energy. The rotor blades <b>22</b> are mated to the hub <b>20</b> by coupling a blade root portion <b>24</b> to the hub <b>20</b> at a plurality of load transfer regions <b>26</b>. The load transfer regions <b>26</b> may have a hub load transfer region and a blade load transfer region (both not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Loads induced to the rotor blades <b>22</b> are transferred to the hub <b>20</b> via the load transfer regions <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In examples, the rotor blades <b>22</b> may have a length ranging from about 15 meters (m) to about 90 m or more. Rotor blades <b>22</b> may have any suitable length that enables the wind turbine <b>10</b> to function as described herein. For example, non-limiting examples of blade lengths include 20 m or less, 37 m, 48.7 m, 50.2 m, 52.2 m or a length that is greater than 91 m. As wind strikes the rotor blades <b>22</b> from a wind direction <b>28</b>, the rotor <b>18</b> is rotated about a rotor axis <b>30</b>. As the rotor blades <b>22</b> are rotated and subjected to centrifugal forces, the rotor blades <b>22</b> are also subjected to various forces and moments. As such, the rotor blades <b>22</b> may deflect and/or rotate from a neutral, or non-deflected, position to a deflected position.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Moreover, a pitch angle of the rotor blades <b>22</b>, i.e., an angle that determines an orientation of the rotor blades <b>22</b> with respect to the wind direction, may be changed by a pitch system <b>32</b> to control the load and power generated by the wind turbine <b>10</b> by adjusting an angular position of at least one rotor blade <b>22</b> relative to wind vectors. Pitch axes <b>34</b> of rotor blades <b>22</b> are shown. During operation of the wind turbine <b>10</b>, the pitch system <b>32</b> may particularly change a pitch angle of the rotor blades <b>22</b> such that the angle of attack of (portions of) the rotor blades are reduced, which facilitates reducing a rotational speed and/or facilitates a stall of the rotor <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the example, a blade pitch of each rotor blade <b>22</b> is controlled individually by a wind turbine controller <b>36</b> or by a pitch control system <b>80</b>. Alternatively, the blade pitch for all rotor blades <b>22</b> may be controlled simultaneously by said control systems.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further, in the example, as the wind direction <b>28</b> changes, a yaw direction of the nacelle <b>16</b> may be rotated about a yaw axis <b>38</b> to position the rotor blades <b>22</b> with respect to wind direction <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the example, the wind turbine controller <b>36</b> is shown as being centralized within the nacelle <b>16</b>, however, the wind turbine controller <b>36</b> may be a distributed system throughout the wind turbine <b>10</b>, on the support system <b>14</b>, within a wind farm, and/or at a remote control center. The wind turbine controller <b>36</b> includes a processor <b>40</b> configured to perform the methods and/or steps described herein. Further, many of the other components described herein include a processor.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As used herein, the term &#x201c;processor&#x201d; is not limited to integrated circuits referred to in the art as a computer, but broadly refers to a controller, a microcontroller, a microcomputer, a programmable logic controller (PLC), an application specific, integrated circuit, and other programmable circuits, and these terms are used interchangeably herein. It should be understood that a processor and/or a control system can also include memory, input channels, and/or output channels.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an enlarged sectional view of a portion of the wind turbine <b>10</b>. In the example, the wind turbine <b>10</b> includes the nacelle <b>16</b> and the rotor <b>18</b> that is rotatably coupled to the nacelle <b>16</b>. More specifically, the hub <b>20</b> of the rotor <b>18</b> is rotatably coupled to an electric generator <b>42</b> positioned within the nacelle <b>16</b> by the main shaft <b>44</b>, a gearbox <b>46</b>, a high speed shaft <b>48</b>, and a coupling <b>50</b>. In the example, the main shaft <b>44</b> is disposed at least partially coaxial to a longitudinal axis (not shown) of the nacelle <b>16</b>. A rotation of the main shaft <b>44</b> drives the gearbox <b>46</b> that subsequently drives the high speed shaft <b>48</b> by translating the relatively slow rotational movement of the rotor <b>18</b> and of the main shaft <b>44</b> into a relatively fast rotational movement of the high speed shaft <b>48</b>. The latter is connected to the generator <b>42</b> for generating electrical energy with the help of a coupling <b>50</b>. Furthermore, a transformer <b>90</b> and/or suitable electronics, switches, and/or inverters may be arranged in the nacelle <b>16</b> in order to transform electrical energy generated by the generator <b>42</b> having a voltage between 400V to 1000 V into electrical energy having medium voltage (e.g. 10-35 KV). Said electrical energy is conducted via power cables <b>160</b> from the nacelle <b>16</b> into the tower <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The gearbox <b>46</b>, generator <b>42</b> in transformer <b>90</b> may be supported by a main support structure frame of the nacelle <b>16</b>, optionally embodied as a main frame <b>52</b>. The gearbox <b>46</b> may include a gearbox housing that is connected to the main frame <b>52</b> by one or more torque arms <b>103</b>.

The y-axis represents average currents (10 minute intervals), and the x-axis represents ambient temperature. The data plotted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> corresponds to wind turbines employing a permanent magnet generator at different sites. A tendency may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> that at higher ambient temperatures, the current levels of the machine side converter tend to be higher. Without wishing to be bound to a specific theory, it is believed that this phenomenon is caused by a decrease of strength of the magnets in the permanent magnet generator at higher ambient temperatures. In order to maintain a power level, a torque in the machine side converter is increased and this leads to higher currents.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Of course, the current level will also depend on the operational situation of the wind turbine and in particular on the wind speed. At wind speeds above the nominal wind speed, the power output will normally be the nominal or &#x201c;rated&#x201d; power of the wind turbine. At wind speeds below the nominal wind speed, the power output will be lower.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Also indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> are two reference lines. The lower reference line indicates nominal or rated currents for the converter. This is the level of currents expected for the converter at nominal power output. The upper line indicates a level of currents above which operation of the converter may be jeopardized, i.e. a threshold above which operation is not sustainable. The IGBT's, diodes etc. of the converter will have an operational limit above which they can get damaged. The converter protection threshold is a safety margin above the nominal current level.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">If currents reach the converter protection threshold, generally the converter does not necessarily trip immediately. Depending on the converter, different security mechanisms may be implemented. One security mechanism may define a function of both current and time that if the function reaches a specific level, the converter will trip. Tripping of the converter will lead to tripping of the wind turbine. One such function is i<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;t being above a threshold, wherein i is a current in a machine side converter, and t is a time period for which the current in the machine side converter is above a maximum level. So, a high level of current can be sustained for a short period of time, but not for a prolonged period of time.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">It may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> that at higher ambient temperatures, the current may reach levels above the converter protection threshold and may thus lead to tripping of the wind turbine. It has been found that in specific sites with higher ambient temperatures e.g. above 25&#xb0; C. or above 30&#xb0; C. for several hours during the day in combination with high wind speeds can lead to tripping of the wind turbine.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> schematically illustrates a relation between generator rotor speed and current levels in a machine side converter. For a given power level, generator currents and currents in the machine side converter are inversely proportional to generator rotor speed. The generator rotor speed is directly proportional to the speed of rotation of the wind turbine rotor in case of a direct drive wind turbine and in case of a wind turbine with a gearbox with a constant transmission ratio. It has been found that a small increase in RPM of e.g. 1 or 2% can lead to a reduction in current levels that is sufficient to postpone or avoid tripping of the machine side converter.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> illustrates an example of a method for controlling a wind turbine. A method for controlling a wind turbine comprises, at block <b>150</b>, receiving values of operational parameters of the wind turbine. The method further comprises, at block <b>160</b>, determining that one or more of the operational parameters satisfy a potential trip criterion for potentially tripping the wind turbine. The method comprises, at block <b>170</b>, sending instructions to wind turbine actuators to temporarily increase a speed of a wind turbine rotor of the wind turbine to a level above a nominal rotor speed. At block <b>180</b>, the method comprises determining that the operational parameters do not satisfy the potential trip criterion anymore, and at block <b>190</b>, sending instructions to wind turbine actuators to reduce the speed of the wind turbine rotor to the nominal rotor speed.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">At block <b>150</b>, the wind turbine controller may receive values of operational parameters from a plurality of different sensors. Such sensors may include ambient temperature sensors, component temperature sensors, and also sensors indicating current levels. These parameters may be indicative of converter temperatures and converter current levels, and may therefore be used to determine a potential trip situation of the machine side converter as commented before.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">However, other sensors may also be used, particularly in connection with other potential trip situations. Such sensors include strain gauges, vibration sensors, and other sensors to indicate loads. Such sensors may be arranged with or indicative of the operational situation of the converter, or the generator, or the wind turbine rotor or other.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">At block <b>160</b>, it may be evaluated whether a particular operational parameter or a combination of operational parameters satisfy a potential trip criterion i.e. it is analyzed whether the levels for the different parameters are sustainable in time, or whether a prolonged operation at these levels will lead to a trip of a wind turbine or component. If the potential trip criterion is not satisfied, the standard or normal operation may be continued. A standard operation in this context may particularly denote an operation according to a predetermined power curve respecting both a nominal power of the wind turbine, and a nominal speed of the rotor of the wind turbine or generator rotor.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">If at block <b>160</b>, it is found that one or more of predefined potential trip criterions is satisfied, then the controller may send instructions, at block <b>170</b>, to temporarily increase a rotor speed of the generator. As explained before, a temporary increase of the rotor speed can lower currents in the machine side converter and avoid the currents reaching a threshold above which the security of the converter components may be compromised. In other examples, such a temporary increase can avoid resonance in a wind turbine. By changing the rotor speed, the excitation frequency of specific loads can be changed and resonance can be avoided. A potential situation in which loads or vibrations reach a level that would lead to tripping of the wind turbine may thus be avoided.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The instructions sent by the controller, at block <b>170</b>, may include settings of actuators like pitch actuators and/or generator torque. In examples, more than one mode of operation may be predefined in the controller, including a default or standard mode of operation, and an adapted or modified mode of operation. Each of these modes of operation may have predefined rules wherein, based on values of sensors including e.g. rotor speed, loads, pitch angle etc., the actuator setpoints are adjusted. In this example, at block <b>170</b>, the modified mode of operation may be adapted.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In an example, the mode of operation or the increased rotational speed may be maintained for a predefined period of time. In other examples, at block <b>180</b>, the adapted mode of operation may be maintained until the potential trip criterion is not satisfied anymore, e.g. until the currents in the machine side converter are below a predefined threshold. In order to avoid hysteresis, a switch-back to the standard mode of operation respecting the nominal rotor speed, may be carried out if the currents are below the predefined security threshold for a minimum period of time. It will be clear that in other examples, or in other potential trip cases, a return to normal operation may depend on parameters which are different from current levels.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In examples, the potential trip criterion for potentially tripping the wind turbine may be a criterion for potentially tripping a power electronic converter.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In examples, the operational parameters which are analyzed or taken into account for a potential trip evaluation include one or more currents in a machine side converter. Alternatively or additionally, the operational parameters include an ambient temperature and/or a temperature in a wind turbine component.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some examples, the level above the nominal rotor speed may be 5% or less above the nominal rotor speed, and specifically 3% or less above the nominal rotor speed. It has been found that even small increases of nominal rotor speed can sufficiently reduce the current levels in the converter and at the same time the potential increase in loads is low enough that the wind turbine life time is not affected.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In examples, temporarily increasing the speed of the wind turbine rotor of the wind turbine to a level above a nominal rotor speed comprises maintaining a power of the wind turbine at a nominal power.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In examples, the speed of the wind turbine rotor of the wind turbine may be increased to the level above the nominal rotor speed for 30 minutes or less, specifically for 20 minutes or less.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> schematically illustrates examples of a standard and a modified operation of a wind turbine.

A first power curve, which indicates the active power output of the wind turbine as a function of wind speed in a standard or default mode of operation. The power curve may correspond to a classic wind turbine control in which rotor speed and output power are increased from a certain wind speed to a first wind speed (in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, around 9 m/s) at which the nominal rotor speed is reached. From this wind speed onwards, the rotor speed stays constant at the nominal level until nominal wind speed is reached (in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, around 12 m/s). From the nominal wind speed onwards, both rotor speed and power output are maintained constant. This is usually achieved through pitching of the wind turbine blades.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">A second power curve indicates the active power output of the wind turbine as a function of wind speed in an adapted or modified mode of operation. It may be seen that the power curves substantially completely overlap.
