In particular but not exclusively in the case of electrical contacting tasks in the higher power range, contact systems have been developed that are based on round contact geometries for receiving a contact pin, plug contact pin, socket pin, male contact pin, mass pin and their starting material consists of a planar contact grid that is brought into the round contact  geometry with a hyperbolic twist. These contact systems that have become known as RADSOK systems are characterized by a robust and high density contact production procedure as a result of their considerable contact area with regard to the respective contact pin. As an alternative, in lieu of the hyperbolic twist situation, inwardly oriented lamella geometries are known, whose lamella contact grid is oriented in a radially symmetrical manner.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">These contact geometries that are preferably used as high-power contact sockets are known as radial contact sockets or hyperbolic contact sockets, socket contacts.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">RADSOK contact systems of the above mentioned type are received into plug connector socket sleeves by way of their in general cylindrical outer contour and realize the further contacting arrangement on the outer side by way of the cylinder surfaces. Contact systems of this construction are usually formed from at least one lamella socket, contact socket, socket contact and at least one plug control pin, socket pin, male contact pin.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The contacting partner of the contact socket is generally a plug contact pin, socket pin, contact pin having a geometry that is plug-compatible with the lamella socket. Since the outer surface of the contact pin is a functional surface with respect to the lamella sleeve, it cannot be housed or cannot be housed directly or received in a housing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to secure the plug connection that consists of a lamella socket and contact pin in its  plugged, power-contacting position, different latching devices, positioning facilities, the so-called secondary-locking arrangement are constructed in a non-positive and/or positive locking manner. The same applies for enclosing measures, sealing tasks, corrosion protection and various other requirements that occur depending upon the individual application purpose.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Measures enclosing the plug connection and/or its plug connection partner are frequently used to provide touch protection. For example DE 10 2012 105 771 A1 discloses a plug having a contact socket that endeavours to provide protection against touch and to prevent the penetration of dirt and water. For this purpose, it is proposed to close the insertion opening of the contact socket with a pivotable screen element. The socket contact that is arranged in the contact socket is completely revealed by pivoting the screen element, with the result that the pin contact can be inserted into the socket contact. The protective cover is a pivotably mounted screen element having an allocated spring, with the result that the screen element is held by means of the spring in a closure position in which it closes an insertion opening of the contact socket and by inserting a pin contact against the force of the spring the screen element is pivoted into an insertion position in which the insertion opening is revealed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The WO 03/047047 A1 proposes a solution for the latching task, which involves different plugging forces for connecting and releasing the plug with respect to the contact socket. A bore hole having a groove is provided in a socket element which is designed as a  housing, enclosure of the plug connection, said groove being arranged on an inner surface of the bore hole. The bore hole represents a shoulder between a groove base and a bore hole. A flat spring for defining a spring hollow space between the flat spring and the shoulder and a circular inclined winding is arranged in the groove. A further, helical-shaped or spiral-shaped spring is arranged in the spring hollow space. The contact pin is designed with a conical end in such a manner that it cooperates with the spring combination and can be pushed into and out of the arrangement. During the insertion movement, it is necessary to overcome the force which the helical-shaped spring requires to realize its elastic deformation to reveal the bore hole, during the extraction movement the elements of the flat spring are to deform.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to configure the plug connections in such a manner that the contacting arrangement is secure and the plugged connection can be released without using a tool, DE 10 2005 016 265 A1 proposes a plug connection with a plug and a socket, wherein the plug latches with the socket in the plugged state. For this purpose, a latching arrangement is provided on the contour of the plug or the socket. The latching arrangement can be preferably released using a tool and the socket and the plug can subsequently be separated from one another. The latching arrangement is encumbered with the risk of being damaged when subjected to a mechanical loading and in fact especially in conjunction with low temperatures.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The socket element in the form of a lamella socket has a socket body. The socket body has a circular cylindrical plug receiving chamber and a  conductor receiving chamber. The plug receiving chamber has an inner plug receiving chamber and an outer plug receiving chamber. The inner plug receiving chamber has a smaller diameter than the outer plug receiving chamber. The outer plug receiving chamber has consequently a greater diameter than the inner plug receiving chamber. A stop is formed at the transition from the outer plug receiving chamber having the larger diameter to the inner plug receiving chamber having the smaller diameter. The stop is realized by reducing the diameter.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Latching means are arranged on the outer contour of the socket body. The latching means are arranged outside on the socket body in the region of the stop that is arranged inside the socket body. The conductor receiving chamber is used to receive a conductor by means of which the socket element can be connected to a current circuit. A latching element is provided adjoining the stop in the outer plug receiving chamber. It is preferred that an intermediate space adjoins the latching element on the side that lies opposite the stop. Adjoining the existing intermediate space, a contact socket is provided in the outer plug receiving chamber. The contact socket ends outwards preferably flush with the socket body. The contact socket is connected in an electrically conductive manner to the socket body of the socket element. As a consequence, an electrically conductive connection is produced from the contact socket to the conductor that is arranged in the conductor receiving chamber.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The contact sleeve is fastened in the outer plug receiving chamber by being pressed therein. The intermediate space is used to compensate any tolerance,  with the result that it is ensured that the latching element still has sufficient play when the socket element is assembled. The outer diameter of the latching element is somewhat smaller than the inner diameter of the outer plug receiving chamber.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">When the socket element is being assembled, it is possible thereby to introduce the latching element into the outer plug receiving chamber. The socket body is a rotary part having a cylindrical shape and having a cylindrical plug receiving chamber and a cylindrical conductor receiving chamber. The contact socket is a cylindrical RADSOK socket. In this case, individual contact surfaces that lie in the interior of the contact socket form cylindrical surface contact means. The latching element is a disc made from a thermoplastic material, in particular a synthetic material. The latching element can also be produced from a bent wire or also from a suitably slotted metal disc. The latching element has a cut-out in the form of a hole.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The contact pin has a first section having a first diameter. A second section having a second diameter adjoins the first section. The second diameter is smaller than the first diameter. A third section adjoins the second section. Adjoining the second section, the third section has latching means. The third section has towards the second section a diameter which is greater than the first diameter but smaller than or a maximum equal to the first diameter. As the distance from the second section or the latching means increases, the diameter of the third section reduces, in other words the third section is designed in a  conical manner. The surface of the first section forms a contact surface of the contact pin.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Many of the known plug connection solutions are optimized and conditioned to one requirement. Most of the solutions have the disadvantage that both plug connection partners must have a housing and as a consequence are complex and cost-intensive. Furthermore, both plug contact partners have complex geometric shapes owing to the functional surfaces of the plug connection both in the contact socket and also in the plug contact pin.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition to the above, it should be appreciated for a plug connection that the releasable plug connection only produces or realizes the electrical contacting arrangement in the latched, secured or locked end position. This requirement, function can prevent damage to the electrical components which are to be contacted, arcing or an unreliable contacting arrangement.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The disclosure discusses embodiments to develop existing plug contact connections, plug connection, plug contact system, contact system and to reduce at least in part the existing disadvantages. In particular, a plug connection is to be created which prevents the plug connection partners making electrical contact prior to realizing the latching position, locking position.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Disclosed is a concept of a single pole electrical plug contact in the form that, when a  contact socket, lamella socket, socket contact is being plugged onto a contact pin, plug contact pin, socket pin, male contact pin without a housing or any other surrounding geometries, if the latching (secondary), locking position is not realized, these are released from the male contact pin and an electrical contacting arrangement is not produced or is released. The latching, locking position corresponds frequently but not necessarily to the end position of the plug connection partner. It is recognized that by integrating the latching and support geometries, preferably in the male contact pin and/or integration of the enclosing elements on sides of a preferably spring-loaded contact socket is suitable to prevent the electrical contacting arrangement outside the latching position.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The invention is further explained below with the aid of an exemplary embodiment, wherein the plug contact pin is configured as a mass connection, in conjunction with the figures.

The position of male the contact pin <b>10</b> flush and perpendicular to the contact socket <b>20</b> is the positioning prior to the plugging process, in other words the contact partners are (still) not in engagement. The assembly unit comprising at least the slider <b>110</b>, the socket housing <b>120</b> and the socket contact <b>20</b>, which is received therein, and the spring <b>101</b>, is brought into the plugging position by way of the socket pin <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The spring <b>101</b> is designed as a helical spring, compression spring and accordingly pre-tensioned, with  the result that the slider <b>110</b> is pushed in the illustrated position into an end position relative to the socket housing <b>120</b> and against the stop that is formed from at least one shoulder <b>112</b> and at least one protrusion <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The slider <b>110</b> is supported in this positioning situation in a non-positive locking manner with its at least one support hook <b>111</b> against the cone <b>11</b> and/or the chamfer <b>12</b> of the male contact pin <b>10</b>, with the result that the assembly unit comprising at least the slider <b>110</b>, the socket housing <b>120</b> and the socket contact <b>20</b>, which is received therein, and the spring <b>101</b>, is arranged in the defined position with respect to the socket pin <b>10</b>. Likewise, the supporting arrangement of the at least one support hook <b>111</b> is relevant with regard to the flow of force for compressing the spring <b>101</b>, since it functions as a counter bearing of the spring <b>101</b> with respect to the movement force and the relative movement travel of the housing <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The continuation of the electrical contacting arrangement to a voltage source, an electrical consumer or a mass connection, ground connection, can occur by way of a cover <b>130</b>.

The plug connection <b>100</b> is plugged in part by virtue of the fact that the plugging travel of the socket pin <b>10</b> into the lamella contact sleeve <b>20</b> is (still) not fully performed up to its end position in the contact socket <b>20</b>. It is preferred that the end position is realized after the maximum possible plugging travel and the latching, secondary-locking arrangement is preferably implemented in the end position.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The amount of the in part plugging travel, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, corresponds to the distance which the socket pin <b>10</b> is pushed into the lamella contact socket <b>20</b>. The slider <b>110</b> is pushed with the plugging movement and against the spring force of the spring <b>101</b> relative to the housing <b>120</b> in an axial manner. The at least one latching hook <b>121</b> lies in this plugged situation with a hook incline <b>121</b>&#x2032; against the chamfer <b>12</b> of the cone <b>11</b>.

The angle of inclination  of the hook incline <b>121</b>&#x2032; is sufficiently small with regard to the axial line with the result that the inclined surface is reliably prevented from becoming jammed against the chamfer <b>12</b>.
