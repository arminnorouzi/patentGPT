Typical dangerous scenarios include: (1) the user and the board going in different directions around large objects at high speeds; and (2) the user being held under the water because of turbulence and heavy water in large surf or when the tether attaches to a rock, macroalgae, or coral in the body of water; (3) turbulent water keeping the board submerged and, in turn, also keeping the attached user underwater. These tethers pose the problem by keeping the user attached to a sporting equipment even if it is a dangerous situation. If users are unable to easily, quickly, and reliably detach from a tether, then users risk injuries due to becoming tangled in the tether or submerged underwater. One method to detach from a tether is to use a swivel lock quick release mechanism.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, even if users are provided with a swivel lock quick release mechanism to detach from the tether, users may still have difficulties detaching. For example, the quick release handle of the swivel lock quick release mechanism could become slippery when wet, making it difficult for users to grip the quick release handle. Even when dry, swivel lock quick release mechanism can be difficult to grip. Additionally, in dangerous situations users may become disoriented, making it difficult to locate the quick release handle and grip it to activate the device. Furthermore, users can get injured, or surfaces can be damaged if hit by the quick release mechanism during dangerous situations.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Users who participate in watersports, for example, are also at risk if the tether becomes detached when unintended. For example, if a tether detaches when unintended a disoriented surfer may not be able to safely resurface and get back on top of their surfboard. Thus, problems may arise if the release mechanism becomes corroded from water and the environment. Additionally, many apparatuses using to tether to secure a user to an object may be provided as a singular monolithic unit with no means to selectively separate the apparatus from the strap or tether. This inability of said apparatus to be selectively disassembled may prevent the modification or replacement of specific parts of said apparatus, thus requiring the usage of separate apparatuses to use different types or sizes of straps or tethers.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The aspects or the problems and the associated solutions presented in this section could be or could have been pursued; they are not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated, it should not be assumed that any of the approaches presented in this section qualify as prior art merely by virtue of their presence in this section of the application.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need to solve the problems described above by providing a device and method for a locking attachment that will quick release without an additional removeable pin from a tether.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some aspects, the techniques described herein relate to a swivel lock quick release device, the device having a protrusion, locking component, and a pull release adapted to receive the protrusion. The pull release also having a slide handle and a locking component with a spring to allow a user to disengage from the protrusion and reengage without a detachable key, pin, or object. Thus, an advantage is having the spring with an appropriate stiffness to ensure the spring does not accidently release during water activities and would still allow the user's force to disconnect the pull release from the protrusion when necessary. Thus, another advantage is a quick and reliable detachment during dangerous situations.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some aspects, the techniques described herein relate to a swivel lock quick release device having a swivel mechanism that allows for the lock and release to freely swivel and does not require removeable parts, key, or pin. The swivel allows for the tether to turn instead of becoming twisted around objects or wound itself. Thus, an advantage is the user not getting tangled up in their tether and the tether does not get coiled around itself. Becoming tangled in a tether or having the tether caught on various objects is dangerous, which is why the rotating aspect of the swivel lock quick release device may be advantageous.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect, the techniques described herein relate to a swivel lock quick release device that allows for a fully self-contained integrated device that does not require additional parts or removable lock to be utilized. The disclosed swivel lock functions as both a locking apparatus that swivels as well as an easily accessible quick release handle. Thus, it is an integrated locking and releasing system.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some aspects, the swivel lock quick release may utilize removable securing bits to attach said swivel lock quick release to a strap and a tether. Thus, both the strap and tether may be removed and replaced as needed for an application through the simple removal and subsequent reinstallation of a securing bit attaching the swivel lock quick release to the corresponding strap and/or tether allowing for easy implementation of alternative tethers, straps, or other comparable components.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some aspects, the swivel lock quick release may be oriented within a tether assembly such that the user may disengage from the sporting equipment by pulling the slide handle toward their body. This may facilitate fast and reliable disengagement of the pull release from the protrusion as a result of the user being able to use their body as a backing support and compress the swivel lock quick release between their hand and their body to facilitate disengagement from said sporting equipment quickly and easily.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some aspects, the techniques described herein relate to a grip cover configured to cover the pull release of a swivel lock quick release device (also referred to herein as &#x201c;swivel lock&#x201d;). The cylindrical grip body, grip ridge, ridge grip end and recess grip end of the grip cover correspondingly cover the body, grip, ridge end and recess end of the pull release, wherein said grip cover conforms to the shape of the pull release. Thus, the grip cover and pull release handle are flush. It should be understood that the shape of the grip cover can be manufactured to cover a multitude of configurations of a pull release, for example a pull release with two separate ridges for grips.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some aspects, a grip cover can be manufactured from materials with a high coefficient of static friction when wet. Additionally, the grip cover can be designed to have a textured surface, such as ridges or bumps. Providing a grip cover reduces slipperiness of the quick release handle and improves user engagement, thus enabling users to operate a swivel lock more easily.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some aspects, a grip cover provides a swivel lock with flotation, which can help users more quickly find and operate the swivel lock by making the swivel lock float. For example, floatation can be achieved by designing the grip cover from a buoyant foam material. Additionally, a foam grip cover may protect users from damaging their hands while operating the swivel lock or being injured by accidentally hitting the swivel lock during a dangerous scenario, for example. Thus, providing a grip cover for a swivel lock can help users operate the swivel lock more quickly during dangerous situations.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some aspects, a grip cover may be configured to protect the internal locking components of a swivel lock by manufacturing the grip cover from a waterproof material and designing the grip cover to conform around and seal the openings on both ends of the swivel lock mechanisms. Thus, providing a grip cover for a swivel lock that covers the recess end and ridge end of said swivel lock may increase the reliability of a swivel lock by preventing degradation due to corrosion or other environmental factors.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some aspects, the techniques described herein relate to a grip cover having a grip body with a regular cylindrical shape; a ridge side opening disposed on one end of the grip body; a recess side opening disposed on an opposite end of the grip body; a grip ridge secured between the grip body and the ridge side opening; and/or an internal ridge nested within the grip body, and/or wherein the grip body is configured to cover a pull release on a swivel lock. The grip cover may be made a foam material configured to enhance engagement between a user's hand and the pull release.

description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description and drawings are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the figures, may be arranged, substituted, combined, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated and made a part of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">For the following description, it can be assumed that most correspondingly labeled elements across the figures (e.g., <b>105</b> and <b>205</b>, etc.) possess the same characteristics and are subject to the same structure and function.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the perspective view of the swivel lock quick release device <b>101</b>, according to an aspect. The swivel lock quick release device <b>101</b> may be adapted to selectively attach a user to a floatation device (not shown) or a piece of sports equipment. The floatation device may be watersports equipment, such as a surfboard, a stand-up paddle board, a kite surfing harness, a fishing rod and reel, a wake board, etc. The swivel lock quick release device <b>101</b> can be used in other applications where a quick release of the user is desired from the equipment or object, such as from a sailboat in sailing applications or a rifle in hunting applications.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">The swivel lock quick release device <b>101</b> having a first connector <b>102</b> and a second connector <b>112</b> is provided. The first connector <b>102</b> may be a pull release <b>102</b> and the second connector <b>112</b> may be a protrusion, stem, or pole <b>112</b>. The pull release <b>102</b> and protrusion <b>112</b> may be selectively engaged in a locked position as described hereinbelow. A slide handle, a portion of the pull release <b>102</b>, may be adapted to be selectively moved in a coaxial direction (e.g., coaxial with the swivel lock) by the user to disengage the pull release and the protrusion. The pull release <b>102</b> may also be adapted to rotate around the protrusion <b>112</b> when connected, allowing the swivel lock device <b>101</b> to swivel. Additionally, the swivel lock quick release device <b>101</b> may be attached to a tether <b>104</b> and a strap <b>105</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The tether <b>104</b> may be adapted to attach to the floatation device, while the strap <b>105</b> may be adapted to attach to the user. This connection between the pull release <b>102</b> and a protrusion <b>112</b> may allow the user to first lock themself to the athletic equipment, and then quickly and reliably disengage themselves from said equipment, for example, in dangerous situations. Having a reliable locking tether that swivels and functions with a quick and reliable means to disengage while participating in aquatic and or land athletics, sports, or other activities is critical due to the need to not only be safely fastened to the object but the need to quickly and safely release from the object because of possible scenarios, dangerous or otherwise, a user may encounter, enjoy, or benefit from.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">As described herein, sports, aquatic and land activities, can be dangerous because of the lack of quick release options in those dangerous situations. Currently, users who participate in watersports, for example, are at a risk when using a tether to keep them attached to their board, flotation device, or sporting equipment because of the common occurrences of the tether becoming tangled with other objects in the body of water or failure of other equipment involved in the activity. Another typical dangerous scenario is the user and the board going in different directions around large objects at high speeds. Additionally, another common dangerous situation is if the user is held under the water because of turbulence and heavy water in large surf or when the tether attaches to rock, macroalgae, or coral in the body of water. These tethers pose the problem of keeping the user attached even if it is a dangerous situation. For example, turbulent water may be keeping the board submerged and in turn the attached user. Furthermore, the swivel lock quick release device <b>101</b> may be used for other sports equipment such as surfing, fishing, stand-up paddling, sailing, hunting, animal collars, or kite surfing equipment.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">The swivel lock quick release device allows a user to easily disengage themselves from a tether <b>104</b>, especially during critical situations. The pull release <b>102</b> may have a textured surface for the grip <b>103</b> to allow the user to have a better grasp when they need to disengage themselves from the tether. The grip <b>103</b> may be patterned, in an example, but other means of textured grip may also be applied to the pull release <b>102</b>. The user may need to disengage themselves from the tether in situations such as the tide pulling the board down, harsh waters, and other dangerous situations that may occur in bodies of water, on land, or for other activities that require a secure locking attachment and an option of quick releasing. Thus, having a pull release <b>102</b> that has a textured grip <b>103</b> and is large enough to be visible and easily accessible from a 360-degree integrated cylinder gripped slide handle during high stress or emergency situations is critical.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">As shown, the user may wrap the strap <b>105</b> around their ankle to have the security of being attached to their board via a tether <b>104</b>, but the swivel lock quick release device <b>101</b> allows the user to disengage when necessary. The swivel lock quick release device <b>101</b> may have a swivel mechanism <b>106</b>, which may allow the user to not get tangled with the tether <b>104</b>. The swivel mechanism <b>106</b> will be discussed in more detail when referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Furthermore, the swivel lock quick release device <b>101</b> is adapted to selectively attach a user to a sports equipment. The sports equipment may be watersports equipment, such as a surfboard, a stand-up paddle board, a kite surfing harness, sailing safety gear, a wake board, etc., or land sports equipment, such as fishing, technical rifle gear, climbing, camping, and hunting equipment.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the perspective view of the swivel lock quick release device <b>201</b> attached to an attachable strap <b>205</b>, according to an aspect. In some aspects, the strap <b>205</b> has a hook and loop fastener <b>223</b> to secure around the user, as shown. For example, the hook and loop fastener <b>223</b> may be Velcro. Additionally, the strap <b>205</b> may be wrapped around a different appendage of the user, for example, their wrist, calf, chest, or ankle. The disengagement of the swivel lock quick release device <b>201</b> has to be as fast as possible and reliable in critical or emergency situations because these situations usually require a fast reaction time. The swivel lock quick release device <b>201</b> would be easy to reach and spot in the water because of the larger grip <b>203</b>. For example, this is even more important in dangerous situations such as turbulent waters, white water, and other situations where visibility is reduced. The grip <b>203</b> ensures faster and more reliable release, which in critical situations is advantageous to help save the user from injury or death. It should be understood that the engaging and disengaging of the swivel lock quick release device <b>201</b> may also be referred to as &#x201c;coupling&#x201d; and &#x201c;uncoupling&#x201d;, respectively, as will be described in greater detail hereinbelow.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates the cross-sectional view of the swivel lock quick release device in the locked position, according to an aspect. For example, the grip <b>303</b> may have a series of protrusions to allow the user to have a better grasp on the pull release <b>302</b>. In another example, the grip <b>303</b> may be in an ergonomic shape with grooves for the user's fingers. Furthermore, the connection between the tether <b>204</b> and the swivel lock quick release device <b>301</b> may utilize a guard <b>319</b> to create a stronger connection and provide better durability against wear and tear of repeated use of the tether <b>204</b> connected to the guard <b>319</b>.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">Additionally, the combination of the protrusion <b>312</b> and pull release <b>302</b> allows the user to reuse their strap <b>305</b> with any number of variable tethers they have previously connected to their floatation devices, animals, or other sporting equipment. For example, the user may purchase multiple tethers, differentiated by size, length, and composition, with the pull release and attach them to their various equipment while using a single strap <b>305</b> with the protrusion <b>312</b> to connect to each pull release <b>302</b>. This allows the user to interchange their equipment and tethers <b>204</b> without needing a new strap <b>305</b> for each device or a detached locking pin, key, or object. Moreover, it is convenient for the user to not have to buy a set of both a tether <b>204</b> and a strap <b>305</b> for each sporting tether device they have.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">The protrusion <b>312</b> may be held into place by one or a plurality of balls (e.g., ball bearings) <b>311</b>. The swivel mechanism <b>306</b> of the swivel lock quick release device allows the pull release <b>302</b> to rotate around the protrusion <b>312</b>. The rotation of the pull release <b>302</b> around the protrusion <b>312</b> prevents the tether from becoming tangled around the user, the floatation device, or obstacles while in use and allows, when locked, for the tether to be securely fastened without trepidation of accidental or unintentional disengagement.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Moreover, the grip <b>303</b> of the pull release <b>302</b> in combination with the spring <b>310</b> stiffness allows the user to easily and reliably disengage from their floatation device, animals, or sporting equipment. The spring <b>310</b> would have an appropriate stiffness to ensure the spring <b>310</b> does not accidently release during sporting activities but would still allow the user's force to disconnect the pull release <b>302</b> from the protrusion <b>312</b>. It should be understood the spring <b>310</b> should have the right stiffness such that to not prematurely or accidently release. Additionally, the spring stiffness would still allow the user to disconnect the pull release <b>302</b> from the protrusion <b>312</b> with one hand. A single hand disconnection is advantageous, for example, because the user may be paddling with the other hand. Furthermore, this disconnection has to be quick and easy because of, for example, the unpredictability of dangerous situations in watersports. It offers the ability for the user to reattach the tether with one hand and without the need to reintroduce an additional disengaged or disconnected locking object, such as a pin, or a key.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">Furthermore, the protrusion <b>312</b> of the swivel lock quick release device <b>301</b> allows the pull release <b>302</b> to be locked into place, as described herein. The protrusion <b>312</b> would be inserted into the protrusion housing <b>316</b>, which may be cylindrical, within the pull release <b>302</b> as shown. The insertion of the protrusion <b>312</b> into the pull release <b>302</b> allows for the selective coupling and uncoupling of the correspondingly attached strap <b>305</b> and tether, as will be discussed in greater detail hereinbelow. The pull release <b>302</b> and the protrusion <b>312</b> are locked together by an indentation <b>313</b> on the protrusion <b>312</b> and balls <b>311</b>. The indentation <b>313</b> forms a head, tip, or bulb <b>323</b> on the end of the protrusion <b>312</b>. The balls <b>311</b> protrude from the pull release <b>302</b> and rest inside the protrusion indentation <b>313</b>. This allows the pull release <b>302</b> and the protrusion <b>312</b> to be engaged and stay connected when the user desires it. The ball <b>311</b>, as shown, is held within a ball housing, opening, radial opening, or hole <b>318</b>, which will be discussed in more detail when referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. The ball housing <b>318</b> allows the ball to radially move in and out of the protrusion indentation <b>313</b>, as depicted by the arrow <b>321</b>, and ensures the locking device, once closed, is secured on the protrusion.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">Additionally, the connection between the tether <b>204</b> and the swivel lock quick release device <b>301</b> may have a guard <b>319</b> to create a stronger connection and provide better durability against wear and tear of repeated use.

As shown, the slide handle, cylinder, or sleeve <b>302</b><i>a </i>is in a second coaxial position, which may allow the balls <b>311</b> to move into the ball groove <b>317</b>. The ball groove <b>317</b> may allow the balls <b>311</b> to disengage with the pin <b>312</b> and allow the pull release <b>302</b> to detach from the user, which will be described in more detail when referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>. For example, the swivel lock quick release device <b>301</b> may have a hole in the recess <b>325</b> used by the protrusion <b>312</b> to allow water and particulates to pass through the device <b>301</b>, which may prevent blockage or hydraulic jamming of the system. The protrusion housing <b>316</b> may exist as part of the recess, opening, cavity <b>325</b>, in which the protrusion <b>312</b> is secured to facilitate the attachment of the pull release <b>302</b> to the protrusion <b>312</b>.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">As shown, the spring <b>310</b> may be a continuous spring surrounding the locking portion, component, tube, or body <b>302</b><i>b </i>of the pull release <b>302</b>.

Furthermore, the pull release <b>302</b> is disconnected by a unidirectional, motion, shown by arrow <b>320</b> that is coaxial with the pull release <b>302</b> swivel lock <b>301</b>. The user can apply force in this direction <b>320</b> to facilitate their disengagement from the tether. This allows the user to have a reliable way to disconnect, along with a faster way to disconnect. The coaxial and linear motion of the pull release <b>302</b> being disconnected from the protrusion <b>312</b> allows for the reliable disconnection during critical times.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">Additionally, the ball housing <b>318</b>, where the ball(s) <b>311</b> are contained, may have a small edge or lip (ball housing edge or lip) <b>318</b><i>a </i>at the innermost region, preventing the balls <b>311</b> from falling inward into the recess <b>325</b> used by the protrusion <b>312</b>. Moreover, for the user to attach to the tether <b>204</b>, the slide handle <b>302</b><i>a </i>may be pulled back against the spring <b>310</b>, allowing the balls <b>311</b> to move outward radially as the protrusion <b>312</b> is inserted. This may allow sufficient room for the protrusion <b>312</b> to be inserted to a depth where the balls <b>311</b> are then able to radially translate inward as the slide handle <b>302</b><i>a </i>slides over the ball housings <b>318</b>.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> illustrates the cross-sectional view of the swivel lock quick release device in a partially unlocked position, according to an aspect.

A grip cover <b>766</b> can help users more easily operate the swivel lock <b>701</b> by eliminating the potential slipperiness of the pull release <b>702</b>. Eliminating slipperiness may be achieved by manufacturing the grip cover <b>766</b> from materials having a relatively high coefficient of static friction when wet (such as compared to metal or plastic) and designing the grip cover <b>766</b> to have a textured surface, such as ridges or bumps. As an example, the material used may be sustainable algae foam. Additionally, a grip cover <b>766</b> can help users more quickly find and operate the swivel lock <b>701</b> by making the swivel lock <b>701</b> float. Floatation can be achieved by designing the grip cover <b>766</b> to be lightweight, for example less than 1 lb, and manufacturing the grip cover <b>766</b> from a buoyant material, such as algae foam. Another benefit of the grip cover <b>766</b> is protecting users from damaging their hands while operating the swivel lock <b>701</b> or being injured from accidentally hitting or being hit by the swivel lock <b>701</b> during a dangerous scenario, for example. Providing a grip cover <b>766</b> also protects nearby surfaces from becoming damaged if the swivel lock <b>701</b> collides with them during a dangerous scenario.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">As an example, the grip cover <b>766</b> can be sustainably produced from a material such as algae foam, or latex foam, for example. Other such materials that can be used to construct the grip cover <b>766</b> include but are not limited to thermoformed EVA copolymer foam, natural rubber, vinyl, neoprene, and polyurethane and PVC foams.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">Additionally, a grip cover <b>766</b> may increase the reliability of the swivel lock <b>701</b> by protecting the swivel lock <b>701</b> from corrosion due to water and the environment. In some embodiments such as the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, the grip cover <b>766</b> may prevent corrosion of the pull release <b>702</b>. In some embodiments, the grip cover may additionally prevent corrosion of the internal locking mechanisms by sealing the recess end <b>722</b> and the ridge end <b>772</b> of the pull release <b>702</b>, for example. Protection against corrosion can be achieved by manufacturing the grip cover from a waterproof material and designing the grip cover to conform around and seal the ridge end <b>772</b> and the recess end <b>773</b>. The sealing of the ridge end <b>772</b> and the recess end <b>773</b> of a swivel lock <b>701</b> or comparable quick release lock may prevent the infiltration of water or other undesirable materials into said swivel lock <b>701</b>/quick release lock.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a side view of the ridge side opening <b>871</b> of the grip cover <b>866</b>, according to an aspect.

Thus, in some embodiments, a grip cover <b>966</b> may be provided with an internal ridge <b>974</b> in order to conform to the shape of the pull release <b>702</b>. Providing a pull release <b>702</b> and grip cover <b>966</b> with corresponding grip ridge <b>967</b> and internal ridge <b>974</b> may allow the grip cover <b>766</b> to engage with the swivel lock <b>701</b> to better stay in place when attached to the swivel lock. The grip cover <b>966</b> can have an internally extending edge, flange, or lip <b>981</b> to further secure and seal the locking component. It should also be understood that the grip cover <b>966</b> can be provided in a variety of shapes and sizes in order to cover different pull releases. For example, in some embodiments, a longer grip cover <b>966</b> may be provided to protect a longer pull release, or a shorter grip cover <b>966</b> may be provided to protect a shorter pull release. It should be understood that the grip cover <b>966</b> can be provided in any suitable conformation and shape to protect any suitable mechanisms used for swivel lock, and the like.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">As shown, the thickness of the grip body <b>968</b> and may be 0.08 inches (in).

As can be seen from the configuration of swivel lock <b>1101</b>, in contrast to previously shown swivel lock configurations, the protrusion, stem, or pole <b>1112</b> may be secured to the tether and the pull release <b>1102</b> may be secured to the strap <b>1105</b>. Each of the protrusion <b>1112</b> and the pull release <b>1102</b> of the swivel lock <b>1101</b> may be secured to either the tether or the strap <b>1105</b>, so long as it does not negatively impact device functionality or the user's ability to reliably engage and disengage the pull release <b>1102</b> from the protrusion <b>1112</b> in the recess, opening, coaxial opening, or cavity <b>1125</b> through a simple coaxial motion. As illustrated, the recess <b>1125</b> is coaxial with the locking component <b>1102</b><i>b </i>such that the central axis of the recess <b>1125</b> and the locking component <b>1102</b><i>b </i>are aligned or coincide along the engagement axis <b>1382</b>. While the tether is not shown, the guard or guard attachment <b>1119</b> may attach to said tether in order to connect the swivel lock <b>1101</b> to sports equipment (not shown) or another suitable object.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">The inclusion of a ridge slot <b>1175</b> embedded within the slide handle, cylinder, or sleeve <b>1102</b><i>a </i>of the pull release <b>1102</b> may facilitate a more secure engagement of the grip cover <b>1166</b> over the swivel lock <b>1101</b>. As discussed herein, the locking component <b>1102</b><i>b </i>can have a ball housing, opening, radial opening, or hole <b>1118</b> within which a ball (e.g., ball bearing) <b>1111</b> radially moves into and out of the indentation of the protrusion depending on the position of the groove <b>1117</b> of the slide handle <b>1102</b><i>a</i>. The sleeve <b>1102</b><i>a </i>can have a first ridge <b>1130</b> on an inner surface or inner cylindrical surface <b>1132</b>. The first ridge <b>1130</b> presses against the flange in the second position to inhibit further axial movement of the sleeve <b>1102</b><i>a </i>from the first position to the second position. The sleeve <b>1102</b><i>a </i>can have a second ridge <b>1134</b> on the inner surface <b>1132</b>, wherein the spring <b>1110</b> presses against the second ridge <b>1134</b> of the sleeve <b>1102</b><i>a </i>to bias the sleeve <b>1102</b><i>a </i>into the first position relative to the locking body <b>1102</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">The previously discussed inner ridge of the grip cover <b>1166</b> may be nested within the ridge slot <b>1175</b> while installed. The engagement of the inner ridge <b>1174</b> with the ridge slot <b>1175</b> and the engagement of the grip <b>1103</b> with the grip ridge <b>1167</b> may help to maintain a secure connection between the grip cover <b>1166</b> and the swivel lock <b>1101</b> that does not come loose during usage, even during dangerous situations. As described hereinabove, the engagement of the recess grip end <b>1169</b> with the recess end <b>1173</b> and the engagement of the ridge grip end <b>1181</b> with the ridge end <b>1172</b> may facilitate an airtight seal around the pull release <b>1102</b> of the swivel lock <b>1101</b>, helping to protect the swivel lock <b>1101</b> from environmental factors, such as corrosion, during use. The grip ridge <b>1167</b> and/or grip cam provide flaring features for hand grip purposes without hydraulic loads pulling the sleeve <b>1102</b><i>a </i>back when dragged underwater, for example.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">Also as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the swivel lock <b>1101</b> may have a pull release stopper or washer <b>1124</b> adapted to stop the slide handle <b>1102</b><i>a </i>from traveling past the locking component, portion, tube, or body <b>1102</b><i>b</i>. The pull release stopper <b>1124</b> prevents the pull release <b>1102</b> from disassembling and assures the balls <b>1111</b> are contained within the ball housing <b>1118</b> to grip the protrusion <b>1112</b>.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref> illustrates the interaction of the locking component <b>1502</b><i>b </i>and the pull release stopper <b>1524</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref> further illustrates the slide handle <b>1502</b><i>a </i>for reference. The locking component <b>1502</b><i>b </i>may have a channel, groove, slot <b>1523</b> configured to receive the pull release stopper <b>1524</b>. As described below, the pull release stopper <b>1524</b> may be configured to be removable from the channel <b>1523</b>. The ability to remove the pull release stopper <b>1524</b> is advantageous because it allows for the slide handle <b>1502</b><i>a </i>to be disassembled from the locking component <b>1502</b><i>b</i>. Such disassembly allows for maintenance or replacement of the internal components of the swivel lock. For example, as described herein in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the swivel lock <b>1101</b> may have a first securing bit <b>1178</b><i>a </i>disposed within the pull release <b>1102</b>. By removing the pull release stopper <b>1124</b>, a user may remove the slide handle <b>1102</b><i>a </i>and access the securing bit <b>1178</b><i>a</i>. In another example, the user may remove the pull release stopper <b>1124</b> and the slide handle <b>1102</b><i>a </i>to replace the spring <b>1110</b> in the event that the spring <b>1110</b> wears out, is damaged, or is to be replaced with another spring or springs. The spring may be replaced with a different spring that provides a different resistance or bias force for the pull release, allowing for adjustment of spring forces according to a user's preference or desired application.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>C</figref>, the pull release stopper <b>1524</b> may be generally U-shaped. It may have a base <b>1527</b> and arms <b>1529</b>. The pull release stopper <b>1524</b> may be configured with indentations, gripping surfaces <b>1533</b>. The gripping surfaces <b>1533</b> may provide a location for a user to exert force to either push the pull release stopper <b>1524</b> over the diameter of the channel <b>1523</b> or pull the pull release stopper free from the channel <b>1523</b>. The arms <b>1529</b> may also be configured with guiding surfaces <b>1535</b> leading to a central locking shape <b>1537</b>. The guiding surfaces <b>1535</b> may be generally V-shaped and may be configured to assist a user in positioning the pull release stopper <b>1524</b> over the channel <b>1523</b> before pressing the pull release stopper into the channel <b>1523</b>. The central locking shape <b>1537</b> is configured to be the same size and shape as the inner surface of the channel <b>1523</b>. For instance, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>B</figref>, the inner surface of the channel <b>1523</b> may be circular, and the central locking shape <b>1537</b> of the pull release stopper <b>1524</b> may be a circle of the same size. Alternatively, the inner surface of the channel <b>1523</b> and the central locking shape <b>1537</b> may be corresponding squares, pentagons, hexagons, or any other shape.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">As discussed herein for the swivel lock device <b>301</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref>, the herein disclosed swivel lock <b>1101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> may utilize a securing bit, fastener, screw, or bolt <b>1178</b><i>b </i>disposed between the strap and a connector.

By orienting the swivel lock <b>1301</b> such that the user pulls a slide handle toward their body to trigger disengagement of the two connectors, the user may be provided with a straightforward disengagement process in which they may use body as backing support to enable rapid disengagement.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">It should be understood that the engaging and disengaging of a first connector attached to the guard <b>1319</b>, and thus the tether, with a second connector attached to the strap junction <b>1315</b>, and thus the strap <b>1305</b>, may be referred to as &#x201c;coupling&#x201d; and &#x201c;uncoupling&#x201d;, respectively. Thus, the engaging and disengaging of the protrusion attached to the tether with the pull release <b>1302</b> attached to the strap <b>1305</b>, as described hereinabove, may be referred to as &#x201c;coupling&#x201d; and &#x201c;uncoupling&#x201d;, respectively. As such, the process of inserting the protrusion <b>312</b> into the pull release <b>302</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, or otherwise engaging the first connector with the second connector, may be called &#x201c;coupling&#x201d;, whereas the removal of the protrusion <b>312</b> from the pull release <b>302</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, or otherwise disengaging the first connector from the second connector, may be called &#x201c;uncoupling&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">When the protrusion and pull release are coupled, both elements may be coaxially aligned on an established engagement axis <b>1382</b>. This disposition of both the protrusion and the pull release <b>1302</b> on this shared engagement axis <b>1382</b> makes it such that the uncoupling of the guard <b>1319</b>, and thus the tether, from the strap <b>1305</b> is facilitated by an axial release of the protrusion from pull release <b>1302</b>, in which said protrusion is moved axially along the engagement axis <b>1382</b> until it fully evacuates said pull release <b>1302</b>, at which point the strap <b>1305</b> and tether are then uncoupled. The engagement axis <b>1382</b> can be, can correspond, or be generally parallel to a central axis of any component discussed herein of the swivel lock quick release device <b>1301</b> as discussed herein, such as the strap junction <b>1115</b>, the junction rod <b>1176</b>, the sleeve <b>1102</b><i>a</i>, the locking component <b>1102</b><i>b</i>, the protrusion <b>1112</b>, the guard <b>1119</b>, and/or the strap <b>1105</b>. As described hereinabove, the disclosed swivel lock quick release device <b>1301</b> is configured to allow rapid, selective coupling and uncoupling of the tether to and from the strap, and thus rapid, selective coupling and uncoupling of the user to and from a sports equipment, floatation device, etc., making it suitable for utilization in safety equipment for various applications, such as watersports. It should be understood that the term &#x201c;selectively coupled&#x201d; may include that the disclosed selectively coupled elements may be coupled and uncoupled as desired, as is the case with the corresponding connectors of disclosed swivel lock quick release device <b>1301</b>. The functionality of coupling and uncoupling or attaching and detaching, etc. may be described and otherwise disclosed without the term &#x201c;selectively.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> illustrates the side perspective view of two different configurations of the disclosed swivel lock quick release device, according to an aspect. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref> illustrates the side perspective view a first configuration of the swivel lock quick release device <b>1401</b><i>a</i>, according to an aspect. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref> illustrates the perspective view of a second configuration of the swivel lock quick release <b>1401</b><i>b</i>, according to an aspect. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, the disclosed swivel lock quick release device may be configured in multiple ways depending on the preferred movement direction to uncouple the first and second connectors of said quick release device.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">A first configuration of the swivel lock quick release device <b>1401</b><i>a </i>may be arranged such that a first connector, such as pull release <b>1402</b>, may be attached to the strap junction <b>1415</b> and thus the strap <b>1405</b>, while a second connector, such protrusion <b>1412</b>, may be attached to the guard <b>1419</b>, and thus the attached tether. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>, the pull release <b>1402</b> may be oriented such that the grip <b>1403</b> is positioned closer to a user secured within the strap <b>1405</b>. In such a configuration, the user will need to pull the grip <b>1403</b> and slide handle of said pull release <b>1402</b> toward themselves in order to uncouple the first and second connector, and thus separate themselves from tether secured object. This first configuration of swivel lock quick release <b>1401</b><i>a </i>may be preferred in application in which a user may prefer or be able to more easily pull the slide handle toward themselves in the situations that merit uncoupling (e.g., a dangerous scenario).</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">A second configuration of the swivel lock quick release <b>1401</b><i>b </i>may be arranged such that a first connector, such as a pull release <b>1402</b> may be attached to the guard <b>1419</b> and thus the attached tether, while a second connection, such as protrusion <b>1412</b>, may be attached to the strap junction <b>1415</b>, and thus the strap <b>1405</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref>, the pull release <b>1402</b> may be oriented such that the grip <b>1403</b> is positioned further away from the user secured within the strap <b>1405</b>. In such a configuration, the user will need to push the grip <b>1403</b> and slide handle of said pull release <b>1402</b> away from themselves in order to uncouple the first and second connector, and thus separate themselves from the tether secured object. This second configuration of swivel lock quick release <b>1401</b><i>b </i>may be preferred in application in which a user may prefer or be able to more easily push the slide handle away from themselves.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">It should be understood that while either configuration of the swivel lock quick release device <b>1401</b><i>a</i>, <b>1401</b><i>b </i>may provide a suitable mechanism for reversibly coupling and uncoupling the user to and from a sports equipment, one of said configurations may be preferable for most applications. Generally, the first configuration of the swivel lock quick release device <b>1401</b><i>a </i>may be preferred over the second configuration <b>1401</b><i>b</i>, as the closer positioning of the grip <b>1403</b> to the user and the use of a pulling motion toward the user for uncoupling may allow for faster, easier and more reproducible uncoupling. Additionally, as described previously, the first configuration <b>1401</b><i>a </i>may allow user to use their own body a backing support to ensure the swivel lock does not move unexpectedly during use, thus increasing the probability that the user can uncouple themselves from the sports equipment quickly during a dangerous scenario. This being said, whichever configuration allows for the fastest and easiest uncoupling for a specific application should be utilized over the alternative. In some cases, the first confirmation <b>1401</b><i>a </i>may be desirable in applications where the tether may break often. In such cases, the strap will often remain intact and can be reused. With the first configuration, the pull release <b>1102</b> can remain with the strap being reused, while the tether attached to the protrusion <b>1112</b> can be replaced. In general, the protrusion is likely to be the cheaper and easier to manufacture component that is replaced with the tether, while the pull release <b>1102</b> can be reused may time with the strap.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref> illustrates an end view, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B</figref> illustrates an isometric view, of the locking component <b>1602</b><i>b </i>of the pull release <b>1602</b> of a swivel lock, according to an aspect. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>C</figref> is an end view, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>D</figref> is an isometric view, of the locking component <b>1602</b><i>b</i>, further illustrating the slide handle <b>1602</b><i>a </i>for reference with a ridge slot <b>1675</b> for connecting to an inner ridge of a grip cover as discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">A raised portion, head, protruding head, flange, or top <b>1641</b> of the perimeter of the locking component <b>1602</b><i>b </i>may have one or more ridges or projections <b>1643</b>. The ridges <b>1643</b> may extend to a diameter <b>1647</b> approximately equal to or slightly less than the inner diameter <b>1649</b> of the slide handle <b>1602</b><i>a</i>. Thus, when the user desires to disengage a protrusion (<b>1112</b>) from the pull release <b>1602</b>, they may pull on the slide handle <b>1602</b><i>a</i>, which is coaxially guided and balanced along the ridges <b>1643</b>. Advantageously, the ridges <b>1643</b> provide support for the slide handle <b>1602</b><i>a </i>and guide the slide handle <b>1602</b><i>a </i>coaxially along the locking component <b>1602</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">The locking component <b>1602</b><i>b </i>may additionally, or alternatively, have one or more recesses or grooves <b>1645</b>. The recesses <b>1645</b> may be disposed between the ridges <b>1643</b>. Advantageously, the difference between the inner diameter <b>1649</b> of the slide handle <b>1602</b><i>a </i>and the diameter <b>1653</b> to which the recesses <b>1645</b> extends forms one or more spaces, pressure release passages <b>1655</b> disposed between the slide handle <b>1602</b><i>a </i>and the locking component <b>1602</b><i>b</i>. Thus, when the user pulls the slide handle <b>1602</b><i>a </i>of the pull release <b>1602</b>, any fluids or small debris that may have entered the space between the slide handle <b>1602</b><i>a </i>and the locking component <b>1602</b><i>b </i>may escape or flow through the pressure release passage <b>1655</b>. For example, when a user of the swivel lock utilizes the swivel lock for water sports, water may enter into the space between the slide handle <b>1602</b><i>a </i>and the locking component <b>1602</b><i>b</i>. If the user attempts to pull the pull release <b>1602</b> while water remains inside, the slide handle <b>1602</b><i>a </i>may be difficult to pull due to hydraulic pressure caused by the entrained water. By providing one or more pressure release passages <b>1655</b> through the recesses <b>1645</b>, water within the pull release <b>1602</b> may escape when the user pulls the slide handle <b>1602</b><i>a</i>, preventing the pull release <b>1602</b> from becoming jammed.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">In some embodiments of the locking component <b>1602</b><i>b</i>, there may be a single ridge <b>1643</b> defining an outer diameter of the locking component <b>1602</b><i>b</i>, and a single recess <b>1645</b>. In some embodiments, there may be multiple ridges <b>1643</b> and recesses <b>1645</b>. The number of ridges <b>1643</b> and recesses <b>1645</b> may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, or any other number. In some embodiments, the ridges <b>1643</b> and recesses <b>1645</b> of the locking component <b>1602</b><i>b </i>may be disposed around the perimeter of a portion of the length of the locking component <b>1602</b><i>b </i>in a generally uniformly such as in a star-shaped pattern, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">Additionally, in some embodiments, the proportion of the perimeter of the locking component <b>1602</b><i>b </i>comprising ridges <b>1643</b> and the proportion comprising recesses <b>1645</b> may be equal, providing for a uniform pattern of ridges <b>1643</b> and recesses <b>1645</b> around the perimeter of the locking component <b>1602</b><i>b</i>. In some embodiments, the proportion of the perimeter comprising ridges <b>1643</b> may be different than the proportion comprising recesses <b>1645</b>.
