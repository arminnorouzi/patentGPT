end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a powdery paper-strengthening agent, a paper-strengthening agent solution, and paper.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Paper has been utilized as a recyclable resource for various applications. In the paper industry, as part of environmental measures, recycling of a used paper and reduction of a water consumption (closed system) have been tackled. However, if a used paper is continuously recycled, fibrils on a pulp surface will decrease, and interfiber bonds in paper will decrease. Furthermore, strength of a pulp fiber itself will be also reduced, and therefore strength of the obtained paper will be reduced. As a result, a paper-strengthening agent becomes indispensable one for compensating for decrease in strength during papermaking.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, as recycling of a used paper and closed system develop, fine fibers and dissolved electrolyte substances are accumulated in a papermaking system. Therefore, an electrical conductivity of the papermaking system tends to increase. Among dissolved electrolyte substances, calcium ions are particularly abundant. Calcium ions are not only originally contained in a papermaking white water, but also generated from calcium carbonate added to a pulp slurry, enhancing the electrical conductivity of the papermaking system. The electrical conductivity is increasing even when it exceeds 4 mS/cm. Under such circumstances, an amphoteric paper-strengthening agent is difficult to exhibit an original paper-strengthening effect because an ion portion is shielded by a dissolved electrolyte such as a calcium ion. A (meth)acrylamide-based polymer is used as a paper-strengthening agent for one of such papermaking additives.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The (meth)acrylamide-based polymer can be classified into an anionic type, a cationic type, or an amphoteric type according to ionicity thereof. Currently, the amphoteric type is mainly used. The amphoteric type (meth)acrylamide-based polymer is obtained by copolymerizing acrylamide with various polymerization components such as a cationic monomer and an anionic monomer. The (meth)acrylamide-based polymer has an isoelectric point and forms a polyion complex (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;PIC&#x201d;) at a pH near the isoelectric point. The isoelectric point refers to a pH at which an electric charge of a polymer as a whole becomes 0 when the pH is changed, and PIC refers to a water-insoluble substance formed by bonding polymers having anionic or cationic groups by ionic bond. When PIC is formed, a phenomenon of cloudiness is observed, and further, a non-uniform state may be created or an insoluble substance may be generated. By forming PIC, the (meth)acrylamide-based polymer is known to exhibit high filterability, yield, and paper-strengthening effect.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, as a paper-strengthening agent comprising the above-described polymers, one having a branched structure and a high molecular weight in order to exhibit an excellent paper-strengthening effect when made into paper has been mainly used, and one of an aqueous solution type has been generally used. However, the aqueous solution type paper-strengthening agent has a problem that a cationic component is hydrolyzed during a long-term storage and therefore a sufficient paper-strengthening effect cannot be obtained, and as a countermeasure, a powder type paper-strengthening agent has been developed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A powder type (meth)acrylamide-based polymer is known to be obtained by polymerization with heat or ultraviolet irradiation (the former is referred to as a &#x201c;boiling polymerization method&#x201d; and the latter as an &#x201c;ultraviolet polymerization method&#x201d;) (Patent Documents 1 and 2).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">Patent Document 1: WO2011/122405</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0009">Patent Document 2: WO2013/031245</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0010">However, in the methods described in Patent Documents 1 and 2, it is difficult to control reaction when trying to introduce a branched structure.

By way of an example, the average particle size of the powdery paper-strengthening agent is preferably about 0.01 to 2 mm from the viewpoint of making it easily soluble in a solvent such as water.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0060">A weight-average molecular weight of the (A) component (a value obtained by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) method) is 1,000,000 or more, preferably 1,500,000 or more, more preferably 2,000,000 or more, further preferably 2,500,000 or more.

The numerical value means that, when the powdery paper-strengthening agent is dissolved in a calcium chloride aqueous solution having an electrical conductivity of 4 mS/cm at 25&#xb0; C. to prepare an aqueous solution having a concentration of 1% by mass of the (A) component, a maximum value of turbidity at pH 3 to 9 of the aqueous solution is 10 to 2500 NTU. When turbidity is less than 10 NTU, the powdery paper-strengthening agent has a weak cohesiveness and easily becomes insufficient in paper-strengthening effect of paper.

Water used for preparing a calcium chloride aqueous solution is preferably a deionized water. This deionized water is water having an electrical conductivity of 0.2 mS/cm or less through an ion exchange resin. A reason for using the above-described calcium chloride aqueous solution is that calcium ions are contained in a white water when papermaking, and further, calcium carbonate is also added as a filler to a pulp slurry. When this white water and the pulp slurry are mixed, a large amount of calcium ions are present in the slurry liquid, so that, by using calcium chloride that dissolves in the deionized water, an environment close to that for papermaking can be created. Moreover, another reason for using the above-described aqueous solution is that calcium ions have a great effect of shielding ionicity of a pulp, a paper-strengthening agent, etc. in a papermaking system.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0064">The above-described turbidity correlates with a degree to which the (A) component forms a polyion complex (PIC), whose value varies depending on pH. Since the (A) component has anionic and cationic functional groups in its molecule, pH of the solution approximates around an isoelectric point to form a PIC. When the (A) component begins to form a PIC, the solution becomes turbid. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a drawing having &#x201c;one peak&#x201d; of a distribution of turbidity. As for the distribution of turbidity, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, when the pH is changed, turbidity of the solution becomes gradually thicker at first, and the turbidity value continues to increase as well. After reaching the maximum value, the turbidity becomes lighter, and the turbidity value also decreases (this distribution is referred to as &#x201c;one peak&#x201d;, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Moreover, when an excessive PIC is formed, precipitates are generated in the solution at a certain point in time, and therefore the turbidness becomes lighter, thereby decreasing the turbidity value, and when the pH is further increased, the precipitates gradually disappear, and therefore the turbidness becomes thicker again, which may increase the turbidity value. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a drawing having &#x201c;two peaks&#x201d; of a distribution of turbidity. In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a turbidity distribution when pH is changed from 3 to 9 has two peaks (this distribution is referred to as &#x201c;two peaks&#x201d;, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).

Cation values before and after the storage were measured. The cation value was calculated by Equation 1, and a cation decomposition rate was calculated by Equation 2. Besides, the cation value was measured by adjusting pH of a solution, diluted with a deionized water so that a concentration of the paper-strengthening agent became 0.5%, to 2.0 with hydrochloric acid, and then performing colloidal titration with an aqueous solution of potassium polyvinyl sulfate (factor: f=1.00) defined as 1/400 (N) using toluidine blue as an indicator. The cation value was calculated according to Equation 1 with a point, at which a color of a measurement solution changed from blue to reddish violet and the reddish violet was maintained for 10 seconds or longer, being as an end point. Moreover, the powdery paper-strengthening agents in Examples 5, 13, and Comparative example 2, and the aqueous solution of (A-1) the component obtained by the method of Example 1 as a reference comparative example were also measured in the similar manner.
