A common form of additive manufacturing is known as fused deposition modeling (FDM). Using FDM, a thermoplastic is passed through and liquified within a heated print head. The print head is moved in a predefined trajectory (a.k.a., a tool path) as the material discharges from the print head, such that the material is laid down in a particular pattern and shape of overlapping 2-dimensional layers. The material, after exiting the print head, cools and hardens into a final form. A strength of the final form is primarily due to properties of the particular thermoplastic supplied to the print head and a three-dimensional shape formed by the stack of two-dimensional layers.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">FDM and other traditional forms of additive manufacturing utilize one of several different available motion platforms to move the print head along the tool path during discharge of the material into the two-dimensional layers. One example motion platform utilizes an overhead gantry having leadscrews that extend in a first (e.g., X-) direction and in a second (e.g., Y-) direction. A carriage is mounted to the first-direction leadscrews via one or more threaded bearings, and the second-direction leadscrews extend between the carriage and one or more threaded bearings of the print head. Motors are controlled to selectively rotate the leadscrews, causing the associated bearings to advance the carriage and/or the print head in desired directions, by desired amounts, and/or at desired speeds. An example of this type of motion platform is disclosed in WO2020170058 that was filed Feb. 21, 2019.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although the leadscrew configuration described above may be adequate for some applications that require high-torque, high-rigidity, a large build volume, and/or high-precision, it may also be problematic. For example, the leadscrew configuration may have high mass, which can require a larger and costlier motor and result in a higher momentum. The high momentum can limit use of the leadscrew configuration at high speeds and/or high accelerations. In addition, chattering is common along leadscrews, which can reduce a quality of printing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An alternative motion platform also utilizes an overhead gantry. However, this gantry relies on a series of belts and pulleys. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 9,108,360 that issued on Aug. 18, 2015 discloses an arrangement having two stationary motors and two stationary pulleys attached to a frame of a printing system. A carriage is slidably mounted to a Y-axis bearing shaft of the frame and includes sleeves that receive X-axis bearing shafts. A print head is slidably mounted to the X-axis bearing shafts. A belt passes around driveshafts of the motors, the two stationary pulleys, and four additional pulleys mounted to the carriage. Ends of the belt terminate at a mount of the print head. The motors can be independently or simultaneously driven in the same or opposing directions to move the print head in an X-Y plane along only the X-direction, only the Y-direction, or both the X- and Y-directions (e.g., diagonally). Consumables are stationarily mounted to the frame.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Although the belt-driven motion platform described above may be a lower cost improvement in applications that require high-speeds and/or high-accelerations, it may also be problematic. For example, the belt may stretch during operation, thereby losing rigidity and limiting its use to smaller build volumes (e.g., where the belt is shorter) and lighter print heads.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The disclosed system is directed to addressing these and other issues of the prior art.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagrammatic illustration of an exemplary disclosed additive manufacturing system;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> are enlarged diagrammatic illustrations of a portion of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagrammatic illustration of another exemplary disclosed additive manufacturing system; and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> are enlarged diagrammatic illustrations of a portion of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to an additive manufacturing system.

First structure <b>22</b> may be configured to move second structure <b>24</b> and head <b>18</b> together with greater stability over longer distances due to its high mass, while second structure <b>24</b> may be configured to move print head <b>18</b> with a high-response rate due to its lower mass. The combined features of both structures <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may allow support <b>14</b> to have both high-stability and high-response rate, resulting in greater accuracies and faster build times within a larger build volume <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, first structure <b>22</b> may include a generally multi-sided skeletal, solid, or semi-solid frame <b>26</b>, wherein second structure <b>24</b> is positioned at an outer face (e.g., an upper most face, relative to the pull of gravity) of frame <b>26</b>. In one embodiment, frame <b>26</b> is generally rectangular, having six faces. In other embodiments, however, frame <b>26</b> could be pyramidal, cylindrical, or have another polyhedron shape with any number of faces.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">First structure <b>22</b> may additionally include, among other things, one or more lead screws <b>28</b> located at the outer face of frame <b>26</b>, one or more threaded blocks <b>30</b> operatively mounted on each of lead screw(s) <b>28</b>, and one or more slide rails or shafts <b>32</b> that extend between blocks <b>30</b> and corresponding bearings <b>34</b> of second structure <b>24</b>. In the depicted embodiment, four lead screws <b>28</b> are illustrated as being located around a perimeter of the outer face, with one block <b>30</b> mounted to each lead screw <b>28</b>. Two rails <b>32</b> are supported by each block <b>30</b>, and one bearing <b>34</b> connects each rail <b>32</b> to second structure <b>24</b>. It is contemplated, however, that rails <b>32</b> could instead be located around the perimeter of the outer face, and lead screws <b>28</b> could extend from blocks <b>30</b> through bearings <b>34</b>, if desired.

The disclosed system may manufacture these structures within a reduced window of operational time. High resolution and low operational time may be achieved by optimally splitting motion of head <b>18</b> and/or platform <b>38</b> between first and second structures <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and/or by reducing a momentum of the system. Operation of system <b>10</b> will now be described in detail.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">At a start of a manufacturing event, information regarding a desired structure <b>12</b> may be loaded into system <b>10</b> (e.g., into controller <b>20</b> that is responsible for regulating operations of support <b>12</b> and/or head <b>18</b>). This information may include, among other things, a size (e.g., diameter, wall thickness, length, etc.), a contour (e.g., a trajectories, surface normal, etc.), surface features (e.g., ridge size, location, thickness, length; flange size, location, thickness, length; etc.), connection geometry (e.g., locations and sizes of couplings, tees, splices, etc.), reinforcement selection, matrix selection, discharge locations, severing locations, motion specifications, etc. It should be noted that this information may alternatively or additionally be loaded into system <b>10</b> at different times and/or continuously during the manufacturing event, if desired. Based on the component information, one or more different reinforcements and/or matrix materials may be installed and/or continuously supplied into system <b>10</b>. This may include, for example, mounting of the fiber supply <b>48</b> and/or matrix supply <b>50</b> onto second structure <b>24</b>, such that head <b>18</b> moves with these materials during activation of first structure <b>24</b> and independent of these materials during activation of second structure <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">After materials are loaded into system <b>10</b> and communicated with head <b>18</b>, controller <b>20</b> may selectively cause head <b>18</b> to discharge material during activation of one or both of first and second structures <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. It is contemplated that first structure <b>22</b> may be activated alone, that second structure <b>24</b> may be activated alone, and/or that first and second structures <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may activated together in a coordinated manner. For example, first structure <b>22</b> may be activated to cause motion of second structure <b>24</b> in only an X-direction, in only a Y-direction, or in both X-and Y-directions (diagonally). Similarly, second structure <b>24</b> may be activated to cause motion of head <b>18</b> in only the X-direction, in only the Y-direction, or in both the X- and Y-directions. Finally, any combination of these motions (e.g., X-, Y-, or diagonal motion of second structure <b>24</b> in conjunction with X-, Y-, or diagonal motion of head <b>18</b>, in any combination of positive or negative directions) may be simultaneously imparted via activation of both first and second structures <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Positive and negative X-, Y-, and diagonal motions of first structure <b>22</b> may be achieved by selectively activating only X-aligned actuators <b>36</b>, only Y-aligned actuators <b>36</b>, or both X- and Y-aligned actuators <b>36</b> in the same or different rotational directions. Likewise, positive and negative X-, Y-, and diagonal motions of head <b>18</b> may be achieved by selectively activating only one or both of actuators <b>58</b> in the same or different rotational directions. Any of the motion of first and/or second structures <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> within the X-Y plane may also be selectively coordinated with motion of second structure <b>24</b> and head <b>18</b> in the Z-direction, tilting of second structure <b>24</b> and head <b>18</b>, and/or motion of platform <b>38</b> in the Z-direction.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Examples of how first and second structures <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be used together or alone during fabrication of particular geometry are provided. In a first example, a circle having a small radius may be fabricated by system <b>10</b>. In this example, fabrication of the circle may require high-acceleration. The circle may be fabricated utilizing only structure <b>24</b> to move print head <b>18</b>, which may have the appropriate structure to handle the high-accelerations and still accurately produce features of the circle. In a second example, a straight line may be fabricated by system <b>10</b>. In this example, fabrication of the straight line may be fabricated utilizing only structure <b>22</b> to move print head <b>18</b>, as changes in acceleration are not present and the rigidity of the leadscrew configuration may improve accuracies. In a third example, a sinusoidal pattern may be fabricated by system <b>10</b>. In this example, structure <b>24</b> may be used to generate the amplitudes of the pattern (i.e., to move head <b>18</b> back and forth across a centerline), while structure <b>22</b> may be used to generate the periods (i.e., to move head <b>18</b> along a length of the centerline). This may result in a fastest fabrication time with a greatest accuracy.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The disclosed system has many advantages over the prior art. For example, the smaller, belt driven gantry being housed inside of the larger lead screw gantry allows for a lower mass at the print head. The mass of the print head is reduced even more by moving material supplies normally residing on the print head to a location off of the print head and on the belt driven gantry. In addition, other components that are critical to the functionality of the print head can also be placed on the smaller gantry, thereby further reducing a mass of the print head.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The lower mass of the print head facilitates quick changes in acceleration, while still allowing for a large build volume otherwise not possible via conventional motion systems. The lead screw gantry provides stable movement of the smaller belt driven gantry to different areas of the print volume, while the belt driven gantry allows for higher print speeds and greater accuracy. Belt stretch, backlash, and chatter may all be reduced.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the disclosed system. Other embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the disclosed system.
