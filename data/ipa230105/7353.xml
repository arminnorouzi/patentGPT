Examples of these implementations are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. It should be noted that these examples are described for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of this disclosure. Rather, alternatives, modifications, and equivalents of the described implementations are included within the scope of this disclosure as defined by the appended claims. In addition, specific details may be provided in order to promote a thorough understanding of the described implementations. Some implementations within the scope of this disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these details. Further, well known features may not have been described in detail for the sake of clarity.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The present disclosure describes techniques that enable consumers of media content to identify and navigate to content of interest. According to a particular class of implementations, a graphical user interface (GUI) is provided in association with media content in which entities (e.g., keywords, distinct speakers, or visual objects) represented in the media content are presented in relation to the media timeline of the media content. For example, for a selected range of the media content a set of entities appearing in that range might be presented. In another example, the positions of occurrences of entities corresponding to a keyword selected or entered by a user might be presented relative to the media timeline. As will be appreciated, such GUI components allow the consumer to identify and navigate to the relevant portions of the media content. An example will be instructive.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an example of a GUI <b>100</b> enabled by the present disclosure. GUI <b>100</b> includes a content window <b>102</b> in which video content is displayed. GUI <b>100</b> also includes a playback bar <b>104</b> that shows the current playback position relative to the media timeline of the video content (e.g., 1:52/36:16). An interactive slider component <b>106</b> is provided that can be moved by the consumer relative to playback bar <b>104</b>. In the depicted example, the width of slider <b>106</b> may be selected by the consumer using slider width component <b>108</b> to be, in this example, one of four different time durations (e.g., one, five, ten, or fifteen minutes). The position of slider <b>106</b> relative to playback bar <b>104</b> selects a corresponding range of the video content.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Selection of a content range using slider <b>106</b> results in presentation of a set of relevant keywords represented in that range in dynamic keyword list <b>110</b>. Thus, by positioning slider <b>106</b>, a consumer can see what is being discussed in any given slice of the content. The consumer can quickly navigate to the content of interest by, for example, scrubbing along playback bar <b>104</b>. As will be discussed, the manner in which keywords are identified, and their relevance determined may vary depending on the particular application. For example, in the depicted example of sports-related video content, the names of athletes and sports teams are emphasized.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">GUI <b>100</b> also includes a relevance bar <b>114</b> in which occurrences of one or more specific keywords are represented relative to the same media timeline represented in playback bar <b>104</b>. The specific keywords represented in relevance bar <b>114</b> may be selected from dynamic keyword list <b>110</b> (e.g., by selecting the &#x201c;+&#x201d; associated with each), or by entry of a keyword in positive interest keywords (PIKS) component <b>116</b>. In the depicted implementation, the selected keywords are represented by lines in relevance bar <b>114</b>. These lines can be presented with varying intensity depending, for example, on relevance and/or frequency. Again, scrubbing along playback bar <b>104</b> allows the consumer to navigate to the relevant ranges of the video content.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">GUI <b>100</b> also allows for the identification of keywords in which the consumer does not have an interest; referred to herein as negative interest keywords (NIKS). Similar to PIKS, NIKS can be selected from dynamic keyword list <b>110</b> (e.g., by selecting the &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; associated with each), or by entry of a keyword in NIKS component <b>118</b>. In the depicted example, NIKS are represented by gaps, dark lines, or otherwise de-emphasized lines in relevance bar <b>114</b>. The consumer can then choose to skip playback of any such portions of the content.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As will be appreciated from the foregoing example, the mechanisms described enable a consumer to quickly identify and navigate to portions of media content relevant to the consumer's interest.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of a computing environment in which a content service <b>202</b> provides access to media content via a network <b>204</b> to a client device <b>206</b> in accordance with the techniques described herein. Content service <b>202</b> may conform to any of a wide variety of architectures such as, for example, a services platform deployed at one or more co-locations, each implemented with one or more servers. Network <b>204</b> represents any subset or combination of a wide variety of network environments including, for example, UDP/IP or TCP/IP-based networks, telecommunications networks, wireless networks, satellite networks, cable networks, public networks, private networks, wide area networks, local area networks, the Internet, the World Wide Web, intranets, extranets, and so on. Client device <b>206</b> may be any suitable device capable of connecting to network <b>204</b> and consuming content provided by service <b>202</b>.

As will be understood, such computing resources may be integrated with and/or under the control of the same entity controlling content service <b>202</b>. Alternatively, such resources may be independent of content service <b>202</b>, e.g., on a platform under control of a separate provider of computing resources with which content service <b>202</b> connects to consume computing resources as needed.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">It should also be noted that, despite any references to particular computing paradigms and software tools herein, the computer program instructions on which various implementations are based may correspond to any of a wide variety of programming languages, software tools and data formats, may be stored in any type of non-transitory computer-readable storage media or memory device(s), and may be executed according to a variety of computing models including, for example, a client/server model, a peer-to-peer model, on a stand-alone computing device, or according to a distributed computing model in which various functionalities may be effected or employed at different locations.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The various implementations enabled by the present disclosure contemplate logic resident on the client device consuming media content from content service <b>202</b>, such logic being configured to use metadata provided with the media content to support the GUI functionalities described herein. Such logic might be part of an existing algorithm or module on the client device (e.g., a media player) or implemented to work in conjunction with such an algorithm or module.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It should be noted that implementations are contemplated in which, in addition to facilitating content delivery to client device <b>206</b>, content service <b>202</b> may include logic that facilitates generation, storage, and communication of the metadata employed by client device <b>206</b> to support the GUI functionality enabled by the present disclosure. Implementations are also contemplated in which all or some portion of such logic operates remotely from content service <b>202</b>, and/or may be under the control of an independent entity. From these examples, those of skill in the art will understand the diversity of use cases to which the techniques described herein are applicable.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A block diagram of an example of a client device <b>300</b> suitable for use with various implementations is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

It will also be understood that device <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is merely an example of a device with which various implementations enabled by the present disclosure may be practiced, and that a wide variety of other devices types may also be used. The scope of this disclosure should therefore not be limited by reference to device-specific details.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Implementations enabled by the present disclosure enable the presentation of GUIs in which entities represented in media content are presented in terms of how they relate to the media timeline of the media content. The techniques described herein free the consumer from depending on playback to explore content, instead allowing an asynchronous approach to exploration of the content that leverages the efficiency of the visual cortex of the human brain to get at information of interest.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to some implementations, entities represented in media content are organized in a multi-time-scale summarization that allows the consumer to zoom into the time period(s) of interest and identify the most interesting things being talked about, visually appearing, or otherwise represented in that time period.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">It should be noted that, while the present application describes examples relating to video content, the techniques described herein may be applied to other types of media content including, for example, audio content, text, images (e.g., a slide presentation or photo stream with narration), etc. It should also be noted that while keywords are referenced in the example described herein, other types of entities (e.g., particular speakers or visual objects) may be employed as described herein without departing from the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">A particular class of implementations will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>7</b></figref>. The flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates generation of structured metadata for media content that organizes the entities represented in the media content by time.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">For a given media content presentation (e.g., video content), entities are identified and indexed relative to the media timeline of the content (<b>402</b>). As mentioned above, entities may include keywords, distinct speakers, or visual objects, among other possibilities. These entities may be identified in a variety of ways. For example, keywords may be extracted from the audio transcript associated with the media content, subtitles, or closed-caption text (e.g. srt file) using tools such as, for example, Amazon Comprehend, Google Cloud Natural Language API, Azure Text Analytics, IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding, etc. If a transcript is not already available for audio track(s) associated with the media content, it may be generated by a closed captioning service or automatically by using any of a variety of speech-to-text transcription tools such as, for example, Amazon Transcribe, Google Speech-to-text, Azure Speech service, IBM Watson Speech to Text, etc.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In another example in which entities correspond to distinct speakers, voice recognition technologies (e.g., Amazon Transcribe Features or Azure Speaker Recognition) may be employed to identify different speakers as distinct from one another (e.g., speaker A and speaker B) and/or to specifically identify individual speakers (e.g., a particular talk show host or celebrity). Distinct speakers may also be identified using facial recognition tools to process image frames or video frames (e.g., Amazon Rekognition, Vision AI from Google, or Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services). Other approaches to speaker separation and/or identification are embodied by the pattern recognition platforms described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,966,274, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In another example, entities may be identified using image processing tools (e.g., Amazon Rekognition, Vision AI from Google, or Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services) to identify specific types of visual objects present in image frames or video frames. Implementations are also contemplated in which the recognition and presentation of entities in a GUI as enabled by the present disclosure can be extended beyond traditional media presentations. For example, objects can be recognized in the data or signals generated using any of a wide variety of imaging technologies (e.g., radar, lidar, etc.), and presented relative to a corresponding timeline. More generally, any type of time-indexed data in which entities may be represented may benefit from the techniques describe herein.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some implementations, and as discussed below, entities for a given media presentation may also be identified from a user or network of users, e.g., by input received from a user or users, and/or from user data stored for a user or users.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to some implementations, the entities are identified for consecutive and non-overlapping portions of the media content. For example, these portions might each be the same duration, e.g., 15 seconds long. Alternatively, these portions might be of different durations, being delineated, for example, by shot or scene boundaries in the content. As yet another alternative, the portions might be semantically determined, e.g., each spoken sentence, a semantically related set of sentences, or uninterrupted speech corresponding to a particular speaker. In other words, for the purpose of identifying entities, the media content may be quantized into chunks that may be either chunks of time or semantic content. Implementations are also contemplated in which the portions of the content may be overlapping.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">More generally, any way in which entities represented in media content and their respective positions relative to the media timeline of the content can be identified may be employed to support functionalities enabled by the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The entities identified for each portion of the media content are ordered according to some measurement of salience or relevance (<b>404</b>). According to some implementations, salience or relevance may be determined, at least in part, as a measure of the value of each word as determined by the text extraction tool (e.g., Google cloud language module, Comprehend). The extraction tool might also provide other useful information such as, for example, the entity type (e.g., whether the entity is a person, place, or thing, work of art, etc.), the mention type (e.g., proper name vs. common name), and so on. Such additional information may be employed to augment presentation of the corresponding entities.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">More generally, salience can be specified or determined in a variety of ways (e.g., word frequency, uniqueness, relevance, etc.) using any of a variety of tools. The extraction tool can be configured to focus on particular types of keywords, e.g., proper names of humans and organizations. The output of the extraction tool may be used directly to determine the entities for a given portion of the content. Alternatively, the output of the extraction tool may be further processed using additional algorithms or parameters to get a set of entities that suits a particular application. According to a particular implementation, a scoring layer is provided in addition to the salience options of the extraction tool to bias entity scores in a configurable manner that is relevant for the type of information the particular application is intended to capture, e.g., relevant to sports, science, news, etc.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Scoring of identified entities may be evolved over time with machine learning techniques, training a machine learning model using a corpus of text and/or user input. User selection and input of keywords can be tracked over time to drive improvement of the salience/scoring algorithm for particular media content or for a category or class of media content. For example, if there are multiple users viewing a particular video, the entities they select can be captured and used as feedback to modify the scoring algorithm for that video or a larger class of similar videos. This might include adding entities selected by users to be included among the relevant entities for that content.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">More generally, back-end learning can be driven by user interaction with the GUI in which time-indexed entities are presented. For example, the more users select specific entities or entity types, those entities or types might be emphasized in future extraction operations. Such feedback can be driven statistically (e.g., as is common in search algorithms). Alternatively, information about the entities being selected (rather than the words themselves) can be used to drive a more optimal scoring algorithm. For example, if users frequently select proper names for a particular video, proper names can be weighted more heavily in the scoring algorithm for that video and other videos like it.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The time-indexed entities are organized as hierarchical metadata (<b>406</b>). According to some implementations, the different levels of the hierarchy relate to different time scales. For example, in one implementation, in addition to the 15-second portions of the media content, the entities are organized according to one-minute, five-minute, ten-minute, and fifteen-minute portions of the content (e.g., as discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to this implementation, each 15-second window has a corresponding set of the top entities in that window ordered by a salience score. The number of keywords for each 15-second window can be a set (configurable) number, variable (e.g., based on a salience or score threshold), or exhaustive (e.g., all keywords that aren't things like articles, conjunctions, etc.). Keyword sets for different time scales (e.g., 1, 5, 10, 15 min) may be generated in different ways depending on the implementation.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to one implementation, the extraction and scoring can be repeated for windows on each time scale. This might be done using the same 15-second extraction window and aggregating the results. Alternatively, the keyword sets for smaller time scales can be combined to create the sets for larger time scales, e.g., 4 consecutive 15-second window sets to get 1 minute, 20 consecutive 15-second window sets or 5 consecutive 1-minute window sets to get 5 minutes, etc.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In addition, the windows for the higher time scales may be non-overlapping or overlapping. In the latter case, for example, each 1-minute window might overlap with adjacent 1-minute windows by 15, 30, or 45 seconds. When lower time scale sets are combined to get a set for a higher time scale, the entities may be reordered (e.g., based on their salience/scores) with the relevance of repeated entities being reinforced (e.g., the score for a given entity can be increased if it is repeated in the different sets being combined). A limit may be set on the number of entities in the sets for higher time scales. For example, there might be only 12 or 15 keywords allowed for each 1-minute or 5-minute window even if there are more than that in the sets for the underlying 15-second windows. According to a specific implementation, entity sets are determined for 1-minute, 5-minute, 10-minute, and 15-minute time windows every 15 seconds (e.g., multiple sliding windows with step of 15 seconds).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example of a portion of hierarchical metadata in which the entities are organized in entity sets for each window of time of the video at each time scale. As will be discussed, this hierarchical metadata may be used to drive the dynamic keyword list presented on the client device as a function of the slider position and width in relation to the playback bar (e.g., slider <b>106</b> and playback bar <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In the depicted example, the entities are only shown for 5, 10, and 15-minute windows for clarity.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">A second type of metadata is generated based on the time-indexed entities that represents how each entity maps to the relevance bar (<b>408</b>), e.g., relevance bar <b>114</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The example of this relevance metadata shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> includes a value for each entity for every 15-second window of the media content. The value might be a one or a zero depending on whether the entity is represented in that window. Alternatively, the value may be weighted based for example, by the number of occurrences of the entity in that window and/or the salience score for that entity. As will be discussed, this relevance metadata drives the relevance bar presented on the client device for keywords that have been selected by the user.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The hierarchical and relevance metadata are transmitted to a client media player (<b>410</b>) in connection with, for example, acquisition of a stream or downloading of the corresponding media content. According to a particular implementation, the hierarchical and relevance metadata are packaged as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files that are converted to a JavaScript data format for use, for example, by a media player in a web browser.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates use of hierarchical and relevance metadata at the client device to support identification of entities of interest and navigation of the media content (or other type of data stream) in a GUI presented on a display associated with the client device. According to a specific implementation, the GUI is implemented in JavaScript using CSS (custom style sheets). The CSS are used to generate the UI elements (buttons, text-entry fields, slider, etc.) and the javascript code governs their functions. As mentioned above, such functionality might be integrated with a media player or provided as an add-on or plug-in to an existing media player.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">When a client device accesses media content (<b>702</b>), either by downloading or streaming, the client device also receives the corresponding hierarchical and relevance metadata (<b>704</b>) which it uses to generate components of a GUI (<b>706</b>) to enhance the playback experience of the media content. According to the implementation discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the GUI includes a dynamic keyword list (e.g., <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that includes the top entities for the current range of media content corresponding to the position of a slider (e.g., <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) relative to a playback bar (e.g., <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that represents the media timeline of the media content.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The width of the slider may be selected by the user to correspond to one of the time scales represented in the hierarchical metadata (<b>708</b>). The position of the slider relative to the playback bar determines what entities appear in the dynamic keyword list (<b>710</b>). This can be done in a variety of ways and may depend on the overlapping or non-overlapping nature of the keyword sets at different time scales. According to a particular implementation, the entity sets implicated by the slider position correspond to the beginning of the 15-second window immediately before the leading edge of the slider. Alternatively, it can be the 15-second window immediately before the trailing edge of the slider. Or it might depend on the time scale of the slider, e.g., for a 5-minute slider, the beginning of the 5-minute window immediately before the slider. Suitable variations will be appreciated by those of skill in the art. As will be appreciated in view of the foregoing time window quantization (e.g. 15 seconds), the apparent portion of the media content specified by the width and position of the slider relative to the playback bar may not correspond exactly to the range of the media content for which entities are presented in the dynamic keyword list.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to the implementation described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the GUI also includes a dynamic relevance bar (e.g., <b>114</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), the presentation of which is based on the relevance metadata. The relevance metadata may take the form of a vector representing the relevance bar that includes each entity's occurrences to the 15-second windows in the hierarchical metadata. Each 15-second window in which a particular entity appears will correspond to a non-zero value in the vector which may be salience score for that entity or, if there is more than one occurrence of the entity in that window, some combination of the salience scores.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The positions represented in the relevance bar may correspond to the 15-second windows represented in the relevance metadata. Alternatively, the relevance bar may be quantized to some alternate number of distinct locations to which the 15-second windows can be mapped. Before any entities are entered or selected by the user, the relevance bar may be presented as empty, or as a uniform shade or color, representing the fact that all entities are equally relevant.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">If the user enters or selects an entity (<b>712</b>), e.g., using PIK component <b>116</b> or list <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the corresponding position(s) of any representations of that entity are shown with vertical lines in the relevance bar (<b>714</b>), e.g., a heat map of relevance. If multiple entities are entered or selected, their relevance metadata may be combined (e.g., summed) and normalized for presentation together in the relevance bar. The entering of an entity in the PIK component might also be used to add that entity to the dynamic keyword list or bias the entity scoring algorithm in some way, e.g., to include proper names or that entity type in the list.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Conventional search technologies are typically positively-focused, identifying only instances of search terms the user wants to find. According to a particular implementation, the relevance metadata may be employed to allow a user to identify portions of media content that relate to entities or topics that are not of interest. This allows for the skipping or avoidance of portions of the content. When such entities are entered or selected (e.g., using NIKS component <b>118</b> or list <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), the corresponding positions are also represented in the relevance bar. This might be done, for example, using gaps or dark lines relative to the original uniform color or shade of the relevance bar. Alternatively, PIKS might be represented with green lines and NIKS with red lines. Suitable alternative will be apparent to those of skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Additional functionality may be supported by either or both of the hierarchical and relevance metadata. According to some implementations, a custom playback experience may be supported in which playback of the media content is constrained based on the relevance metadata and one or more entities entered or selected by the user. For example, if a user enters the name of a particular athlete, playback of a sports highlight show could be limited to include only the ranges (e.g., the 15-second windows) of the media content in which that athlete is mentioned. This might be accomplished by creation of a new video including only the relevant portions. Alternatively, playback of non-relevant portions of the content can be skipped. For example, when the relevance of a selected entity (as reflected in the relevance metadata) drops below a threshold, playback could skip ahead to the next relevant portion.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The relevance threshold for such playback could be manipulated to adjust how much of the content should be played back. For example, if a user has only one minute to watch an hour long video, the threshold can be set very high resulting in a shorter playback. On the other hand, if the user has 15 minutes, the threshold can be lowered resulting in longer playback; perhaps providing more of the context around the highly relevant portions. The playback time might be pre-calculated for a given threshold and communicated to the user, e.g., at this threshold it will take 10 minutes for playback. Alternatively, the user might specify how much time she has to watch the video and the threshold can be set accordingly.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As mentioned above, the entities represented in the hierarchical and relevance metadata may correspond to a number of entity types including, for example, distinct speakers in the media content and the portions of the content in which those speakers are speaking. In such an implementation, a dynamic speaker list (similar to the dynamic keyword list), and a speaker bar (similar to the relevance bar) may be presented in a GUI as described above. Similar metadata structures could be created in which the distinct speakers are identified. Such metadata may be represented more efficiently than for keywords in that the 15-second windows in which a particular speaker is speaking can be collapsed into a longer range of time during which that person is speaking. The speaker bar could identify each distinct speaker with a color and the speaker bar would have a multi-colored presentation identifying when the different speakers are speaking.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The distinct speakers could be specifically identified using, for example, speech or facial recognition technologies. On the other hand, some speech-to-text tools actually include speaker identification; not necessarily identifying the speaker by name but distinguishing between different speakers (e.g., A or B). And as will be appreciated, speaker-related metadata can be used to support custom playback as well, i.e., playback can be limited to specific speakers.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">According to some implementations, the entities entered or selected by the user as PIKS and NIKS may be employed in a variety of ways beyond identification of their respective positions in the relevance bar. For example, these can be used to weight scores for entities for particular media content or a class of media in a custom fashion. For a given user, this kind of feedback can be used to dynamically evolve a metadata engine or scoring layer for entity extraction that becomes a proxy for the user herself or a class of which that user is a member.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In another example, users can save their entity sets (e.g., PIKS and NIKS) in a manner similar to bookmarks for use with the same or other media content. For example, if a user is researching a particular topic, the user could save a set of PIKS and NIKS for a particular item of media content for use in connection with a later playback of that media content. In addition, a saved set of PIKS and NIKS that turns out to be useful for one item of media content can be re-used with other items of media content relating to the same topic.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In another example, the PIKS and NIKS for a particular user (e.g., a power user, an influential user, a subject matter expert, etc.) can be shared within a population of users. That is, a specific user's feedback for a particular item of media content or a class of media content (e.g., the PIKS and NIKS of that user) could be selected or adopted by another user as a baseline for themselves. For example, a user can select from among experts or authorities in particular subject matter areas, requesting content viewed by a particular expert using that expert's entity sets.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Entity sets for given items of media content, classes of media content, data streams, classes of data streams, particular users, or classes of users can also be used in support of a search functionality to identify other media content having sufficiently similar entity sets. This includes the identification of advertising content that aligns with a given entity set. Moreover, such uses of entity sets are not limited to identifying media content for which entity sets as described herein are available. Rather, any information associated with media content (e.g., conventional metadata associated an item of media content) can be used for comparison with a particular entity set to determine its similarity.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">As will be appreciated with reference to the foregoing examples, the data generated by users interacting with media content as enabled by the present disclosure is highly relevant in a number of ways. Not only do implementations enabled by the present disclosure enable a user to interact with media content more efficiently, the feedback from the user as to what is relevant to that user is far more specific and detailed than what is typically acquired in connection with the consumption of media content. That is, most content providers know what users search for, what they watch or listen to, and for how long. By contrast, the techniques enabled by the present disclosure provide ways to acquire feedback relating to very specific interests within the larger context of the media content.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">It will be understood by those skilled in the art that changes in the form and details of the implementations described herein may be made without departing from the scope of this disclosure. In addition, although various advantages, aspects, and objects have been described with reference to various implementations, the scope of this disclosure should not be limited by reference to such advantages, aspects, and objects. Rather, the scope of this disclosure should be determined with reference to the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
