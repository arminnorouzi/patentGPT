In detail, four power reception coils <b>31</b> are arranged at equal intervals (interval d (mm)) circumferentially. Hence, in this example, the power reception coil <b>31</b> is configured to rotate with the rotation of the tire <b>10</b> or the wheel <b>20</b>. Here, the circumferential position of the power reception coil <b>31</b> changes with the rotation of the tire <b>10</b> or the wheel <b>20</b>. The power reception coil <b>31</b> is located so as to face the power transmission coil <b>41</b> at least at a certain tire rotation angle in a state in which the tire and wheel assembly <b>3</b> is located above the power transmission device <b>40</b>. Therefore, when the tire <b>10</b> is located on the road surface above the power transmission coil <b>41</b> and the power transmission coil <b>41</b> and the power reception coil <b>31</b> face each other, the power reception coil <b>31</b> generates an electromotive force based on an AC magnetic field generated by the power transmission coil <b>41</b>, as a result of which current flows to feed power. The power reception coil <b>31</b> is ring-shaped as a whole, and is located so that the axial direction of the ring will be approximately perpendicular to the road surface. For example, the power reception coil <b>31</b> is wound around a core such as a ferrite core and is ring-shaped as a whole. The power reception coil <b>31</b> is, however, not limited to such, and may be any coil capable of generating an electromotive force based on an AC magnetic field, such as a coil spring or an air-core coil.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0130">The position of the power reception coil <b>31</b> is not limited as long as the power reception coil <b>31</b> faces the power transmission coil <b>41</b> when the tire <b>10</b> is located on the road surface above the power transmission coil <b>41</b>. For example, the power reception coil <b>31</b> may be attached to the inner circumferential surface of the bottom portion of the well <b>25</b>, or attached to the inner circumferential surface or outer circumferential surface of another part of the rim portion <b>21</b>. In such a case, too, the power reception coil <b>31</b> rotates with the rotation of the tire <b>10</b> or the wheel <b>20</b>.

In the case of dividing the power reception coil <b>31</b> into a plurality of power reception coils <b>31</b>, the total size of the power reception coils <b>31</b> can be reduced to suppress a weight increase due to the power reception coils <b>31</b>, so that the fuel efficiency can be improved. In this embodiment, four power reception devices <b>30</b> are provided in correspondence with the four power reception coils <b>31</b>. However, the number of power reception devices <b>30</b> may be any number corresponding to, for example, the number of power reception coils <b>31</b>, and the number of power reception devices <b>30</b> may be different from the number of power reception coils <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0132">In this example, the power reception device <b>30</b> includes a power conversion circuit <b>32</b>, a power storage <b>33</b>, and a controller <b>34</b>. The power conversion circuit <b>32</b> converts power generated in the power reception coil <b>31</b> into DC power, and supplies the DC power to the power storage <b>33</b> or another in-vehicle device included in the vehicle <b>2</b> via a conductive wire or the like. The power storage <b>33</b> stores the power generated in the power reception coil <b>31</b>. The power storage <b>33</b> is, for example, a capacitor, but is not limited to such, and may be any power storage device such as a storage battery. In the case where the power storage <b>33</b> is a capacitor, the power storage <b>33</b> can be charged and discharged in a shorter time than a storage battery. The power storage <b>33</b> that is a capacitor is therefore advantageous in such a situation that requires high readiness such as storing the power generated in the power reception coil <b>31</b> when the vehicle <b>2</b> runs on the power transmission device <b>40</b> provided on the road. The controller <b>34</b> may include one or more processors that provide processes for controlling each function of the power reception device <b>30</b>. The controller <b>34</b> may be a general-purpose processor such as a central processing unit (CPU) that executes a program defining a control procedure, or a dedicated processor that specializes in processes of each function. The controller <b>34</b> may include storage means for storing a program and the like, and any means used for controlling the power reception device <b>30</b> such as communication means for communicating with an external electronic device wiredly or wirelessly.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0133">In the case where the power reception coil <b>31</b> is configured to rotate with the rotation of the tire <b>10</b> or the wheel <b>20</b> as in this embodiment, the power generated in the power reception coil <b>31</b> may be, for example, transmitted to the power conversion circuit <b>32</b> via a slip ring. Alternatively, the power generated in the power reception coil <b>31</b> may be transmitted to a first repeating coil (wiredly). In such a case, a magnetic field generated by current flowing through the first repeating coil passes through a second repeating coil to cause current to flow through the second repeating coil, as a result of which power can be transmitted from the second repeating coil to the power conversion circuit <b>32</b> and the like. In this case, the first repeating coil and the second repeating coil are also configured to rotate with the rotation of the tire <b>10</b> or the wheel <b>20</b>.
