The sampling of a fluid is normally combined with the transport of the fluid through a pipeline, being one of the most important transporting means in many industries handling large quantities of fluids.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One example where the sampling of fluids has become increasingly important in the recent years is found in the oil industry. Sampling of crude oil for determining the net amount of oil has to be performed very accurately in connection with the metering of crude oil for royalty purposes. The knowledge of the correct amount of hydrocarbons in the available crude oil will further enable refinery operation management to draw up more accurate mass balances, so that the various refinery operations may be carried out in the most efficient manner.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A large variety of methods are known for sampling fluids; however, all these methods suffer from being not accurate enough when non-homogeneous fluids are to be sampled. The main reason for this inaccuracy consists herein that the samples which are taken from a fluid stream in a pipeline in the known methods are not representative for the bulk of fluid but only for that part of the fluid passing the sample point at the moment the samples are taken.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A problem in sampling crude oil to determine the content of water and bottom sediments in the oil, is formed by the fact that the water and other contaminations are hardly ever uniformly distributed in the oil. When crude oil is stored in a tank, the water and bottom sediments will settle down in the bottom part of the tank. When, for example, crude oil is unloaded from a tanker and transferred through a pipeline the amount of water and bottom sediments in the crude oil will exhibit large fluctuations. When the unloading of a tank in the tanker is in an advanced stage the crude oil passing through the pipeline will contain no or only small amounts of water dispersed therein. However, when the unloading of a further tank is started the amount of water in the crude oil will suddenly increase, and even slugs of water ray pass through the pipeline. Samples taken from the first part of the crude oil unloaded from a tanker may therefore totally differ from samples taken from the crude oil during the last part of the unloading. None of these samples nor the combined samples will necessarily be representative for the total mass of crude oil unloaded from the tanker. Further large variations in throughput may occur during the unloading process, causing further inaccuracies in the known sampling methods.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Fluid sampling devices are used in many industries to acquire a measured volume of fluid from an independent fluid source for transport to a remote testing location. Testing of the fluid sample may include detecting the presence of contaminants and/or determining the fluid's physical properties and composition. Generally, the fluid from the fluid source is circulated through the fluid sampling device, which facilitates the capture of a representative sample in a sample vessel that is detachable from the sampling device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This specification describes technologies related to systems, apparatus, and methods for acquiring a fluid sample, and a sampling system that is mobile and can be taken from field to field, e.g. the entire system is contained within a truck or other mobile unit.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments relate to an automated portable sampling apparatus and system to collect representative samples from non-homogeneous hydrocarbon systems and pipelines with no release of toxic vapor and liquid waste containing hydrogen sulfide to atmosphere.

The methods and systems of the present disclosure may be in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the illustrated embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure can be thorough and complete, and can fully convey its scope to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present disclosure relates to systems, devices, and methods for acquiring a representative fluid sample from a fluid source. In some embodiments, a fluid sampling device is appropriately configured to facilitate the acquisition of a fluid sample and the subsequent purging of its internal components, while inhibiting the release of sample fluid to the surrounding environment. This protects the environment and sampling personnel from harmful chemical release. In some examples, the fluid sampling device may facilitate a sample acquisition process that provides closed-loop flush and expansion operations for obtaining a representative sample at the appropriate fill density of the sample vessel. In some examples, the fluid sampling device may facilitate an inert-gas purging process that deposits residual sample fluid from previous sampling operations directly back into the fluid source. In some embodiments, a fluid sampling device includes an internal booster pump operable to maintain the pressure of the sample fluid above its vapor pressure to inhibit inadvertent flashing of a two-phase sample fluid to a gas phase. Thus, the fluid sampling device can facilitate sample acquisition from an external fluid source without an independent pressure source (e.g., a tank or reservoir). In order to be mobile, the fluid sampling device is preferably contained within a truck or other mobile unit that can travel from well to well and from field to field.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Turning now to the figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a fluid sampling device <b>100</b> and a fluid sampling method, according to one example embodiment of the disclosure. Device <b>100</b> is a battery operated portable sampling station using a positive displacement compressor <b>54</b>. The process involves collecting the crude sample <b>58</b> from three phase flow upstream choke valve or upstream any control valves or restriction orifice <b>50</b> inside a gas oil facility. The system includes piping <b>10</b> that contains a three phase fluid, e.g. including water, gas, and oil, flowing through it at a gas oil facility. A static mixer <b>12</b> mixes the fluids together, and the pipe <b>10</b> has an input <b>14</b> and an output <b>16</b>. A flexible hose <b>22</b> is connected upstream the choke or control valve <b>50</b> and a discharge hose <b>24</b> is connected downstream the choke or control valve <b>50</b> via quick acting and leakage free couplings <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> on one side and a non-return valve (NRV) <b>40</b> on the other side.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The method includes ensuring that pressure differential valve (PDV) <b>50</b> is open and there is differential pressure across the valve by comparing the reading from pressure transmitter PI-<b>1</b> <b>36</b> and pressure transmitter PI-<b>2</b> <b>38</b>. The next step is to connect the portable sampling device at double block and bleed valves (DBBV1 &#x26; DBBV2) <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> using the provided quick acting and leakage free couplings <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, respectively.

The next step is to ensure the level inside the Collection Drum (CD) <b>44</b> is zero. The next step is to open control valve <b>30</b> for an additional minute to ensure the vapor line is clean. The sample collection step involves closing valve <b>34</b> and opening valve <b>30</b> and monitoring the liquid level indicator (LC) <b>48</b> inside the collection drum <b>44</b>, and when LC <b>48</b> reaches 100%, closing valves <b>18</b> and <b>32</b>, to start the battery-operated positive displacement compressor (BOPDC) <b>54</b>. The next step is to monitor pressure controller (PC) <b>46</b> on the collection drum <b>44</b> and stop the compressor <b>54</b> when pressure reaches 0 psig. The next step is to close valve <b>20</b> which will ensure the full isolation of the sampling skid from the crude pipeline. The next step is to open the manual valve (MV) <b>42</b> and collect the crude sample <b>58</b> inside the sample container <b>56</b>. The next step is to disconnect the portable sampling station <b>100</b> from valves <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> using the provided quick acting and leakage free couplings <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, respectively. After the fluid sample <b>58</b> is collected in the sample container <b>56</b>, the fluid sample <b>58</b> may be analyzed using a computer software program (fluid analyzer) <b>60</b>, which may be installed on a network computer <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a fluid sampling device <b>120</b> and a fluid sampling method, according to another example embodiment of the disclosure.
