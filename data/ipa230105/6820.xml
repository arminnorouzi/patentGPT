Machine builders, solution providers, and other content creators typically produce the control logic needed to run on these controllers to control the machines.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to controller logic, other content may be employed or generated during industrial automation operations, such as data sets, drive parameters, cam tables, product formulations, recipes, production data, and human-machine interface (HMI) components. An HMI receives and processes status data from the machines to generate various graphical displays. For example, an HMI graphical display might indicate status metrics of a drive, the pressure of a pump, the speed of a motor, or the output of a robot. The HMI may also provide a mechanism for an operator to send control instructions to an industrial controller system that controls a machine. For example, an operator might use the HMI to direct the control system to update drive parameters, turn on a pump, speed-up a motor, or stop a robot.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">OVERVIEW</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Techniques to facilitate feature licensing of industrial devices employed in an industrial automation environment are disclosed herein.

For the purpose of teaching inventive principles, some conventional aspects of the best mode may be simplified or omitted. The following claims specify the scope of the invention. Note that some aspects of the best mode may not fall within the scope of the invention as specified by the claims. Thus, those skilled in the art will appreciate variations from the best mode that fall within the scope of the invention. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the features described below can be combined in various ways to form multiple variations of the invention. As a result, the invention is not limited to the specific examples described below, but only by the claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Various industrial devices are often employed in industrial automation environments, such as controllers, drives, communication modules, HMI devices, and other industrial equipment. Manufacturers of industrial devices often desire to control the use of certain features and functionality of a device through various licensing schemes. Feature licensing can provide a useful way to monetize device functionality and allow for a better user experience. However, many licensing schemes have inherent weaknesses, and difficulties can arise in securely provisioning and enforcing the licenses. For example, unscrupulous users often attempt to circumvent a licensing scheme by employing scripts or applications intended to unlock features and functionality of industrial devices without purchasing a license, or might even attempt some reverse engineering techniques to extract data stored within hardware.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Implementations disclosed herein provide for secure feature licensing and management of user operations on industrial devices. In at least one implementation, strong cryptography is applied to an industrial device with a hardware protected root of trust to ensure license information is unique to that specific hardware instance. For example, a hardware-based root of trust may be installed into an industrial device at the time of manufacture, and private cryptographic keys unique to the device may then be stored securely within the root of trust. In some implementations, a security certificate is provisioned to the device that provides strong identity information, including product type. The security certificate may be tied to the private key of the device so the certificate cannot be used on any other device. In order to license particular features of the device to an end user, a device information package may be provided to the user that is signed via a different root of trust associated with a security authority and is encrypted with the public key specific to the device. Generally, a second public key associated with the different root of trust of the security authority would be stored securely within the hardware root of trust of the device in order to verify the signature of the security authority and authenticate the device information package. In some implementations, the device information package may provide encrypted licensing information to the device about the specific behaviors and features which are enabled on the device. Since the licensing data in the device information package is encrypted with the device's public key, the license is tied to that specific device, and thus cannot be used on a different device that lacks the device's private key needed to decrypt the license data. Beneficially, the strong root of trust provisioned in the hardware of the industrial device when manufactured, combined with the unique identity of the device provided by the device's private key and associated security certificate, enable the ability to securely provision and license features of the device to an end user. In this manner, license information can be provisioned online or offline while still ensuring that the license cannot be used on different devices or transferred to another device without the involvement of the authoritative system.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary communication system, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a sequence diagram of an operation to securely license functionality for an industrial device in an exemplary implementation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates another exemplary communication system, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a flow diagram of an operation to facilitate feature licensing of industrial devices employed in an industrial automation environment in an exemplary implementation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary industrial automation environment that includes a computing system that may be used to execute a feature licensing process, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary computing system that may be used to perform any of the processes and operational scenarios described herein.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a block diagram that illustrates communication system <b>100</b> in an exemplary implementation is shown. Communication system <b>100</b> includes a manufacturing environment and a customer environment. The manufacturing environment includes certificate authority <b>110</b> and industrial device <b>130</b>, and the customer environment includes customer <b>125</b>, industrial device <b>130</b>, and industrial device <b>131</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the elements of the customer environment are in communication with computing system <b>101</b> and certificate authority <b>110</b> over communication network <b>120</b>. In some examples, the customer environment of communication system <b>100</b> could comprise an industrial automation environment, such as an automobile manufacturing factory, food processing plant, oil drilling operation, microprocessor fabrication facility, or some other type of industrial enterprise. Industrial devices <b>130</b> and <b>131</b> could comprise industrial controllers, motion drives, communication devices, sensors, data transmitters, HMI hardware systems, and other industrial automation equipment. In some examples, where industrial device <b>130</b> comprises an industrial controller, industrial device <b>130</b> could comprise an automation control system that drives the operation of industrial machinery, such as a programmable logic controller (PLC), programmable automation controller (PAC), or any other controller used in automation control. In some examples, industrial device <b>130</b> could comprise a ControlLogix&#xae; control system provided by Rockwell Automation, Inc.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Communication system <b>100</b> provides an example of a communication system in which any of the feature licensing processes and operational scenarios described herein may be implemented. The techniques described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> could be executed by the systems of communication system <b>100</b> such as computing system <b>101</b>, certificate authority <b>110</b>, and industrial device <b>130</b>, and could be combined with operation <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> in some implementations.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In operation, a unique identity is provisioned to industrial device <b>130</b> from certificate authority <b>110</b> at the time of device manufacture, as illustrated in the manufacturing environment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, the manufacturer of industrial device <b>130</b> could utilize certificate authority <b>110</b> to generate a unique identity for device <b>130</b> during manufacture, and then securely embed the unique identity into the hardware of device <b>130</b>, such as a hardware-based cryptographic root of trust, which is indicated graphically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> by the lock icon. In some implementations, the unique identity for industrial device <b>130</b> could utilize a public key infrastructure (PKI), such that the unique identity for device <b>130</b> is provided by a private key generated by certificate authority <b>110</b> and embedded into the hardware root of trust within industrial device <b>130</b>. In at least one implementation, industrial device <b>130</b> could generate the public/private key pair internally within its own trusted hardware, and the private key may then be stored securely within the hardware-based root of trust. The private key that is securely stored in the hardware root of trust of device <b>130</b> provides a unique identity of device <b>130</b> in that the private key is specifically associated with industrial device <b>130</b> and no other industrial device. The public key that is paired with the private key of industrial device <b>130</b> may then be stored by certificate authority <b>110</b> for subsequent use to encrypt licensing information for device <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some implementations, to provision the unique identity for industrial device <b>130</b>, certificate authority <b>110</b> could provision a security certificate to device <b>130</b> for storage in the hardware root of trust of device <b>130</b> at the time of device manufacture. The security certificate is specific to the private key of industrial device <b>130</b>. For example, the security certificate for device <b>130</b> may be generated by certificate authority <b>110</b> using the private key specific to device <b>130</b>. The security certificate provides strong identity information for industrial device <b>130</b>, including the device type, and uniquely identifies the specific industrial device <b>130</b> of that device type. The security certificate may be signed by certificate authority <b>110</b> so that the security certificate could later be validated and verified by certificate authority <b>110</b> as authentic. Accordingly, industrial device <b>130</b> may be uniquely identified by the security certificate provisioned for device <b>130</b> during manufacture based on the private key specific to device <b>130</b>. Further, in at least one implementation, a public key of an authoritative system, such as certificate authority <b>110</b> in this example, could also be stored in the hardware root of trust of device <b>130</b> at the time of manufacture, which could later be used by device <b>130</b> to validate license information received by device <b>130</b> that is signed by the corresponding private key of the authoritative system.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">After industrial device <b>130</b> is provisioned with a unique identity, device <b>130</b> may be sold to and operated by a customer <b>125</b>, as illustrated in the customer environment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In order to activate specific features and functionality of industrial device <b>130</b>, customer <b>125</b> may purchase a license to enable one or more functions of industrial device <b>130</b>. For example, an authoritative entity, such as the manufacturer of industrial device <b>130</b>, could utilize certificate authority <b>110</b> with computing system <b>101</b> to securely provision feature licenses for industrial device <b>130</b> over communication network <b>120</b> as purchased by customer <b>125</b> in real time. Accordingly, in some implementations, certificate authority <b>110</b> could be utilized to provide runtime licensing through a cloud gateway over communication network <b>120</b>. In this manner, the license information can be provisioned online or offline, yet cannot be compromised or transferred without going back to the authoritative system for approval.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In at least one implementation, in order to purchase a feature license, the customer <b>125</b> could present the signed security certificate for industrial device <b>130</b> to certificate authority <b>110</b>. Certificate authority <b>110</b> could then validate the certificate using the public key that corresponds to the private key that was used by authority <b>110</b> to sign the certificate, and thereby validate the certificate as authentic. Since the security certificate is unique to that specific industrial device <b>130</b>, certificate authority <b>110</b> could then utilize the security certificate to generate a license for the features and functionality that customer <b>125</b> desires to activate on device <b>130</b>. For example, the certificate authority <b>110</b> could utilize the security certificate of industrial device <b>130</b> to generate a feature license unique to device <b>130</b> by encrypting the license with the public key that corresponds to the private key unique to device <b>130</b>. In this manner, the license generated using the security certificate provisioned to industrial device <b>130</b> would therefore only be effective to unlock the specified features on industrial device <b>130</b>, because only device <b>130</b> possesses the unique private key necessary to decrypt the license information. Further, in some implementations, certificate authority <b>110</b> could include the feature license for industrial device <b>130</b> in a device information package, which could then be encrypted using the public key corresponding to the private key stored in device <b>130</b>, and could then sign the device information package using the private key associated with and controlled by certificate authority <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Upon receipt of the device information package, customer <b>125</b> could securely provision the device information package to industrial device <b>130</b> in order to apply the license and activate the licensed functionality.
