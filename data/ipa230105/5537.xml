While much of resistive-switching memory technology is in the development stage, various technological concepts for resistive-switching memory have been demonstrated and are in one or more stages of verification to prove or disprove associated theories or techniques. Resistive-switching memory technology is expected to show compelling evidence of substantial advantages over competing technologies in the semiconductor electronics industry in the near future.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Proposals for practical utilization of resistive-switching technology to memory applications for electronic devices have been put forth. For instance, resistive-switching elements are often theorized as viable alternatives, at least in part, to metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) type memory transistors employed for electronic storage of digital information. Models of resistive-switching memory devices provide some potential technical advantages over non-volatile FLASH MOS type transistors, for instance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In light of the above, the Assignee of the present disclosure continues to develop and pursue practical utilizations of resistive-switching technology.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following presents a simplified summary of the specification in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the specification. This summary is not an extensive overview of the specification. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the specification nor delineate the scope of any particular embodiments of the specification, or any scope of the claims. Its purpose is to present some concepts of the specification in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented in this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide for leveraging physical characteristics of resistive switching devices to generate data distinct to those resistive switching devices. That distinct data can be utilized for various purposes related to electronic identification. As one example, data generated from physical characteristics of resistive switching devices on a semiconductor chip can be utilized to form a distinct identifier sequence for that semiconductor chip.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In further embodiments, the subject disclosure provides physical characteristics of resistive switching devices that can have or can be fabricated to have stochastic or substantially stochastic characteristics. Further, these physical characteristics can produce measurably distinct qualities that differ among adjacent resistive switching devices on an array (or other suitable grouping), among different resistive switching devices on a semiconductor die, among different resistive switching devices on a wafer or multiple wafers, or the like, or combinations of the foregoing. In addition, physical characteristics that produce consistent measurements for a given resistive switching device or set of devices over multiple measurements, at different temperatures, or different operating conditions, etc., are provided. Accordingly, distinct data produced by these measurements can be reliably reproduced over many measurement cycles in various operating conditions. This in turn achieves a very low error rate in reproducing a distinct identifier sequence derived from resistive switching devices, as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Still other embodiments disclose a variety of measurably distinct qualities of resistive switching devices that can be utilized to generate distinct identifier data. Examples include original leakage current(s) of a device or group of devices, original electrical resistance of a device(s), original switching speed of a device(s), original program voltage of a device(s), differential program speed of groups of devices, differential program voltage(s) of groups of devices, as well as other examples disclosed herein or that may be known in the art, or reasonably conveyed to one of ordinary skill in the art by way of the context provided herein.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In still further embodiments, a measurement process utilized to generate identifier data from a resistive switching device can be rendered permanent to minimize or avoid error in regenerating the identifier data. For instance, a measurement process based in part or whole on a program event for a resistive switching device can include a process that renders the program event permanent for the resistive switching device. As one example, a program process suitable to form a one-time programmable resistive switching device can be utilized following a measurement process that associates identifier data with the program event for the resistive switching device. Making the resistive switching device one-time programmable facilitates great longevity in recalling the identifier data associated with the measurement process, even over many read cycles, over a large temperature range and other conditions (e.g., electromagnetic radiation in x-ray or gamma frequencies) that might perturb a program event of a resistive switching device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet additional embodiments, disclosed is an electronic device that facilitates post-fabrication generation of distinct (e.g., unique) identifier data for a semiconductor chip. The distinct identifier data can be derived from measurable processes associated with stochastic or substantially stochastic physical characteristics of resistive switching devices fabricated within the semiconductor chip. In some embodiments, the electronic device can facilitate a selection among multiple measurable processes of resistive switching devices for generating the identifier data for the semiconductor chip. In other embodiments, the electronic device can facilitate a selection of a subset of resistive switching devices on the semiconductor chip for the measurable processes. In still other embodiments, the electronic device can facilitate designation of different subsets of an array(s) of resistive switching devices for different purposes, including: rewritable non-volatile memory, one-time programmable (non-rewritable) memory, or identifier devices for generating the identifier data for the semiconductor chip. In still further embodiments, a combination of the foregoing can be provided by the electronic device. By allowing post-fabrication selection of portions of an array for generating the identifier data, the identifier data can be opaque even to a manufacturer of the semiconductor chip, providing a subsequent user (e.g., a purchaser, a licensee, a sub-licensee, etc.) with a great degree of reliability on the security of the identifier data, and resistance to unauthorized access, hacking, cloning or the like.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The following description and the drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects of the specification.

description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Introduction</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0039">One or more embodiments of the present disclosure leverage stochastic or substantially stochastic physical characteristics of nano-scale resistive switching devices to generate data. Being generally random, stochastic features of resistive switching devices can be leveraged to produce data that has little to no correlation among a population of such devices (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, infra). As a result, that data can be suited to applications requiring distinct or unique identification, such as identification and authorization applications pertaining to a device (e.g., a semiconductor die&#x2014;also referred to herein as a semiconductor chip&#x2014;or a semiconductor wafer, group(s) of dies, group(s) of wafers, an electronic device incorporating a semiconductor die(s), and so forth). Further, highly non-correlated data can also be utilized for security applications, such as random number generation, cryptography key generation applications, and the like.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition, various embodiments disclose resistive switching device processes utilized to generate high-entropic data sequences (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, infra) that meet or exceed scientific standards for randomness, and are comparable with high-quality cryptographic random number sources. Moreover, the switching device processes utilized to generate data sequences can be selected from native resistive switching devices (e.g., devices that have not previously been programmed, and are original or virgin devices post-fabrication) that most closely leverage nano-scale unclonable physical characteristics of the resistive switching devices. This achieves high non-correlation among devices on a die (intra-die), among dies on a wafer (inter-die) and among wafers in a fabrication facility, minimizing likelihood that a data sequence generated from resistive switching devices on a single die is repeated by other devices on that same die, or repeated by other resistive switching devices on a given wafer, or on different wafers.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Still further, disclosed resistive switching devices can be constructed among electromagnetically opaque metal lines of a semiconductor die (e.g., among backend-of-line wiring structures that are non-transparent to a fairly large portion of the electromagnetic imaging spectrum; visible light, UV light, infrared light, etc.) exacerbating the difficulty involved in illicit side-channel access techniques such as unauthorized device layer microscopy. In one or more additional embodiments, some disclosed sequence generation processes can be rendered permanent through one-time programmable processes, allowing a sequence to be reliably re-read over a very large number of read cycles to reliably and accurately reproduce a previously generated data sequence, achieving extremely low bit error rates (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, infra). In still further embodiments, disclosed processes for generating non-correlated data sequences can involve processes compatible with resistive switching device operation, allowing a set of resistive switching devices to be selected post-fabrication from any suitable subset of resistive switching devices on a chip. Systems and methods are further provided to export control of resistive switching device selection, data sequence process selection and process configuration&#x2014;associated with physically unclonable data sequence generation disclosed herein&#x2014;to a user of the chip post-fabrication. Various other embodiments will be readily apparent based on the disclosure herein and the associated drawings.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As utilized herein, the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; and other relative terms or terms of degree (e.g., about, approximately, substantially, and so forth) are intended to have the meaning specified explicitly in conjunction with their use herein, or a meaning which can be reasonably inferred by one ordinary skill in the art, or a reasonable variation of a specified quality(ies) or quantity(ies) that would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art by reference to this entire specification (including the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art as well as material incorporated by reference herein). As an example, a term of degree could refer to reasonable manufacturing tolerances about which a specified quality or quantity could be realized with fabrication equipment. Thus, as a specific illustration, though non-limiting, for an element of a resistive switching device expressly identified as having a dimension of about 50 angstroms (&#x212b;), the relative term &#x201c;about&#x201d; can mean reasonable variances about 50 A that one of ordinary skill in the art would anticipate the specified dimension of the element could be realized with commercial fabrication equipment, industrial fabrication equipment, laboratory fabrication equipment, or the like, and is not limited to a mathematically precise quantity (or quality). In other examples, a term of degree could mean a variance of +/&#x2212;0-3%, +/&#x2212;0-5%, or +/&#x2212;0-10% of a expressly stated value, where suitable to one of ordinary skill in the art to achieve a stated function or feature of an element disclosed herein. In still other examples, a term of degree could mean any suitable variance in quality(ies) or quantity(ies) that would be suitable to accomplish one or more explicitly disclosed function(s) or feature(s) of a disclosed element. Accordingly, the subject specification is by no means limited only to specific qualities and quantities disclosed herein, but includes all variations of specified quality(ies) or quantity(ies) reasonably conveyed to one of ordinary skill in the art by way of the context disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As the name implies, a two-terminal resistive switching device has two terminals or electrodes. Herein, the terms &#x201c;electrode&#x201d; and &#x201c;terminal&#x201d; are used interchangeably; moreover, a two-terminal resistive switching device includes a non-volatile two-terminal memory device as well as a volatile two-terminal switching device. Generally, a first electrode of a two-terminal resistive switching device is referred to as a &#x201c;top electrode&#x201d; (TE) and a second electrode of the two-terminal resistive switching device is referred to as a &#x201c;bottom electrode&#x201d; (BE), although it is understood that electrodes of two-terminal resistive switching devices can be according to any suitable arrangement, including a horizontal arrangement in which components of a memory cell are (substantially) side-by-side rather than overlying one another. Between the TE and BE of a two-terminal resistive switching device is typically an interface layer sometimes referred to as a switching layer, a resistive switching medium (RSM) or a resistive switching layer (RSL); such devices are not limited to these layers, however, as one or more barrier layer(s), adhesion layer(s), ion conduction layer(s), seed layer(s), particle source layer(s) or the like&#x2014;as disclosed herein, disclosed within a publication incorporated by reference herein, as generally understood and utilized in the art or reasonably conveyed to one of ordinary skill in the art by way of the context provided herein and its addition to the general understanding in the art or the incorporated publications&#x2014;may be included between or adjacent one or more of the TE, the BE or the interface layer consistent with suitable operation of such device.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Composition of memory cells, generally speaking, can vary per device with different components, materials or deposition processes selected to achieve desired characteristics (e.g., stoichiometry/non-stoichiometry, volatility/non-volatility, on/off current ratio, switching time, read time, memory durability, program/erase cycle, and so on). One example of a filamentary-based device can comprise: a conductive layer, e.g., metal, metal-alloy, metal-nitride, (e.g., comprising TiN, TaN, TiW, or other suitable metal compounds), an optional interface layer (e.g., doped p-type (or n-type) silicon (Si) bearing layer (e.g., a p-type or n-type Si bearing layer, p-type or n-type polysilicon, p-type or n-type polycrystalline SiGe, etc.)), a resistive switching layer (RSL) and an active metal-containing layer capable of being ionized. Under suitable conditions, the active metal-containing layer can provide filament-forming ions to the RSL. In such embodiments, a conductive filament (e.g., formed by the ions) can facilitate electrical conductivity through at least a subset of the RSL, and a resistance of the filament-based device can be determined, as one example, by a tunneling resistance between the filament and the conductive layer. A memory cell having such characteristics may be described as a filamentary-based device.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A RSL (which can also be referred to in the art as a resistive switching media (RSM)) can comprise, e.g., an undoped amorphous Si-containing layer, a semiconductor layer having intrinsic characteristics, a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric silicon nitride (e.g., SiN, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, SiN<sub>x</sub>, etc.), a Si sub-oxide (e.g., SiO<sub>x </sub>wherein x has a value between 0.1 and 2), a Si sub-nitride, a metal oxide, a metal nitride, a non-stoichiometric silicon compound, and so forth. Other examples of materials suitable for the RSL could include Si<sub>x</sub>Ge<sub>y</sub>O<sub>z </sub>(where x, y and z are respective suitable positive numbers), a silicon oxide (e.g., SiON, where N is a suitable positive number), a silicon oxynitride, an undoped amorphous Si (a-Si), amorphous SiGe (a-SiGe), TaOB (where B is a suitable positive number), HfOc (where C is a suitable positive number), TiOD (where D is a suitable number), AWE (where E is a suitable positive number) and so forth, a nitride (e.g., AlN, SiN), or a suitable combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, a RSL employed as part of a non-volatile memory device (non-volatile RSL) can include a relatively large number (e.g., compared to a volatile selector device) of material voids or defects to trap neutral metal particles (e.g., at low voltage) within the RSL. The large number of voids or defects can facilitate formation of a thick, stable structure of the neutral metal particles. In such a structure, these trapped particles can maintain the non-volatile memory device in a low resistance state in the absence of an external stimulus (e.g., electrical power), thereby achieving non-volatile operation. In other embodiments, a RSL employed for a volatile selector device (volatile RSL) can have very few material voids or defects for trapping particles. Because of the few particle-trapping voids/defects, a conductive filament formed in such an RSL can be quite thin (e.g., one to a few particles wide depending on field strength, particle material or RSL material, or a suitable combination of the foregoing), and unstable absent a suitably high external stimulus (e.g., an electric field, voltage, current, joule heating, or a suitable combination thereof). Moreover, the particles can be selected to have high surface energy, and good diffusivity within the RSL. This leads to a conductive filament that can form rapidly in response to a suitable stimulus, but also deform quite readily, e.g., in response to the external stimulus dropping below a deformation magnitude (which can be lower than a formation magnitude of the external stimulus associated with forming the volatile conductive filament, e.g., in response to a current flowing through the selector device; see U.S. Pat. No. 9,633,724 B2 hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and for all purposes). Note that a volatile RSL and conductive filament for the selector device can have different electrical characteristics than a conductive filament and non-volatile RSL for the non-volatile memory device. For instance, the selector device RSL can have higher material electrical resistance, and can have higher on/off current ratio, among others.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">An active metal-containing layer for a filamentary-based memory cell can include, among others: silver (Ag), gold (Au), titanium (Ti), titanium-nitride (TiN) or other suitable compounds of titanium, nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), chromium (Cr), tantalum(Ta), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), tungsten (W), vanadium (V), cobalt (Co), platinum (Pt), hafnium (Hf), and palladium (Pd). Other suitable conductive materials, as well as stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric: compounds, nitrides, oxides, alloys, mixtures or combinations of the foregoing or similar materials can be employed for the active metal-containing layer in some aspects of the subject disclosure. Further, a non-stoichiometric compound, such as a non-stoichiometric metal oxide/metal-oxygen or metal nitride/metal nitrogen (e.g., AlO<sub>x</sub>, AlN<sub>x</sub>, CuO<sub>x</sub>, CuN<sub>x</sub>, AgO<sub>x</sub>, AgN<sub>x</sub>, and so forth, where x is a suitable positive number or range of numbers, such as: 0&#x3c;x&#x3c;2, 0&#x3c;x&#x3c;3, 0&#x3c;x&#x3c;4 or other number/range of numbers depending on metal compound, which can have differing values for differing ones of the non-stoichiometric compounds) or other suitable metal compound can be employed for the active metal-containing layer, in at least one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one or more embodiments, a disclosed filamentary resistive switching device can include an active metal layer comprising a metal-nitrogen selected from the group consisting of: TiN<sub>x</sub>, TaN<sub>x</sub>, AlN<sub>x</sub>, CuN<sub>x</sub>, WN<sub>x </sub>and AgN<sub>x</sub>, where x is a positive number (or range of numbers) that can vary per metal-nitrogen material. In a further embodiment(s), the active metal layer can comprise a metal-oxygen selected from the group consisting of: TiO<sub>x</sub>, TaO<sub>x</sub>, AlO<sub>x</sub>, CuO<sub>x</sub>, WO<sub>x </sub>and AgO<sub>x </sub>where x is a positive number (or range of numbers) that can likewise vary per metal-oxygen material. In yet another embodiment(s), the active metal layer can comprise a metal oxygen-nitrogen selected from the group consisting of: TiO<sub>a</sub>N<sub>b</sub>, AlO<sub>a</sub>N<sub>b</sub>, CuO<sub>a</sub>N<sub>b</sub>, WO<sub>a</sub>N<sub>b </sub>and AgO<sub>a</sub>N<sub>b</sub>, where a and b are suitable positive numbers/ranges of numbers. The disclosed filamentary resistive switching device can further comprise a switching layer comprising a switching material selected from the group consisting of: SiO<sub>y</sub>, AlN<sub>y</sub>, TiO<sub>y</sub>, TaO<sub>y</sub>, AlO<sub>y</sub>, CuO<sub>y</sub>, TiN<sub>x</sub>, TiN<sub>y</sub>, TaN<sub>x</sub>, TaN<sub>y</sub>, SiO<sub>x</sub>, SiN<sub>y</sub>, AlN<sub>x</sub>, CuN<sub>x</sub>, CuN<sub>y</sub>, AgN<sub>x</sub>, AgN<sub>y</sub>, TiO<sub>x</sub>, TaO<sub>x</sub>, AlO<sub>x</sub>, CuO<sub>x</sub>, AgO<sub>x</sub>, and AgO<sub>y</sub>, where x and y are positive numbers (or ranges), and y is larger than x. Various combinations of the above are envisioned and contemplated within the scope of embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one example, a disclosed filamentary resistive switching device comprises a particle donor layer (e.g., the active metal-containing layer) comprising a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric metal compound (or mixture) and a resistive switching layer. In one alternative embodiment of this example, the particle donor layer comprises a metal-nitrogen: MN<sub>x</sub>, e.g., AgN<sub>x</sub>, TiN<sub>x</sub>, AlN<sub>x</sub>, etc., and the resistive switching layer comprises a metal-nitrogen: MN<sub>y</sub>, e.g., AgO<sub>y</sub>, TiO<sub>y</sub>, AlO<sub>y</sub>, and so forth, where y and x are positive numbers (or ranges), and in some cases y is larger than x. In an alternative embodiment of this example, the particle donor layer comprises a metal-oxygen: MO<sub>x</sub>, e.g., AgO<sub>x</sub>, TiO<sub>x</sub>, AlO<sub>x</sub>, and so on, and the resistive switching layer comprises a metal-oxygen: MO<sub>y</sub>, e.g., AgO<sub>y</sub>, TiO<sub>y</sub>, AlO<sub>y</sub>, or the like, where y and x are positive numbers (or ranges), and in some cases y is larger than x. In yet another alternative, the metal compound of the particle donor layer is a MN<sub>x </sub>(e.g., AgN<sub>x</sub>, TiN<sub>x</sub>, AlN<sub>x</sub>, etc.), and the resistive switching layer is selected from a group consisting of MO<sub>y </sub>(e.g., AgO<sub>y</sub>, TiO<sub>y</sub>, AlO<sub>y</sub>, etc.) and SiO<sub>y</sub>, where x and y are typically non-stoichiometric values, or vice versa in a still further embodiment.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As utilized herein, variables x, y, a, b, and so forth representative of values or ratios of one element with respect to another (or others) in a compound or mixture can have different values (or ranges) suitable for respective compounds/mixtures, and are not intended to denote a same or similar value or ratio among the compounds. Mixtures can refer to non-stoichiometric materials with free elements therein&#x2014;such as metal-rich nitride or oxide (metal-oxide/nitride with free metal atoms), metal-poor nitride or oxide (metal-oxide/nitride with free oxygen/nitrogen atoms)&#x2014;as well as other combinations of elements that do not form traditional stoichiometric compounds as understood in the art. Some details pertaining to embodiments of the subject disclosure can be found in the following U.S. patent applications that are licensed to the assignee of the present application for patent: application Ser. No. 11/875,541 filed Oct. 19, 2007 and application Ser. No. 12/575,921 filed Oct. 8, 2009; each of the foregoing patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their respective entireties and for all purposes in addition to those incorporated by reference elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">It should be appreciated that various embodiments herein may utilize a variety of memory cell technologies, having different physical properties. Such physical properties can be associated with a fabrication process or processes, and can have stochastic or substantially stochastic characteristics that mitigate or avoid replication or repetition among fabricated memory cells, even when made by the same process. As one example, one or more layers of a disclosed resistive switching device can have a root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of &#x3e;0.2 nm (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, infra), up to a maximum of about 10.0 nm surface roughness, in an embodiment. This results in random or near-random variation in layer thickness, including unpredictable changes in physical characteristics of such devices. In some theoretical models the RMS surface roughness can affect the geometry of a resistive switching material layer inducing stochastic or substantially stochastic variations in resistive switching devices properties such as: native or virgin (e.g., as fabricated) current conductance, program voltage, differential program voltage, program speed, differential program speed, among others disclosed throughout this specification. As further examples, different resistive-switching memory cells and cell technologies can have different discrete programmable resistances, different associated program/erase voltages, as well as other differentiating characteristics. In an embodiment, a resistive switching memory device resulting from a 28 nm photolithographic process with device size between about 50 nanometer (nm) width and about 130 nm width (e.g., about 100 nm width, about 56 nm width, about 75 nm width, about 128 nm width, and so forth) can be suitable to achieve stochastic physical characteristics disclosed herein. In other embodiments, a 22 nm photolithographic process producing a device size between 40 nm and 100 nm width (e.g., about 44 nm width, about 60 nm width, about 66 nm width, about 88 nm width, and so forth) can achieve stochastic physical characteristics.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Upon fabrication, disclosed resistive-switching devices can have native physical features generated from the fabrication process utilized to produce the resistive switching devices. These native physical features can have inherent stochastic or substantially stochastic properties that vary from resistive switching device to resistive switching device in a group of such devices (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C</figref>, infra), and can vary among devices in a die and among devices on a wafer or multiple wafers. As a result, minimal correlation in the native physical features among devices, dies, wafers and so forth, can yield minimal correlation between operational processes and data derived from such processes among devices, dies, wafers and so on. For instance, a native electrical resistance of a resistive switching layer (RSL) can depend at least in part on these non-correlated physical features and can vary from device to device even for adjacent devices in a single array on a single die (and, as previously stated, among multiple dies, wafers, and so on). Further, a current flow through the RSL in a native un-programmed state, a program voltage in the native un-programmed state, a program speed in the native un-programmed state, differential program voltage/current/speed in the native un-programmed state, and so on, can vary among resistive switching devices. Processes disclosed herein for forming resistive switching devices and for leveraging stochastic or substantially stochastic physically unclonable features of resistive switching devices can provide excellent non-correlated data sequences.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As utilized herein, the term &#x201c;native&#x201d;, &#x201c;original&#x201d;, &#x201c;virgin&#x201d; or the like refers to post-fabrication but pre-commercial operation of resistive switching devices on a semiconductor die. Native (and like terminology) need not exclude some or all post-fabrication operations such as quality testing or other verification routines performed by a manufacturer, and even some pre-commercial operation by a non-manufacturer such as testing to ensure manufacturer quality specifications are met by a chip, chip setup routines or configuration routines (e.g., defining one-time programmable memory or identifier memory within an array of resistive switching memory; see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, infra), among others. In general a resistive switching device is in a native state, as utilized herein, if it has not yet received a stimulus (e.g., electrical, thermal, magnetic, or a like stimulus known in the art, suitable combinations thereof, and so forth) suitable to form a conductive filament within the resistive switching device and change the resistive switching device from an electrically resistive state to an electrically conductive state as described herein or known in the art.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Some embodiments of the subject disclosure can employ a bipolar switching device that exhibits a first switching response (e.g., programming to one of a set of program states) to an electrical signal of a first polarity and a second switching response (e.g., erasing to an erase state) to the electrical signal having a second polarity. The bipolar switching device is contrasted, for instance, with a unipolar device that exhibits both the first switching response (e.g., programming) and the second switching response (e.g., erasing) in response to electrical signals having the same polarity and different magnitudes.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In various embodiments, filamentary-based resistance switching devices can operate in a bipolar fashion, behaving differently in response to different polarity (or direction, energy flow, energy source orientation, etc.) external stimuli. For the volatile filamentary-based selector device, as an illustrative example, in response to a first polarity stimulus exceeding a first threshold voltage (or set of voltages), the filamentary selector device can change to a second resistance state from a first resistance state. Moreover, in response to a second polarity stimulus exceeding a second threshold voltage(s), the filamentary selector device can change to a third state from the first state. In some embodiments, the third state can be substantially the same as the first state, having the same or similar measurably distinct characteristic (e.g., electrical conductivity, and so forth), having the same or similar magnitude of threshold stimulus (though of opposite polarity or direction), or the like. In other embodiments, the third state can be distinct from the second state, either in terms of the measurable characteristic (e.g., different electrical conductivity value in response to the reverse polarity as compared to the forward polarity) or in terms of threshold stimulus associated with transitioning out of the first state (e.g., a different magnitude of positive voltage required to transition to the second state, compared to a magnitude of negative voltage required to transition to the third state).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">For bipolar operation of a non-volatile filamentary-based memory cell, a conductive path or a filament forms through a non-volatile RSL in response to a suitable program voltage applied across the memory cell. In particular, upon application of a programming voltage, metallic ions are generated from the active metal-containing layer and migrate into the non-volatile RSL layer. The metallic ions can occupy voids or defect sites within the non-volatile RSL layer. In some embodiments, upon removal of the bias voltage, the metallic ions become neutral metal particles and remain trapped in voids or defects of the non-volatile RSL layer. When sufficient particles become trapped, a filament is formed and the memory cell switches from a relatively high resistive state, to a relatively low resistive state.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some disclosed embodiments, completion of a conductive filament can involve only a few particles (e.g., atoms, ions, conductive compounds, etc.) of conductive material, or less. As one particular example, an electrically continuous conductive filament could be established by position of 1-3 atoms at a boundary of a switching layer, whereas repositioning of one or more of these atoms can break that electrical continuity, in some embodiments. Because the scale is so small between a completed filament and non-completed filament, illicit side-channel attempts to read bits of memory&#x2014;for example through high intensity microscopy&#x2014;can be very difficult, if not impossible due to the difficulty of imaging such small particles and determining whether their location is sufficient to establish electrical continuity. Still further, disclosed resistive switching devices can be formed among metal lines of a semiconductor chip (e.g., among backend-of-line wiring layers). The density of metal wiring layers further occludes visibility of the resistive switching devices, making common side-channel techniques unprofitable.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Once a conductive filament is formed, trapped conductive particles provide the conductive path or filament through the non-volatile RSL layer, and the resistance is typically determined by a tunneling resistance between one or more such particles and an electrical conductive material adjacent to the non-volatile RSL layer. In some resistive-switching devices, an erase process can be implemented to deform the conductive filament, at least in part, causing the memory cell to return to the high resistive state from the low resistive state. More specifically, upon application of an erase bias voltage, the metallic particles trapped in voids or defects of the non-volatile RSL become mobile ions and migrate back towards the active metal layer, or disassociate within the RSL (or a combination of the foregoing) to break electrical conductivity of the conductive filament through the RSL layer. This change of state, in the context of memory, can be associated with respective states of a binary bit. For an array of multiple memory cells, a word(s), byte(s), page(s), block(s), etc., of memory cells can be programmed or erased to represent zeroes or ones of binary information, and by retaining those states over time in effect storing the binary information. In various embodiments, multi-level information (e.g., multiple bits) may be stored in such memory cells.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Where no specific memory cell technology or program/erase voltage is specified for the various aspects and embodiments herein, it is intended that such aspects and embodiments incorporate any suitable memory cell technology and be operated by program/erase voltages appropriate to that technology, as would be known by one of ordinary skill in the art or made known to one of ordinary skill by way of the context provided herein. It should be appreciated further that where substituting a different memory cell technology would require circuit modifications that would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art, or changes to operating signal levels that would be known to one of such skill, embodiments comprising the substituted memory cell technology(ies) or signal level changes are considered within the scope of the subject disclosure.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As mentioned above, applying a program voltage (also referred to as a &#x201c;program pulse&#x201d;) to one of the electrodes of the two-terminal memory can cause a conductive filament to form in an interface layer (e.g., a RSL). By convention and as generally described herein, the TE receives the program pulse and the BE is grounded (or held at lower voltage or opposite polarity compared to the program pulse), but such is not intended to be limiting for all embodiments. Conversely, applying an &#x201c;erase pulse&#x201d; to one of the electrodes (generally a pulse of opposite polarity as the program pulse or to the opposite electrode as the program pulse) can break continuity of the filament, e.g., by driving the metal particles or other material that forms the filament back toward the active metal source. Properties of this conductive filament as well as its presence or absence affect the electrical characteristics of the two-terminal memory cell such as, for example, lowering the resistance and/or increasing conductance across the two terminals when the conductive filament is present as opposed to when not present.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Following program or erase pulses, a read pulse can be asserted. This read pulse is typically lower in magnitude relative to program or erase pulses and typically insufficient to affect the conductive filament and/or change the state of the two-terminal memory cell. By applying a read pulse to one of the electrodes of the two-terminal memory, a measured current (e.g., I<sub>on</sub>) when compared to a predetermined threshold current can be indicative of the conductive state of the two-terminal memory cell. The threshold current can be preset based on expected current values in different states (e.g., high resistance state current; respective currents of one or more low resistance states, and so forth) of the two-terminal memory device, suitable for a given two-terminal memory technology. For example, when the conductive filament has been formed (e.g., in response to application of a program pulse), the conductance of the cell is greater than otherwise and the measured current (e.g., I<sub>on</sub>) reading in response to the read pulse will be greater. On the other hand, when the conductive filament is removed (e.g., in response to application of an erase pulse), the resistance of the cell is high because the interface layer has a relatively high electrical resistance, so the conductance of the cell is lower and the measured current (e.g., I<sub>off</sub>) reading in response to the read pulse will be lower. By convention, when the conductive filament is formed, the memory cell is said to be in the &#x201c;on-state&#x201d; with a high conductance. When the conductive filament is not extant, the memory cell is said to be in the &#x201c;off-state&#x201d;. A memory cell being in the on-state or the off-state can be logically mapped to binary values such as, e.g., &#x201c;1&#x201d; and &#x201c;0&#x201d;. It is understood that conventions used herein associated with the state of the cell or the associated logical binary mapping are not intended to be limiting, as other conventions, including an opposite convention can be employed in connection with the disclosed subject matter. Techniques detailed herein are described and illustrated in connection with single-level cell (SLC) memory, but it is understood that the disclosed techniques can also be utilized for multi-level cell (MLC) memory in which a single memory cell can retain a set of measurably distinct states that represent multiple bits of information.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">By mapping digital information to non-volatile resistance states of a two-terminal memory cell, digital information can be stored at such device. An electronic device containing many of these two-terminal memory cells can likewise store significant quantities of data. High density arrays are configured to contain as many memory cells as possible for a given area of chip space, thereby maximizing data storage capacity of a memory chip, or system-on-chip device.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Two general conventions are utilized for two-terminal memory formed at intersections of metal lines within a wafer (e.g., a crossbar array). A first convention is the 1T1R memory array, in which each memory cell is isolated from electrical effects (e.g., current, including leak path current(s)) of surrounding circuitry by an associated transistor. A second convention is the 1TnR memory array (n being a positive number greater than one), where a group of multiple memory cells is isolated from electrical effects of surrounding circuitry by one (or more) transistors. In the 1T1R context, individual memory cells can be configured to have high current suppression between memory cells, significantly reducing leakage path currents for the 1T1R memory array. In the 1TnR context, many individual memory cells having high device density in a given amount of silicon space can be connected to a single transistor that has much lower density. Accordingly, the 1TnR context facilitates higher bit densities for resistive memory cells on a semiconductor chip.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Overview</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of an example integrated circuit device <b>100</b> for an electronic device according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.

Use of static random access memory (SRAM) for generating identifier sequence data has met with fairly high bit error rate (BER), from 3% to 15% depending on implementation. To reduce BER associated with SRAM identifier sequence generation, complicated circuitry is coupled to the SRAM bits upon fabrication. This permanently fixes the SRAM bits that can be utilized for identifier sequence generation, and further adds significant hardware overhead to a semiconductor die. Disclosed resistive switching devices can generate identifier sequence data with extremely low BER (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, infra). Accordingly, embodiments disclosed herein provide circuitry and processes utilized for memory operations of the resistive switching devices (e.g., for storing data, for reading data, for rewriting data, etc.) and extend them to generating identifier sequence data. In such embodiments, resistive switching devices utilized for memory operations, identifier data or OTP storage need not be fixed on manufacture, and instead can be dynamically exposed for selection and re-configuration (e.g., by way of controller <b>160</b>) post-fabrication.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition to the foregoing, disclosed resistive switching devices have excellent properties for generating identifier data sequences. Such properties include high entropy, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, infra, for generating random or substantially random numbers, low BER, inherent difficulty in reverse engineering or illicit side-channel data access, and fast sensing times. For example, a bit sequence of 128 or 256 identifier bits (also referred to herein as physical unclonable feature (or PUF) bits) can be formed from 128 or 256 resistive switching devices (as described herein) or 128/256 groups of multiple such resistive switching devices (as described in differential identifier bit generation, herein). High randomness in generating identifier bits minimizes non-random patterns between bits (resistive switching devices/groups of such devices) of a sequence, mitigating or avoiding false rejection rates. In addition, high randomness enhances security margin by minimizing hamming distance values for multiple read operations of an identifier sequence on a single die (intra-HD; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) and providing an ideal gaussian distribution of hamming distance values among multiple dies of resistive switching devices. This can increase a total number of semiconductor chips that can achieve distinct identifier sequences for a given sequence bit count, even with high security margin (e.g., defined by a number of distinct bits between each sequence utilized for identifying a single die).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one or more embodiments, controller <b>160</b> can be operable to perform memory operations on array of RS devices <b>105</b>. For instance, controller <b>160</b> can be operable to perform sensing operations pertaining to generating an identifier data bit from one (or a group of) resistive switching device(s) allocated to identifier devices <b>120</b>, in an embodiment(s). Examples of sensing operations pertaining to generating an identifier bit can include: native current (of an un-programmed resistive switching device, also called leak current), native electrical resistance of a resistive switching device, detection of program events, detection of speed or timing of program events, a program voltage, a program current, an on-state (programmed) resistance, an erase voltage or current, a delay frequency, a parasitic resistance or capacitance, a program or erase minimum pulse width, and so forth, or suitable combinations of the foregoing, described throughout this specification. In other embodiments, controller <b>160</b> can be operable to perform a program operation(s) pertaining to generating an identifier data bit from one or more resistive switching devices allocated to identifier devices <b>120</b>, in further embodiments. Examples of such program operations include: native program voltage, native program speed, native program current, and so forth. In still other embodiments, controller <b>160</b> can be configured to implement differential operations pertaining to generating an identifier bit from a plurality of resistive switching devices. Differential operations usable to generate an identifier bit according to aspects of the present disclosure can include: differential program speed, differential native program voltage, differential native (leak) current, differential native electrical resistance, differential on-state resistance, differential erase voltage or current, differential delay frequency, differential parasitic resistance or capacitance, a differential program or erase minimum pulse width, or the like, or a suitable combination of the foregoing (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>12</b></figref>, infra).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In yet other embodiments, controller <b>160</b> can be operable to selectively implement one-time programmable operations on selected identifier devices <b>120</b> to render permanent an identifier bit sequence generated with a program event (e.g., native program voltage, native program speed, differential program speed, differential program voltage, etc.). In still additional embodiments, controller <b>160</b> can be operable to establish one or more threshold metric levels (e.g., current level(s), resistance level(s), program voltage level(s), program speed level(s), etc.) for defining identifier bit values (e.g., logic levels; a &#x2018;0&#x2019; bit and a &#x2018;1&#x2019; bit in the binary context) from sensing operations or program operations performed on identifier devices <b>120</b>, as described herein. As an illustrative example, if an operational characteristic selected to generate identifier bit data is a native leak current, a current value threshold (or small range of values) (e.g., 500 nA, or any other suitable value or range) can be selected and resistive switching devices above the current value threshold can be allocated a &#x2018;1&#x2019; identifier bit value and devices below the current value threshold can be allocated a &#x2018;0&#x2019; identifier bit value. In other embodiments, a range of threshold values with a lower threshold and an upper threshold (e.g., a lower threshold of 400 nA and an upper threshold of 600 nA, or any other suitable threshold value or range of values) can be utilized. Devices with native current below 400 nA can be allocated a &#x2018;0&#x2019; identifier bit value; devices with native current above 600 nA can be allocated a &#x2018;1&#x2019; identifier bit value, and devices between 400 nA and 600 nA can be discarded, in an embodiment. In an embodiment, further read operations can use a 500 nA threshold to regenerate the &#x2018;0&#x2019; bit values and &#x2018;1&#x2019; bit values. Using lower and higher initial threshold values can increase sensing margin and reduce bit error rates, according to embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">It should be appreciated that a suitable threshold or set of thresholds can be established for other resistive switching device operational characteristics selected for generating identifier bits information. As another (non-limited) illustrative example, a logic level 0 can be associated with a program voltage of 2 volts or higher and a logic level 1 associated with a program voltage of 1.8 volts or below. As stated previously, other suitable thresholds can be used to define logic level values for identifier bits as disclosed herein. In some embodiments, when a large number of resistive switching devices are sensed as part of generating identifier bits, a threshold voltage, current, pulse width etc., can be selected such that approximately half of the devices become associated with a logic level 0 and another half become associated with a logic level 1. In some embodiments, threshold settings can be performed manually by way of controller <b>160</b>; in other embodiments default threshold settings can be set upon initializing a semiconductor chip.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In further embodiments, an operational characteristic or program event utilized to generate an identifier bit sequence can be selected to have the same or substantially the same measurement over time, over many read cycles and at a range of temperatures common to semiconductor chips. This leads to very low bit error rate for disclosed identifier bit sequences (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, infra). As an illustrative example, a native leak current (or other physical unclonable characteristic) for a resistive switching device measured for the first time on day 1 at room temperature can measure the same or substantially the same (e.g., relative to a constant native leak current threshold) five years later, at 100 degrees C. after a million read operations. Values of the resistance switching device can be determined upon demand by controller <b>160</b>. As another illustrative example, to determine an electrical resistance of a resistive switching device, a current source can be applied to the resistive switching device, a voltage drop measured and resistance calculated. Other techniques for measuring or determining physical characteristics of resistive switching devices known in the art or reasonably conveyed to one of ordinary skill in the art are considered within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In addition to the foregoing, controller <b>160</b> can be configured to define an arrangement or ordering of resistive switching devices (or groups of resistive switching devices) to create a multi-bit sequence of identifier bits. As one illustrative example, resistive switching devices 0:7 can be read and assigned to bits 0:7 of a bit sequence. In other embodiments, the bit sequence need not be derived from resistive switching devices arrayed in a particular order. As an example, from an ordinal line of resistive switching devices, devices <b>15</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>37</b>, <b>19</b> can be read and respectively assigned to bits 0:7 of an output bit string. The big string can be of any selected length. For instance, bit strings of 64 bits, 256 bits, 1024 bits, 64 kbits, or any other suitable subset of identifier devices <b>120</b> up to all of identifier devices <b>120</b> (which can include all of array of RS devices <b>105</b> in at least some embodiments) may be employed for a bit string. As another non-limiting illustration, for a 256-bit identifier sequence, controller <b>160</b> can define an ordering of identifier devices <b>120</b>/groups of identifier devices <b>120</b> to correspond with a sequence of 256 bits.

Moreover, the term &#x201c;block&#x201d; is not intended to limit the number, position, layout or spatial orientation of groups of resistive switching devices that may be allocated to a selectable block <b>210</b>. Rather, the term &#x201c;block&#x201d; is merely intended to represent a selectable grouping of any suitable subset of resistive switching devices within array of RS devices <b>205</b>, subject only to physical limitations of circuitry layout (if any) and operational access to a group of resistive switching devices that may be instituted upon manufacture of a semiconductor die containing array of RS devices <b>205</b>. However, where two-terminal resistive switching devices that are bit addressable are employed within array of RS devices <b>205</b>, no such limitation need apply, and any suitable selection, grouping, concatenation, etc., of resistive switching devices can be defined as a selectable block <b>210</b> by way of controller <b>160</b> in such embodiments.

Suitable combinations of the foregoing can be implemented in yet other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Controller <b>160</b> can receive input (e.g., by way of input(s) <b>140</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, supra or via another command path&#x2014;not depicted) of a selection of resistive switching devices to assign as a group. The selection can include any suitable number of resistive switching devices, including regular or non-regular shaped groupings, non-shaped groupings, contiguous and non-contiguous resistive switching devices, or the like, or a suitable combination of the foregoing. Thus, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a rectangular block of identifier devices <b>120</b> within array of RS devices <b>205</b>, it should be understood that different subsets of array of RS devices <b>205</b> can be defined selected as identifier devices <b>120</b> instead.

In some embodiments, controller <b>160</b> can facilitate defining or re-defining selectable blocks following operation of array of RS devices <b>205</b>. For instance, pre-operation groupings of devices as identifier devices <b>120</b>, OTP devices <b>130</b>, or resistive switching devices <b>110</b> can be modified during operational life of a chip or electronic device containing array of RS devices <b>205</b>, in one or more embodiments, and where permitted by physical constraints of the resistive switching devices employed for array of RS devices <b>205</b>. In general, devices programmed to OTP operation to store data as OTP data usually cannot be erased and thus cannot be re-purposed to a non-OTP operation. However, this is subject to technology capabilities of resistive switching devices employed for array of RS devices <b>205</b>; for instance, where an OTP device can be re-purposed following OTP programming, such rededication can be effected by controller <b>160</b> in at least one embodiment.

This is because a fixed set of bits within array of RS devices <b>205</b> for generating identifier data adds no additional ambiguity to the physical location where the identifier data is contained (or generated). As a result, a hacker intending to illicitly acquire the identifier data could target the precise portion of array of RS devices <b>205</b> for illicit side-channel read operations, such as high intensity microscopy (e.g., using high-magnification electromagnetic technology&#x2014;whether visible, infrared or UV&#x2014;to image the physical nature of identifier bits to see whether they are in a programmed or unprogrammed state). Compromising security of a chip need not even require the chip itself to succeed; some hacking operations merely require the identifier data in order to pass off an illicit chip as the chip associated with the identifier data. In this case, the hacker does not even care if portions of array of RS devices <b>205</b> are physically destroyed in the process of side-channel access (or even if most of the chip is destroyed); as long as the identifier data is accurately extracted, the hack succeeds. In contrast, when the portion of the resistive switching devices allocated to identifier devices <b>120</b> is unknown, hacking techniques cannot target the precise subset of bits that contain the identifier data. Thus, even having a manufacturer's layout of array of RS devices <b>205</b> as-fabricated is insufficient to determine which bits contain the identifier data; even the manufacturer of the chip itself will not know this information. Moreover destroying a few bits of array of RS devices <b>205</b> can effectively destroy the identifier data if those destroyed bits contain a portion of the identifier data, effectively foiling the hack attempt. Accordingly, providing controller <b>160</b> with the capacity to export selection of identifier bits <b>120</b> post-fabrication, and particularly allowing selection of different sizes of identifier bits, different locations of identifier bits within array of RS devices <b>205</b>, non-contiguous groups of identifier bits and even irregular shaped or non-shape groupings of identifier bits significantly compounds the difficulty associated with illicit access of identifier data generated by array of RS devices <b>205</b> as described herein.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of an example resistive switching device layer stack <b>300</b> according to further embodiments of the present disclosure.

Based upon ranges of manufacturing tolerance at least some of these characteristics of resistive switching devices can have very low cross-correlation among resistive switching devices in an array, or switching devices on a die (intra-device), among dies in a wafer, or among wafers (inter-device).

Rather, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C</figref> illustrate filaments of conductive particles (referred to hereinafter as conductive filaments <b>402</b>B, <b>402</b>C) formed within switching layers <b>324</b> of devices <b>320</b>B and <b>320</b>C. Because electrical conductivity through switching layers <b>324</b> can be defined primarily by electrical continuity (or at least electron tunneling-based continuity) between conductive filament <b>402</b>B and conductive material <b>322</b>, a resistance state of devices <b>320</b>B, <b>320</b>C can also primarily be defined by electrical continuity of a conductive filament. Conductive filament <b>402</b>B represents an electrically continuous path between particle donor layer <b>326</b> and conductive layer <b>322</b> through switching layer <b>324</b> of device <b>320</b>B, causing device <b>320</b>B to be in a low resistance (or programmed) resistive state. In contrast, conductive filament <b>402</b>C represents an electrically dis-continuous path between particle donor layer <b>326</b> and conductive layer <b>322</b> of device <b>320</b>C, causing device <b>320</b>C to be in a high resistance (or erased, or non-programmed) resistive state. In the example depicted by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C</figref>, these respective continuity states are determined by only a pair of conductive particles <b>404</b>B and <b>404</b>C. For conductive filament <b>402</b>B, particles <b>404</b>B complete continuity between conductive filament <b>402</b>B and conductive material <b>322</b>, whereas for conductive filament <b>402</b>C, particles <b>404</b>C do not complete continuity between conductive filament <b>402</b>C and conductive material <b>322</b>. The position of these two particles <b>404</b>B, <b>404</b>C in these examples therefore is determinative of the resistive state of devices <b>320</b>B and <b>320</b>C. These figures illustrate the difficulty of side-channel reading of filamentary-based resistive switching devices. Because only a few atomic/molecular particles may be needed to complete or break continuity, thereby causing one state or another state, illicit techniques to determine the resistance state, such as high-intensity microscopy, can be very difficult. This can be further exacerbated when devices <b>320</b>B and <b>320</b>C are formed between metal wiring layers (e.g., as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, supra) due to the density of metal materials typically employed for backend-of-line wiring structures.

Hamming distance represents a minimum deviation between uniquely identifiable bit sequences (e.g., two sequences in which at least one bit of the respective sequences is different). The blue graph lists hamming distance of identifier sequence data generated by resistive switching device techniques disclosed herein, between different semiconductor dies.

The red line indicates intra-hamming devices for multiple reads of an identifier sequence on a single die. Ideal intra-HD for a single die is 0.0, which is the case when the data sequence is read identically every time, producing a bit error rate (BER) of zero. Existing structures utilized to generate identifier data such as SRAM have very high native bit error rates, resulting in intra-HD values significantly larger than 0.0. This decreases the security margin differentiating intra-HD from inter-HD, increasing the likelihood that a read error overlaps with an identifier sequence of another semiconductor die, destroying identifier uniqueness. For resistive switching devices, the intra-HD is effectively 0.0 providing excellent security margin and minimizing BER and maximizing identifier sequence uniqueness over many read cycles.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts an example chart of spatial randomness <b>600</b> for identifier data generated from disclosed resistive switching devices according to further embodiments of the present disclosure.

In the differential grouping <b>900</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, pairs of resistive switching devices are allocated to a single identifier bit (e.g., by a controller, such as controller <b>160</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Also as illustrated in the differential grouping <b>900</b> each pair of resistive switching devices grouped into a single identifier bit <b>902</b>, <b>902</b>A, <b>902</b>B are adjacent resistive switching devices on a common wordline, such as wordline<b>0</b> <b>910</b> through wordlineN <b>912</b>, where N is a suitable integer greater than 0. Thus, for instance, the bottom right identifier bit <b>902</b> includes resistive switching device<b>1</b> <b>904</b> and an adjacent resistive switching device<b>2</b> <b>906</b> on wordlineN <b>912</b>. Each resistive switching device <b>904</b>, <b>906</b> can be connected at one terminal to a bitline <b>936</b>, <b>938</b> and at a second end to a sourceline <b>926</b>, <b>928</b> by way of a respective transistor <b>908</b>.

In other words, when wordlineN <b>912</b> has a high voltage and activates transistors <b>908</b>, resistive switching devices <b>904</b>, <b>906</b> are connected to sourcelines <b>926</b>, <b>928</b> respectively. In contrast, when wordlineN <b>912</b> has a low voltage and deactivates transistors <b>908</b>, resistive switching devices <b>904</b>, <b>906</b> are disconnected from sourcelines <b>926</b>, <b>928</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">A bit value of each identifier bit <b>902</b>, <b>902</b>A, <b>902</b>B can be determined from a selected differential characteristic of the resistive switching devices defined for each identifier bit <b>902</b>, <b>902</b>A, <b>902</b>B. If a first resistive switching device (e.g., defined by controller <b>160</b>) of the pair of resistive switching devices <b>904</b>, <b>906</b> has a first threshold characteristic, identifier bit <b>902</b> can have a first binary value (e.g., a &#x2018;0&#x2019; value). In contrast, if the second resistive switching device (e.g., defined by controller <b>160</b>) of the pair of resistive switching devices <b>904</b>, <b>906</b> has the first threshold characteristic, identifier bit <b>902</b> can have a second binary value (e.g., a &#x2018;1&#x2019; value). Example differential characteristics can include: program speed (e.g., which device is the first device to become programmed in response to a program voltage determines whether identifier bit <b>902</b> is &#x2018;0&#x2019; or &#x2018;1&#x2019;), program voltage (e.g., device<b>1</b> <b>904</b> having a higher program voltage than device<b>2</b> <b>906</b> determines a &#x2018;0&#x2019;, or vice versa determines a &#x2018;1&#x2019;), native current (e.g., device<b>1</b> <b>904</b> having higher native current than device<b>2</b> <b>906</b> determines a &#x2018;0&#x2019;, or vice versa determines a &#x2018;1&#x2019;), native electrical resistance (e.g., device<b>1</b> <b>904</b> having higher native resistance than device<b>2</b> <b>906</b> determines a &#x2018;0&#x2019;, or vice versa determines a &#x2018;1&#x2019;), or the like, or a suitable combination of the foregoing. In an embodiment, once a differential program-related event establishes a value of identifier bit <b>902</b>, the device that was first to program (or that had higher or lower program voltage, as determined at controller <b>160</b>) can be set to one-time programmable programming to enable the identifier bit to be re-read many many times with little to no error rate.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In at least one embodiment, differential characteristics of resistive switching devices defined for each identifier bit <b>902</b>, <b>902</b>A, <b>902</b>B can be utilized to generate multi-bit binary data for the identifier bits. In one embodiment, larger groups of resistive switching devices can be grouped into respective identifier bits <b>902</b> to achieve multi-bit binary values. For instance, four resistive switching devices can be grouped to identifier bit <b>902</b> to achieve a dual-bit identifier data (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>, infra). In another embodiment, however, a controller (e.g., controller <b>160</b>) can instead establish multiple states for pairs of resistive switching devices <b>904</b>, <b>906</b> to achieve multi-bit binary information. For instance, a threshold native current (or range(s) of native currents) can be established and native current values of pairs of resistive switching devices <b>904</b>, <b>906</b> can be utilized to define four (or more) differential states, which can be correlated to dual-bit (or higher) binary data. As an example, four differential states can be defined to include: a zeroth state in which both devices <b>904</b>, <b>906</b> have less than a threshold native current (e.g., 500 nA), a first state in which device <b>904</b> has less than the threshold native current and device <b>906</b> has more than the threshold native current, a second state in which device <b>906</b> has less than the threshold current and device <b>904</b> has more than the threshold current, and a third state in which both devices <b>904</b>, <b>906</b> have more than the threshold current. Measuring native current of pairs of devices <b>904</b>, <b>906</b> can therefore be utilized to generate a dual-bit binary value for identifier bit <b>902</b>. As yet another example, multiple threshold current values can be defined relative to native current values of pairs of devices <b>904</b>, <b>906</b> to achieve even high multi-bit numbers. For instance, two native current thresholds (500 nA, 550 nA) can define three native current states (a less than 500 nA current state; a between 500 nA and 550 nA current state; and a greater than 550 nA current state) for each of the pairs of devices <b>904</b>, <b>906</b>. Three native current states measured with respect to two resistive switching devices <b>904</b>, <b>906</b> can produce 2<sup>3 </sup>differential states, enabling the definition of tri-bit binary data for identifier bit <b>902</b>, and so forth. In various embodiments, combinations of larger numbers of resistive switching devices <b>904</b>, <b>906</b> and multiple measurement thresholds can be utilized to achieve larger numbers of differential states, where 2<sup># of differential states </sup>defines the number of binary bits that can be correlated to a single identifier bit <b>902</b>, <b>902</b>A, <b>902</b>B.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of an example array of resistive switching devices providing an alternative definition of differential grouping <b>1000</b> of identifier bits <b>902</b>, <b>1002</b>, <b>1010</b> according to alternative or additional embodiments of the present disclosure. Differential grouping <b>1000</b> can define multiple non-adjacent resistive switching devices on a wordline as a single identifier group.

Particularly, differential grouping <b>1200</b> allows grouping of resistive switching devices on different bitlines as well as different wordlines into an identifier group. For instance, identifier bit <b>1202</b> includes resistive switching devices on bitlines <b>930</b>, <b>932</b> and wordlines <b>910</b>, <b>912</b>.

It should be appreciated that any regular or irregular grouping of resistive switching devices into an identifier bit(s) can also be accomplished according to various embodiments of the present disclosure, and the scope of the disclosure is not limited to those explicitly depicted. Moreover, identifier bits <b>1202</b>, <b>1210</b>, <b>1220</b> incorporate four resistive switching devices each.
