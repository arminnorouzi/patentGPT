In the specific context of pulmonary valve replacement, for example, U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2003/0199971 A1 and 2003/0199963 A1, both filed by Tower, et al. and incorporated herein by reference, describe a valved segment of bovine jugular vein, mounted within an expandable stent, for use as a replacement pulmonary valve. The replacement valve is mounted on a balloon catheter and delivered percutaneously via the vascular system to the location of the failed pulmonary valve and expanded by the balloon to compress the native valve leaflets against the right ventricular outflow tract, thereby anchoring and sealing the replacement valve. As described in the articles: &#x201c;Percutaneous Insertion of the Pulmonary Valve&#x201d;, Bonhoeffer, et al., Journal of the American College of Cardiology 2002; 39: 1664-1669 and &#x201c;Transcatheter Replacement of a Bovine Valve in Pulmonary Position&#x201d;, Bonhoeffer, et al., Circulation 2000; 102: 813-816, both incorporated herein by reference in their entireties, the replacement pulmonary valve may be implanted to replace native pulmonary valves or prosthetic pulmonary valves located in valved conduits.

Unfortunately, the most common groups of patients requiring pulmonary valve replacement are adults and children who have previously undergone transannular patch repair of tetralogy of Fallot during infancy, which left them with right ventricular outflow tracts that are larger than 22 mm in diameter. Thus, typical venous segments cannot typically be securely implanted within these patients.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates one example of a prior art adapter stent <b>10</b> that has been developed to allow the use of valved segments of bovine jugular veins in a patient with these large right ventricular outflow tracts.

In one particular embodiment, the invention is intended to provide a mechanism that allows the use of valved segments of veins (e.g., bovine jugular veins) as replacement pulmonary valves in patients having large right ventricular outflow tracts. However, the invention may also be useful in conjunction with other replacement valves, such as are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,719,789 and 5,480,424, issued to Cox, or with other valves that comprise pericardial tissue, nitinol, and/or polymers, for other examples. It is further contemplated that segments of porcine or equine veins can be used in conjunction with the devices of the present invention and that mechanical valves can also be used.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention accomplishes the above-described objectives by providing an expandable adapter stent having a configuration which, when expanded, has an outer wall that is sufficiently large to engage and seal against the inner wall of a vessel at the desired implant site. The adapter stent further includes an internal opening that has a smaller size than the outer wall of the adapter stent. In one embodiment, this internal opening is generally cylindrical such that a wall of this internal opening extends along the length of the adapter stent and has an inner diameter that generally corresponds to the outer diameter of a valved venous segment or other replacement valve that is or will be positioned therein.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one configuration of the invention, a valved venous segment or other replacement valve is positioned within the internal section or opening of an adapter stent prior to implant. In a second configuration, a valved venous segment or other replacement valve is placed in the internal opening of an adapter stent after a previous implant of the adapter stent. In the latter configuration, the replacement valve may itself be mounted in an expandable valve stent, as described in the above cited Tower, et al., applications and Bonhoeffer, et al. articles.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The stents employed in the invention may either be self-expanding stents, such as the type that may be constructed of nitinol or another shape memory material, or may be stents that are expandable by a device such as a balloon. In the embodiments discussed below, an adapter stent of the invention is provided as a tubular structure made of a liquid impermeable outer structure with an internal space for enclosing a substance, such as liquid or gel materials, for an extended period of time. In this way, all blood flow will be directed through the internal section or opening of the adapter stent, where the replacement valve will be positioned.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one aspect of the invention, a method is provided for placing a valve in an organ having a greater size in at least one dimension than the valve. The method comprises delivering an expandable tubular adapter to a desired site within the tubular organ, wherein the adapter comprises an enclosed volume surrounded by an outer cylindrical wall having a first diameter that is spaced concentrically from an inner cylindrical wall having a second diameter that is smaller than the first diameter, and first and second end walls extending between the outer and inner cylindrical walls at a proximal and distal end of the adapter, respectively. The method further includes expanding the outer cylindrical wall relative to the inner cylindrical wall so that the outer cylindrical wall contacts the tubular organ, and placing a valve within the inner cylindrical wall of the adapter. The method may further include inserting material into the enclosed volume of the adapter to expand the outer wall relative to the inner wall, which material may include liquid or gel, for example, and may be a material that completely or partially hardens. Alternatively, the valve may be positioned within the inner cylindrical wall of the adapter prior to the adapter being delivered to the desired site.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect of the invention, an apparatus is provided for placing a valve in a tubular organ having a greater diameter than the valve. The apparatus comprises an enclosed volume surrounded by an outer cylindrical wall having a first diameter that is spaced concentrically from an inner cylindrical wall having a second diameter that is smaller than the first diameter, and first and second end walls extending between the outer and inner cylindrical walls at a proximal and distal end of the adapter, respectively. The apparatus further comprises a quantity of material contained within the enclosed volume and a valve mounted within the inner cylindrical wall of the adapter. The outer wall, the inner wall, or both the outer and inner wall may include at least one protrusion extending from its surface, such as to mate with at least a portion of the valve.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention will be further explained with reference to the appended Figures, wherein like structure is referred to by like numerals throughout the several views, and wherein:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a side view of an exemplary prior art adapter stent;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic end view of the adapter stent of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, with a valved venous segment installed therein;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional side view of a replacement valve including an adapter stent of the type illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, as implanted in a right ventricular outflow tract;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of an embodiment of an adapter stent according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional side view of the adapter stent of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a side view of a stented valved venous segment;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a side view of a delivery system for a delivering a valved venous segment in accordance with the invention;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a side view of the valved venous segment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> as it can be delivered by the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a cross-sectional side view of a replacement valve positioned within an adapter stent of the invention, as implanted in a right ventricular outflow tract;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a side view of a delivery system for an adapter stent, according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of another embodiment of an adapter stent that includes ribs or protrusions extending outwardly from the outer surface of the adapter stent;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of another embodiment of an adapter stent that includes ribs or protrusions extending inwardly toward the inner open channel of the adapter stent;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of another embodiment of an adapter stent according to the invention, including a valve segment positioned therein;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a schematic perspective view of a valve attached to a stent in accordance with another embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a cross-sectional side view of another embodiment of an adapter stent of the invention, including the valve and stent of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> in a first position; and</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a cross-sectional side view of the adapter stent of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, including the valve and stent of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> in a second position.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to the Figures, wherein the components are labeled with like numerals throughout the several Figures, and initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, an exemplary configuration of an adapter stent <b>200</b> in accordance with the invention is illustrated. Adapter stent <b>200</b> can be used to reduce the infundibulum or right ventricular outflow tract to a diameter that accommodates a percutaneous pulmonary valve, for example. That is, adapter stent <b>200</b> provides for an area of appropriate size or diameter to accept the implantation of a valve, such as in an area where the infundibulum or right ventricular outflow tract is too large to otherwise accommodate such a valve. Adapter stent <b>200</b> includes a generally cylindrical balloon <b>202</b> that surrounds an inner channel <b>204</b> that extends generally through its center. The inner channel <b>204</b>, which is defined by an inner wall <b>206</b> of balloon <b>202</b>, is generally concentrically located relative to an outer surface <b>208</b> of balloon <b>202</b>, although it could instead be at least somewhat offset. End walls <b>210</b> and <b>212</b> extend between the inner wall <b>206</b> and outer surface <b>208</b>, thereby providing an enclosed tubular configuration for balloon <b>202</b>. End walls <b>210</b> and <b>212</b> may be generally straight or flat and extend in a generally perpendicular direction from one or both of the inner wall <b>206</b> and outer surface <b>208</b> toward the other of the inner wall <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>. Alternatively, the end walls <b>210</b> and <b>212</b> may instead by generally concave or convex portions of the balloon that provide a smooth transition surface between the inner wall <b>206</b> and outer surface <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Adapter stents of the invention are primarily described herein as being generally tubular in shape for use in pulmonary valve replacement, which will generally involve an adapter have a cylindrical shape with a length for use in the area of a failed pulmonic valve. However, the length and/or shape of the adapter stent can be at least somewhat different when provided for use in replacement of the aortic, mitral or tricuspid valves, all of which are considered to be within the scope of the invention. That is, when used in the mitral valve space, for example, the adapter stent may be much shorter and comprise a more toroid-like shape.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As will be described in further detail below, balloon <b>202</b> can be inserted into a patient in a generally deflated or collapsed condition, then subsequently filled with one or more of a variety of substances. For example, these substances may be of a type that does not harden, such as air or liquid of varying viscosities. In these cases, the balloon can be provided with a mechanism to keep the material contained within the balloon (i.e., to prevent leakage), such as a plug or other closing mechanism. It is also contemplated that the balloon itself is made of a self-sealing type of material that can be punctured or otherwise compromised to allow filling of the balloon through a nozzle or other device, and that will reseal itself after removal of the balloon-filling device. Alternatively, the balloon can be filled with a compound that is completely or partially hardenable such that it cannot leak or otherwise migrate from the balloon once it has hardened. Such hardenable materials may harden quickly or instantaneously within the balloon after it is injected or inserted therein, or the materials can gradually harden over time, such as in response to the temperature of the surrounding bodily fluids and tissues. Other exemplary materials that may be used within the balloon include saline, collagen, silicone, hydrogel, blood, foam, beads or spheres made of glass, polymers, or metals, or the like.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Although the balloon and/or adapter stent are described above as being generally cylindrical in shape, it is understood that the balloon may instead be shaped in a number of different ways that are considered to be within the scope of the invention. For example, the balloon may have an outer wall that is generally elliptical, oval, spherical, or irregularly shaped, for example, and the inner wall of such a balloon may have a similar or different shape from the outer wall.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one specific example, the outer wall of an adapter stent may be generally oval or D-shaped to conform to a patient's generally D-shaped mitral valve opening. Such an adapter can facilitate usage of a circular or other shaped replacement valve. In yet another specific example, a heart failure patient may have a dilated round mitral orifice that can be remodeled back to be more D-shaped or oval with the use of an appropriately shaped adapter stent. This type of remodeling of the shape of a valve opening can also be beneficial for congenital heart valve patients who desire to have the valve anatomy remodeled to accommodate a new replacement valve and/or to improve blood flow, hemo dynamics, and the like.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In accordance with the invention, the inner wall of an adapter stent is configured to accommodate a valve, and the outer wall is configured so that a sufficient portion of its area will securely contact the body opening in which it is inserted. That is, the outer wall of the balloon can have a number of irregularly-shaped contours such as may be necessary to accommodate the congenital irregularities of a right ventricular outflow tract, for example. In that regard, the balloon and/or adapter stent may have an outer wall that appears to be generally cylindrical when in its collapsed or semi-collapsed condition, but that is relatively conformable such that its outer wall will be relatively irregular when expanded within the appropriate body opening. Thus, the adapter stents of the invention may be used in areas of the body that do not comprise regularly or symmetrically shaped tubular openings. Further, with any of these balloons and/or adapter stents, the inner channel may be somewhat or significantly offset (i.e., non-concentric) relative to the outer surface of the balloon.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The balloon <b>202</b> can be constructed of any material that is compatible with the material that it contains, and is preferably impermeable or semi-impermeable to bodily fluids. In any of the embodiments of the invention, the balloon can be made of one or more materials that form a continuous tube that can be maintained in its expanded state for an extended period of time. That is, the material placed within the inner area of the balloon preferably does not migrate or leak out once the balloon has been sealed, and the fluids outside the balloon preferably do not migrate into the inner area of the balloon. In other words, the material from which the balloon is made is preferably impermeable to any of the fluids with which it comes in contact. Exemplary balloon materials include PTFE or ePTFE, although a wide variety of impermeable materials or combinations of materials can be used. It is further contemplated that the surface of the balloon can include a material that facilitates tissue in-growth or pannus, such as a fabric or other material that has a biocompatible and biostable coating and/or surface texture that facilitates healing of the balloon in the location where it was inserted. Such a material may make up the entire balloon, or only a portion of the balloon may include a material that facilitates tissue in-growth.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one configuration of the invention, the material from which the balloon <b>202</b> is constructed is flexible enough to accommodate a wide variety of anatomies so that an adapter stent <b>200</b> of one particular size and shape can be configured for use in a wide variety of patients and/or anatomical areas of patients. In addition, the balloon <b>202</b> is desirably designed in such a way that it provides an inner channel <b>204</b> having a predetermined size when it is inflated, no matter how far the inner wall <b>206</b> and outer surface <b>208</b> are spaced from each other. That is, if the balloon <b>202</b> is to be expanded to accommodate an unusually large anatomy, the inner channel <b>204</b> can be maintained at a predetermined diameter to accept a particular valve in its proper orientation. Thus, it is possible that the balloon <b>202</b> is constructed of a single material or a combination of materials, parts, and/or features that vary in thickness or other properties in certain areas of the balloon to allow for a desired expansion profile. For example, the portion of the balloon <b>202</b> that makes up the inner wall <b>206</b> can be relatively non-deformable or non-expandable as compared to the portion of the balloon that makes up the outer surface <b>208</b> so that addition of material to the inner area of the balloon <b>202</b> will not allow expansion of the balloon <b>202</b> into the inner channel <b>204</b>, but will only allow for expansion of the outer surface <b>208</b> of the balloon <b>202</b> away from the inner wall <b>206</b>. In this way, the diameter of the inner channel <b>204</b> can be maintained at a particular size and shape for accepting a replacement valve. In addition, it is preferable that the distance between the end wall <b>210</b> and the end wall <b>212</b> will be approximately the same when the balloon <b>202</b> is collapsed or when the balloon <b>202</b> is partially or completely expanded. However, it is also possible that the length of the balloon <b>202</b> increases at least slightly when material in inserted therein.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The expansion of the balloons of the invention may involve an actual stretching or expansion of the material from which the balloon is made in response to an addition of material into its internal volume. However, in other embodiments, the material itself may not actually expand or stretch, but the filling of the internal volume of the balloon instead causes the walls of the balloon to move away from each other, thereby expanding the internal balloon volume.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The balloon <b>202</b> can be covered or partially covered with one or more substances to control or prevent ingrowth and sealing of the valve, such as Dacron, PTFE, tissue, and the like. The material from which the balloons are made may include a material that has essentially zero porosity when first used, but which allows some short-term, limited leakage prior to implantation. This type of material becomes impermeable when implanted. Metal stent material can also be used in combination with the balloon material to allow tailored radial force for the balloon <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The adapter stents of the invention can include features such as rings, barbs, hooks, teeth, or other protrusions or recesses that extend from or into the balloon material of the inner wall, the outer wall, or both the inner and outer walls. One example of such a configuration is illustrated as an adapter stent <b>250</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. Adapter stent <b>250</b> includes a generally cylindrical balloon <b>252</b> that surrounds an inner channel <b>254</b> that extends generally through its center. Balloon <b>252</b> includes an inner wall <b>256</b> that defines the inner channel <b>254</b>, where the inner channel <b>254</b> has a generally constant diameter along its length. Balloon <b>252</b> further includes an outer wall <b>258</b> spaced from inner wall <b>256</b>. At least one protrusion <b>260</b> extends outwardly from the outer wall <b>258</b>, which can be provided as discrete bumps or knobs, for example, or may include ribs that extend around all or some portion of the periphery of the balloon <b>252</b>. The protrusions <b>260</b> can be spaced from each other, as shown, or can be more of a continuous textured surface of the outer wall <b>258</b>. Another alternative configuration of these protrusions <b>260</b> includes one or more spiral ribs that extend continuously or semi-continuously along the length of the balloon <b>252</b>. Other configurations of these protrusions may also be provided that allow for the performance characteristics described below.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The number, spacing, and particular configurations of any protrusions <b>260</b> from outer wall <b>258</b> are chosen to provide and/or enhance certain features of an adapter stent relative to a certain procedure. That is, these protrusions can be provided to increase the radial force of the balloon <b>252</b>, reduce its migration risk, and/or improve the overall structural integrity of the adapter stent, for example. Any protrusions <b>260</b> that are provided may be formed integrally with the outer wall <b>258</b>, or may be adhered or otherwise attached to the balloon <b>252</b>, using the same or different materials as the material from which the balloon is constructed. One example of such an alternative protrusion is a plug that extends into and from the outer wall <b>258</b>, such as a self-expandable cylindrical mesh device of the type commercially available from AGA Medical Corporation of Golden Valley, Minnesota, as the &#x201c;AMPLATZER Vascular Plug&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates a portion of another embodiment of an adapter stent <b>270</b>, which comprises a balloon <b>272</b> surrounding an inner channel <b>274</b> that extends generally through its center. Balloon <b>272</b> includes an outer wall <b>276</b> spaced from an inner wall <b>278</b> that defines the inner channel <b>274</b>. Outer wall <b>276</b> has a generally constant diameter along its length; however, inner wall <b>278</b> includes at least one protrusion <b>280</b> extending into the inner channel <b>274</b>. Protrusions <b>280</b> may include any of the variations described or contemplated above relative to protrusions from outer wall <b>258</b> of adapter stent <b>250</b>, as desired. One function for such protrusions <b>280</b> is to control the position of a new valve within the adapter stent, such as to prevent migration of the valve. That is, such protrusions can promote docking, positioning, and/or securing of the valve within the adapter stent. Further, a single adapter stent may use a combination of protrusions from both its inner and outer walls and along all or a portion of these wall lengths.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of an adapter stent <b>300</b>, which further includes a valve segment <b>302</b> positioned therein. Adapter stent <b>300</b> includes a balloon <b>304</b> surrounding a generally cylindrical inner channel <b>306</b>. Inner channel <b>306</b> includes at least one contoured portion <b>308</b>, which thereby varies the diameter of the inner channel <b>306</b> along a portion of its length. In one embodiment, a discrete contoured portion <b>308</b> is provided to correspond with each leaflet of a particular valve that will be used therewith. That is, if a three-leaflet valve will be used, for example, three corresponding contoured or bulbous portions <b>308</b> can be provided. The contoured portions <b>308</b> can thereby correspond with the anatomic or natural shape of a valve to be inserted therein. However, the contoured portions <b>308</b> may instead be more continuous around all or a portion of the inner periphery of the balloon <b>304</b>. Such contoured portions may alternatively or additionally be provided on the outer wall of an adapter stent to accommodate the anatomy of the patient.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates another example of a stented valve venous segment <b>50</b> that has been developed, which can be positioned within a previously implanted adapter stent, such as the adapter stent <b>200</b>. The stented venous segment <b>50</b> may correspond to that described in the above-cited Tower, et al., and Bonhoeffer et al. references, and generally comprises a stent <b>52</b> and a venous segment <b>54</b>. The stented venous segment <b>50</b> is expandable to an outer diameter as large as the diameter inner channel <b>204</b> of adapter stent <b>202</b>. The stent <b>52</b> may be fabricated of platinum, stainless steel or other biocompatible metal. While it may be fabricated using wire stock as described in the above-cited Tower, et al. applications, it can also be produced by machining the stent from a metal tube or molding the stent from another appropriate material. The venous segment <b>54</b> is mounted within the stent <b>52</b> with its included valve located between the ends of the stent and is secured to the stent by sutures <b>56</b>. Sutures <b>56</b> are located at the proximal and distal ends of the stent and preferably at all or almost all of the intersections of the stent, as illustrated. A more detailed description of the manufacture of stented venous segments is disclosed in Assignee's co-pending U.S. Patent application titled &#x201c;Apparatus for Treatment of Cardiac Valves and Method of Its Manufacture&#x201d;, in the names of Philippe Bonhoeffer and Debra Ann Taitague et al., filed Nov. 18, 2005 and assigned U.S. Ser. No. 11/282,275.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates one exemplary system for delivering a valved venous segment of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> to the interior of a previously implanted adapter stent, such as adapter stent <b>200</b>. The delivery system <b>60</b> comprises an outer sheath <b>62</b> overlying an inner balloon catheter (not visible in this Figure). The outer sheath includes an expanded distal portion <b>64</b>, within which the stented valved venous segment is located. The venous segment is compressed around a single or double balloon located on the inner catheter. A tapered tip <b>66</b> is mounted to the distal end of the inner catheter and serves to ease the passage of the delivery system through the patient's vasculature. The system also includes a guidewire <b>68</b>, which can be used to guide the delivery system to its desired implant location.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The delivery system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and its use may correspond to that described in the above-cited Tower, et al. applications, with the exception that the venous segment is placed within the middle section of a previously placed adapter stent, such as adapter stent <b>200</b>, rather than expanded against a failed native or prosthetic valve. The delivery system can be advanced to the desired valve implant site using the guidewire <b>68</b>, after which the sheath <b>62</b> is retracted to allow balloon expansion of the venous segment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates the mechanism for deployment of a stented valved venous segment, such as segment <b>50</b>, within middle portion of a previously implanted adapter stent, such as adapter stent <b>200</b>. The outer sheath <b>62</b> is moved proximally, exposing the balloon <b>72</b> mounted on inner catheter <b>70</b>. The balloon <b>72</b> is expanded, which thereby expands venous segment <b>50</b> against the inner surface of the previously implanted adapter stent, stabilizing and sealing the venous segment within the adapter stent. If any protrusions or other docking features are provided within the adapter stent, the venous segment <b>50</b> can be engaged with such features. The balloon is then deflated and the delivery system is withdrawn proximally.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a replacement valve, as implanted in a right ventricular outflow tract <b>40</b> within an adapter stent <b>200</b> of the invention. As discussed above, this replacement valve can either be implanted within the adapter stent <b>200</b> at the same time the adapter stent is implanted in the patient, or the replacement valve can instead be implanted at some time after the adapter stent <b>200</b> is implanted. In yet another alternative, the adapter stent and/or replacement valve can be placed surgically within the patient, with the two components being implanted in a single procedure or multiple procedures. In any case, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates the outer surface <b>208</b> of the adapter stent <b>200</b> expanded against the inner wall of the outflow tract <b>40</b>. As set out above, the inner channel <b>204</b> preferably maintains a particular diameter that is appropriate for holding and maintaining a chosen replacement valve. Thus, depending on the size of the outflow tract <b>40</b>, the outer surface <b>208</b> may be relatively close to the inner channel <b>204</b> or may be spaced relatively far from the inner channel <b>204</b>. In other words, if the outflow tract is relatively large, the outer surface <b>208</b> will be spaced relatively far from the inner channel <b>204</b> as compared to a configuration where the outflow tract is not as large.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">With the adapter stent <b>200</b>, the outer surface <b>208</b> is preferably in contact with the inner surface of the outflow tract <b>40</b> along the entire length of the stent, although it is possible that portions of the outer surface <b>208</b> are not in contact with the outflow tract. In any case, enough of the outer surface <b>208</b> should be in contact with the outflow tract <b>40</b> to accomplish sealing and prevent its migration after implantation. The adapter stent in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is mounted downstream of the native valve leaflets <b>42</b> to allow them to continue to function during the time the adapter stent <b>200</b> and the stented venous segment <b>50</b> are being implanted. Optionally, the venous segment <b>50</b> may be placed within the adapter stent <b>200</b> at some period of time after its initial implant, such as several days or weeks. In this Figure, the leaflets <b>58</b> of an implanted venous segment <b>54</b> are also illustrated within the adapter stent <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates one exemplary system that may be used for delivering the adapter stents according to the invention, which can be somewhat similar to the system used for delivering a venous segment. The delivery system <b>21</b> comprises an outer sheath <b>22</b> overlying an inner catheter (not visible in this Figure). The outer sheath <b>22</b> has an expanded distal portion <b>24</b>, within which an adapter stent <b>200</b> (with or without a valved venous segment) can be located. The adapter stent <b>200</b> can be initially be in its collapsed condition, compressed around the inner catheter, and retained in its compressed configuration by the outer sheath <b>22</b>. A tapered tip <b>26</b> is mounted to the distal end of the inner catheter and serves to ease the passage of the delivery system <b>20</b> through the vasculature. The system also includes a guidewire <b>28</b>, which may be used to guide the delivery system <b>20</b> to its desired implant location.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Delivery system <b>21</b> further includes a mechanism <b>32</b> that communicates with an adapter stent for its inflation or expansion at the desired implant site. The mechanism <b>32</b> can include a wide variety of devices that can provide the desired material to the interior of the adapter stent <b>200</b>, such as a pump that can move fluid or gel into the adapter sten <b>200</b>, a source of pressurized air or other gas that can be controlled to inflate the adapter stent <b>200</b> by a predetermined amount, and the like. That is, the material that is used within the adapter stent <b>200</b> will determine the type of mechanism <b>32</b> that needs to be used to inflate it or expand it. The delivery system <b>21</b> and/or the adapter stent <b>200</b> can optionally be provided with a sealing mechanism (not shown) for sealing or closing any openings in the adapter stent <b>200</b> after material is injected or inserted therein to keep the material from leaking out of the stent <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The outer sheath <b>22</b> can be moved proximally, either in response to the expansion of the adapter stent <b>200</b> via the mechanism <b>32</b>, or by pulling it from one end, thereby allowing the adapter stent <b>200</b> to expand away from the inner catheter <b>30</b>, which is visible in this configuration of the device. The distal segment of the adapter stent <b>200</b> can engage the wall of the heart vessel at the desired implant site, stabilizing the stent. The outer sheath <b>22</b> is then moved further proximally, releasing the proximal segment of the adapter stent, which is then free to expand in diameter until it contacts the wall of the heart vessel. Material can continue to be added to the adapter stent <b>200</b> until it is inflated or expanded to its desired size. The delivery system is then withdrawn proximally. In certain configurations, the valved venous segment is pro-mounted within the adapter stent <b>200</b>, so this inflation or expansion of the adapter stent <b>200</b>, with its valved venous segment mounted therein, provides a single-procedure implantation of the replacement valve. Alternatively, the valved venous segment can be inserted into the adapter stent in a separate procedure.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The stented valved venous segments used with the adapter stents of the invention have been described and shown as being compressible for installation into a patient, then expandable, such as by a balloon or otherwise expandable portion of a delivery system. However, it is also understood that other types of stented valves can be used, such as those that are referred to as the &#x201c;self-expanding&#x201d; type. These self-expanding stents are compressible for installation into a patient, then will radially expand to a desired size simply by removing certain external forces that were used to keep the stent in a compressed state. Other types of stented valves can also be used that are compressible and expandable in ways other than those described herein.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the valve segment <b>302</b> is illustrated as it has been pre-attached or mounted within the inner channel <b>306</b> of the balloon <b>304</b> so that the implantation procedure can be accomplished in a single step. That is, rather than first installing the adapter stent, then subsequently installing a valve segment within its inner channel, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates a adapter stent assembly that allows the surgeon to eliminate the separate step of using a delivery system with a balloon to expand the valve segment. Valve segment <b>302</b> is illustrated in the general form of a bovine jugular vein that includes bulbous areas <b>310</b> that can expand into the contoured portions <b>308</b> of the balloon <b>304</b>. This configuration can provide less stress on the leaflets <b>312</b> since the bulbous areas <b>310</b> are not compressed or otherwise deformed into the inner channel <b>306</b> of the balloon <b>304</b>, but are allowed to remain generally in their native anatomical form.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of a valve <b>320</b> (shown with broken lines) attached within a stent <b>322</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. Valve <b>320</b> includes leaflets <b>324</b>, and the stent includes a proximal end <b>328</b> and an opposite distal end <b>326</b>. The proximal end <b>328</b> may be at least partially covered with tissue, for example, such as during a procedure of securing the stent <b>322</b> to the valve <b>320</b> by a sewing operation. The stent <b>322</b> may include a braided or wire mesh material, or any other appropriate stent material. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows this valve-stent assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> positioned within an adapter stent or balloon <b>330</b>, with the leaflets <b>324</b> positioned generally within an inner channel <b>332</b> of the balloon <b>330</b>, and the proximal end <b>328</b> of the stent <b>322</b> extending beyond one end of balloon <b>330</b>. Stent <b>322</b> is attached to the balloon <b>330</b>, such as by sewing the proximal end <b>328</b> of stent <b>322</b> to balloon <b>330</b> around at least a portion of the circumference of the stent <b>322</b>. The balloon <b>330</b> can be provided with a cuff or other extension (not shown) for attachment of a stent without compromising any of the strength of the balloon, for example. At this point, the adapter stent having a stented valve installed therein can be shipped to a clinician, for example.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The valve-stent assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> can optionally be inverted to the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> by pulling the distal end <b>326</b> of the stent <b>322</b> through the inner channel <b>332</b> of the balloon <b>330</b> until it is essentially turned inside out as compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. In this way, the balloon with an attached stented valve can be compressed to a smaller dimension for delivery of the system into a patient, because a smaller volume of material will be in this area than if the stented valve were to remain in the inner channel <b>332</b> during the compression process. The adapter stent may then be used in a similar way as discussed herein relative to other embodiments of the invention, such as will include expanding the balloon with a material, removing any delivery devices, etc., but can also include the step of reversing the inversion process described above by pressing the distal end <b>326</b> of the stent <b>322</b> back into the inner channel <b>332</b> so that it can function as a valve for the patient.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Finally, while the invention described above is particularly optimized for placement of valves in the right ventricular outflow tract, it is possible that the invention might be used to place valves in other blood vessels or other tubular organs. Similarly, while bovine jugular veins are disclosed as the source for the valved segments used to practice the invention, other source animals or source vessels may be substituted. Also, polymer or thin metal film valves may be used. Further, alternative exemplary replacement valves can be used, of the type described U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,719,789 and 5,480,424, issued to Cox, discussed above. As such, the above description should be taken as exemplary, rather than limiting.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The present invention has now been described with reference to several embodiments thereof.
