The invention further relates to a cover unit and a securing element.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The cover unit or grate unit in common gutter systems for drainage is connected or interlocked with the frame unit. This is to allow the grate unit or cover unit in the frame unit to be secured against falling out and/or being lifted out.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thick-walled gutter systems in particular however require a large grate width for this purpose, increasing the cost of producing such cast iron grates. The frame unit or channel wall itself must also be modified and designed using additional geometries in such a way to enable engagement in the wall.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The object of the present invention is to provide a gutter system which can be manufactured simply and inexpensively, enables an optimized grate or cover connection with different types of frame units, ensures simple assembly on site, and which allows simple maintenance and theft protection at the same time. The object of the invention is further to provide a cover unit and a securing element, particularly for said gutter system. This object is achieved by the subject matter of claim <b>1</b> with respect to the gutter system, by claim <b>12</b> with respect to the cover unit, and by claim <b>13</b> with respect to the securing element. Preferred embodiments are set out in the dependent claims. According to the invention, a gutter system is provided with at least one frame unit, at least one cover unit and at least one securing element, wherein the frame unit has at least one receiving area for arranging the cover unit, and wherein the securing element is designed to engage, in particular to engage non-positively and/or positively, in the cover unit and to releasably engage in the receiving area so the cover unit can interlock in the receiving area of the frame unit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention is based on the idea of providing a securing element which can be connected to the cover unit and enables a releasable connection to the frame unit. It should be in particular possible to achieve a captive connection of the securing element to the cover unit, whereby a connection of the cover unit to the frame unit can be released by means of the securing element as required.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">By this, a secure and easy to establish connection or latching of the cover unit to the frame unit is achieved. At the same time, theft protection can be achieved as well.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The frame unit may preferably be symmetrically designed, so receiving areas are formed on both sides of the frame unit in the longitudinal direction of the gutter system. The securing element is provided for expedient engagement in the receiving area.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">By the at least one securing element engaging only in sections in the receiving area of the frame unit, differently designed frame units can be used in combination with the securing element or the cover unit for the gutter system, no continuous receiving area along the frame unit in particular is necessary.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a preferred embodiment, the securing element is elastically and/or plastically deformable in such a way that the engagement of the securing element in the at least one receiving area can be released as required, in particular by at least partial deformation of the securing element. This ensures that, when connected to the frame unit, the securing element or the cover unit can be released in a simple, expedient manner.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a further embodiment, the at least one receiving area of the frame unit is designed as an undercut.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">This allows the securing element to expediently engage in the frame unit to ensure a non-positive and/or positive connection between the cover unit and the frame unit, which can be released as required.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a preferred embodiment, the securing element has a release area for engagement, in particular for engagement by means of a screwdriver, a lever element or the like, in order to apply a release force for elastic and/or plastic deformation of the securing element (<b>30</b>) to the securing element as required.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The at least one securing element of the gutter system is thus preferably operable solely by auxiliary means to release the engagement with the frame unit or the receiving area, and thus to release the connection between the frame unit and the cover unit.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, the securing element comprises a locking lever, wherein the locking lever is supported against the cover unit and applies a locking force so that the securing element engages non-positively and/or positively in the receiving area.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The elastically and/or plastically deformable locking lever of the securing element in particular allows the provision of a releasable connection between the cover unit and the frame unit in an expedient form with a predeterminable locking force.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a further embodiment, the cover unit comprises at least one receiving opening for receiving and guiding the at least one securing element. The at least one securing element may thus preferably be received in the at least one receiving opening of the cover unit in an interlocked manner. A guide through the cover unit along the desired direction of movement of the securing element is further disposed in order to provide a releasable connection between the cover unit and the frame unit.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a further embodiment, the at least one receiving opening comprises at least one bearing element and the securing element comprises at least one correspondingly configured bearing groove for receiving and guiding the securing element.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Alternatively, the bearing groove may be formed along the receiving opening of the cover unit, the bearing element being formed along the securing element.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">This allows the provision of a connection or bearing and guide between the securing element and the cover unit. The securing element and the cover unit in particular can engage with each other.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The receiving opening may moreover have two bearing elements and the securing element may have correspondingly two bearing grooves, wherein the bearing elements are formed on opposite side surfaces of the receiving opening of the cover unit. This allows the provision of a double-sided or two-sided bearing and guiding of the securing element to ensure reliable functionality.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the bearing element has a loss-preventing unit at a longitudinal end, in particular in the direction of a central area of the gutter system, so that the securing element and the cover unit can be connected non-positively and/or positively to provide a captive connection.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">After initial connection, the securing element is thus non-positively and/or positively interlocked and expediently secured to the frame unit. For this purpose, the loss-preventing unit may be provided along the bearing element as an additional latch nose or the like. The locking lever may be designed in such a way that, when the connection is made between the cover unit and the securing element, the locking lever slides along the bearing element and overcomes the loss-preventing unit due to elastic deformation. The securing element can thus be secured or latched to the cover unit.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a preferred embodiment, the at least one bearing element is of nose-shaped design. This provides a non-positive and/or positive engagement between the bearing element and the correspondingly configured bearing groove to allow expedient reception and guidance of the securing element.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a further embodiment, the at least one receiving opening has a support surface for supporting the locking lever, so that a locking force can be exerted by the locking lever on the securing element.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a further embodiment, the support surface is designed at least in sections with a rounding such that a release force to be applied to overcome the locking force of the locking lever is reduced along the support surface at least in sections or is adjustable based on the configuration of the rounding.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The at least sectional rounding of the support surface may in particular be designed such that a release force does not increase across the support surface, does not exceed a threshold value, or such that it is reduced.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a preferred embodiment, the locking lever has at least one latch nose for engaging with and/or behind the loss-preventing unit.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">This allows the provision of a non-positive and/or positive connection between the securing element and the cover unit.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, the at least one securing element is designed in one piece, and/or the at least one cover unit is designed in one piece. The cover unit and the securing element can preferably each be designed in one piece.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">This allows the provision of a reliable, stable and expedient interlocking or connection between the cover unit and the securing element.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an ancillary aspect of the invention, a cover unit for use with a gutter system according to the invention is provided, the cover unit having at least one receiving opening for receiving and guiding at least one securing element.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another ancillary aspect of the invention, a securing element for use with a gutter system according to the invention and/or a cover unit according to the invention is provided.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The cover unit and the securing element may in particular be used with any type of frame unit having, at least on one side, a receiving area or the like for engagement by the securing element.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">This allows the provision of universal use and easy connection or securing of the cover unit to a frame unit.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The invention will be explained hereafter in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In particular schematically:</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional view of an exemplary embodiment of a gutter system comprising a frame unit, a cover unit and a securing element;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a top view of the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a perspective view of a frame unit and the cover unit according to the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i></figref>show cross-sectional views of the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in particular to illustrate the functionality of the securing element; and</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows another cross-sectional view of the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional view of an exemplary embodiment of a gutter system <b>1</b> comprising a cover unit <b>20</b> and a securing element <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The frame unit <b>10</b> is designed with a receiving area <b>12</b> for bearing and receiving the cover unit <b>20</b>.
