This valve unit includes a liquid control valve disposed in a liquid refrigerant pipe, a gas control valve disposed in a gas refrigerant pipe, and a casing covering the liquid control valve and the gas control valve. Each valve tends to become a leakage point of refrigerant, and thus needs to be regularly checked by a monitoring person and also repaired by a maintenance person as necessary.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, when a refrigerant leakage occurred, the internal space of the casing would have already been permeated with a significant amount of leaked refrigerant when the monitoring/maintenance person arrives and opens the casing. For instance, some refrigerants used are flammable or slightly flammable. Hence, opening such a casing is undesirable from safety perspective. Meanwhile, if the valves are not covered by the casing, leaked refrigerant would immediately spread to the surrounding area.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One or more embodiments of the present disclosure provide a valve unit with high safety regarding refrigerant leakage, and provide a method for assembling such a valve unit.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One or more embodiments of the present disclosure provide a valve unit used for a heat-pump system, comprising: at least one liquid refrigerant pipe portion; at least one gas refrigerant pipe portion; at least one liquid control valve disposed in the liquid refrigerant pipe portion; at least one gas control valve disposed in the gas refrigerant pipe portion; a casing accommodating at least the liquid control valve and the gas control valve; and an air-discharge mechanism configured to operate to discharge an air in an internal space of the casing to an external space outside the casing when a refrigerant leakage in the casing has occurred.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">With the above configuration, even if a refrigerant leakage has occurred at the valves, the casing can prevent or restrain the leaked refrigerant from spreading to a surrounding area. Moreover, concentration of the leaked refrigerant in the internal space of the casing can be decreased by discharging the air in the internal space to an external space of the casing. This external space may not be an outer space directly surrounding the casing or an indoor space where a human or animal could come or reside. The external space may be an outdoor space.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, the valve unit may be configured such that the internal space of the casing is substantially closed in normal times, and a refrigerant leakage detection may be made based on concentration of refrigerant in the internal space of the casing. In this case, it is possible to swiftly detect an occurrence of a refrigerant leakage in the casing and start operation of the air-discharge mechanism at an early stage. Hence, it is possible to prevent concentration of the leaked refrigerant in both the casing and the surrounding area from becoming high in a more secure manner. This allows the monitoring/maintenance person to safely monitor, maintain, or repair the valves. Accordingly, it is possible to improve safety of the valve unit regarding refrigerant leakage.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The pipe portions, the valves and the casings, and the air-discharge mechanism, may be manufactured together. In this case, it is easier to design the valve unit so as to enhance its performance such as airtightness of the casing and air-discharge efficiency of the air-discharge mechanism. It is also easier to optimize the dimension of the valve unit, a position of a maintenance door of the casing, and the capacity of the air-discharge mechanism. Hence, it is possible to improve not only safety but also maintainability and functionality of the valve unit. Alternatively, the casing may be a retrofitted casing which is to be assembled around existing valves.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one or more embodiments of the valve unit mentioned above, the air-discharge mechanism includes: a fan configured to draw the air from the internal space towards the external space.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">With the above configuration, it is possible to effectively discharge the air in the casing when a refrigerant leakage in the casing has occurred. In a case where the casing has a part exposed to the outdoor space, an outlet of the fan may be disposed in this part. In a case where the casing does not have any part exposed to the outdoor space, an air duct extending from the casing to the outdoor space may be arranged, and the fan may be disposed in or attached to the air duct. The fan may be arranged at the outer end of the air duct. Thereby, the full air duct can be kept in under pressure, preventing the air containing refrigerant from leaking from the duct.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to one or more embodiments of the valve unit mentioned above with the fan, an opening is formed in the casing, and the air-discharge mechanism further includes a check air damper configured to allow an air to flow from an outside of the casing towards the internal space through the opening when the fan is in operation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">With the above configuration, the discharge of the air in the internal space of the casing can be promoted by replacing it with an external air. Thus, it is possible to more effectively discharge the air in the casing when a refrigerant leakage in the casing has occurred. Moreover, since the check air damper can keep a closed state when the fan is not in operation, the airtightness of the casing can be maintained.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to one or more embodiments of any one of the valve units mentioned above, the valve unit further comprises: a sensor configured to detect a concentration of the refrigerant in the air in the casing; and a controller configured to determine that a refrigerant leakage in the casing has occurred when the detected concentration is equal to or greater than a detection value threshold, and control the air-discharge mechanism to start operation when the refrigerant leakage has occurred.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">With the above configuration, the concentration of refrigerant in the internal space of the casing can be prevented from becoming high even when a refrigerant leakage in the casing has occurred. Thus, it is possible to achieve the safety of the valve unit in a more secure manner.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to one or more embodiments of any one of the valve units mentioned above with the controller, the liquid refrigerant pipe portion and the gas refrigerant pipe portion form a part of a liquid refrigerant pipe and a part of a gas refrigerant pipe, respectively, which extend between a heatsource-side heat exchanger and a utilization-side heat exchanger of the heat-pump system; and the controller is further configured to control the liquid control valve and the gas control valve to close when a refrigerant leakage in a utilization-side piping section has occurred, the utilization-side piping section extending between the liquid control valve and the gas control valve and including at least the utilization-side heat exchanger.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">With the above configuration, it is possible to restrain or stop further supply of refrigerant to the utilization-side piping section when a refrigerant leakage in the utilization-side piping section has occurred. Thereby, further refrigerant leakage from the utilization-side piping section, e.g. from the utilization-side heat exchanger, can be restrained or stopped. The liquid control valve and the gas control valve may be shut-off valves. Moreover, it is possible to divide a refrigerant circuit of the heat-pump system into smaller sections, which are arranged for different spaces. There is a case where ratio of a total refrigerant amount in each circuit section with respect to total volume of a space in which the circuit section extends is legally restricted. Even in such a case, the above configuration allows the air-conditioning system to be easily applied to a facility having relatively small spaces, while ensuring high safety at a low cost. Furthermore, although the valves themselves could be refrigerant leakage points, they are also disposed inside the casing. Thus, it is possible to obtain the above-mentioned effects without impairing safety of other locations regarding refrigerant leakage.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one or more embodiments of the valve unit mentioned above with the check air damper and the controller, the check air damper is configured to be operated by an electric motor, and the controller is configured to control the electric motor to open the check air damper when a refrigerant leakage in the casing has occurred.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">With the above configuration, it is possible to more effectively and securely discharge the air in the casing when a refrigerant leakage in the casing has occurred.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to one or more embodiments of any one of the valve units mentioned above with the controller, the controller is further configured to output alarm information when a refrigerant leakage in the casing or a refrigerant leakage in the utilization-side piping section has occurred.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">With the above configuration, it is possible to notify the monitoring/maintenance person and/or an external information output device of an occurrence of a refrigerant leakage in the casing or the utilization-side piping section. Thus, the safety of the valve unit and/or the air-conditioning system can be further improved.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to one or more embodiments of any one of the valve units mentioned above, the at least one gas refrigerant pipe portion includes a low-pressure gas pipe portion, a high-pressure gas pipe portion, and a utilization-side gas pipe portion branching into the low-pressure gas pipe portion and the high-pressure gas pipe portion; the at least one liquid control valve includes a liquid shut-off valve disposed in the liquid refrigerant pipe portion; and the at least one gas control valve includes a low-pressure gas control valve disposed in the low-pressure gas pipe portion, a high-pressure gas control valve disposed in the high-pressure gas pipe portion, and a gas shut-off valve disposed in the utilization-side gas pipe portion.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">With the above configuration, the valve unit can switch whether the utilization-side gas pipe portion is communicated with the low-pressure gas pipe portion or the high-pressure gas pipe portion.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For instance, the liquid refrigerant pipe portion is selectively communicated with a condenser and an evaporator as heatsource-side heat exchangers disposed in a heatsource-side unit and with a utilization-side heat exchanger disposed in a utilization-side unit. The low-pressure gas pipe portion is communicated with the suction port of a refrigerant compressor disposed in the heatsource-side unit. The high-pressure gas pipe portion is communicated with the discharge port of the refrigerant compressor disposed in the heatsource-side unit. The utilization-side gas pipe portion is communicated with the utilization-side heat exchanger. In this case, the valve unit can function as a branch selector which allows operation state of the utilization-side unit to easily switch between cooling operation in which the utilization-side heat exchanger functions as an evaporator and heating operation in which the utilization-side heat exchanger functions as a condenser.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to one or more embodiments of any one of the valve units mentioned above, the at least one liquid refrigerant pipe portion includes a plurality of utilization-side liquid pipe portions, and a heatsource-side liquid pipe portion branching into the utilization-side liquid pipe portions; the at least one gas refrigerant pipe portion includes a plurality of utilization-side gas pipe portions, and a heatsource-side gas pipe portion branching into the utilization-side gas pipe portions; the at least one liquid control valve includes a plurality of liquid shut-off valves disposed in the utilization-side liquid pipe portions, respectively, the at least one gas control valve includes a plurality of gas shut-off valves disposed in the utilization-side gas pipe portions, respectively.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">With the above configuration, the plurality of utilization-side gas pipe portions are connected with the common heatsource-side gas pipe portion, and the plurality of utilization-side liquid pipe portions are connected with the common heatsource-side liquid pipe portion.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For instance, the heatsource-side liquid pipe portion is communicated with a heatsource-side heat exchanger disposed in a heatsource-side unit. The utilization-side liquid pipe portions are connected with a plurality of utilization-side heat exchangers disposed in a plurality of utilization-side units, respectively. The heatsource-side gas pipe portion is communicated with a refrigerant compressor disposed in the heatsource-side unit. The utilization-side gas pipe portions are connected with the utilization-side heat exchangers, respectively. In this case, the valve unit can function as a refrigerant branch unit which allows the plurality of utilization-side units to share the common heatsource-side unit.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to one or more embodiments of any one of the valve units mentioned above, the at least one liquid refrigerant pipe portion includes a plurality of utilization-side liquid pipe portions, and a heatsource-side liquid pipe portion branching into the utilization-side liquid pipe portions; the at least one gas refrigerant pipe portion includes a plurality of low-pressure gas sub pipes, a low-pressure gas pipe portion branching into the low-pressure gas sub pipes, a plurality of high-pressure gas sub pipes, a high-pressure gas pipe portion branching into the high-pressure gas sub pipes, and a plurality of utilization-side gas pipe portions each branching into one of the low-pressure gas sub pipes and one of the high-pressure gas sub pipes so as to be connected to the low-pressure gas pipe portion and the high-pressure gas pipe portion via the low-pressure gas sub pipe and the high-pressure gas sub pipe, respectively; the at least one liquid control valve includes a plurality of liquid shut-off valves disposed in the utilization-side liquid pipe portions, respectively; and the at least one gas control valve includes a plurality of low-pressure gas control valves disposed in the low-pressure gas sub pipes, respectively, a plurality of high-pressure gas control valves disposed in the high-pressure gas sub pipes, respectively, and a plurality of gas shut-off valves disposed in the utilization-side gas pipe portions, respectively.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">With the above configuration, the valve unit can function as a multi branch selector in which the functions of the branch selector and the refrigerant branch unit mentioned above are integrated. The multi branch selector achieves an individual air-conditioning of a plurality of utilization-side units while sharing the same heatsource-side unit. Meanwhile, the multi branch selector tends to include a number of the branching/merging points and valves, and thus have a number of possible refrigerant leakage points. With the above configuration, such a lot of possible refrigerant leakage points can be disposed inside the casing.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to one or more embodiments of any one of the valve units mentioned above, the valve unit further comprises: insulators applied to the casing such that an internal space of the casing is isolated from an outer space surrounding the casing at least when the air-discharge mechanism is not in operation.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">With the above configuration, the internal space of the casing can be substantially closed at least when the air-discharge mechanism is not in operation. Thereby, when a refrigerant leakage at the valves has occurred, it is possible to prevent the leaked refrigerant from spreading to surrounding area and detect an occurrence of a refrigerant leakage in the casing more swiftly.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to one or more embodiments of any one of the valve units mentioned above with the low-pressure gas control valve and the high-pressure gas control valve, a minute channel is formed in at least one of the low-pressure gas control valve and the high-pressure gas control valve, the minute channel being configured and arranged to enable refrigerant to flow through the minute channel even when an opening degree of the at least one of the low-pressure gas control valve and the high-pressure gas control valve is set to be the lowest degree.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">With the above configuration, a formation of a liquid seal circuit within the refrigerant circuit can be prevented by the minute channel, without separately providing a bypass circuit for inhibiting liquid sealing. Thus, it is possible to improve reliability of the air-conditioning system at a low cost.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to one or more embodiments of any one of the valve units mentioned above, the refrigerant is R32 refrigerant.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">R32 refrigerant, which is also called HFC-32 refrigerant or difluoromethane refrigerant and with a chemical formula of CH2F2, has characteristics of the zero-ozone depletion potential and the low global warming potential while being slightly flammable. Thus, it is possible to achieve an eco-friendly air-conditioner while ensuring high safety regarding refrigerant leakage.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">One or more embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method for assembling any one of the valve units mentioned above, wherein the casing is formed from a plurality of casing parts, comprising: arranging the casing parts around at least the liquid control valve and the gas control valve; and fixing the casing parts to each other.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">By the above process, the above-mentioned effects of any one of the valve units mentioned above can be achieved with the existing liquid control valve and gas control valve. The method may further include assembling a unit having the liquid refrigerant pipe portion, the gas refrigerant pipe portion, the liquid control valve, and the gas control valve before arranging the casing parts.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to one or more embodiments of the method mentioned above, the method further comprises attaching the air-discharge mechanism to the casing.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">By the above process, it is possible to separately assemble the air-discharge mechanism to the casing before or after fixing the casing parts to each other.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic configuration diagram of a valve unit according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a block diagram indicating a functional configuration of a controller shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a flow chart indicating a process performed by the controller.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a schematic configuration diagram of a valve unit according to a modification of the embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0044">One or more embodiments of a valve unit according to the present disclosure will be described with reference to the drawings.
