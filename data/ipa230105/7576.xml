Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (for example, bandwidth or transmit power). Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems, and Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE/LTE-Advanced is a set of enhancements to the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The above multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different UEs to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, or global level. NR, which may be referred to as 5G, is a set of enhancements to the LTE mobile standard promulgated by the 3GPP. NR is designed to better support mobile broadband internet access by improving spectral efficiency, lowering costs, improving services, making use of new spectrum, and better integrating with other open standards using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with a cyclic prefix (CP) (CP-OFDM) on the downlink, using CP-OFDM or single-carrier frequency division multiplexing (SC-FDM) (also known as discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM)) on the uplink, as well as supporting beamforming, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology, and carrier aggregation. As the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase, further improvements in LTE, NR, and other radio access technologies remain useful.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cell selection is the process of searching for a suitable cell of a selected public land mobile network (PLMN), selecting a cell to provide available services, and monitoring a control channel of the cell. A UE that has selected a cell and that is monitoring the control channel of the cell is said to be &#x201c;camped&#x201d; on the cell. The UE may register on a cell on which the UE has camped. Camping enables the UE to receive system information from the PLMN, establish or resume a radio resource control (RRC) connection via the cell, and receive paging. A UE may select a suitable cell based at least in part on a set of cell selection criteria, such as a measurement threshold, a priority of the cell, and so on. For example, the UE may search cells on frequencies identified by an acquisition database until the UE identifies a cell that satisfies the set of cell selection criteria, and may camp on the identified cell. Such an approach may lead the UE to identify a cell that is suitable but not ideal. For example, the cell may be weaker than other nearby cells, may have a narrow bandwidth, or may be associated with a negative trend in signal strength.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some aspects described herein relate to a method of wireless communication performed by a user equipment (UE).

This disclosure may, however, be embodied in many different forms and are not to be construed as limited to any specific structure or function presented throughout this disclosure. Rather, these aspects are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art. One skilled in the art may appreciate that the scope of the disclosure is intended to cover any aspect of the disclosure disclosed herein, whether implemented independently of or combined with any other aspect of the disclosure. For example, an apparatus may be implemented or a method may be practiced using any quantity of the aspects set forth herein. In addition, the scope of the disclosure is intended to cover such an apparatus or method which is practiced using other structure, functionality, or structure and functionality in addition to or other than the various aspects of the disclosure set forth herein. Any aspect of the disclosure disclosed herein may be embodied by one or more elements of a claim.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Several aspects of telecommunication systems will now be presented with reference to various apparatuses and techniques. These apparatuses and techniques will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks, modules, components, circuits, steps, processes, or algorithms (collectively referred to as &#x201c;elements&#x201d;). These elements may be implemented using hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software. Whether such elements are implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Various aspects relate generally to cell selection and reselection. Some aspects more specifically relate to selection of a cell using multiple factors. In some aspects, the multiple factors are used to determine a cell score for each cell that is a candidate for selection or reselection. The multiple factors can include a cell selection condition (such as may be associated with a cell selection threshold defined as a reference signal received power (RSRP), reference signal received quality (RSRQ), or signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) threshold), as well as one or more other factors described in more detail elsewhere herein. In some aspects, cell selection may be based at least in part on ordering frequencies of an acquisition database based at least in part on frequency scores of the frequencies. Some aspects more specifically relate to reselection using one or more factors of a reselection condition. In some aspects, the one or more factors may be based at least in part on a cell score, as described above. In some aspects, the reselection condition may provide for faster triggering and performance of reselection than a baseline reselection configuration, such as a reselection configuration specified by a wireless communication specification or a reselection configuration based at least in part on a combination of a measurement and a priority level.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Particular aspects of the subject matter described in this disclosure can be implemented to realize one or more of the following potential advantages. In some examples, the described techniques can be used to improve the UE's performance with regard to cell selection and reselection, such as by encouraging the selection of stronger cells (rather than a first-identified suitable cell), cells with suitable bandwidth, cells that are more recently measured, and so on. Thus, throughput may be increased and overhead associated with frequent cell reselection may be reduced. Furthermore, the described techniques for reselection using one or more factors may reduce latency associated with reselection and may increase throughput, since reselection may be triggered more aggressively or quickly than when using a baseline reselection configuration.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a wireless network in accordance with the present disclosure. The wireless network <b>100</b> may be or may include elements of a 5G (for example, NR) network or a 4G (for example, Long Term Evolution (LTE)) network, among other examples. The wireless network <b>100</b> may include one or more base stations <b>110</b> (shown as a BS <b>110</b><i>a</i>, a BS <b>110</b><i>b</i>, a BS <b>110</b><i>c</i>, and a BS <b>110</b><i>d</i>), a user equipment (UE) <b>120</b> or multiple UEs <b>120</b> (shown as a UE <b>120</b><i>a</i>, a UE <b>120</b><i>b</i>, a UE <b>120</b><i>c</i>, a UE <b>120</b><i>d</i>, and a UE <b>120</b><i>e</i>), or other network entities. A base station <b>110</b> is an entity that communicates with UEs <b>120</b>. A base station <b>110</b> (sometimes referred to as a BS) may include, for example, an NR base station, an LTE base station, a Node B, an eNB (for example, in 4G), a gNB (for example, in 5G), an access point, or a transmission reception point (TRP). Each base station <b>110</b> may provide communication coverage for a particular geographic area. In the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; can refer to a coverage area of a base station <b>110</b> or a base station subsystem serving this coverage area, depending on the context in which the term is used.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A base station <b>110</b> may provide communication coverage for a macro cell, a pico cell, a femto cell, or another type of cell. A macro cell may cover a relatively large geographic area (for example, several kilometers in radius) and may allow unrestricted access by UEs <b>120</b> with service subscriptions. A pico cell may cover a relatively small geographic area and may allow unrestricted access by UEs <b>120</b> with service subscription. A femto cell may cover a relatively small geographic area (for example, a home) and may allow restricted access by UEs <b>120</b> having association with the femto cell (for example, UEs <b>120</b> in a closed subscriber group (CSG)). A base station <b>110</b> for a macro cell may be referred to as a macro base station. A base station <b>110</b> for a pico cell may be referred to as a pico base station. A base station <b>110</b> for a femto cell may be referred to as a femto base station or an in-home base station.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The wireless network <b>100</b> may be a heterogeneous network that includes base stations <b>110</b> of different types, such as macro base stations, pico base stations, femto base stations, or relay base stations. These different types of base stations <b>110</b> may have different transmit power levels, different coverage areas, or different impacts on interference in the wireless network <b>100</b>. For example, macro base stations may have a high transmit power level (for example, 5 to 40 watts) whereas pico base stations, femto base stations, and relay base stations may have lower transmit power levels (for example, 0.1 to 2 watts). In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be a macro base station for a macro cell <b>102</b><i>a</i>, the BS <b>110</b><i>b </i>may be a pico base station for a pico cell <b>102</b><i>b</i>, and the BS <b>110</b><i>c </i>may be a femto base station for a femto cell <b>102</b><i>c</i>. A base station may support one or multiple (for example, three) cells. A network controller <b>130</b> may couple to or communicate with a set of base stations <b>110</b> and may provide coordination and control for these base stations <b>110</b>. The network controller <b>130</b> may communicate with the base stations <b>110</b> via a backhaul communication link. The base stations <b>110</b> may communicate with one another directly or indirectly via a wireless or wireline backhaul communication link.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some examples, a cell may not necessarily be stationary, and the geographic area of the cell may move in accordance with the location of a base station <b>110</b> that is mobile (for example, a mobile base station). In some examples, the base stations <b>110</b> may be interconnected to one another or to one or more other base stations <b>110</b> or network nodes (not shown) in the wireless network <b>100</b> through various types of backhaul interfaces, such as a direct physical connection or a virtual network, using any suitable transport network.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The wireless network <b>100</b> may include one or more relay stations. A relay station is an entity that can receive a transmission of data from an upstream station (for example, a base station <b>110</b> or a UE <b>120</b>) and send a transmission of the data to a downstream station (for example, a UE <b>120</b> or a base station <b>110</b>). A relay station may be a UE <b>120</b> that can relay transmissions for other UEs <b>120</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the BS <b>110</b><i>d </i>(for example, a relay base station) may communicate with the BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>(for example, a macro base station) and the UE <b>120</b><i>d </i>in order to facilitate communication between the BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>and the UE <b>120</b><i>d</i>. A base station <b>110</b> that relays communications may be referred to as a relay station, a relay base station, or a relay.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The UEs <b>120</b> may be dispersed throughout the wireless network <b>100</b>, and each UE <b>120</b> may be stationary or mobile. A UE <b>120</b> may include, for example, an access terminal, a terminal, a mobile station, or a subscriber unit. A UE <b>120</b> may be a cellular phone (for example, a smart phone), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem, a wireless communication device, a handheld device, a laptop computer, a cordless phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a tablet, a camera, a gaming device, a netbook, a smartbook, an ultrabook, a medical device, a biometric device, a wearable device (for example, a smart watch, smart clothing, smart glasses, a smart wristband, smart jewelry (for example, a smart ring or a smart bracelet)), an entertainment device (for example, a music device, a video device, or a satellite radio), a vehicular component or sensor, a smart meter/sensor, industrial manufacturing equipment, a global positioning system device, or any other suitable device that is configured to communicate via a wireless medium.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Some UEs <b>120</b> may be considered machine-type communication (MTC) or evolved or enhanced machine-type communication (eMTC) UEs. An MTC UE or an eMTC UE may include, for example, a robot, a drone, a remote device, a sensor, a meter, a monitor, or a location tag, that may communicate with a base station, another device (for example, a remote device), or some other entity. Some UEs <b>120</b> may be considered Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, or may be implemented as NB-IoT (narrowband IoT) devices. Some UEs <b>120</b> may be considered a Customer Premises Equipment. A UE <b>120</b> may be included inside a housing that houses components of the UE <b>120</b>, such as processor components or memory components. In some examples, the processor components and the memory components may be coupled together. For example, the processor components (for example, one or more processors) and the memory components (for example, a memory) may be operatively coupled, communicatively coupled, electronically coupled, or electrically coupled.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In general, any quantity of wireless networks <b>100</b> may be deployed in a given geographic area. Each wireless network <b>100</b> may support a particular RAT and may operate on one or more frequencies. A RAT may be referred to as a radio technology or an air interface. A frequency may be referred to as a carrier or a frequency channel. Each frequency may support a single RAT in a given geographic area in order to avoid interference between wireless networks of different RATs. In some cases, NR or 5G RAT networks may be deployed.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples, two or more UEs <b>120</b> (for example, shown as UE <b>120</b><i>a </i>and UE <b>120</b><i>e</i>) may communicate directly using one or more sidelink channels (for example, without using a base station <b>110</b> as an intermediary to communicate with one another). For example, the UEs <b>120</b> may communicate using peer-to-peer (P2P) communications, device-to-device (D2D) communications, a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) protocol (for example, which may include a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) protocol, a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) protocol, or a vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) protocol), or a mesh network. In such examples, a UE <b>120</b> may perform scheduling operations, resource selection operations, or other operations described elsewhere herein as being performed by the base station <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Devices of the wireless network <b>100</b> may communicate using the electromagnetic spectrum, which may be subdivided by frequency or wavelength into various classes, bands, or channels. For example, devices of the wireless network <b>100</b> may communicate using one or more operating bands. In 5G NR, two initial operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR1 (410 MHz-7.125 GHz) and FR2 (24.25 GHz-52.6 GHz). It should be understood that although a portion of FR1 is greater than 6 GHz, FR1 is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;Sub-6 GHz&#x201d; band in various documents and articles. A similar nomenclature issue sometimes occurs in connection with FR2, which is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band in documents and articles, despite being different from the extremely high frequency (EHF) band (30 GHz-300 GHz) which is identified by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The frequencies between FR1 and FR2 are often referred to as mid-band frequencies. Recent 5G NR studies have identified an operating band for these mid-band frequencies as frequency range designation FR3 (7.125 GHz-24.25 GHz). Frequency bands falling within FR3 may inherit FR1 characteristics or FR2 characteristics, and thus may effectively extend features of FR1 or FR2 into mid-band frequencies. In addition, higher frequency bands are currently being explored to extend 5G NR operation beyond 52.6 GHz. For example, three higher operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR4a or FR4-1 (52.6 GHz-71 GHz), FR4 (52.6 GHz-114.25 GHz), and FR5 (114.25 GHz-300 GHz). Each of these higher frequency bands falls within the EHF band.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">With the above examples in mind, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;sub-6 GHz,&#x201d; if used herein, may broadly represent frequencies that may be less than 6 GHz, may be within FR1, or may include mid-band frequencies. Further, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;millimeter wave,&#x201d; if used herein, may broadly represent frequencies that may include mid-band frequencies, may be within FR2, FR4, FR4-a or FR4-1, or FR5, or may be within the EHF band. It is contemplated that the frequencies included in these operating bands (for example, FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR4-a, FR4-1, or FR5) may be modified, and techniques described herein are applicable to those modified frequency ranges.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some aspects, the UE <b>120</b> may include a communication manager <b>140</b>. As described in more detail elsewhere herein, the communication manager <b>140</b> may perform measurements on a plurality of cells; order the plurality of cells based at least in part on multiple factors including at least a cell selection condition, the cell selection condition indicating a threshold for the measurement for cell selection; select, based at least in part on the ordering, a cell from the plurality of cells; and camp on the selected cell.

For example, the UE <b>120</b> may perform a cell search on frequencies of the acquisition database in an order corresponding to frequency scores of the frequencies.

In some aspects, N may be selected so that a camping time (such as a time associated with cell selection and camping) is not unduly extended. To search for cells, the UE <b>120</b> may perform measurements on the top N frequencies. The measurements may include, for example, RSRP measurements, RSRQ measurements, SINR measurements, or another form of measurement. The UE <b>120</b> may detect one or more cells. In this example, the UE <b>120</b> detects a plurality of cells. The UE <b>120</b> may detect a cell when the measurement associated with the cell satisfies one or more thresholds, such as an Srxlev threshold (which is a cell selection receive level value in dB) and an Squal threshold (which is a cell selection quality value in dB).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In a fourth operation <b>340</b>, the UE <b>120</b> may order detected cells based at least in part on cell scores of the detected cells. For example, the UE <b>120</b> may determine cell scores of the detected cells based at least in part on multiple factors. The multiple factors may include a cell selection condition (such as a condition associated with an Srxlev threshold or an Squal threshold), which may be used to identify the plurality of cells to be ordered, and one or more other factors. Examples of multiple factors, and the determination of the cell scores, are described in more detail in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The UE <b>120</b> may use the cell scores to prioritize cells for cell selection or reselection. For example, the UE <b>120</b> may order the detected cells based at least in part on their cell scores, and may attempt to camp on a cell with a highest cell score, then a cell with a second-highest cell score (if camping on the cell with the highest cell score fails), and so on.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The determination of the cell scores, and the ordering of the detected cells in accordance with the cell scores, may enable the UE <b>120</b> to prioritize camping on cells that may provide improved performance relative to a cell selected in accordance with a baseline approach, such as a cell associated with a most recent camping. For example, in some aspects, the cell score may be based at least in part on a strength associated with the measurement. In this scenario, the cell score may cause the UE <b>120</b> to prioritize cells associated with a higher measurement, whereas a baseline approach might consider any cell that satisfies the one or more thresholds for cell selection (such as Srxlev and Squal). As another example, in some aspects, the cell score may be based at least in part on a bandwidth (where a wider bandwidth is associated with a more favorable cell score). In this scenario, the cell score may cause the UE <b>120</b> to prioritize cells associated with a wider bandwidth, which may provide improved throughput. As yet another example, in some aspects, the cell score may be based at least in part on a recency of a measurement (that is, a length of time since a most recent measurement for a cell). In this scenario, the cell score may cause the UE <b>120</b> to prioritize cells associated with a more recent measurement that satisfies a threshold, which may lead to selection of a cell that is likely to remain acceptable for at least the near term.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In a fifth operation <b>350</b>, the UE <b>120</b> may attempt camping on one or more detected cells.

In some aspects, the UE <b>120</b> may attempt to camp on a first detected cell associated with a highest cell score (that is, a cell with a most favorable cell score). If camping is unsuccessful on the first detected cell, then the UE <b>120</b> may attempt to camp on a second detected cell associated with a second-highest cell score.

An exit condition indicates a condition for selecting a cell prior to determining all cell scores of a plurality of cells. If the exit condition is satisfied for a cell, the UE <b>120</b> may select the cell for camping. For example, the UE <b>120</b> may select a cell for which an exit condition is satisfied before determining cell scores for all of the selected cells. As another example, the UE <b>120</b> may select a cell for which an exit condition is satisfied before attempting to camp on each cell associated with a higher cell score than the cell for which the exit condition is satisfied. In some aspects, the exit condition may be associated with a threshold. For example, the exit condition may be associated with a threshold for one or more factors associated with the cell score. In some aspects, the threshold may be higher than the one or more thresholds for cell selection (such as Srxlev and Squal).
