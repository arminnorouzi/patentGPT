The strong UV light emitted by such lights can effectively kill bacteria and virus and shorten the sterilization time, so such UV lights achieve a good sterilization and disinfection effect. However, to ensure the safety performance, strong-UV lights in relevant technologies are usually designed into large-size cabinets, so such strong-UV lights occupy a large space and are relatively heavy, which brings installation difficulties and higher costs.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The foregoing content is only used for assisting in understanding the technical scheme of this invention, but does not mean the acknowledgement of that the above content is the current technology.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The main objective of the present invention is to provide a UV ceiling light to improve the installation convenience and use safety of UV lights and reduce the manufacture cost of UV lights.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To realize the above objective, the UV ceiling light in the present invention comprises:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">a mounting box and a mounting board, defining that the UV ceiling light is of a top-bottom structure, wherein there is a mounting space inside the mounting box, the bottom of the mounting box is also provided with avoiding holes connecting to the mounting space, the mounting board is provided on the upper end of the mounting box in a dismountable way, the mounting board is used for external installation of the UV ceiling light;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">driving power supply, provided in the mounting space;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">UV module electrically connecting to the driving power supply, with its upper end passes through the avoiding holes and extends into the mounting space;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">a grating component provided on the lower surface of the mounting box, including several separating plates provided at intervals from the top to the bottom, wherein several the separating plates are circular and are provided around the UV module horizontally, each two adjacent the separating plates form a light outlet in an enclosing way, and UV light emitted by the UV module is emitted horizontally via the light outlets; and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">a cover plate below the grating component.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other characteristics and corresponding beneficial effects of the present invention are elaborated in the latter part of the description.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The solving ideas of technical problems of the present invention and relevant product design solutions are as shown below: The strong-UV light is designed into a ceiling light structure. By making advantage of the installation characteristics of the ceiling light, the UV ceiling light in the present invention can be installed in the upper space more than 2.1 m above the ground for use. Thus, the UV ceiling light comprises a mounting board and a mounting box, wherein the mounting board mounting board is used for external installation of the ceiling light; the mounting box, as the main body of the light, connects to the mounting board in a dismountable way.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Different from ordinary lighting ceiling lights, the light source module of this UV ceiling light is not provided inside the mounting box, but the illuminating part of the UV module is provided at the bottom of the mounting box, so that the illuminating part can be exposed for sterilization, and the light cap (on the upper end of the UV module) and the driving power supply of the UV module are provided inside the mounting box.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, the periphery of the exposed illuminating part of the UV module is provided with a grating component, and the horizontal baffles of the grating component limit that the UV light emitted by the UV module only goes out horizontally. In such a case, horizontally emitted UV light can directly contact air outside the light to carry out sterilization and improve the sterilization efficiency; and, the UV light can be limited in the upper space, preventing damage to human bodies.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, the grating component can adopt the sheet stamping process to significantly reduce the weight of the grating component. In the meanwhile, baffles of the grating component are designed into circles to form a central hole where the UV module is located, which significantly decrease the size and weight of the light. Additionally, under the premise of guaranteeing the safety, the cost of the strong-UV light is reduced too. Taking 30 W UV downlight as an example, the size of the present invention can be decreased to &#x3c6;170&#xd7;1250 MM, enabling a compact structure, and its weight can be decreased to less than 1.7 Kg; however, the size of cabinet strong-UV lights in relevant technologies is more than 0.6 m or 1 m, so they are heavy and it is hard that they are installed by an individual person. Thus, the UV ceiling light in the present invention is characterized by a small size, light weight, low manufacture cost, convenient installation and safe use.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing the structure of an example of the UV light of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing the structure of another perspective of the UV ceiling light in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing the structure of the UV ceiling light in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> after removing the mounting board and the protective cover;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing the explosive structure of the UV ceiling light in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> from one perspective;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing the explosive structure of the UV ceiling light in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> from another perspective;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing the cross section of the UV ceiling light in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing the explosive structure of the mounting box and the mounting board of the UV ceiling light in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing the structure of the grating component of the UV ceiling light in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The shape, dimension, proportion or position relationship of parts of the product in drawings may be real data of embodiments and they are under protection of this invention.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">To make the objective, technical solutions and advantages of the present invention clearer and be understood better, further detailed descriptions of examples of the present invention are made in combination with drawings. Understandably, the specific examples described are just used to explain but not limit the present invention.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention provides a UV ceiling light.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one example of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, the UV ceiling light comprises a mounting box <b>11</b>, a mounting board <b>13</b>, driving power supply <b>2</b>, a UV module <b>3</b>, a grating component <b>4</b> and a cover plate <b>5</b>. Wherein, defining that the UV ceiling light is of a top-bottom structure, there is a mounting space <b>110</b> inside the mounting box <b>11</b>, the bottom of the mounting box <b>11</b> is provided with avoiding holes <b>111</b> connecting to the mounting space <b>110</b>, the mounting board <b>13</b> is provided on the upper end of the mounting box <b>11</b> in a dismountable way, the mounting board <b>13</b> is used for external installation of the UV ceiling light; the driving power supply <b>2</b> is provided inside the mounting space <b>110</b>; the upper end of the UV module <b>3</b> passes through the avoiding holes <b>111</b> and extends into the mounting space <b>110</b>, and the UV module <b>3</b> electrically connects to the driving power supply <b>2</b>; the grating component <b>4</b> is provided on the lower surface of the mounting box <b>11</b>, comprises several separating plates <b>41</b> provided at intervals from the top to the bottom, several separating plates <b>41</b> are circular (e.g. circular shape, square shape or other enclosing-type geometric shapes containing a central hole) and are provided around the UV module <b>3</b> horizontally, each two adjacent separating plates <b>41</b> from a light outlet <b>42</b> in an enclosing way, UV light emitted by the UV module <b>3</b> is emitted horizontally via the light outlets; the cover plate <b>5</b> is below the grating component <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one example of the present invention, the UV ceiling light can connect other devices via the mounting board <b>13</b>. For example, the mounting board <b>13</b> can connect to a roof, wall or other supporting surface directly or via a suspending pole, so that the UV ceiling light can be installed in the upper space.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The UV module <b>3</b> can be a gas discharge lamp tube composed of several hollow tubes connected in sequence, and the length of the hollow tubes is vertical to the separating plates <b>41</b>. Since UV lights with gas discharge UV lamp tubes, such as low-pressure mercury lamp, high and medium-pressure mercury lamp and xenon lamp, have high UV conversion efficiency, the sterilization effect of the UV ceiling light can be improved. The lamp tube is composed of several hollow tubes connected in sequence, which can increase the effective length of the lamp tube and then increase the power of the lamp tube; and shorten the length of the tube. In this example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the light adopts two 15 W lamp tubes, each lamp tube composes four parallel straight tubes connected in sequence, enabling the tube length to decrease by about 4 times; the tube can also be composed of two U-shaped tubes. After the tube length is shortened, the quantity of separating plates <b>41</b> used can be reduced, the ceiling light is lighter and has a more compact structure. Furthermore, the length of the hollow tubes is vertical to the separating plates <b>41</b>, enabling UV light to be emitted via the light outlets more easily and reducing energy loss. Additionally, compared with lights which adopt one hollow tube, the light which adopts several hollow tubes enables the intensity of UV light emitted via the same light outlet <b>41</b> to increase by times, so that the emission distance of UV light via the light outlets will be further and the sterilization scope of the light will be improved.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The UV module <b>3</b> can also adopt the UV LED which comprises UV LED lamp beads and a strip-shaped heat radiator. In such a case, the UV LED lamp beads are provided on the periphery of the heat radiator corresponding to light outlets <b>42</b> (that is, LED lamp beads are provided between two adjacent separating plates <b>41</b> to make UV light emitted by LED be directly emitted via light outlets and reduce loss of UV light caused by separating plates), and the length of the heat radiator is vertical to the separating plates.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The cover plate <b>5</b> can be used for fixing grating component <b>5</b>, mounting box <b>11</b> and UV module. To improve the light shielding effect and the locating effect of the cover plate <b>5</b> for the UV module <b>3</b>, the position on the cover plate <b>5</b> corresponding to the lower end of the UV module <b>3</b> can be provided with a groove <b>51</b>, and the lower part of the UV module <b>3</b> is against the inner side of the groove <b>51</b>. The groove <b>51</b> can adopt the flexible plastic, or can be coated with flexible materials, or can be composed with flexible parts. For example, an independent flexible plastic part or elastic part can be inserted in the groove. When the UV module <b>3</b> is a lamp tube, since most tubes are fragile (e.g. quartz), lamp tubes usually need to be fixed with glue, and the glue curing process is involved during production and assembly. Since flexible grooves <b>51</b> are preset, the lamp tube can be fixed directly with glue when assembling the ceiling light, without the need of waiting for curing of glue before assembly of the whole ceiling light. So, a lot of assembly time is saved and the productivity of lights is improved.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one example of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the UV ceiling light also comprises a connecting fitting <b>6</b> provided inside the mounting space <b>110</b> and connecting to the mounting box <b>11</b> in a dismountable way; at least one installation position <b>61</b> is formed at the position on the connecting fitting <b>6</b> corresponding to the avoiding holes <b>111</b>, there should be at least one UV module <b>3</b> fixed onto the installation position <b>61</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, the UV ceiling light is provided with two 15 W UV modules <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Understandably, the UV module <b>3</b> is not directly fixed onto the mounting box <b>11</b>, but adopts a connecting fitting <b>6</b>. The connecting fitting <b>6</b> is provided with installation positions <b>61</b> to facilitate this UV module <b>3</b> to be installed onto the connecting fitting <b>6</b>, and the connecting fitting <b>6</b> connects to the mounting box <b>11</b> in a dismountable way. As a result, when the UV module <b>3</b> breaks down, the connecting fitting <b>6</b> can be removed from the mounting box <b>11</b> to repair and replace the UV module <b>3</b>. And, via this connecting fitting <b>6</b>, one or several installation positions <b>61</b> can be set according to the demand for the power of the ceiling light, which facilitates extension of several UV modules <b>3</b>, derivation of different power types of ceiling lights and realization of series of products. Wherein, the connecting fitting <b>6</b> can be roughly a plate-shaped structure and can be provided with a through-hole to form an installation position <b>61</b>. Of course, the connecting fitting <b>6</b> can also be of a frame structure containing two clamping arms, and the space between two clamping arms forms an installation position <b>61</b>. In such a case, the upper end of the UV module <b>3</b> is clamped by two clamping arms.

In the meanwhile, such design enables them to be more compact inside the mounting space <b>110</b> and then decreases the overall size of the mounting box <b>11</b>.

In the meanwhile, the periphery of the light is of consistency, preventing limitation of the installation direction of the light; reducing the volume of the light and enabling a compact structure. Of course, the present invention is not limited to the above solutions.

With the mounting holes <b>133</b>, the mounting board can be installed by using a suspending pole to improve the convenience of external installation. Mounting holes <b>133</b> are in the strip shape, which enables the installation position to be adjusted to some extent. The cord hole <b>135</b> facilitates that the cord can be laid orderly to connect to the driving power supply <b>2</b>. Additionally, it needs to be explained that in other examples of the present invention, the mounting board <b>13</b> can directly connect to the mounting box <b>11</b> via screws.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one example of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the height of the mounting box <b>11</b> is H (2 mm&#x2264;H&#x2264;20 mm).

Several adjacent connecting poles <b>43</b> compose a group of connecting poles, that is, the grating component <b>4</b> can comprise several groups of connecting poles provided at intervals around the periphery of the separating plates <b>41</b>. For the same group of connecting poles, the fixing holes <b>119</b>, the first through-hole <b>431</b>, the third through-hole <b>411</b> and the second through-hole <b>53</b> are connected mutually, which enables fasteners <b>8</b> to be inserted into the fixing holes <b>119</b>, the first through-hole <b>431</b>, the third through-hole <b>411</b> and the second through-hole <b>53</b> to realize assembly and dismountable connection of the cover plate <b>5</b>, grating component <b>4</b> and mounting box <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Since the UV ceiling light is small, and the structural strength of the ceiling light is improved by using the connecting fitting <b>6</b>, the separating plates <b>41</b>, cover plate <b>5</b> and mounting box <b>11</b> can adopt the sheet stamping process to significantly reduce the weight and cost of the light.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Additionally, cover plate <b>5</b> and grating component <b>4</b> connect to mounting box <b>11</b> in a dismountable way, so that when one of them is damaged, they can be dismounted directly to repair or replace the damaged one. With the fixing holes <b>119</b>, the first through-hole <b>431</b>, the third through-hole <b>411</b> and the second through-hole <b>53</b>, the cover plate <b>5</b>, the grating component <b>4</b> and the mounting box <b>11</b> can be installed at one time by making the cord pass through the fasteners <b>8</b>, which significantly improves their installation efficiency. Wherein, the fixing holes <b>119</b> can be threaded holes, and the fasteners <b>8</b> can be screws. Screw fastening is simple and reliable, so screw fastening can guarantee the connection stability of the cover plate <b>5</b>, grating component <b>4</b> and mounting box <b>11</b>, simplify their connection structure and then improve their dismounting convenience. Of course, the fixing holes <b>119</b> can also be snap joint holes, and, in such a case, the fasteners <b>8</b> are clamping columns, enabling the fasteners <b>8</b> to be snap-fitted with the fixing holes <b>119</b>.

The fan can exhaust sterilized air in the upper space better to promote ventilation of air in the upper space and the lower space and expand the sterilization scope of the UV lights for the surrounding air. In such a way, the UV light can directly sterilize and disinfect horizontal air corresponding to the grating component <b>4</b>, and horizontal air and vertical air can be convected well too to realize indirect sterilization and disinfection of the air in areas beyond the horizontal layer corresponding to the grating component <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The above description only presents the preferred examples of the invention, and it is not for this reason that the patent scope of the invention is limited.
