Particularly when accuracies in the range of one micrometer and less are required, not only does the requirement for the accuracy of the placement machine increase, but more time is also required for the placement of individual elements. In known technologies, the semiconductor components, for example, in the form of chips or chiplets, are individually removed from a sawn wafer and transported, for example, by means of a vacuum tool to precisely align them in position relative to a target substrate and to connect them to the substrate by gluing, soldering, pressure or friction welding or by other methods. The chip size in this case is often very small, for example, having edge lengths of less than 250 &#x3bc;m. The handling of such chips makes special technical demands. The assembly times increase to an unacceptable level, especially when assembling larger units having thousands of chips.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">So far, solder-assisted self-adjustment has been known for the precise positioning of individual chips during assembly on a substrate, in which chips are each placed on a substrate, solder pads or wettable pads, which are also referred to as solder pads in this context, being provided on the chip side and on the substrate side, that is, metalized defined contact surfaces bonded together with the interposition of a solder material. During the remelting, that is, the melting and solidification of the solder material, said solder material wets the solder pads and, due to the surface tension, tries to minimize the total surface of the liquid solder material, the solder material exerting adjustment forces on the solder pads, aligning them together with the components symmetrically and precisely. In addition, stoppers and stops can be provided on the chip or substrate side, defining a relative positioning of the parts that are soldered together.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The solder-supported self-adjustment avoids long process times for the fine adjustment and the connection process for the individual chips because the individual chips are each aligned to the substrate in a single, parallel step and soldered thereto. However, there are still long assembly times for the plurality of individual chips on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">DE 102014201635 B3 discloses a method for equipping a substrate with semiconductor components, in which semiconductor components are first attached to a carrier by means of an adhesive and are transferred from said carrier to a substrate. In this case, the semiconductor components are held on the carrier by means of individual adhesive dots or adhesive patterns, simplifying subsequent separation of the carrier from the semiconductor components.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Against the background of the prior art, the present disclosure is based on the object of connecting a plurality of chips on a substrate with less assembly effort and shorter assembly time while maintaining undiminished reliability and positioning accuracy.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY/OVERVIEW</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure relates to a method for manufacturing a semiconductor arrangement having a substrate and a plurality of semiconductor components individually attached at target positions on the substrate, each of the semiconductor components having one or more solder pads and the substrate having a plurality of solder pads, each being connected to solder pads of the semiconductor components by means of a solder material</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">having the following steps:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">first, a plurality of separate semiconductor components are mechanically firmly connected to a common intermediate carrier,</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">after that, the intermediate carrier with the semiconductor components attached thereto is then arranged with respect to the substrate so that, at least for a majority of the semiconductor components, at least one solder pad of a semiconductor component lies opposite a solder pad of the substrate associated therewith, the solder pad of the semiconductor component and the solder pad of the substrate associated therewith forming a solder joint,</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">and after that, mutually associated solder pads of the semiconductor components and the substrate are connected to one another by melting and solidifying the solder material arranged between them, the intermediate carrier being kept freely movable in one or more directions during the phase in which the solder material is liquid, so that the surface tension of the solder material between the respective solder pads of the substrate and the semiconductor components sets a predetermined preferred position of the intermediate carrier relative to the substrate, in which the semiconductor components assume target positions relative to the substrate until the end of the adjustment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">For the sake of simplicity, the term solder pad was used in the same way for both contact sides. The correct description would be that on one side, there is a pad having a metalization that can be soldered plus solder, and on the opposite side, a pad having a metalization that can be soldered and sometimes additionally used with an oxide protection (gold). In principle, the solder can be present on the chips or on the opposite side (target substrate) and the solderable metalization opposite. In principle, however, it is also possible for the solder to be present on both sides. For the sake of simplicity, this is referred to as &#x201c;solder pads&#x201d; in general, but this means all of the cases mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">For this purpose, the solder material should advantageously be simultaneously liquid in one phase at all solder joints used for adjustment by the surface tension of the solder material, so that the intermediate carrier can be moved with respect to the substrate. In extreme cases, this can only be a single solder joint, but in many cases, a plurality of or all solder joints are to be connected. Any remaining solder joints that were not yet connected during the adjustment can be soldered in a further step.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The aim of the method is to arrange a plurality of semiconductor components in a precise position on a substrate and to attach them thereto and, optionally, to make electrical contact therewith. The solder pads in this case can be used to make contact with certain connections of the semiconductor components with the substrate or a conductor or an element on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, individual or some or all of the solder pads can be used for generating adjustment forces during the liquid phase when soldering the solder material. Depending on the initial positioning of the intermediate carrier in relation to the substrate, the surface tension of the liquefied solder material at each solder joint pulls the solder pads lying opposite one another towards one another, wherein their distance from one another tends to be reduced and/or if the solder pads are offset laterally, an adjustment force is generated, producing a displacement of the intermediate carrier with respect to the substrate transversely to the direction in which the intermediate carrier approaches the substrate or else parallel to the parting plane formed between the intermediate carrier and the substrate. This solder-assisted self-adjustment process has so far only been used for positioning individual chips or chiplets on a substrate. In the individual positioning and with the common positioning of a plurality of chips with respect to a substrate, attempts have hitherto only been made to optimize the positioning by means of optical adjustment and image analysis. It has been found that even with minor irregularities of individual solder pads in the arrangement of the chips on the intermediate carrier, a resulting adjustment force at a plurality of solder joints is favorable and sufficient for achieving a desired accuracy in the positioning of each individual semiconductor component located on the intermediate carrier. An advantage arising with this method is, for example, that the actual adjustment force can be applied through all or only through individual solder joints that arise on one or more and in particular on fewer than all chips to be positioned. The number of semiconductor components on the intermediate carrier can be greater than 5, in particular greater than 50, more particularly greater than 100, greater than 1000 or greater than 10,000. Corresponding positioning stops or stop elements only need to be provided in small numbers overall, for example, less than 1/10 of the number of semiconductor components, since merely positioning the intermediate carrier itself relative to the substrate with the desired accuracy is sufficient to position each individual semiconductor component. The solder depots can be produced very precisely, for example, by structured galvanic deposition on the solder pads, for example, using a tin-rich (Sn, SnAg) or indium-rich solder or a solder alloy. A particularly suitable high-melting solder alloy can be produced by depositing AuSn solder or gold and tin in two layers, the solder alloy being formed by remelting. Other known solder alloys are also suitable therefor.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The known reflow soldering method can be used as the soldering method, for example, in which initially solder depots in the form of a paste-like solder material or a solder preform (solder balls) are arranged either on the semiconductor components or on the substrate or on both elements and these are then liquefied by the action of heat. For this purpose, a flux can already be contained in the solder paste, it being possible for a gold/tin solder to be used as the solder material. The solder pads are usually formed by metalizations consisting, for example, of a material containing titanium and/or platinum and/or gold, in order to achieve optimized surface tension conditions when the solder material is liquefied. The solder material is applied to the solder pads in a suitable form before melting. The use of solder pastes is conceivable, as is that of solder balls. The use of a micro-galvanic or the vapor deposition of solders can provide higher accuracy at possibly less expense.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a particular implementation of the method according to the present disclosure, provision can be made, for example, for a plurality of the semiconductor elements to be arranged next to one another on the intermediate carrier in a plane or in a plurality of planes offset parallel to one another, and the planes of the intermediate carrier being aligned parallel to one or more mutually offset planes of the substrate, the intermediate carrier being initially held in one position relative to the substrate during the soldering process, in which an adjustment force is generated at one or more of the solder joints, in particular at fewer than all solder joints, by the surface tension of the solder material, the adjustment force being directed parallel to at least one of the planes. In this case, normally only one type of semiconductor chip is arranged on an intermediate carrier. For a plurality of semiconductor chip types, these are usually bonded to the substrate one after the other with an intermediate carrier, the previous semiconductors being thinner than those subsequent in order to prevent the intermediate carrier from colliding with the chips that have already been bonded.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With such a design of the method, it can then be provided that the positioning of the intermediate carrier during the soldering process causes the intermediate carrier to be displaced parallel to the plane or planes of the intermediate carrier by adjustment forces generated by surface tension of the solder material, such that at least one lateral stop element of one of the semiconductor components comes into contact with a lateral stop element of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">For example, a single stop element or a single stop surface or edge on one element per degree of freedom can then be sufficient for the relative positioning of the intermediate carrier and the substrate. This means that there is at least one stop element in each case in two directions within the plane of the substrate or of the intermediate carrier, it also being possible for a plurality of stop elements to be provided. However, it proves to be advantageous if the number of stop elements is significantly less than the number of semiconductor components to be positioned. In addition, it can be provided that during the soldering process, the intermediate carrier is brought close enough to the substrate so that one or two or more than two vertical stop elements of one or more semiconductor elements, the vertical stop element(s) limiting a relative movement perpendicularly to the plane or planes of the intermediate carrier, comes or come into contact with one or more common vertical stop elements of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">An edge or side face of a semiconductor component can also be regarded as a stop element. A vertical stop element on the intermediate carrier side can, for example, also stop on the surface of the substrate itself.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The distance between the semiconductor components and the substrate is thus also set to the desired accuracy while the semiconductor components are still connected to the intermediate carrier. For example, three vertical stop elements or three pairs of stop elements, of which one is arranged on the substrate and one on a semiconductor component, can be sufficient for the final and precise positioning of the entire intermediate carrier relative to the substrate. All individual semiconductor components are then also positioned as desired relative to the substrate with respect to the direction perpendicular to the plane of the intermediate carrier or substrate. Webs or rods, which are each arranged on the substrate or on semiconductor components, can serve as stop elements, and on the respective other side, said webs or rods or other stop elements can each come into contact on said opposite further stop elements, which, for example, can also be formed by the plane/surface of the substrate or, on the side of the intermediate carrier, the planes/surfaces of the semiconductor components themselves. Such stop elements can be glued or otherwise attached there to the semiconductor devices or the substrate, or they can be manufactured integral with said elements, for example, by epitaxy, lithographic masking and etching or other methods. Additive manufacturing processes such as 3D printing can also be used to apply such stop elements.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As part of the manufacturing method, it can further be provided that after the soldering process, the intermediate carrier is separated from some or all of the semiconductor components by the application of force with or without acting on an adhesive connecting the semiconductor components to the intermediate carrier. The adhesive can be acted on, for example, by laser ablation.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It can further be provided in the method that after the soldering process, the intermediate carrier is separated from some semiconductor components by the application of force with or without acting on an adhesive connecting the semiconductor components to the intermediate carrier and that the intermediate carrier together with one or more semiconductor components, which form or contain mechanical stops for the previous positioning of the intermediate carrier relative to the substrate, is removed from the substrate.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Since the individual semiconductor components are preferably attached to the intermediate carrier by means of an adhesive, on the one hand, the adhesive can be selected such that the intermediate carrier can be lifted off the semiconductor component or components against the adhesive force, the semiconductor components adhering more firmly to the substrate by means of the solder joints than to the intermediate carrier. For this purpose, provision can be made, for example, for the individual semiconductor components to be attached to the intermediate carrier only by means of individual, relatively small adhesive spots or adhesive areas, and/or it can also be provided for the adhesive connections to be weakened, for example, by making the adhesive brittle by means of the effect of electromagnetic radiation or other controllable external influences such as temperature influences or the like.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this case, the fixation of the individual semiconductor components on the intermediate carrier can also be selectively different in strength, so that individual semiconductor components are lifted off the substrate with the intermediate carrier, while other semiconductor components remain adhering to the substrate. For example, it can be provided that such semiconductor components that adhere to the intermediate carrier and are lifted off the substrate are used exclusively for the formation or provision of mechanical stops in order to position the semiconductor components and the intermediate carrier relative to the substrate during the soldering process.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The semiconductor components can also be separated from the intermediate carrier by irradiation with UV light through the then transparent intermediate carrier. The UV exposure causes the adhesive to lose its adhesive effect and the intermediate carrier can be separated from the semiconductor chips.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A laser, for example, a UV laser, can be used for reducing the adhesive force. Here, the transparent intermediate carrier is scanned from the rear side using the UV laser, the adhesive layer separating from the intermediate carrier.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a further configuration, it can be provided, for example, that the semiconductor components are first manufactured on a common starting wafer, that the starting wafer is then connected to a handling wafer such that each of the semiconductor components is held on the handling wafer, that the semiconductor components are then separated from one another by a method known per se and that the handling wafer is then used as an intermediate carrier.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In this case, the semiconductor components formed there are initially positioned very precisely and reliably relative to one another on the wafer as a result of the manufacturing process. The connection of the starting wafer to the handling wafer does not change anything here, and as a result the individual semiconductor components on the handling wafer are positioned just as precisely relative to one another. This state is retained even after the individual semiconductor components have been separated from one another by means of sawing, etching or other methods. If the handling wafer is then used as an intermediate carrier, all of the semiconductor components attached to the intermediate carrier can be positioned relative to the substrate by positioning a single semiconductor component or a few selected semiconductor components relative to a substrate. And if the semiconductor components are individually firmly connected to the substrate by one or more soldered connections, then the semiconductor components can be attached to the desired target positions on the substrate by a single adjustment process of the intermediate carrier relative to the substrate.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The manufacturing method described above can be further developed in that the semiconductor components, while they are each connected to the handling wafer on one of their sides, are connected to a further handling wafer on their other opposite side, that the connections to the handling wafer are then severed and that the further handling wafer then acts as an intermediate carrier.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The inclusion of an additional handling wafer after the semiconductor devices are attached on a first handling wafer allows the semiconductor devices to be accessed from the side initially connected to the first handling wafer. This side of the semiconductor devices can then be connected to the substrate.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In this case, the adhesive points of the further handling wafer can be structured such that only a selection of semiconductor components is temporarily fixed to the further handling wafer. If this selection of semiconductor components is separated from the first handling wafer, only this selection can be bonded to the substrate.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Due to the optional rebonding of the semiconductor components onto a further handling wafer, it is thus possible, within the scope of the method according to the present disclosure, to attach the semiconductor components to a substrate both with their front side and with their rear side.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition to the above-mentioned method and its configuration options, the present disclosure also relates to an arrangement having an intermediate carrier to which a plurality of semiconductor components are firmly connected and having a substrate, both the semiconductor components and the substrate having solder pads connected to one another by a solder material and mechanical stop elements relatively positioning the intermediate carrier with the semiconductor components relative to the substrate and the positioning of the solder pads on the semiconductor components and the substrate and the positioning of the stop elements being selected such that when the solder material arranged between opposite solder pads liquefies, adjustment forces are generated at at least one solder joint due to its surface tension, the adjustment forces holding the stop elements of the semiconductor devices and the substrate against each other.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">It can be provided here that at least one individual solder joint is designed such that said solder joint generates adjustment forces through the surface tension of the solder material, while other solder joints, for example, almost all other or actually all other solder joints, are designed such that they do not result in any adjustment forces, at least in the transverse direction, that is, in the plane of the substrate and/or the intermediate carrier. This is the case when the solder pads of each of the solder joints, with the exception of the individual solder joint, are directly opposite one another and without any lateral offset. For those solder joints that generate adjustment forces, the solder pads of the individual solder joint are laterally displaced from one another, so that the solder material in liquefied form assumes the shape of a sheared-off truncated cone. It is to be expected that practically all solder joints will generate forces when the solder material is liquefied, bringing the two solder pads closer together, so that in most cases, it will make sense to also provide vertical stop elements to define the distance between the individual semiconductor components and the substrate.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the drawings, which are not necessarily drawn to scale, like numerals may describe similar components in different views.

The chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are initially attached to the intermediate carrier <b>4</b> (conveyor) by means of the adhesive. In a previous step, the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, after being connected to the intermediate carrier <b>4</b>, are separated from a common starting wafer in which they were manufactured. This process is described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b></figref>. At the end of the process, the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are positioned relative to one another on the intermediate carrier <b>4</b> as they were previously on the starting wafer.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The individual chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> carry solder pads or metalizations <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, each forming individual solder joints <b>6</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>13</b> with opposite solder pads <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> of the substrate <b>1</b> and a solder material <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the solder pads <b>6</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>7</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>9</b>, <b>13</b> are each offset a bit from one another horizontally and parallel to the joining plane between the substrate and the intermediate carrier in the top representation of the configuration. A solder material is indicated symbolically in the form of balls <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> between the individual pairs of solder pads. In fact, one would use electroplated and remelted solder, which sits on the pad as a spherical segment (cap). The solder material is normally initially deposited as a solder bump or solder supply either on a solder pad of the substrate or on a solder pad of a chip <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> or on both.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">During the soldering process, which typically takes place by reflow soldering, the solder material, which is initially present, for example, in the form of a deposited solder depot, is liquefied, so that the configuration is as shown in the second partial figure from the top of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, where the solder pads <b>6</b>, <b>10</b> are connected to one another by the liquefied solder material <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Due to the surface tension of the liquid solder material <b>14</b>, forces act, tending to reduce the surface area of the liquid solder material. As a result, the intermediate carrier <b>4</b>, together with the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, is displaced towards the substrate and to the right with respect to the substrate <b>1</b>, so that the solder pads <b>6</b>, <b>10</b> are brought closer together in pairs until a symmetrical configuration is obtained, as shown in the third partial figure from the top of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The solder material <b>14</b> forms a vertical column there between the solder pads <b>6</b>, <b>10</b> (not shown in detail) of the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and the substrate <b>1</b>. A self-adjustment of the chips with respect to the substrate, which is known per se, thus takes place as a result of the reflow soldering. In a last step, the intermediate carrier <b>4</b> is then detached from the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> attached to the substrate <b>1</b>, for which purpose the adhesive layer <b>5</b> can be destroyed or decomposed beforehand by the effect of electromagnetic radiation, for example, laser radiation. For this purpose, it can be provided that the intermediate carrier <b>4</b> is permeable to the radiation used and consists of a corresponding material. Alternatively or additionally, it can also be provided that the adhesive layer <b>5</b> is not continuous but consists of individual adhesive dots or adhesive patterns, so that the adhesive strength is limited and the intermediate carrier <b>4</b> can be detached from the substrate <b>1</b> without tearing off the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The configuration in which the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are individually attached to the substrate <b>1</b> by the solder material and are contacted is shown in the bottom partial figure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In three representations, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows different states during the positioning of chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> with respect to a substrate <b>1</b>, the positioning in the vertical direction between the chips and the substrate being the focus there. The uppermost of the three representations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, fastened to the intermediate carrier <b>4</b>, as a possible variant, fixed, vertical stops in the form of metal blocks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> being integrated into the soldering material <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> at the soldering joints <b>6</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>8</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Said metal blocks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> are not melted during the soldering process, so that when the solder liquefies, which is shown in the second representation from the top in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are drawn to the substrate <b>1</b> by the surface tension of the liquefied solder material until the solder pads <b>6</b>, <b>10</b> have approached each other to the smallest possible distance, the stops <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> being clamped between them. In this state, the solder material is then solidified again by cooling, so that the positioned configuration of the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> with the substrate <b>1</b> is stabilized in this state. The intermediate carrier <b>4</b> is then removed by destroying it or by removing the adhesive <b>5</b>, so that, as shown in the lower representation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, only the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> remain, each individually attached to the substrate <b>1</b> by means of the solder connections. The distance between the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and the substrate <b>1</b> is then given by the vertical stops/metal blocks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> integrated into the respective solder joints.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a configuration with four partial representations, in which the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are positioned horizontally with respect to the substrate <b>1</b>, the surface tension forces of the solder being used during the soldering process and the exact end position being defined by separate stop bodies <b>20</b> attached to the substrate in the example shown. Corresponding stop bodies could just as well be attached to the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. The relative positioning of the substrate <b>1</b> to the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> takes place by striking an edge of a chip <b>2</b> against the stop body/stop element <b>20</b>. In the second representation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the liquefied solder material is shown between the respective solder pads of the solder joints, the liquefied solder exerting a force on the intermediate carrier <b>4</b> and the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, the force being indicated by the arrow <b>21</b> and by which the intermediate carrier with the chips is displaced to the right in the figure.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the third representation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the intermediate carrier with the chips has already been displaced horizontally to such an extent that the edge of the chip <b>2</b> has abutted against the stop body <b>20</b> and is in contact therewith. Even in this state, the solder joints are still shown such that the solder pads <b>6</b>, <b>10</b> are not symmetrically opposite one another, so that the liquefied solder material <b>14</b> still tends to generate a positioning/displacement force in this state, ensuring that the chips and the intermediate carrier are held stably in the target position and pressed against the stop body <b>20</b>. After the solder material <b>14</b> has solidified, the intermediate carrier <b>4</b> can then be removed with or without the adhesive layer <b>5</b>, so that, as shown in the bottom representation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the individual chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> remain independently attached to the substrate and electrically contacted therewith. It is important to note here that not each of the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> strikes a stop element individually, but that a small number of stop elements <b>20</b> can be used to position one or fewer of the chips directly with respect to the substrate, a positioning of all the chips or chiplets in the target positions being indirectly achieved by the common attachment of the chips or also chiplets on the intermediate carrier <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a configuration similar to that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> being aligned on the substrate <b>1</b> by means of lateral stops <b>20</b>. The individual solder joints on the various chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are of different types, a solder joint having extraordinarily large solder pads on the right chip <b>3</b> being shown as an example. The result is that positioning forces of different strength are generated by the liquefied solder through the individual solder joints. With the same lateral offset of the solder pads, the positioning force is lower for a large solder joint <b>22</b> than for a plurality of small solder joints, which are represented by the solder material <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> in the second representation from the top of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The solder joint <b>22</b> can also be designed such that it does not exert any resultant force on the intermediate carrier. Overall, the resultant force of the individual solder joints with liquefied solder material pulls the intermediate carrier with the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> into an end position which, according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, is given by a stop element <b>20</b> against which the chip <b>2</b> strikes. The right edge of the chip <b>2</b> thus forms a stop element on the side of the intermediate carrier. After removal of the intermediate carrier <b>4</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the individual chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> remain attached to the substrate <b>1</b> individually and in each case.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the positioning of chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> with respect a substrate <b>1</b> in three representations one below the other, a stop body <b>23</b> being provided for the vertical positioning of the chips on the substrate. In this example, unlike in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the stop body <b>23</b> is not integrated into the solder joints or solder bumps, but instead exists independently of the solder joints between the chip <b>2</b> and the substrate <b>1</b>. Said stop body <b>23</b> is attached to the substrate <b>1</b> in the example shown, but could just as well be attached to the chip <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the example shown, the surface of the chip <b>2</b> facing the substrate also forms a stop element.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a further variant, spacer elements functioning as stop elements could also be provided both on a chip <b>2</b> and on the substrate, said spacer elements also being able to abut and rest against one another.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to the second representation from the top of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, as part of the liquefaction of the solder material <b>14</b>, the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> with the intermediate carrier <b>1</b> are brought closer to the substrate by the surface tension forces of the solder material until the chip <b>2</b> abuts against the stop element <b>23</b> and is held in contact with the stop element by the surface tension. The solder material <b>14</b> is cooled and solidified in this state. The intermediate carrier <b>1</b> can then be lifted off or with the adhesive layer <b>5</b> so that the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are each positioned independently of one another and remain connected to the substrate <b>1</b> and electrically contacted.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In four representations arranged one below the other, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a positioning of chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> with respect to a substrate <b>1</b>, a lateral stop body <b>20</b> being provided on the substrate, against which a chip <b>2</b> abuts as part of the effect of surface tension forces during the soldering process. The top representation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the solder joints on the chip <b>3</b> with a solder supply that has not yet liquefied and is arranged between the pairs of solder pads. In the second representation from the top of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the solder material <b>19</b> is then liquefied, so that the intermediate carrier <b>1</b> with the chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> is pulled by surface tension in the representation to the right in the direction of the arrow <b>21</b> parallel to the joining plane, until the chip <b>2</b> strikes the stop body <b>20</b>, as shown in the third representation from the top of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In this position, the solder material <b>19</b> is cooled so that it solidifies and the chip <b>3</b> is positioned in the target position with respect to the substrate <b>1</b>. The special feature of this configuration is that the chip <b>2</b> has no solder joints and is therefore not connected to the substrate by the solder material, but only serves to position the chip <b>3</b> on the substrate <b>1</b> by interacting with the stop element <b>20</b>. Accordingly, after removal of the intermediate carrier <b>1</b>, only the chip <b>3</b> remains attached to the substrate <b>1</b> and contacted therewith. The stop element <b>20</b> is used for positioning in the horizontal direction, as indicated by the arrows <b>21</b> in the figures, while further stop bodies can be used for positioning in the vertical direction perpendicular to the arrows <b>21</b>. However, stop bodies or stop elements can also be provided, which can simultaneously serve as the stop in different directions and are shaped accordingly. Basically, effort can be saved by the fact that the number of stop bodies both for the vertical positioning, that is, perpendicular to the joining plane between the intermediate carrier or the chips and the substrate, and parallel to said joining plane is less than the number of separate chips or chiplets to be positioned, in particular less than half the number of chips or less than 10% of the number of chips. The adhesive <b>5</b>, with which the intermediate carrier is connected to the individual chips <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, is selected such that said adhesive is stable at the soldering temperature, so that the chips do not shift on the intermediate carrier/conveyor. The adhesive can then later be released by other means, such as embrittlement by exposure to electromagnetic radiation or simply by the application of force, particularly if the adhesive layer is not designed to be continuous.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the solder joints on individual chips or a plurality of solder joints on a chip can be designed differently, some of the solder joints being able to be designed to optimize adjustment forces, while other solder joints have, for example, large contact areas with large solder pads. to be used later for good adhesion of the chips to the substrate, for high current consumption or for good thermal contact for cooling. The metalization of the solder pads can, for example, be made of titanium, platinum or gold in a particularly favorable manner in order to enter into a particularly deep connection with the solder material, also forming a high surface tension. The solder depots, which can advantageously be deposited on the solder pads, can contain gold/tin alloys, for example. If no mechanical stop elements are provided for stopping in the horizontal direction, the adjustment is made by the soldering process and the acting surface tension such that the solder pads are arranged one above the other and symmetrically to one another in the state of equilibrium. In this case, the deposition of the corresponding metalizations to create the solder pads must take place in advance such that the solder pads assume the corresponding relative position to one another at the target position of the chips on the substrate. To accommodate the individual chips from the starting wafer to the intermediate carrier, the adhesive material can be structured or printed onto the intermediate carrier, for example. The chips can then be transferred from the starting wafer to the intermediate carrier and held there by the adhesive. The intermediate carrier can then also be divided into what are known as conveyor tiles, which each carry a plurality of semiconductor components and can be positioned individually with respect to the substrate in accordance with the method according to the present disclosure. The individual sections of the intermediate carrier can then also be removed from the chips separately from one another. For example, using the method described, large numbers of chips can be distributed equidistantly on a substrate surface, as is necessary for optical displays or screens in which large numbers of LED arrangements have to be uniformly distributed, fixed and contacted on the surface of a substrate.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a starting wafer <b>25</b> in or on which a plurality of semiconductor components <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> have already been created by a method known per se. The semiconductor components are arranged in the starting wafer in the form of a one- or two-dimensional matrix with defined distances from one another.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows that a handling wafer <b>4</b><i>a </i>is placed on the starting wafer.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, an adhesive in the form of adhesive surface segments <b>5</b> is arranged between the wafers <b>4</b><i>a, </i><b>25</b> such that the respective semiconductor components <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are connected to the handling wafer <b>4</b><i>a </i>by the adhesive.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the next step, the starting wafer <b>25</b> is sawn up or divided by etching, so that the semiconductor components then individually adhere to the handling wafer, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>. In a next step, the handling wafer <b>4</b><i>a </i>with the semiconductor components <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> can be bonded to a further handling wafer <b>4</b><i>b </i>by means of a further adhesive layer <b>5</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Thereafter, the handling wafer <b>4</b><i>a </i>can be separated from the semiconductor components <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, so that the components <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> can now be connected to a substrate with their upper side that has become free, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>. In this case, the components <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> must have solder pads on their exposed upper sides for soldering to the substrate.
