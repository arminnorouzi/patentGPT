Meanwhile, currently commercialized major displays are represented by a liquid crystal display (LCD) and an organic light-emitting diode (OLED).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the LCD has problems in which the response time is slow and it is difficult to realize flexibility, and the OLED has problems in which the lifespan thereof is short and the production yield thereof is low.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, a light-emitting diode (LED), which is a well-known semiconductor light-emitting element that converts current into light, has been used as a light source for displaying an image in electronic devices including information communication devices together with a GaP:N-based green LED, starting with commercialization of a red LED using a GaAsP compound semiconductor in 1962. Therefore, a method of solving the above-described problems by implementing a display using the semiconductor light-emitting element may be proposed. Such a light-emitting diode has various advantages, such as a long lifespan, low power consumption, excellent initial driving characteristics, and high vibration resistance, compared to a filament-based light-emitting element.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, when a light-emitting module in which light-emitting elements are arranged in one dimension is rotated and driven at a high speed according to the angle thereof, various letters, graphics, and videos may be recognized by a human due to an afterimage effect.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In general, when still images are continuously displayed at a rate of 24 or more sheets per second, a viewer recognizes the same as a video. A conventional image display device, such as a CRT, an LCD, or a PDP, displays still images at a rate of 30 to 60 frames per second, so a viewer is capable of recognizing the same as a video. As the number of still images displayed per second increases, a viewer may experience smoother video.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As the number of still images displayed per second increases, a viewer may experience smoother video, and as the number of still images displayed per second decreases, it becomes difficult to implement smooth video.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One of the tasks to be accomplished in display devices, which are designed to realize an image by rotating light-emitting elements, is to improve a stereoscopic effect. A rotary-type display device has a characteristic in that the display thereof is transparent due to the nature of the structure thereof. Accordingly, it is possible to realize a multi-layer display surface using the characteristic.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In realization of a rotary-type display capable of conveying a stereoscopic effect using multiple layers, a task to be accomplished is to enable a moving image to be played while preventing light-emitting element arrays for realizing a display from overlapping each
