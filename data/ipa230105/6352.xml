The transmission speed and capacity have increased significantly, and the frequencies used have also become higher. For faster transmission speeds and greater capacities, GHz frequency bands are utilized, that is, a millimeter-wave region. Therefore, the millimeter wave will be a main communication technology for next generation, or referred as 5G. Amongst all components, the liquid crystal polymer(LCP) substrates for carrying components and transmitting signals play an extremely important role.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">On the other hand, high directivity and high gain are required in the design of millimeter-wave antennas. Current technologies are insufficient in gain and band width. An array antenna has been proposed to increase the antenna gain in some literatures to overcome foregoing disadvantages. However, the array antenna has relatively narrow bandwidth and requires additional process to manufacture, hence manufacturing costs and antenna sizes are increased. Therefore, such an antenna structure is still to be improved.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a coupled array antenna for a millimeter wave with a frequency band in a range of 55 GHz to 72.5 GHz where high directivity and high gain are required. In view of the aforementioned requirements, a multi-layer patch antenna coupling structure is proposed to increase gain and bandwidth of the patch antenna.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The coupled array antenna of the present invention includes a feeding network layer and a plurality of patch antennas disposed on the feeding network layer. A first patch antenna is disposed on the feeding network layer, a second patch antenna is disposed above and coupled to the first patch antenna, and other patch antennas are sequentially disposed above and each coupled to its previous patch antenna.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an embodiment of the present invention, the coupled array antenna further includes a three-layer substrate having a first layer, a second layer, and a third layer. The feeding network layer is disposed on the surface of the first layer, the first patch antenna is disposed on the surface of the second layer on top of the first layer, and the second patch antenna is disposed on the surface of the third layer on top of the second layer. The total thickness of the three-layer array antenna with substrate is 400 &#x3bc;m. The distance between two adjacent layers of the circuit substrate falling in a range of 150 &#x3bc;m to 250 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment of the present invention, the feeding network layer further includes a plurality of metal circuits.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment of the present invention, the first patch antenna is slightly larger than the second patch antenna. The length of any side of the second patch antenna is 85% to 95% of a length of a corresponding side of the first patch antenna.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment of the present invention, the first patch antenna and the second patch antenna are patch antennas with the same shape. In other embodiments, the first patch antenna and the second patch antenna may alternatively have different geometric shapes such as square, rectangle, circle, ellipse, triangle, sector, ring or ring sector.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment of the present invention, the first patch antenna has a half-wavelength resonance condition.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment of the present invention, the first patch antenna has a first blind hole of 0.1 mm in diameter, and the second patch antenna has no blind hole.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment of the present invention, the wavelength of the second patch antenna is 0.90 to 0.99 times of the wavelength of the first patch antenna.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention further provides a coupled array antenna device. At least two coupled array antennas according to any one of the foregoing embodiments are connected in series through microstrips.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">To conclude, although a single-layer patch antenna has a high gain, but the bandwidth is insufficient. For example, a patch antenna gain is 7.16 dBi and a bandwidth ratio is 5.3% at 60 GHz. To increase an antenna bandwidth, a patch antenna with a wavelength 0.93 times of an original wavelength is added 200 &#x3bc;m above the single-layer patch antenna. A three-layer substrate is used to enable the patch antennas to be coupled without contacting. The antenna gain is 6.9 dBi and the bandwidth ratio can be increased to 21.7% at 60 GHz. When a coupled patch antenna is added above a single-layer patch antenna as a set of device, the antenna gain can be further increased to 9.3 dBi and the bandwidth ratio to 11.7% at 60 GHz. When coupled array antennas are arranged to a 1&#xd7;8 feeding network, the antenna bandwidth is greatly increased where a pass band covers a range of 57.06 GHz to 73 GHz, and the antenna gain approaches to 16 dBi. The patch antennas discussed above utilize LCP flexible sheet for their relatively low loss and low water absorption features that prevent the patch antennas from deforming due to moisture.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a schematic structural top view of a single-layer patch antenna.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a schematic structural side view of a single-layer patch antenna.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a schematic structural top view of a coupled array antenna according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a schematic structural side view of a coupled array antenna according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a schematic structural top view of a coupled array antenna device according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a schematic structural side view of a coupled array antenna device according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a frequency response diagram of antenna return loss of a coupled array antenna device according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a schematic diagram of a 3D radiation field pattern of a single-layer patch antenna.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a schematic diagram of a 3D radiation field pattern of a coupled array antenna according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> is a schematic diagram of a 3D radiation field pattern of a coupled array antenna device according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a 1&#xd7;8 coupled array antenna device according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a frequency response diagram of antenna return loss of a 1&#xd7;8 coupled array antenna device according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a 3D radiation field pattern of a 1&#xd7;8 coupled array antenna device according to the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">To make the foregoing features and advantages of the present invention clearer and more comprehensible, specific embodiments are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> are a schematic structural top view and a schematic structural side view of a single-layer patch antenna respectively.
