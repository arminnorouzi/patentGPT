When doing a laminectomy, the performing surgeon removes the posterior arch, which removes the fixation point for muscles to attach. As a result, the posterior tension band is lost and kyphosis can occur over time because the extensor muscles in the cervical and lumbar spine cannot maintain tension to keep the correct curvature.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Additionally, laminectomy with fusion is another posterior approach that decompresses the spinal cord, but does not lead to spinal destabilization as in the case with a laminectomy without fusion. However, if the surgeon does not use any product to protect the spinal cord, muscles may attach to the dura and scar tissue will form. Such epidural scarring can make it very difficult for a reoperation and can be irritating to some patients.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, some surgeons believe in a less invasive approach by preserving the posterior elements and performing a laminoplasty. However, with laminoplasty, surgeons are not able to achieve bilateral decompression as in the case with performing a laminectomy. In addition, the potential for the posterior arch to cave in on the implant and compress the spinal cord is a possibility.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there exists a need for a lamina plate assembly to protect the patient's spinal cord and to provide an attachment point or attachment points for muscles following laminectomy or laminoplasty to restore the posterior tension bands as well as to provide surgeons with another option to easily achieve direct decompression of the spinal cord with similar results as the more difficult laminoplasty procedure, as well as to restore the patient's posterior profile for cosmetic purposes.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one embodiment, a lamina plate assembly may be configured to provide lamina support following laminectomy in cervical and lumbar cases.

The lamina plate assemblies <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> may be secured with fasteners or pedicle screws, for example.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Static lamina plates are used as lamina support following a laminectomy in cervical and lumbar cases and can be used in standalone applications to preserve motion or applications with traditional CT or MCS systems to help promote fusion. The primary purpose of a lamina plate is to protect the spinal cord and to provide structure and an attachment point for muscles following a laminectomy to restore the posterior tension band. Secondary applications of static lamina plates are to provide surgeons another option to easily achieve direct decompression of the spinal cord with similar results to the more difficult laminoplasty procedure, and to restore the patient's posterior profile for cosmetic purposes. Prior to using the lamina plate, the surgeon performs a typical laminectomy. The lamina plate can then be quickly tacked on to the patient's spine for structure and protection.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The arched shape of static lamina plate assemblies <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> replace posterior elements (C3-L5) that connect to the lateral masses, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Assemblies <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> can be provided in various sizes to match the patient's particular anatomy. For particular standalone applications, as discussed below, assemblies <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> can have oblong, adjacent, or in-line holes, depending on the patient's anatomy, as well as the web segment that is being replaced. Additionally, for infusion cases, assemblies <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> can be provided with polyaxial screw holes for both cervical and lumbar segments, as well as for rod-to-rod connections.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">According to one embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, a lamina plate assembly <b>100</b> (&#x201c;assembly <b>100</b>&#x201d;) may include a generally elongate body <b>102</b> having a first free end <b>104</b>, a second free end <b>106</b>, disposed away from first free end <b>104</b>, and a posterior portion <b>108</b> disposed between first free end <b>104</b> and second free end <b>106</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, body <b>102</b> may be constructed from a biocompatible metal, such as, for example, commercially pure titanium, although those skilled in the art will recognize that body <b>102</b> can be constructed from other biocompatible materials as well. Titanium can be a desirable material because it has been shown to be a good material for tissue ongrowth. As a result, muscle can reattach to assembly <b>100</b> to reform the posterior tension band and to help maintain cervical or lumbar lordosis. Body <b>102</b> can be formed as a flat sheet, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and then bent into an arcuate or curved shape as desired, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, according to the anatomy of the particular patient.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Body <b>102</b>, with posterior portion <b>108</b>, extends along a longitudinal axis <b>110</b>. Posterior portion <b>108</b> also has side edges <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> that extend in a straight line between first free end <b>104</b> and second free end <b>106</b> parallel to longitudinal axis <b>110</b> and to each other.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Further, posterior portion <b>108</b> of body <b>102</b> includes a plurality of through-openings, or &#x201c;windows&#x201d; <b>116</b> disposed between first free end <b>104</b> and second free end <b>106</b> that can be used as suture holes for surgically attaching muscles (not shown) to assembly <b>100</b> for more rigid fixation. Alternatively, windows <b>116</b> can be used to apply graft material (not shown) through assembly <b>100</b> and, still alternatively, windows <b>116</b> can be used to allow for bone growth therethrough after insertion into the patient. An additional advantage of windows <b>116</b> is to allow the surgeon to visualize the cervical and lumbar canal during surgery.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">A first securing portion <b>118</b> is connected to first free end <b>104</b>, and extends away from body <b>102</b>. Similarly, a second securing portion <b>120</b> is connected to second free end <b>106</b>, and extends away from body <b>102</b>. Each of first securing portion <b>118</b> and second securing portion <b>120</b> includes an opening <b>122</b> formed therein sized to allow a securing member, such as, for example, a screw <b>60</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, to extend therethrough and secure each of the securing portion <b>118</b> and second securing portion <b>120</b> to vertebra <b>50</b> (e.g., at the lateral masses). Securing portions <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> can be in the form of securing feet that are fixedly secured to first free end <b>104</b> and second free end <b>106</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Different embodiments of securing portions can be provided to secure assembly <b>100</b> to vertebra <b>50</b>.

Consequently, in an alternative embodiment of a static lamina assembly <b>200</b> (&#x201c;assembly <b>200</b>&#x201d;), shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>8</b></figref>, and <b>9</b>, instead of having straight edges <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> as shown in assembly <b>100</b> above, a posterior portion <b>208</b> of assembly <b>200</b> is an elongate member that initially extends in a plane (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) and has a first edge <b>212</b> and a second free edge <b>214</b> that both extend to form an arcuate portion between first free end <b>204</b> and second free end <b>206</b>, which results in an angled assembly <b>200</b> when assembly <b>200</b> is bent to the condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>9</b></figref>. Assembly <b>200</b> can be used on patients in which a preserved posterior arch is obstructing installation of assembly <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">While assembly <b>200</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref> as having securing portion <b>120</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, assembly <b>200</b> (as well as assembly <b>100</b>), can have securing portion <b>220</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, incorporating a generally oblong opening <b>222</b> that allows for lateral adjustment of assembly <b>200</b> or assembly <b>100</b>, as desired or needed by the inserting surgeon. Further, while assembly <b>200</b> incorporates securing portion <b>220</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, those skilled in the art will recognize that both assembly <b>100</b> and assembly <b>200</b> can incorporate any of the securing portions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>10</b></figref>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows assembly <b>200</b> being used with polyaxial screws <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, using securing portion <b>120</b> as an example, each of the first and second securing portions described above can include a ridge <b>160</b> extending outwardly from a bottom surface <b>158</b> of securing portion <b>120</b>. Each ridge <b>130</b> is adapted to lag the first securing foot and the second securing foot into vertebra <b>50</b>. Ridge <b>160</b> is used to help with internal fixation prior to screw placement and four fixation post-screw placement to help lag the particular assembly <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> into vertebra <b>50</b>. Such feature allows assembly <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> to sink into the bone of vertebra <b>50</b> and to promote fusion between assembly <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> and the surface of the bone for more rigid fixation.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">While ridge <b>160</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> as generally following along the outer perimeter of the securing portion, those skilled in the art will recognize that ridge <b>160</b> can be located anywhere along bottom surface <b>158</b>, and can be broken into a plurality of separate ridges or can be the single ridge <b>160</b> as shown.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, as well as to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>15</b></figref>, a lamina plate assembly <b>300</b> (&#x201c;assembly <b>300</b>&#x201d;) can be used with a rod <b>64</b> and polyaxial screws <b>62</b> two fuse adjacent vertebrae <b>50</b> to each other.

The lamina plate assembly <b>1300</b> can have a double bend that matches the posterior anatomy of the lamina (C2-L5). In some embodiments, the lamina plate assembly <b>1300</b> can be titanium sprayed for surface roughness to allow for bony ongrowth at thicker regions and bone ingrowth at the lateral mass feet and lamina. Advantageously, the lamina plate assembly may be used for standalone applications to preserve motion or for fusion as an adjunct to CT, pedicle screw or MCS (midline cortical screw) systems and can adjust to various sizes and be bent to match the patient's anatomy.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">In some embodiments, hinged assemblies such as the lamina plate assembly <b>1300</b> provide a number of advantages, including increased stability. Advantageously, in laminoplasty procedures, the assembly <b>1300</b> offers bilateral support to the lamina as opposed to only offering support on the side lifted open. While in some laminoplasty cases, an extra hinge plate can provide support for the contralateral side of the lamina in cases where the joint is weakened or cut, the present lamina plate assembly <b>1300</b> reduces the use of this extra step. Additionally, the lamina plate <b>1300</b> can be used for various types of laminoplasty. In some embodiments, one or two spacers can be added to the lamina plate assembly <b>1300</b> to provide additional support. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the lamina screw holes can be used as suture holes to give surgeons the ability to reattach the posterior musculature.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">It will be further understood that various changes in the details, materials, and arrangements of the parts which have been described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of this invention may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention as expressed in the following claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
