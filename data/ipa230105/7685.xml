id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to the technical field of wireless communication and more particularly to reporting random access performance of a user equipment to an access node of a wireless communication network.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Next generation systems are expected to support a wide range of use cases with varying requirements ranging from fully mobile devices to stationary Internet of Things (IoT) or fixed wireless broadband devices. The traffic pattern associated with many use cases is expected to consist of short or long bursts of data traffic with varying length of waiting period in between. This waiting period is herein referred to as &#x201c;inactive state.&#x201d; In New Radio (NR), both License Assisted Access (LAA) and standalone unlicensed operation are to be supported.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Allowing unlicensed networks (i.e., networks that operate in shared or unlicensed spectrum) to effectively use the available spectrum is an attractive approach to increasing system capacity. Although unlicensed spectrum does not match the qualities of the licensed regime, solutions that allow an efficient use of the unlicensed spectrum as a complement to licensed deployments have the potential to bring great value to Third Generation Partnership project (3GPP) operators, and, ultimately, to the 3GPP industry as a whole. For this reason, 3GPP has spent significant effort in specifying operations for LAA in Long Term Evolution (LTE), and NR-Unlicensed (NR-U) in NR.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When operating in unlicensed spectrum many regions in the world require a device to sense the medium as free before transmitting. This operation is often referred to as Listen Before Talk (LBT). There are many different flavors of LBT, depending on which radio technology the device uses and which type of data it wants to transmit at the moment. Common for all known flavors is that the sensing is done in a particular channel (corresponding to a defined carrier frequency) and over a predefined bandwidth. For example, in the 5 GHz band, the sensing is done over 20 MHz channels. Many devices are capable of transmitting (and receiving) over a wide bandwidth including multiple sub-bands/channels, e.g., LBT sub-band (i.e., wherein the frequency part with bandwidth equals the LBT bandwidth). A device is only allowed to transmit on the sub-bands where the medium is sensed as free. Such an LBT procedure has to be performed by both the base station, and the User Equipment (UE), whenever they intend to transmit something on the unlicensed spectrum, regardless of the type of uplink or downlink transmission being made. That is, the LBT procedure is generally required for both data and control signaling at any layer (e.g., Layer 1/2/3).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">More particularly, LBT is traditionally designed for the unlicensed spectrum to ensure a fair coexistence with other Radio Access Technologies (RATs). In this mechanism, a radio device applies a clear channel assessment (CCA) check (i.e., channel sensing) before any transmission. The transmitter considers energy detection (ED) over a time period compared to a certain threshold (ED threshold) in order to determine if a channel is idle. If the channel is determined to be occupied, the transmitter performs a random back-off within a contention window before making another CCA attempt. In order to protect Acknowledgement (ACK) transmissions, the transmitter must defer a period after each busy CCA slot prior to resuming back-off. As soon as the transmitter has grasped access to a channel, the transmitter is only allowed to perform transmission up to a maximum time duration (namely, the maximum channel occupancy time (MOOT)).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For Quality of Service (QoS) differentiation, a channel access priority based on the service type has been defined. For example, there are four known LBT priority classes that are defined for differentiation of contention window sizes (CWSs) and MOOT between services. Therefore, the LBT class selected for a transmission depends on the priority of the data to transmit or on the type of signal to transmit, e.g., depending on whether the signal is a Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH), Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH), or Radio Resource Control (RRC) signal.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">NR also supports the classical 4-step random access procedure (which is present also in LTE), and a newer 2-step random access procedure that has been specified as part of the 3GPP Rel-16 standard. From the signaling diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the differences between the traditional 4-step Random Access Channel (RACH) procedure (top) and the newer 2-step RACH procedure (bottom) can be readily appreciated.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A clear advantage of the 2-step RACH procedure over the 4-step RACH is that the 2-step RACH is much faster. In particular, it is possible to show that the minimum latency that can be achieved between the PRACH transmission until msg4 reception (i.e. contention resolution, with the 4-step RACH) is 13 subframes. By comparison, for 2-step RACH, the minimum achievable latency is 4 subframes. This makes 2-step RACH approximately 3 times faster than 4-step RACH. Therefore, the 2-step RACH approach may be particularly attractive for delay-sensitive use cases, and also in unlicensed networks. That is because the 2-step approach, unlike the 4-step approach, implies only 2 LBT procedures (one at the UE side for msgA transmission, and one at the network side for the msgB transmission), thereby making the 2-step much faster especially in case of congested network where the UE and/or gNodeB (gNB) may need to postpone the transmission of random access (RA) messages several times due to LBT failures (e.g., a busy channel).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">On the other hand, in 2-step RACH, the UE may transmit data (i.e. the payload) as part of msgA (i.e., before getting a proper uplink timing alignment from the network). Additionally, data transmitted in msgA have not yet been link adapted by the network. This means that the probability of properly decoding the payload at network side very much depends on how good uplink synchronization already is. For example, the probability of properly decoding the payload may depend on the cell size, and also on how good the link quality is. Given the above, assuming that the Bandwidth Part (BWP) selected for the random access procedure has both 4-step and 2-step RACH resources configured, the UE traditionally selects the 2-step RACH resources only if the estimated downlink Resource Signal Receive Power (RSRP) is above a certain configurable threshold.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Similar to the 4-step RACH, the UE can select a RACH preamble from two groups of 2-step RACH preambles, depending on the size of the payload to include in msgA. At transmission of 2-step RACH, the UE starts the msgB-ResponseWindow timer and starts monitoring the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) with msgB-RNTI. If no msgB is received within msgB-ResponseWindow, or if the gNB sends a msgB that includes a backoff indicator, the UE reattempts msgA transmission and applies power ramping. Otherwise, the network may include a successRAR flag in the msgB to indicate that msgA (preamble+payload) decoding was successful. In this case, if the UE contention resolution identity included in msgB matches the one included by the UE in msgA, the random access procedure is considered successful and the UE will use the Cell Radio Network Temporary Identifier (C-RNTI) included in the msgB for successive communications with the network.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The network may also include in the msgB a fallback indicator to indicate to the UE a fallback to 4-step RACH procedures. The fallback procedure may be used, for example, when the network successfully decodes the preamble, but is not able to decode the payload in msgA. Therefore, if the msgB Medium Access Control (MAC) Protocol Data Unit (PDU) with fallbackRAR includes a Random Access Preamble Identifier (RAPID) which matches the preamble index used by the UE in msgA, the UE continues with msg3 transmission using the uplink grant and the Temporary C-RNTI included in msgB. Hence, the UE moves the payload intended to be transmitted in msgA to the msg3 buffer, and it waits for msg4 to resolve the contention.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Finally, a switch procedure is also considered in the relevant 3GPP specification. The UE switches from 2-step RACH to 4-step RACH after attempting the 2-step RACH transmission a certain amount of times with no success. Unlike the fallback procedure, the switch procedure implies that the UE drops the 2-step RACH resources, and restarts from 4-step msg1 by selecting a new 4-step RACH resource.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As previously discussed, random access messages (including the PRACH) are also subject to LBT before being transmitted. In NR-U, an LBT counter is stepped whenever an uplink transmission fails in a certain BWP. When the LBT counter reaches a maximum value within a certain time, the UE declares &#x201c;consistent LBT failure&#x201d; for the corresponding BWP. If the affected BWP is in the Primary Cell (PCell) or the Primary Secondary Cell (PSCell), the UE deactivates the affected BWP and activates another already configured BWP in the PCell/PSCell and transmits random access therein. On the other hand, if the affected BWP is an SCell, the UE stops transmitting in this SCell, and can send a Scheduling Request (SR) on another SCell, PCell, and/or PSCell for further communications. Additionally, as a result of the consistent LBT failure, the UE issues a MAC Control Element (CE) to indicate to the network which cells are the problematic cells in which &#x201c;consistent LBT failures&#x201d; were experienced.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the case of the PCell being affected, once the UE has attempted random access in all the BWPs in the PCell with no success, the UE declares a Radio Link Failure (RLF) and may attempt connection reestablishment. Similarly, for the case of the PSCell, the UE declares a Secondary Cell Group (SCG) failure when consistent uplink LBT failures have been experienced in all the BWPs of the PSCell.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Minimization Drive Test (MDT) reporting has been used in 3GPP cellular communication since Release 9 and recently extended to NR in 3GPP Release 16. Traditionally, the purpose of MDT is for the UE to store information about different measurements that the UE may perform both in idle and connected mode. Typical measurements that the UE may log are the qualities of the cells that the UE traverses when moving, or statistics about transmission delays the UE experiences, and/or events such as RLF and/or handover failures. Such reports may then be requested by the network and used for different purposes, such as coverage optimization, mobility optimization, capacity optimization, QoS verification, and ultimately Self-Organizing Network (SON) actions.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In particular, related to RACH, a new MDT RACH signaling mechanism was introduced in Release 16. The new RRC signaling is shown in the ASN.1 code of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>. For each successful random access procedure, the UE signals an RA-Report element. For each attempted random access, the UE includes a perRAInfo element, which in turn contains the ssb-Index (or the Channel State Information Reference Signal (CSI-RS) index) associated with such preamble transmission, the number of preambles sent for this ssb-Index, information related to whether contention resolution was successful or not, and the experienced downlink RSRP quality. Such RACH-related information can be also sent as part of the RLF report or handover failure report as shown in the ASN.1 code of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A traditional Fifth Generation (5G) Radio Access Network (RAN) (NG-RAN) architecture is depicted and described in TS 38.401 version 15.5.0, an example of which is provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The NG-RAN consists of a set of gNBs (i.e., 5G base stations) connected to the 5G Core (5GC) through the NG interface. A gNB can support Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) mode, Time Division Duplexing (TDD) mode or dual mode operation. In the 5G architecture, gNBs can be interconnected through the Xn interface. A gNB may consist of a gNB Central Unit (gNB-CU) and gNB Distributed Units (gNB-DUs). A gNB-CU and a gNB-DU are connected via an F1 logical interface. Typically, one gNB-DU is connected to only one gNB-CU. However, for resiliency, a gNB-DU may be connected to multiple gNB-CUs by appropriate implementation.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The NG, Xn and F1 interfaces are logical interfaces. The NG-RAN is layered into a Radio Network Layer (RNL) and a Transport Network Layer (TNL). The NG-RAN architecture, (i.e., the NG-RAN logical nodes and interfaces between them) is defined as part of the RNL. For each NG-RAN interface (NG, Xn, F1) the related TNL protocol and the functionality are specified. The TNL provides services for user plane transport and signaling transport. If security protection for control plane and user plane data on the TNL of NG-RAN interfaces has to be supported, Network Domain Security/Internet Protocol (NDS/IP) is applied (e.g., as specified in 3GPP TS 33.401).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A gNB may also be connected to an LTE eNB (i.e., a Fourth Generation (4G) base station) via the X2 interface. According to another architectural option, an LTE eNB connected to the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) network is connected over the X2 interface to a so-called en-gNB, which is a gNB not connected directly to a Core Network (CN) and connected via X2 to an eNB for the sole purpose of performing dual connectivity.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The architecture in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> can be expanded by spitting the gNB-CU into two entities, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In the split architecture option, the RAN protocol stack functionality is separated into different parts. The Central Unit Control Plane (CU-CP) is expected to handle the RRC layer, the Central Unit User Plane (CU-UP) handles the Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer, and the Distributed Unit (DU) handles the Radio Link Control (RLC), MAC, and Physical (PHY) layers of the protocol stack. Some implementations have a further split in which the DU can have a separate unit that handles the PHY parts separately from the RLC and MAC layers, which are handled in the DU.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As different units handle different protocol stack functionalities, inter-node communication between the DU, the CU-UP and the CU-CP may be required. This inter-node communication is achieved via the F1-C interface (relating to control plane signaling), via the F1-U interface (relating to user plane signaling for communication between CU and DU) and via the E1 interface (for communication between CU-UP and CU-CP).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The E1 interface is a logical interface. It supports the exchange of signaling information between the endpoints. From a logical standpoint, the E1 is a point-to-point interface between a gNB-CU-CP and a gNB-CU-UP. The E1 interface enables exchange of UE associated information and non-UE associated information. The E1 interface is a control interface and is not used for user data forwarding.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments of the present disclosure include a method of reporting random access information to an access node.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Current MDT/SON reporting (e.g., failure reports, optimization reports) does not take into account possible LBT failures that may affect the UE which are neither related the random access procedure (2-step, 4-step) nor related to other uplink transmissions. In fact, from the network perspective, it is not possible to know whether a given uplink message was not received because of an LBT failure (i.e., in which the UE did not transmit an uplink message at all), or because of a decoding issue at the gNB side (e.g., the UE did transmit an uplink message, but inadequate energy was detected by the gNB, possibly because transmission power at the UE was too low). Additionally, in licensed communication, a random access procedure may either succeed or result in RLF/handover/connection setup or resume failure (depending what had triggered the random access procedure). On the other hand, in unlicensed communication, the random access procedure may fail because of consistent LBT failure, without the UE necessarily declaring RLF and triggering a reestablishment or SCG failure reporting procedure (i.e., upon consistent LBT failures in the Special Cell (SpCell) (i.e., a PCell or a PSCell) the UE initiates random access in another BWP in the same cell).</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The lack of this diagnostic data, especially related to random access, may result in poor network knowledge about interference scenarios that may lead to a poor 4-step and/or 2-step random access resource allocation. This may ultimately result in lower connection establishment success for the UE.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In view of the above, according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, the UE logs and reports, to the network, diagnostic data associated with the random access procedure (e.g., whether 2-step random access is performed, whether 4-step random access is performed, whether both are performed) in the particular case of random access being performed in the unlicensed spectrum. Ways in which the logged diagnostic information may be used to advantageously optimize or enhance the network configuration are described below. In general, one or more embodiments of the present disclosure additionally or alternatively relate generally to QoS-based triggering of RLF.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">More particularly, one or more embodiments of the present disclosure enable the network to detect problems related to the random access procedure when performed in the unlicensed spectrum. By knowing the random access performances, the network may, for example, rearrange the resources allocated to random access. In one particular example, in response to persistent LBT failures being detected, resources may be reallocated in order to avoid interferers operating in the same spectrum. Additionally or alternatively, the network may readjust the power ramping performed in response to LBT failures that occasionally occur in the msg1 and which cause the UE to report random access failures, e.g. ra-ResponseWindow or msgB-ResponseWindow expiring without any msg2/msgB received.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Additionally or alternatively, the network may use such information to determine whether 2-step RACH or 4-step RACH is preferable given an experienced interference scenario, e.g., to tune the RSRP, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), and/or channel occupancy thresholds for selecting between using 2-step RACH or 4-step RACH. Finally, the input of the proposed MDT reports can trigger a SON algorithm which could be used to coordinate the RACH resources with other Public Land Mobile Networks (PLM Ns) operating in the same frequency.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Similarly, if failures occur after msg1 transmission, the network may use information in the RACH report to properly schedule the msgB/msg2/msg4, e.g., to avoid interference from a hidden node, and/or to provide an efficient resource allocation for the msg3 transmission.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example communication system <b>100</b> according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure. Although certain aspects of the communication system <b>100</b> may herein be described in the context of an LTE, 5G, and/or NR communication network, the discussion throughout this disclosure may similarly be applied to any of these wireless communication systems, other wireless communication systems (e.g., Wi-Fi), and/or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">The communication system <b>100</b> comprises a plurality of wireless communication nodes. One of the wireless communication nodes in particular is an access node <b>110</b> that serves a cell <b>115</b> to a UE <b>105</b>. The UE <b>105</b> and/or access node <b>110</b> may, e.g., each be referred to as a radio node (i.e., a network node capable of radio communication). Further, the access node <b>110</b> may be referred to, in some embodiments, as a base station, an eNB, or an gNB (among other things, depending on the particular embodiment). Although only one access node <b>110</b> and one UE <b>105</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, other examples of the communication system <b>100</b> may include any number of access nodes <b>110</b>, each of which may serve one or more cells <b>115</b> or beams (not shown) to any number of UEs <b>105</b>. Further, according to other embodiments, the UE <b>105</b> may, instead, be a base station (e.g., a femtocell, relay base station).</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">As discussed above, in order for the UE <b>105</b> to access communication system <b>100</b>, the the UE <b>105</b> may instigate a random access procedure with the access node <b>110</b>. Further, before either the UE <b>105</b> or access node <b>110</b> transmits on unlicensed or shared spectrum, each may be required to perform an LBT procedure.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Wireless communication between the access node <b>110</b> and one or more UEs <b>105</b> is performed using radio resources across a time domain, a frequency domain, or both. LTE and NR in particular use Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) in the downlink. The basic NR or LTE downlink physical resource may be viewed as a time-frequency grid, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a portion of an example OFDM time-frequency grid <b>50</b>, e.g., for LTE and/or NR. Generally speaking, the time-frequency grid <b>50</b> is divided into subframes, as will be discussed below. Each subframe includes a plurality of OFDM symbols <b>55</b>. Each symbol <b>55</b> may include a cyclic prefix. The cyclic prefix may be longer or shorter based on conditions. For example, a normal cyclic prefix (CP) length may be used in situations in which multipath dispersion is not expected to be severe. Alternatively, an extended cyclic prefix may be used in situations in which multipath dispersion is expected to be severe. In general, a subframe may comprise fewer symbols <b>55</b> when longer cyclic prefixes are used, and more symbols <b>55</b> when shorter cyclic prefixes are used.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">According to the present example, the physical resources shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> are divided across the frequency domain into adjacent subcarriers with a spacing of 15 kHz. Other embodiments may include other spacing (i.e., different in the time domain, in the frequency domain, or both). In particular, the number of subcarriers may, in some embodiments, vary according to the allocated system bandwidth. The smallest element of the time-frequency grid <b>50</b> is typically referred to as a resource element <b>52</b>, which comprises one OFDM subcarrier during one OFDM symbol interval.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Data is transmitted from the access node <b>110</b> to the UE <b>105</b> over a downlink transport channel. The downlink transport channel is a time and frequency multiplexed channel shared by a plurality of UEs <b>105</b>. The downlink transmissions are typically organized into radio frames of a given duration (e.g., ten milliseconds). Each radio frame may comprise a plurality of subframes <b>62</b>. According to one example, a radio frame <b>60</b> may comprise ten equally-sized subframes <b>62</b><i>a</i>-<i>j</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Each subframe <b>62</b> may comprise one or more slots <b>68</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a subframe <b>62</b><i>a </i>may comprise two equally-sized slots <b>68</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an example in which the radio frame <b>60</b> comprises twenty equally-sized slots <b>68</b><i>a</i>-<i>t. </i></p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">According to embodiments, a slot <b>68</b> may comprise a plurality of symbols <b>55</b>, the precise number of which may vary according to the embodiment. For example, a slot <b>68</b> may comprise seven or fourteen symbols <b>55</b>, according to particular embodiments. Further, in some embodiments, the slot duration may be configurable, such that the number of symbols <b>55</b> in a slot <b>68</b> may, e.g., be set in the UE <b>105</b> by the access node <b>110</b>. Further still, a plurality of symbols <b>55</b> fewer than the number of symbols in a slot <b>68</b> may be referred to, in some embodiments, as a mini-slot (not shown).</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">PDCCHs may be used, e.g., in NR for downlink control information (DCI). This DCI may, e.g., include downlink scheduling assignments and uplink scheduling grants. The PDCCHs are traditionally transmitted at the beginning of a slot <b>68</b> (e.g., in an area of the grid identified as a CORESET) and relate to data in the same or a later slot. For mini-slots, a PDCCH may also be transmitted within a regular slot. Different formats (e.g., sizes) of the PDCCHs are possible to handle different DCI payload sizes and different aggregation levels (i.e. a given code rate for a given payload size).</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">According to embodiments of the present disclosure, diagnostic information about random access performed in an unlicensed spectrum is reported to the access node <b>110</b> (e.g., gNB). Such information may be reported separately for 2-step and 4-step RACH. As will be described in further detail below, the 2-step/4-step RACH report may, in turn, be included in an overall RACH report, in an RLF report, in an SCG failure report (if RACH failed in a cell of the secondary cell group), in an LBT report, as part of accessibility measurement, and/or as part of a connection failure report.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Particular embodiments include a method (<b>400</b>) performed by a UE (<b>105</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The method (<b>400</b>) comprises making a plurality of attempts at random access to the access node (<b>110</b>) (step <b>410</b>). The method (<b>400</b>) further comprises transmitting, to the access node (<b>110</b>), a report comprising Listen Before Talk (LBT) diagnostic data for each of the attempts at random access (step <b>420</b>).</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Other embodiments include a method (<b>450</b>) performed by an access node (<b>110</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The method (<b>450</b>) comprises receiving, from a UE (<b>105</b>), a report comprising Listen Before Talk (LBT) diagnostic data for each of a plurality of attempts at random access to the access node (<b>110</b>) performed by the UE (<b>105</b>) (step <b>460</b>). The method (<b>450</b>) further comprises configuring the UE (<b>105</b>) with an adjusted random access resource allocation based on the LBT diagnostic data of at least one of the attempts at random access (step <b>470</b>).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">For each initiated random access procedure, the diagnostic data reported to the access node <b>110</b> may contain a variety of information related to random access performance. Such information may include, for example, whether LBT was successful or not for a given preamble transmission (e.g., a msgA or msg1 transmission) or a msg3 transmission (when 4-step RACH or 2-step RACH with a fallback to 4-step RACH is performed). Such information may additionally or alternatively include the cumulative number of LBT failures experienced during the random access procedure (e.g., considering LBT failures that occur during both msg1 and msg3 transmission). Such information may additionally or alternatively include LBT configuration information used during the random access procedure.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">The diagnostic information reported to the access node <b>110</b> about random access may additionally or alternatively include the amount of time spent by the UE <b>105</b> before it was able to successfully transmit one preamble (msgA/msg1) or the msg3 (when 4-step RACH or 2-stepRACH with fallback to 4-step RACH is performed). For example, in some embodiments, a timer is started for msgA/msg1 when the physical layer triggers a preamble transmission, and the timer is stopped when LBT for the preamble transmission is successful. This process may be performed by the UE <b>105</b> for each preamble transmission attempt. In some embodiments, when an LBT failure on that BWP in which the UE <b>105</b> did not receive an opportunity to transmit the preamble, the timer is stopped when the UE <b>105</b> performs BWP switching. In some embodiments, the timer is stopped when msgB/msg2 is correctly received by the UE, which means that the timer is not restarted when the RARwindow expires. Rather, the UE <b>105</b> also keeps the timer running when another preamble is selected and until a msgB/msg2 is received. In yet other embodiments, the timer is stopped when the Random Access Response (RAR) window timer expires.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">In some embodiments, the timer is started for msg3 when a MAC PDU containing the msg3 is sent to the physical layer for transmission, and it is stopped when LBT for the msg3 transmission is successful. In some embodiments, the timer is stopped when msg4 is correctly received by the UE <b>105</b>, or when the RA contention resolution timer expires.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">In yet further embodiments, the UE <b>105</b> may separately indicate the time spent waiting for reception of msg2 and msg4. This information can be useful because it considers possible LBT failures on the access node <b>110</b> side in transmitting the msg2/msg4, as well as possible decoding issues on the UE <b>105</b> side due to nodes that are hidden from the UE <b>105</b> yet also communicating with the access node <b>110</b> (e.g., the access node <b>110</b> may be a serving gNB for both the UE <b>105</b> and one or more other nodes that the UE <b>105</b> cannot detect).</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">The diagnostic information reported to the access node <b>110</b> about random access may additionally or alternatively include the cumulative time spent by the UE <b>105</b> before successfully completing the random access procedure. In some such embodiments, a timer is started when the physical layer triggers a preamble transmission for the first RA attempt, and the timer is stopped upon successful reception of, in the case of 2-step RACH, a msgB is received that comprises a successRAR indication and a UE Contention resolution identity matching the UE identity provided in msgA. In the case of 4-step RACH (or 2-step RACH with 4-step RACH fallback), the timer is stopped upon successful reception of a msg4 comprising a UE Contention resolution identity that matches the UE identity provided by the UE <b>105</b> in msg3.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">In some such embodiments, responsive to an RLF, handover failure, or connection failure report being triggered, this cumulative time indicates the time spent from when the random access procedure was initiated by the UE (i.e., a msg1/msgA transmission attempt triggered by physical layer) until random access problems are reported to higher layers (i.e., the RLF, handover failure, or connection failure report issued) or until a connection is successfully established.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">The diagnostic information reported to the access node <b>110</b> about random access may additionally or alternatively include a consistent LBT failure flag, which may (for example) be included in the &#x201c;cause&#x201d; field of a RACH, RLF, LBT, SCG, and/or connection failure report to indicate that the associated random access procedure was not initiated due to consistent LBT failures.

Because the reporting of RACH information from the UE <b>105</b> to the access node <b>110</b> as described herein happens at the RRC level, according to embodiments this information is received at the access node <b>110</b> by the gNB-CU-CP. That said, the management of RACH resources and configuration is controlled by the gNB-DU. Accordingly, embodiments of the present disclosure include signaling such RACH information to the gNB-DU to allow the gNB-DU to determine, based on information in the RACH report regarding the status of the configured RACH resources, whether such configuration needs to be modified (e.g., optimized), whether there are issues to be solved at coverage level, whether it is opportune to choose one type of RACH access versus another (e.g. 2-step RACH vs 4-step RACH), and/or other similar decisions.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">For example, the gNB-DU may determine from the received RACH report that there is a consistent failure in the reception of msgA in the 2-step RACH procedure, but there is no equivalent failure in the reception of msg1 in a 4-step RACH procedure. From this, the gNB-DU may determine that the radio channel conditions at the edge of a given beam area are such to allow reception of a message of the size of msg1. From this, the gNB-DU may either decide to use only 4-step RACH procedures for access to the particular cell/beam where the events have been monitored and/or may decide to reduce the coverage of such beam so that UEs attempting to RACH to such beam would do so when they are closer to the UL receiver.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">It should be noted that the actions described above on determining more optimal configurations from the content of the RACH report described herein could be performed by a node different from the gNB-DU or access node <b>110</b>, provided that such node receives all the relevant information.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">In another embodiment, the RACH information described herein and grouped in a RACH report provided by the UE <b>105</b> to the access node <b>110</b> (or other RAN node) serving it, may be forwarded to other neighbor nodes for the purpose of coverage and capacity enhancement/optimization for 2-step RACH access. For example, if one or more of the RACH reports described herein reveal that reception of msgA in 2-step RACH procedures towards a given beam consistently failed, a possible root cause of the failure may be that interference on the uplink RACH resources is high. A neighbor access node learning about such condition may decide to reduce the amount of interference generated towards the beam subject to the failed RACH access, e.g. by reconfiguring RACH resources on its served cells in an attempt to decouple its own RACH resources and those of the neighbor cell.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">In view of the above, the access node <b>110</b> (e.g., gNB) may respond to receiving LBT information as discussed herein in one or more ways, e.g., to improve conditions for one or more UEs <b>105</b> interacting with the access node <b>110</b> via random access. In some embodiments, the access node <b>110</b> changes the preamble resource allocation depending on the amount of LBT the UE <b>105</b> experienced in the frequency in which random access was performed. For example, the access node <b>110</b> may change the initial BWP used for random access purposes and may exclude the most problematic BWPs at least from being used for random access purposes.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">In some embodiments, the access node <b>110</b> may determine that a node hidden from the UE <b>105</b> is present based on the UE <b>105</b> indicating failures in msg2/msgB reception. That is, the access node <b>110</b> may determine that the UE <b>105</b> is suffering from certain negative effects of a hidden node. Accordingly, the access node <b>110</b> may change the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) resource allocation at least for msg2/msgB transmission. Similarly, the access node <b>110</b> may avoid allocating PUSCH resources for the msg3 (during 4-step RACH or after 2-step fallback) in those resource blocks in which previous msg3 transmissions suffered LBT failures.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">In some embodiments, the access node <b>110</b> may determine that another access node (e.g., a gNB belonging to a different PLMN; a Wi-Fi station) is operating in the same frequency in which the UE <b>105</b> attempted random access and interfered with that random access.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">In some embodiments, the access node <b>110</b> may determine whether to allocate 2-step RACH resources and/or 4-step RACH resources for a serving cell based of the content of 2-step and/or 4-step RACH reporting that includes LBT information of at least that serving cell. For example, the access node <b>110</b> may determine whether to allocate 2-step RACH resources and refrain from allocating 4-step RACH resources based on whether an RSRP, RSSI, channel occupancy, and/or number of LBT failures exceeds a threshold. Similarly, the access node <b>110</b> may determine whether to allocate 4-step RACH resources and refrain from allocating 2-step RACH resources based on whether the RSRP, RSSI, channel occupancy, and/or number of LBT failures exceeds the threshold.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">Indeed, in some embodiments, the access node <b>110</b> controls the allocation of RACH resources based on one or more factors relative to certain respective thresholds. In one such example, the access node <b>110</b> may allocate 2-step RACH resources (e.g., by maintaining a previous allocation of 2-step RACH resources or configuring new ones) in the cell responsive to the downlink RSRP being above a certain value and either LBT failures exceeding a certain threshold, the RSSI falling below a certain threshold, and/or the Channel occupancy exceeding a threshold. Correspondingly, in some embodiments, should any of these criteria fail to be met, the access node <b>110</b> may instead allocate 4-step RACH resources (e.g., by maintaining a previous allocation of 4-step RACH resources or configuring new ones).</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">In some embodiments, the access node <b>110</b> reallocates RACH resources from 2-step RACH to 4-step-RACH or from 4-step RACH to 2-step RACH based on any of the 2/4-step RACH reporting discussed above (e.g., based on the LBT information contained therein).</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">In some embodiments, the access node <b>110</b> keeps for this cell and this BWP both the 2-step and 4-step RACH resources, and it signals the aforementioned threshold to the UE (e.g., in the System Information Block (SIB)) so that the UE can autonomously determine whether to use 2-step RACH resources or 4-step RACH resources for random access.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">It should be further noted that a UE <b>105</b> as described above may perform any of the processing described herein by implementing any functional means or units.
