A number of these conditions that are associated with diabetes in a dysregulation of small blood vessels of the vascular system that maintain a normal blood perfusion to such tissues as the retina in the eye, the glomerulus in the kidney and the peripheral nervous system. When the peripheral nerves become starved of normal blood supply as is found in diabetes, these nerves become dysfunctional and the clinical result is DPN where normal sensation in the periphery is lost with chronic pain being a component along with loss of sensation/numbness, paresthesia (e.g., tingling or &#x201c;pins and needles&#x201d; feeling). Diabetic peripheral neuropathy affects about 50% of the people diagnosed with diabetes. In 2014, 387 million people were living with diabetes in the world, and it is estimated that by 2035, 592 million people globally will have diabetes. Thus, it is estimated that about 194 million people suffer from diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and that by 2035, 296 million people will suffer from diabetic peripheral neuropathy globally. The instigator of the small blood vessel damage that is associated with diabetes that is responsible for DPN is the high circulating glucose concentration that is the hallmark of the diabetes. Glucose is toxic to blood vessels and in DPN the result of this is often observed as arterial attenuation and venous tortuosity around critical nerves in the periphery, such as the sural nerve in the lower leg that is associated with a sensory field in the foot. Patients experiencing DPN are often unable to sense normal environment feedback and the result often is injury to feet or hands which go on to heal poorly because of poor small vessel circulation, ulceration and infection. Chronic pain and amputations are commonplace in DPN. Currently available treatments include lifestyle modifications, weight loss programs and other treatments directed only at temporary symptomatic relief of pain such as transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) and drug treatment. The medications used to treat DPN are often opioids, anti-seizure drugs, or antidepressants that often have intolerable side effects and low effectiveness, along with the risk of addiction. Further, none of the currently available treatments for DPN address the cause of the symptoms, which is diminished blood supply to the peripheral nerves.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As such, there remains a need for a safe, effective, and non-invasive method to increase blood flow and or perfusion of the peripheral nerves to repair nerve tissue, restore normal sensation in the periphery and to treat the pain associated with DPN.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The problems discussed above are addressed by the present invention, which encompasses an article and method for treating peripheral neuropathy by restoring blood flow to target nerve tissue in a non-invasive manner For instance, in one particular embodiment, the present invention is directed to an article for transcutaneously applying an appropriately contoured electrical stimulation to target nerve tissue to treat a patient having peripheral neuropathy.

id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Reference now will be made in detail to various embodiments of the disclosure, one or more examples of which are set forth below. Each example is provided by way of explanation, not limitation of the disclosure. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations may be made in the present disclosure without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment, may be used on another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover such modifications and variations.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Generally speaking, an article and method for non-invasively treating peripheral neuropathy in a patient via transcutaneous stimulation of target nerve tissue are contemplated by the present invention. For instance, in one particular embodiment, the article of the present invention includes a support on which at least one electrode pair is positioned; a controller attached to the at least one electrode pair via one or more leads; and a power supply connected to the controller. The article is configured to deliver electrical stimulation to the target nerve tissue via the at least one electrode pair at a level sufficient to initiate vasodilation of vasculature adjacent the target nerve tissue. Meanwhile, in another embodiment, the method of the present invention includes positioning at least one electrode pair adjacent an area of skin overlying the target nerve tissue; and delivering electrical stimulation to the target nerve tissue via the at least one electrode pair, where the electrical stimulation is delivered with an appropriate contour and at a level sufficient to initiate vasodilation of vasculature within or adjacent the target nerve tissue and responsible for perfusion of the target nerve tissue. An implantable system and method for treating peripheral neuropathy via percutaneous electrical stimulation are also contemplated by the present invention.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Without intending to be limited by any particular theory, the present inventors have discovered that selectively controlling the electrical stimulation parameters applied transcutaneously or percutaneously to target nerve tissue (e.g., sensory nerves), where the target nerve tissue is a source of pain and loss of sensation related to DPN, can facilitate dilation of the arterial vasculature within or adjacent the target nerve tissue. This, in turn, results in increased blood flow to or perfusion of the target nerve tissue, which reduces the pain and paresthesia associated with damage to the target nerve tissue. For instance, stimulation of the target nerve tissue can promote the release of the vasodilator calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which can increase blood flow in the vasculature adjacent the target nerve tissue. Further, it is also believed that stimulation of the target nerve tissue can increase production of the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) from the endothelium of the vasculature, which can also increase blood flow in the vasculature within or adjacent or within the target nerve tissue by relaxing the smooth muscle cells and increasing the diameter of the vasculature.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Moreover, although treatment of DPN is described in detail herein, the systems and methods of the present invention are also contemplated for use in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy associated with other diseases or conditions besides diabetes. For example, in addition to diabetes, other diseases or conditions that cause peripheral neuropathy include, but are not limited to: nerve compression, entrapment or laceration (e.g., crutches, ulnar neuropathy, thoracic outlet syndrome, meralgia paresthetica, Morton's metatarsalgia); other metabolic disorders (e.g., hypothyroidism); autoimmune disorders (e.g., lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Miller Fisher Syndrome); kidney disease, liver disease, toxin-induced neuropathy (e.g., related to alcohol, tobacco, asbestos, arsenic, lead, or mercury); malignant lymphoma; lung cancer; viral or bacterial infections (e.g., HIV, Lyme disease, leprosy, poliomyelitis); medication-induced neuropathy (chemotherapy); trauma; carpal tunnel syndrome; cubital tunnel syndrome; and vitamin deficiency (e.g., vitamin B deficiency). Inherited causes of peripheral neuropathy include Charcot-Marie Tooth disease, Kennedy's disease (X-linked bilbospinal muscular atrophy), Van Allen's Syndrome (hereditary amyloid neuropathy), Refsum's disease, and Tangier disease. Various embodiments of the systems and methods for treating peripheral neuropathy associated with such diseases and conditions are described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one embodiment, an article and method of the present invention contemplates non-invasively treating pain associated with a peripheral nerve disease such as DPN via transcutaneous electrical stimulation of target nerve tissue in a patient, where the target nerve tissue is a source of the patient's pain. The target nerve tissue can include peripheral nerves that have been damaged due to lack of blood flow to the target nerve tissue. The lack of blood flow leads to endoneurial hypoxia, which in turn impairs nerve metabolism and leads to the pain and numbness associated with DPN. The lack of blood flow can be caused by arterial attenuation, vascular tortuosity, inflammation, or a combination thereof, which can be the result of endothelial cell proliferation, basement membrane thickening, increased diffusion distance, epineurial arterio-venous shunting, hyper-reactive platelets, elevated blood viscosity, erythrocyte rigidity, etc., each of which can be associated with diabetes. The electrical stimulation can be in the form of specifically controlled and contoured waveforms that facilitate energy-dependent vasodilation of the vasculature within or adjacent the target nerve tissue, thus increasing blood flow to or perfusion of to the target nerve tissue, which, in turn, can relieve pain and restore sensation to the patient.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the present invention contemplates the use of a stimulation system <b>10</b> that can include a pulse generator <b>30</b>, a user interface <b>40</b>, a controller <b>60</b>, and an isolated power system <b>70</b>. The stimulation system <b>10</b> can be connected to an article via electrodes (at least one cathode <b>20</b> and at least one anode <b>28</b>) using electrical leads <b>31</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>9</b></figref>), where the electrodes deliver transcutaneous electrical stimulation from the pulse generator <b>30</b> to the target nerve tissue affected by DPN. As discussed in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, the electrodes can be positioned on a support <b>50</b> (e.g. a sock <b>80</b>, a glove <b>90</b>, a finger cot <b>96</b>, or a wrap <b>97</b> or <b>98</b>) to deliver electrical stimulation to target nerve tissue in a desired location (e.g., ankles, feet, toes, wrists, hands, fingers, etc.). In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the present invention also contemplates a system that is implantable and can deliver percutaneous electrical stimulation to target nerve tissue. Further, while an experimental-scale system is shown and described, it is contemplated that a more compact unit could be used to control and deliver the desired electrical stimulation. Further, in some embodiments, the system can be portable and user-friendly such that a patient can utilize the system at home, outside of a medical office setting. However, it is also to be understood that the system can also be used in a medical office setting.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Whether the system is transcutaneous or percutaneous, at least two electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>28</b> (i.e., an electrode pair) are generally needed to deliver electrical stimulation to target nerve tissue via contoured waveforms selectively controlled to facilitate dilation of the vasculature adjacent the target nerve tissue. The cathode <b>20</b> or stimulating electrode delivers a positive-going pulse that attracts negatively-charged ions, while the anode <b>28</b> or ground electrode delivers a negative-going pulse that attracts positively-charged ions. The movement of ions within the tissue approximates a current flow and likely acts on sensory receptors in the target nerve tissue by modulating their receptor potential and sensitizing the organ. The electrodes <b>20</b> and <b>28</b> (described herein) are attached to insulated leads <b>31</b> that pass to pulse generator <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, the electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>28</b> can be made from a variety of conductive materials. Such materials include carbon, metals (e.g., platinum, palladium, gold, tungsten, titanium, etc.), metal-based compounds (e.g., oxides, chlorides, etc.), metal alloys, conductive polymers, or a combination thereof. Particular examples of carbon electrodes include glassy carbon, graphite, mesoporous carbon, nanocarbon tubes, fullerenes, etc.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>28</b> may be in the form of a film. Thin films of the conductive materials may be formed by a variety of methods including, sputtering, reactive sputtering, physical vapor deposition, plasma deposition, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), printing, spraying, and other coating methods. For instance, carbon or metal-paste based conductive materials can be formed using screen printing. Metal-based electrodes can be made using standard sputtering or CVD techniques. In other aspects, the electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>28</b> can be formed by stamping or cutting thin sheets of desired metals as is known in the art.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Each electrode <b>20</b>, <b>28</b> can be unique in shape and size, or the electrodes may be identical in shape and size. Any variety of shapes can be used (e.g. rectangle, circle, oval, random, etc.) The size of an electrode <b>20</b>, <b>28</b> can be determined by the available skin contact or surface area. In general, larger electrodes will enable larger areas of sensitization.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In one aspect of the present invention, the electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>28</b> can be screen printed onto a support <b>50</b> (e.g., a sock <b>80</b>, a glove <b>90</b>, a finger cot <b>96</b>, a wrap <b>97</b> or <b>98</b>, etc.). The electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>28</b> can be made with a carbon paste and polymeric binder, which are mixed together with a volatile solvent to create a screen printable &#x201c;ink.&#x201d; The resulting thickness of the screen printed electrodes (once the volatile has evaporated) can range from about 0.25 microns to about 100 microns, such as from about 0.5 microns to about 50 microns, such as from about 0.75 microns to about 20 microns, such as from about 1 micron to about 10 microns. These thicknesses are also contemplated for the other aforementioned types of electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>28</b> that can alternatively be employed.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In another aspect of the present invention, the electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>28</b> may be constructed from woven or nonwoven threads made from conductive fibers. The threads may have a round or rectangular cross-section and may have the same thickness as described above for the screen printed electrodes. The threads may be woven into the material from which a support <b>50</b> (e.g., a sock <b>80</b>, a glove <b>90</b>, a finger cot <b>96</b>, a wrap <b>97</b> or <b>98</b>, etc.) is made.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In yet another alternative, the electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>28</b> may have a laminate structure. Again, such electrodes have the same thickness as the screen printed electrodes. In still another alternative, the electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>28</b> may be in the form of a nerve cuff, such as in the embodiment contemplated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> where the electrodes are implantable to provide for the delivery of percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Regardless of their particular form, the electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>28</b> are positioned on a support <b>50</b> such that they can come into contact with a patient's skin, and the electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>28</b> are also connected to a pulse generator <b>30</b> via one or more leads <b>31</b>. The leads <b>31</b> conduct electricity from the pulse generator <b>30</b> to the electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>28</b> as determined via parameters input into the controller <b>60</b>, and can be made from a material that is the same or different than the material of the electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In one aspect, the leads <b>31</b> can be screen printed onto a support <b>50</b>. Such leads <b>31</b> can be made from a composition that includes silver or a silver chloride paste as well as a polymeric binder. Volatile solvents can be added to this composition to create an &#x201c;ink&#x201d; that can be screen printed either over the top of the previously printed carbon leads, or in place of the carbon leads. The resulting thickness of the screen printed leads (once the volatile has evaporated) can range from about 0.25 microns to about 100 microns, such as from about 0.5 microns to about 50 microns, such as from about 0.75 microns to about 20 microns, such as from about 1 micron to about 10 microns.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The leads <b>31</b> can also be electrically insulated so that they do not short in the presence of moisture. If the leads <b>31</b> are screen printed leads, an insulation coating is placed over the top of the lead, creating a seal between the support immediately surrounding the lead and the coating. If the leads <b>31</b> are threads or laminate strips, the entire thread/strip may be coated with insulation material prior to placement onto the support of before integration therewith.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In one aspect, the leads <b>31</b> can be coated with a photoresist material such as an organic compound that can be altered by exposure to light of a particular wavelength or range of wavelengths. An exemplary coating technique includes depositing a layer of a photoresist over the leads <b>31</b>. Exposure to light makes the photoresist material less susceptible to removal by chemical agents. After the layer of photoresist material is applied, it is exposed to light, or other electromagnetic radiation, through a mask.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, a support <b>50</b> such as a glove <b>80</b>, a sock <b>90</b>, a finger cot <b>96</b>, a foot wrap <b>97</b>, or a hand wrap <b>98</b> are exemplary articles to which the electrodes <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> may be attached (e.g. adhesively or mechanically) or even integrated (e.g., a wrap, a woven sock, or a glove made with conductive and non-conductive threads or a film-like finger cot <b>96</b> made with embedded electrodes) for use with the stimulation system <b>10</b> discussed above. These articles can be molded from a polymeric material, a woven material, a nonwoven material, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Molded socks, gloves, finger cots, or wraps may be made by conventional methods known in the art, such as by dipping, spraying or otherwise coating a mold with a desired material and turning the article inside out after placement of the electrodes <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and curing the material (not necessarily in that order). For example, socks <b>80</b>, gloves <b>90</b>, or wraps <b>97</b> or <b>98</b> may be made in a manner as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,521,365 issued to Kurtz et al. or by U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,401 issued to Sommers, both of which are incorporated herein by reference to the extent they are consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In one particular embodiment, a support <b>50</b> can be in the shape of a sock <b>80</b>, a glove <b>90</b>, a finger cot <b>96</b>, a foot wrap <b>97</b>, or a hand wrap <b>98</b> that is molded from nitrile, acrylic, or latex. Because these materials are flexible and elastic, the leads <b>31</b> attached to these materials may necessarily be flexible as well. Elasticity may not be inherent to the materials to which the leads <b>31</b> are made. Thus, to create pseudo-elasticity in what might be a non-elastic material, the lead <b>31</b> may be applied to the support surface in a sawtooth or sinusoidal pattern (not shown).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">One advantage of an elastomeric sock <b>80</b>, glove <b>90</b>, finger cot <b>96</b>, foot wrap <b>97</b>, or hand wrap <b>98</b> is that it can be fit to a person's foot, hand, or finger in a way that creates constant pressure. This makes the electrode <b>20</b>, <b>28</b> contact with a patient's skin constant, which is greatly desired to ensure that the desired electrical field stimulation is delivered to the target nerve tissue. In one aspect, the sock <b>80</b>, glove <b>90</b>, finger cot <b>96</b>, foot wrap <b>97</b>, or hand wrap <b>98</b> is sufficiently elastic so that when attached to the user's body, it is capable of applying forces upon the body tissue and compliantly responding to force resultant from body motion.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In one aspect, a coupling media such as an electrically conductive gel or paste may be applied to a surface of the electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>28</b> to enhance the conductivity of the skin and/or lower impedance. Desirably, the electrolytic gel or paste can coat a skin-facing surface of the electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>28</b> so that the gel or paste enhances the contact between the patient's skin and the electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>28</b>. Examples of conductive pastes include TEN20 conductive paste from Weaver and Company, Aurora, Colo., and ELEFIX Conductive Paste from Nihon Kohden with offices at Foothill Ranch, Calif. Examples of conductive gels include SPECTRA 360 Electrode Gel from Parker Laboratories, Inc., Fairfield, N.J., or ELECTRO-GEL from Electro-Cap International, Inc., Eaton, Ohio.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In another aspect, the sock <b>80</b>, glove <b>90</b>, finger cot <b>96</b>, foot wrap <b>97</b>, or hand wrap <b>98</b> may be made from a woven material. A woven structure provides the opportunity to weave insulated leads into very fabric from which these articles are constructed. Because the leads <b>31</b> are not elastomeric, the selected weave is such that when an appendage in a sock <b>80</b>, glove <b>90</b>, finger cot <b>96</b>, foot wrap <b>97</b>, or hand wrap <b>98</b> moves, the resulting tensile or compressive forces do not cause the lead <b>31</b> to fail mechanically. Thus, a knitted fabric may be more desirable than a flat-weave fabric as many knitted weave patterns can stretch even when the threads used to make the fabric are not elastomeric. However, a flat-weave fabric (or knitted fabric) of conductive materials may have leads <b>31</b> stitched or glued thereon in a pattern that can accommodate tensile or compressive forces.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">A thread or yarn making up the majority of a fabric used to make the sock <b>80</b>, glove <b>90</b>, finger cot <b>96</b>, foot wrap <b>97</b>, or hand wrap <b>98</b> can be one or more non-conductive materials such as nylon, acrylic, wool, cotton, rayon or the like. These threads or yarns typically have round cross-sections with a diameter of about 0.25 millimeters to about 2 millimeters. These diameters may be quite different than the diameters of leads <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">As mentioned above, the electrodes (cathode <b>20</b> and anode <b>28</b>) may each be electrically connected via a lead <b>31</b> to the stimulation system <b>10</b>. Specifically, the electrodes can be connected via lead <b>31</b> to a pulse generator <b>30</b>. The pulse generator <b>30</b> can be a constant-current stimulator. One exemplary stimulator is the constant-current DIGITIMER DS5 peripheral electrical stimulator available from Digitimer Ltd., England. The DIGITIMER DS5 machine delivers a bipolar stimulation via a pair of electrodes (cathode <b>20</b> and anode <b>28</b>), where both electrodes are within a specified distance from the target nerve tissue. In another aspect of the present disclosure, pulse generator <b>30</b> may be a constant-voltage pulse-generator. For example, three such generators are available from Grass Technologies, a subsidiary of Astro-Med, Inc., RI, US, as models S88X, S48, SD9. It should also be understood that monopolar stimulation, where just one electrode is placed within a specified distance from the target nerve tissue and a reference electrode is located elsewhere, will also activate a target nerve tissue and cause sensory nerve stimulation, but with lesser effectiveness.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The system <b>10</b> also includes a user interface <b>40</b>, which is a computer that can operate software designed to record signals passed from the controller <b>60</b>, and to drive the controller's output from the pulse generator <b>30</b>. Possible software includes Cambridge Electronic Design's (UK) &#x201c;SPIKE&#x201d; program. The software is programmable and can record and analyze electrophysiological signals, as well as direct the controller <b>60</b> to enable electrical stimulation for treatment of a vascular disorder such as DPN.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Further, the controller <b>60</b> performs data acquisition functions by acquiring electrophysiological waveform data from, for instance, signal amplifiers/conditioners (not shown), and outputs electrical signals for real-time control of the pulse generator <b>30</b>. The controller <b>60</b> may have onboard memory to facilitate high speed data capture, independent waveform sample rates and on-line analysis. In one aspect, the controller <b>60</b> may be a POWER 1401 data-acquisition interface unit available from Cambridge Electronic Design, UK.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The various components of the system <b>10</b> can be powered by an isolated power supply <b>70</b> to protect them from ground faults and power spikes carried by the electrical main. An exemplary isolated power supply is the Model IPS115 Isolated Medical-grade Power System from Grass Technologies, a subsidiary of Astro-Med, Inc., West Warwick, R.I., USA. Although not shown, the system <b>10</b> can also be powered by a battery so that the system can be portable. In one embodiment, the battery can be rechargeable.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Various articles that can be used in conjunction with the stimulation system <b>10</b> will now be discussed in more detail. Turning first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an article that includes a support <b>50</b> in the form of a sock <b>80</b> is illustrated.

However, although not shown, it is also to be understood that, alternatively, the electrodes <b>20</b> and <b>28</b> can be positioned along a distal phalanx <b>81</b> of a toe so that the electrodes <b>20</b> and <b>28</b> can make contact with a plantar surface <b>83</b> of the toe.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, another embodiment of an article that includes a support <b>50</b> in the form of a sock <b>80</b> is illustrated.

Such stimulation frequencies are sufficient to facilitate the vasodilation of vasculature (e.g., arteries and veins) adjacent the target nerve tissue which, in turn, increase blood flow to or perfusion of the target nerve tissue, resulting in a recovery of nerve function, sensation and reduction or elimination of the patient's pain due to peripheral neuropathy. In one particular embodiment, the vasculature includes resistance arteries, which are arteries that are generally less than about 400 micrometers in lumen diameter, which can include arteries having a lumen diameter ranging from about 100 micrometers to about 400 micrometers and arterioles having a lumen diameter of less than about 100 micrometers.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Further, the transcutaneous electrical stimulation can be applied at a current ranging from about 0.1 milliamps to about 60 milliamps, such as from about 0.5 milliamps to about 30 milliamps, such as from about 1 milliamp to about 15 milliamps, such as from about 1.5 milliamps to about 10 milliamps Alternatively, the electrical stimulation can be applied at a voltage ranging from about 0.1 volts to about 200 volts, such as from about 1 volt to about 150 volts, such as from about 5 volts to about 125 volts, such as from about 10 volts to about 100 volts.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Moreover, each electrical stimulation pulse can have a pulse width ranging from about 0.1 milliseconds to about 250 milliseconds, such as from about 0.5 milliseconds to about 150 milliseconds, such as from about 1 millisecond to about 75 milliseconds, such as from about 2.5 milliseconds to about 25 milliseconds.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Further, although not required, in addition to an electrical stimulation (modulating) frequency, a carrier frequency can be utilized to improve energy transfer through the skin, so that electrical stimuli (current or voltage) can more easily and efficiently affect the target nerve tissue. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that power calculations for transcutaneous stimulation use a skin impedance of 500&#x3a9;. Studies show that the use of carrier frequencies up to 1 MHz can reduce the skin's impedance to 100&#x3a9;. As such, in some embodiments, the carrier frequency can range from about 25,000 Hertz to about 500,000 Hertz, such as from about 50,000 Hertz to about 300,000 Hertz, such as from about 100,000 Hertz to about 200,000 Hertz.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In addition to the transcutaneous system discussed above, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the present invention also contemplates a system that is implantable and can deliver percutaneous electrical stimulation to target nerve tissue, where vasculature affected by DPN is within or adjacent the target nerve tissue (e.g., the sural nerve).

The percutaneous electrode assembly <b>502</b> can be in the form of a percutaneous electrode or electrodes placed nearby the target nerve tissue. The percutaneous electrode assembly <b>502</b> used in a bipolar or multi-polar fashion can have an anode <b>504</b> and a cathode <b>506</b> placed nearby the target nerve tissue of interest. Monopolar percutaneous electrodes have a cathode <b>506</b> located nearby the target nerve tissue, and a return electrode (i.e., anode) positioned some distance away. Bipolar and multipolar electrode configurations have at least one cathode and one anode in the vicinity of the target nerve tissue. The electrode shape and size, and inter-electrode spacing are specific to contouring the electrical field surrounding the target nerve tissue, to enable vasodilation of the vasculature within or adjacent the target nerve tissue. For example, a suitable multipolar electrode may include a center cathode electrode <b>506</b> that is flanked by two anodes <b>504</b>, where the anodal electrodes are connected together, effectively sharing a charge. The electrodes may be circumferential in shape (e.g., disposed radially at the surface of the electrode) and have a diameter ranging from 0.25 mm to 10 mm, and a width from 0.25 mm to 10 mm. For example, the electrodes may have a diameter ranging from about 0.25 mm to 5 mm, and a width from 0.25 mm to 5 mm. As another example, the electrodes may have a diameter ranging from about 0.25 mm to 3 mm, and a width from 0.25 mm to 3 mm. The inter-electrode spacing may have a range from 0.5 mm to 10 mm.
