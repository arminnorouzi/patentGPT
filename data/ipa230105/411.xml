More particularly, the present invention is directed at a system and related methods for performing neurophysiologic assessments during surgical procedures.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The spinal column is a highly complex system of bones and connective tissues that provide support for the body and protect the delicate spinal cord and nerves. The spinal column includes a series of vertebral bodies stacked one atop the other, each vertebral body including an inner or central portion of relatively weak cancellous bone and an outer portion of relatively strong cortical bone. Situated between each vertebral body is an intervertebral disc that cushions and dampens compressive forces exerted upon the spinal column. A vertebral canal containing the spinal cord is located behind the vertebral bodies.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are many types of spinal column disorders including scoliosis (abnormal lateral curvature of the spine), excess kyphosis (abnormal forward curvature of the spine), excess lordosis (abnormal backward curvature of the spine), spondylolisthesis (forward displacement of one vertebra over another), and other disorders caused by abnormalities, disease or trauma, such as ruptured or slipped discs, degenerative disc disease, fractured vertebrae, and the like. Patients that suffer from such conditions usually experience extreme and debilitating pain as well as diminished nerve function.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Neurophysiologic monitoring has become an increasingly important adjunct to surgical procedures where neural tissue may be at risk. Spinal surgery, in particular, involves working close to delicate tissue in and surrounding the spine, which can be damaged in any number of different ways. When spinal cord monitoring is required, somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) monitoring is often chosen. SSEP monitoring traditionally involves complex analysis and specially trained neurophysiologists are generally called upon to perform the monitoring. Even though performed by specialists, interpreting the complex waveforms in this fashion is nonetheless disadvantageously prone to human error and can be disadvantageously time consuming, adding to the duration of the operation and translating into increased healthcare costs. Even more costly is the fact that the neurophysiologist is required in addition to the actual surgeon performing the spinal operation. Past developments have attempted to solve these challenges in various ways. One such development is so-called automated or surgeon-driven SSEPs monitoring.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For some time, surgeon-driven and traditional neuromonitoring systems have co-existed and have experienced some of the same challenges in performing intraoperative neuromonitoring. One such challenge is that neurophysiologic signals are typically sub-microvolt evoked potentials that are hard to resolve in an &#x201c;electrically hostile&#x201d; environment such as an operating room. What is needed are systems and methods for improved SSEP data acquisition that provides meaningful data to user. According to a broad aspect of the present invention, there are provided methods and techniques to enhance, facilitate, and/or simplify the process of detecting neurophysiologic signals (e.g. SSEP signals) particularly in the presence of noise including ambient electrical activity and non-evoked biopotentials.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention includes systems and methods to evaluate the health and status of the lower motor neural pathway before, during and after the establishment of an operative corridor through (or near) any of a variety of tissues having such neural structures which, if contacted or impinged, may otherwise result in neural impairment for the patient. It is expressly noted that, although described herein largely in terms of use in lateral lumbar spinal surgery, the system and methods of the present disclosure are suitable for use in any number of additional spinal surgeries including posterior, posterolateral, anterior, anterolateral lumbar spinal surgeries as well as thoracic and thoracolumbar spinal surgeries. Indeed, the invention of the present disclosure is suitable for use in any number of additional surgical procedures wherein tissue having significant neural structures must be passed through (or near) in order to establish an operative corridor.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another broad aspect, the present invention includes a control unit, a patient module, and a plurality of surgical accessories adapted to couple to the patient module. The control unit includes a power supply and is programmed to receive user commands, activate stimulation in a plurality of predetermined modes, process signal data according to defined algorithms, display received parameters and processed data, and monitor system status. The patient module is in communication with the control unit. The patient module is within the sterile field. The patient module includes signal conditioning circuitry, stimulator drive circuitry, and signal conditioning circuitry required to perform said stimulation in said predetermined modes. The patient module includes a processor programmed to perform a plurality of predetermined functions including at least two of neuromuscular pathway assessment, non-evoked monitoring, static pedicle integrity testing, dynamic pedicle integrity testing, nerve proximity detection, manual motor evoked potential monitoring, automatic motor evoked potential monitoring, transcutaneous nerve root testing, manual somatosensory evoked potential monitoring, automatic somatosensory evoked potential monitoring, and surgical correction planning and assessment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to still another broad aspect, the present invention includes a processing unit programmed to perform a plurality of predetermined functions using said instrument including at least two of neuromuscular pathway assessment, static pedicle integrity testing, dynamic pedicle integrity testing, nerve proximity detection, transcutaneous nerve root testing, non-evoked monitoring, motor evoked potential monitoring, somatosensory evoked potential monitoring, and surgical correction planning and assessment. The processing system has a pre-established profile for at least one of said predetermined functions so as to facilitate the initiation of said at least one predetermined function.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a hunting algorithm executable on the control unit of the neurophysiologic monitoring system (for example, the neurophysiologic monitoring system shown and described below) that finds a minimum rejection threshold that will quickly find a significant response with a minimum number of responses to provide a significant, well-resolved SSEP waveform for the surgeon without the need for highly trained personnel to be present to acquire or interpret the waveforms. It is to be appreciated while the hunting algorithm described below is described with respect to somatosensory evoked potentials, it is equally applicable to all neurophysiologic modalities, including but not limited to motor evoked potentials (MEP) and transcutaneous, trans-abdominal evoked potentials. It will also be appreciated that the hunting algorithm described below is applicable to not just spine procedures but any procedure in which one or more aspects of the nervous system are at risk of permanent or transient injury or damage.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. The systems disclosed herein boast a variety of inventive features and components that warrant patent protection, both individually and in combination. The systems and methods described herein boast a variety of inventive features and components that warrant patent protection, both individually and in combination.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">A neurophysiologic monitoring system <b>10</b> is described herein and is capable of performing a number of neurophysiological and/or guidance assessments at the direction of the surgeon (and/or other members of the surgical team). By way of example only, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref> illustrate the basic components of the system <b>10</b>. The system comprises a control unit <b>12</b> (including a main display <b>34</b> preferably equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI) and a processing unit <b>36</b> that collectively contain the essential processing capabilities for controlling the system <b>10</b>), a patient module <b>14</b>, a stimulation accessory (e.g. a stimulation probe <b>16</b>, stimulation clip <b>18</b> for connection to various surgical instruments, an inline stimulation hub <b>20</b>, and stimulation electrodes <b>22</b>), and a plurality of recording electrodes <b>24</b> for detecting electrical potentials.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The stimulation accessories may be in the form of various probe devices that are themselves inserted into the stimulation site, clips that attach and deliver stimulation signals to standard instruments that are used at various times throughout a procedure and surface electrodes. The stimulation clip <b>18</b> may be used to connect any of a variety of surgical instruments to the system <b>10</b>, including, but not necessarily limited to a pedicle access needle <b>26</b>, k-wire <b>27</b>, tap <b>28</b>, dilator(s) <b>30</b>, tissue retractor <b>32</b>, etc. One or more secondary feedback devices (e.g. secondary display <b>46</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>-<b>21</b></figref>) may also be provided for additional expression of output to a user and/or receiving input from the user.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one embodiment, the system <b>10</b> may be configured to execute any of the functional modes including, but not necessarily limited to, neuromuscular pathway assessment (&#x201c;Twitch Test&#x201d;), non-evoked monitoring (&#x201c;Free-run EMG&#x201d;), static pedicle integrity testing (&#x201c;Basic Stimulated EMG&#x201d;), dynamic pedicle integrity testing (&#x201c;Dynamic Stimulated EMG&#x201d;), nerve proximity detection (&#x201c;XLIF&#xae;&#x201d;), motor evoked potential monitoring (&#x201c;MEP Manual&#x201d; and &#x201c;MEP Automatic&#x201d;), transcutaneous nerve root testing (&#x201c;TCNR Alert&#x201d; and &#x201c;TCNR Threshold&#x201d;), somatosensory evoked potential monitoring (&#x201c;SSEP Manual&#x201d; and &#x201c;SSEP Automatic&#x201d;), and surgical correction planning and assessment. The system <b>10</b> may also be configured for performance in any of the lumbar, thoracolumbar, and cervical regions of the spine.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The basis for performing many of these functional modes (e.g. Twitch Test, Basic Stimulated EMG, Dynamic Stimulated EMG, XILF, MEP Manual, MEP Automatic, TCNR Alert, and TCNR Threshold) is the assessment of evoked responses of the various muscles myotomes monitored by the system <b>10</b> in relation to a stimulation signal transmitted by the system <b>10</b> (via patient module <b>14</b>). The assessment of the evoked responses can be any suitable means of sensing physical motion of a muscle, for example via mechanomyography (MMG) which in one embodiment entails using an accelerometer or other similar device for detecting mechanical movement of a muscle or via electromyography (EMG) which is described in detail herein. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates the resulting EMG waveform of a monitored myotome in response to one of the example stimulation signals represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The EMG responses provide a quantitative measure of the nerve depolarization caused by the electrical stimulus. One way to characterize the EMG response is by a peak-to-peak voltage of V<sub>pp</sub>=V<sub>max</sub>&#x2212;V<sub>min</sub>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Nerve tissues have characteristic threshold current levels (I<sub>thresh</sub>) at which they will depolarize and result in a detectable muscle activity. Below this threshold current level, a stimulation signal will not evoke a significant EMG response. According to one embodiment, a significant EMG response may be defined as having a V<sub>pp </sub>of approximately 100 uV. Thus, the lowest stimulation current necessary to evoke an EMG response of the threshold voltage (V<sub>thresh</sub>), 100 uV in this example, may be called I<sub>thresh</sub>. The greater the degree of electrical communication between a stimulation signal and a nerve, the lower I<sub>thresh </sub>will be. Conversely, the lower the degree of electrical communication between a stimulation signal and a nerve, the greater I<sub>thresh </sub>will be. Thus determining I<sub>thresh</sub>, and/or monitoring changes in I<sub>thresh </sub>over time, may provide valuable information when nerve tissues are at risk during a surgical procedure, as will be discussed in more detail below. By way of example, an excessively high I<sub>thresh </sub>or an increase over a previous measurement during MEP testing may indicate a problem in the spinal cord or other portion of the motor pathway inhibiting transmission (communication) of the stimulation signal to the nerve. Meanwhile, during the Basic Stimulated EMG or Dynamic Stimulated EMG modes and the XLIF mode, a low I<sub>thresh </sub>value may indicate a breach in the pedicle allowing the electrical signal to transmit through the pedicle, or the close proximity of a nerve to the stimulation source, respectively. Armed with the useful information conveyed by T<sub>thresh</sub>, the surgeon may detect a problem or potential problem early and then act to avoid and/or mitigate the problem. The neurophysiology system <b>10</b> may quickly and accurately determine I<sub>thresh </sub>under the direction and operation of the surgeon (if desired) and convey the useful information I<sub>thresh </sub>contains in a simple and easily comprehensible manner for interpretation by the surgeon.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Before further addressing the various functional modes of the surgical system <b>10</b>, the hardware components and features of the system <b>10</b> will be describe in further detail. The control unit <b>12</b> of the system <b>10</b>, illustrated by way of example only in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, includes a main display <b>34</b> and a processing unit <b>36</b>, which collectively contain the essential processing capabilities for controlling the system <b>10</b>. The main display <b>34</b> is preferably equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI) capable of graphically communicating information to the user and receiving instructions from the user. The processing unit <b>36</b> contains computer hardware and software that commands the stimulation source (e.g. patient module <b>14</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b></figref>), receives digital and/or analog signals and other information from the patient module <b>14</b>, processes EMG and SSEP response signals, and displays the processed data to the user via the display <b>34</b>. The primary functions of the software within the control unit <b>12</b> include receiving user commands via the touch screen main display <b>34</b>, activating stimulation in the appropriate mode (Twitch Test, Basic Stimulated EMG, Dynamic Stimulated EMG, XLIF, MEP Manual, MEP Automatic, TCNR Alert, TCNR Threshold, SSEP Manual, and SSEP Automatic), processing signal data according to defined algorithms, displaying received parameters and processed data, and monitoring system status. According to one example embodiment, the main display <b>34</b> may comprise a 15&#x2033; LCD display equipped with suitable touch screen technology and the processing unit <b>36</b> may comprise a 2 GHz. The processing unit <b>36</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> further includes a powered USB port <b>38</b> for connection to the patient module <b>14</b>, a media drive <b>40</b> (e.g. CD, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-RW, etc. . . . ), a network port, wireless network card, and a plurality of additional ports <b>42</b> (e.g. USB, IEEE 1394, infrared, etc . . . ) for attaching additional accessories, such as for example only, navigated guidance sensors, auxiliary stimulation anodes, and external devices (e.g. printer, keyboard, mouse, etc . . . ). Preferably, during use the control unit <b>12</b> sits near the surgical table but outside the surgical field, such as for example, on a table top or a mobile stand. It will be appreciated, however, that if properly draped and protected, the control unit <b>12</b> may be located within the surgical (sterile) field.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The patient module <b>14</b>, shown by way of example only in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, is communicatively linked to the control unit <b>12</b>. In this embodiment the patient module <b>14</b> is communicatively linked with and receives power from the control unit <b>12</b> via a USB data cable <b>44</b>. However, it will be appreciated that the patient module <b>14</b> may be supplied with its own power source and other known data cables, as well as wireless technology, may be utilized to establish communication between the patient module <b>14</b> and control unit <b>12</b>. The patient module <b>14</b> contains a digital communications interface to communicate with the control unit <b>12</b>, as well as the electrical connections to all recording and stimulation electrodes, signal conditioning circuitry, stimulator drive and steering circuitry, and signal conditioning circuitry required to perform all of the functional modes of the system <b>10</b>, including but not necessarily limited to Twitch Test, Free-run EMG, Basic Stimulated EMG, Dynamic Stimulated EMG, XLIF, MEP Manual and MEP Automatic, TCNR Alert, TCNR Threshold, SSEP Manual, and SSEP Automatic. In one example, the patient module <b>14</b> includes thirty-two recording channels and eleven stimulation channels. A display (e.g. an LCD screen) may be provided on the face of the patient module <b>14</b>, and may be utilized for showing simple status readouts (for example, results of a power on test, the electrode harnesses attached, and impedance data, etc . . . ) or more procedure related data (for example, a stimulation threshold result, current stimulation level, selected function, etc . . . ). The patient module <b>14</b> may be positioned near the patient in the sterile field during surgery. By way of example, the patient module <b>14</b> may be attached to bed rail with the aid of a hook <b>48</b> attached to, or forming a part of, the patient module <b>14</b> casing.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, patient module <b>14</b> comprises a multitude of ports and indicators for connecting and verifying connections between the patient module <b>14</b> and other system components. A control unit port <b>50</b> is provided for data and power communication with the control unit <b>12</b>, via USB data cable <b>44</b> as previously described. There are four accessory ports <b>52</b> provided for connecting up to the same number of surgical accessories, including, but not necessarily limited to, stimulation probe <b>16</b>, stimulation clip <b>18</b>, inline stimulation hub <b>20</b>, and navigated guidance sensor (or tilt sensor) <b>54</b>. The accessory ports <b>52</b> include a stimulation cathode and transmit digital communication signals, tri-color LED drive signals, button status signals, identification signals, and power between the patient module <b>14</b> and the attached accessory. A pair of anode ports <b>56</b>, preferably comprising 2 wire DIN connectors, may be used to attach auxiliary stimulation anodes should it become desirable or necessary to do so during a procedure. A pair of USB ports <b>58</b> are connected as a USB hub to the control unit <b>12</b> and may be used to make any number of connections, such as for example only, a portable storage drive.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As soon as a device is plugged into any one of ports <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>56</b>, or <b>58</b>, the system <b>10</b> automatically performs a circuit continuity check to ensure the associated device will work properly. Each device forms a separate closed circuit with the patient module such that the devices may be checked independent of each other. If one device is not working properly the device may be identified individually while the remaining devices continue indicate their valid status. An indicator LED is provided for each port to convey the results of the continuity check to the user. Thus, according to the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, the patient module <b>14</b> includes one control unit indicator <b>60</b>, four accessory indicators <b>62</b>, two anode indicators <b>64</b>, and two USB indicators <b>66</b>. According to a preferred embodiment, if the system detects an incomplete circuit during the continuity check, the appropriate indicator will turn red alerting the user that the device might not work properly. On the other hand, if a complete circuit is detected, the indicator will appear green signifying that the device should work as desired. Additional indicator LEDs are provided to indicate the status of the system and the MEP stimulation. The system indicator <b>68</b> will appear green when the system is ready and red when the system is not ready. The MEP stim indicator <b>70</b> lights up when the patient module is ready to deliver and MEP stimulation signal. In one embodiment, the MEP stim indicator <b>68</b> appears yellow to indicate a ready status.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">To connect the array of recording electrodes <b>24</b> and stimulation electrodes <b>22</b> utilized by the system <b>10</b>, the patient module <b>14</b> also includes a plurality of electrode harness ports. In the embodiment shown, the patient module <b>14</b> includes an EMG/MEP harness port <b>72</b>, SSEP harness port <b>74</b>, an Auxiliary harness port <b>76</b> (for expansion and/or custom harnesses; e.g. a TCNR harness). Each harness port <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, and <b>76</b> includes a shaped socket <b>78</b> that corresponds to a matching shaped connector <b>82</b> on the appropriate electrode harness <b>80</b>. In addition, the system <b>10</b> may preferably employ a color code system wherein each modality (e.g. EMG, EMG/MEP, and SSEP) has a unique color associated with it. By way of example only and as shown herein, EMG monitoring (including, screw tests, detection, and nerve retractor) may be associated with the color green, MEP monitoring with the color blue, and SSEP monitoring may be associated with the color orange. Thus, each harness port <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> is marked with the appropriate color which will also correspond to the appropriate harness <b>80</b>. Utilizing the combination of the dedicated color code and the shaped socket/connector interface simplifies the setup of the system, reduces errors, and can greatly minimize the amount of pre-operative preparation necessary. The patient module <b>14</b>, and especially the configuration of quantity and layout of the various ports and indicators, has been described according to one example embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated, however, that the patient module <b>14</b> could be configured with any number of different arrangements without departing from the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As mentioned above, to simplify setup of the system <b>10</b>, all of the recording electrodes <b>24</b> and stimulation electrodes <b>22</b> that are required to perform one of the various functional modes (including a common electrode <b>23</b> providing a ground reference to pre-amplifiers in the patient module <b>14</b>, and an anode electrode <b>25</b> providing a return path for the stimulation current) are bundled together and provided in single electrode harness <b>80</b>, as illustrated, by way of example only, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. Depending on the desired function or functions to be used during a particular procedure, different groupings of recoding electrodes <b>24</b> and stimulation electrodes <b>22</b> may be required. By way of example, the SSEP function requires more stimulating electrodes <b>22</b> than either the EMG or MEP functions, but also requires fewer recording electrodes than either of the EMG and MEP functions. To account for the differing electrode needs of the various functional modes, the system <b>10</b> may employ different harnesses <b>80</b> tailored for the desired modes. According to one embodiment, three different electrode harnesses <b>80</b> may be provided for use with the system <b>10</b>, an EMG harness, an EMG/MEP harness, and an SSEP harness.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">At one end of the harness <b>80</b> is the shaped connector <b>82</b>. As described above, the shaped connector <b>82</b> interfaces with the shaped socket <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, or <b>76</b> (depending on the functions harness <b>80</b> is provided for). Each harness <b>80</b> utilizes a shaped connector <b>82</b> that corresponds to the appropriate shaped socket <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> on the patient module <b>14</b>. If the shapes of the socket and connector do not match the harness <b>80</b>, connection to the patient module <b>14</b> cannot be established. According to one embodiment, the EMG and the EMG/MEP harnesses both plug into the EMG/MEP harness port <b>72</b> and thus they both utilize the same shaped connector <b>82</b>. By way of example only, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>C</figref> illustrate the various shape profiles used by the different harness ports <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and connectors <b>82</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> illustrates the half circular shape associated with the EMG and EMG/MEP harness and port <b>72</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> illustrates the rectangular shape utilized by the SSEP harness and port <b>74</b>. Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref> illustrates the triangular shape utilized by the Auxiliary harness and port <b>76</b>. Each harness connector <b>82</b> includes a digital identification signal that identifies the type of harness <b>80</b> to the patient module <b>14</b>. At the opposite end of the electrode harness <b>80</b> are a plurality of electrode connectors <b>102</b> linked to the harness connector <b>82</b> via a wire lead. Using the electrode connector <b>102</b>, any of a variety of known electrodes may be used, such as by way of example only, surface dry gel electrodes, surface wet gel electrodes, and needle electrodes.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">To facilitate easy placement of scalp electrodes used during MEP and SSEP modes, an electrode cap <b>81</b>, depicted by way of example only in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref> may be used. The electrode cap <b>81</b> includes two recording electrodes <b>23</b> for SSEP monitoring, two stimulation electrodes <b>22</b> for MEP stimulation delivery, and an anode <b>23</b>. Graphic indicators may be used on the electrode cap <b>81</b> to delineate the different electrodes. By way of example, lightning bolts may be used to indicate a stimulation electrode, a circle within a circle may be used to indicate recording electrodes, and a stepped arrow may be used to indicate the anode electrode. The anode electrode wire is colored white to further distinguish it from the other electrodes and is significantly longer that the other electrode wires to allow placement of the anode electrode on the patient's shoulder. The shape of the electrode cap <b>81</b> may also be designed to simplify placement. By way of example only, the cap <b>81</b> has a pointed end that may point directly toward the patient's nose when the cap <b>81</b> is centered on the head in the right orientation. A single wire may connect the electrode cap <b>81</b> to the patient module <b>14</b> or electrode harness <b>80</b>, thereby decreasing the wire population around the upper regions of the patient. Alternatively, the cap <b>81</b> may be equipped with a power supply and a wireless antenna for communicating with the system <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref> illustrates another example embodiment of an electrode cap <b>83</b> similar to cap <b>81</b>. Rather than using graphic indicators to differentiate the electrodes, colored wires may be employed. By way of example, the stimulation electrodes <b>22</b> are colored yellow, the recording electrodes <b>24</b> are gray, and the anode electrode <b>23</b> is white. The anode electrode is seen here configured for placement on the patient's forehead. According to an alternate embodiment, the electrode cap (not shown) may comprise a strap or set of straps configured to be worn on the head of the patient. The appropriate scalp recording and stimulation sites may be indicated on the straps. By way of example, the electrode cap may be imbued with holes overlying each of the scalp recording sites (for SSEP) and scalp stimulation sites (for MEP). According to a further example embodiment, the border around each hole may be color coded to match the color of an electrode lead wire designated for that site. In this instance, the recording and stimulation electrodes designated for the scalp are preferably one of a needle electrode and a corkscrew electrode that can be placed in the scalp through the holes in the cap.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In addition to or instead of color coding the electrode lead wires to designated intended placement, the end of each wire lead next to the electrode connector <b>102</b> may be tagged with a label <b>86</b> that shows or describes the proper positioning of the electrode on the patient. The label <b>86</b> preferably demonstrates proper electrode placement graphically and textually. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the label may include a graphic image showing the relevant body portion <b>88</b> and the precise electrode position <b>90</b>. Textually, the label <b>86</b> may indicate the side <b>100</b> and muscle (or anatomic location) <b>96</b> for placement, the function of the electrode (e.g. stimulation, recording channel, anode, and reference&#x2014;not shown), the patient surface (e.g. anterior or posterior), the spinal region <b>94</b>, and the type of monitoring <b>92</b> (e.g. EMG, MEP, SSEP, by way of example, only). According to one embodiment (set forth by way of example only), the electrode harnesses <b>80</b> are designed such that the various electrodes may be positioned about the patient (and preferably labeled accordingly) as described in Table 1 for Lumbar EMG, Table 2 for Cervical EMG, Table 3 for Lumbar/Thoracolumbar EMG and MEP, Table 4 for Cervical EMG and MEP, Table 5 for TCNR, and Table 6 for SSEP:</p><p id="p-0067" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Lumbar EMG</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="84pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Electrode Type</entry><entry>Electrode Placement</entry><entry>Spinal Level</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Ground</entry><entry>Upper Outer Thigh</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Anode</entry><entry>Latissimus Dorsi</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Stimulation</entry><entry>Knee</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Recording</entry><entry>Left Tibialis Anterior</entry><entry>L4, L5</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Recording</entry><entry>Left Gastroc.

module <b>14</b> is configured such that the system <b>10</b> may conduct an impedance test under the direction of the control unit <b>12</b> of all electrodes once the system is set up and the electrode harness is connected and applied to the patient. After choosing the appropriate spinal site upon program startup (described below), the user is directed to an electrode test. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>B</figref> illustrate, by way of example only, a graphical implementation capturing the features of an electrode test[s] as implemented on an electrode test screen <b>104</b>. The electrode test screen <b>104</b> includes a human figure depiction with positioned electrodes <b>108</b>. A harness indicator <b>109</b> displays which harness is in use. For each electrode on the harness <b>80</b> in use there is a channel button <b>110</b>. This includes the common <b>25</b> and anode <b>23</b> electrodes which are both independently checked for impedance. To accomplish this, the anode <b>23</b> and common <b>25</b> are both provided as dual electrodes. At least one of the anode leads on the anode electrode is reversible. During the impedance check, the reversible anode lead switches to a cathode such that the impedance between the leads can be measured. When the impedance test is complete, the reversible lead switches back to an anode. The channel button <b>110</b> may be labeled with the muscle or coverage area of the corresponding electrode. Selecting the channel button <b>110</b> will disable the channel. Disabled channels will not be tested for impedance and they will not be monitored for responses or errors unless reactivated. Upon selection of a start button <b>106</b> (&#x201c;Run Electrode Test&#x201d;), the system tests each electrode individually to determine the impedance value. If the impedance is determined to be within acceptable limits, the channel button <b>110</b> and electrode depiction on the human <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>108</b></figref> turn green. If the impedance value for any electrode is not determined to be acceptable, the associated channel button <b>110</b> and electrode depiction turn red, alerting the user. Once the test is complete, selecting the &#x201c;Accept&#x201d; button <b>112</b> will open the main monitoring screen <b>200</b> of the system <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0067">The system <b>10</b> may utilize various stimulation accessories to deliver stimulation signals to a stimulation target site such as over the patient's conus medullaris, a hole formed or being formed in a pedicle, and/or tissue surrounding an access corridor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>-<b>17</b></figref> illustrate an example embodiment of a stimulation accessory in the form of a stimulation clip <b>18</b> that permits the system <b>10</b> to deliver stimulation signals through various surgical instruments already used during the surgical procedure. By way of example only, the coupling device <b>18</b> may connect the system <b>10</b> with instruments including, but not necessarily limited to, a pedicle access needle <b>26</b>, a tap <b>28</b>, dilator <b>30</b>, tissue retractor <b>32</b>, and k-wire <b>27</b>. The stimulation clip <b>18</b> utilizes a spring-loaded plunger <b>128</b> to hold the surgical tool and transmit the stimulation signal thereto. The plunger <b>128</b> is composed of a conductive material such as metal. A nonconductive housing <b>130</b> partially encases the plunger <b>128</b> about its center. Extending from the housing <b>130</b> is an endplate <b>132</b> that hooks the surgical instrument. A spring (not shown) is disposed within the housing <b>130</b> such that in a natural or &#x201c;closed&#x201d; state, the plunger <b>128</b> is situated in close proximity to the endplate <b>132</b>. Exerting a compressive force on the spring (such as by pulling on the thumb grip <b>134</b>) causes a gap between the end plate <b>132</b> and the plunger <b>128</b> to widen to an &#x201c;open&#x201d; position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>-<b>17</b></figref> thereby allowing insertion of a surgical tool between the endplate <b>132</b> and plunger <b>128</b>. Releasing the thumb grip <b>134</b> allows the spring to return to a &#x201c;closed&#x201d; position, causing the plunger <b>132</b> to move laterally back towards the endplate such that a force is exerted upon the surgical instrument and thereby holding it in place between the endplate <b>132</b> and the plunger <b>128</b>. The clip <b>18</b> further includes a button module <b>129</b> containing an activation button <b>131</b> for initiating stimulation. The button module <b>129</b> is set apart from the body of the clip <b>18</b> and they are linked by an integrated wire. An accessory port <b>133</b> is located next to the button <b>131</b> on the button module <b>129</b>, thus minimizing the number of wires connecting back to the patient module <b>14</b> and outside the sterile field. Clip <b>18</b> is equipped with three LEDs <b>135</b>, <b>137</b>, and <b>139</b>. LED <b>135</b> is associated with the accessory port <b>133</b> and LED <b>137</b> is associated with the clip <b>18</b> to indicate which of the two is stimulating. The LEDs <b>137</b> and <b>137</b> may appear purple when stimulation is active. When a stimulation result is determined, the associated LED <b>135</b> or <b>137</b> may appear either red (if the result meets a predetermined potentially unsafe value), green (if the result meets a predetermined safe value), or yellow (if the result is in between the safe and potentially unsafe values). A third LED <b>139</b> is contained within the thumb grip <b>134</b>, which will appear red, yellow, or green depending on the threshold result. The clip <b>18</b> connects to one of the accessory ports <b>62</b> on the patient module <b>14</b> via a connector <b>136</b>. The connector <b>136</b> includes an identification signal that identifies it to the patient module.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0068">As mentioned above, the system <b>10</b> may include a secondary display, such as for example only, the secondary display <b>46</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>-<b>19</b></figref>. The secondary display <b>46</b> may be configured to display some or all of the information provided on main display <b>34</b>. The information displayed to the user on the secondary display <b>34</b> may include, but is not necessarily limited to, alpha-numeric and/or graphical information regarding any of the selected function modes (e.g. Twitch Test, Free-Run EMG, Basic Stimulated EMG, Dynamic Stimulated EMG, XLIF, MEP Manual, MEP Automatic, TCNR Alert, TCNR Threshold, SSEP Manual, SSEP Automatic, and surgical correction planning and assessment), attached accessories (e.g. stimulation probe <b>16</b>, stimulation clip <b>18</b>, tilt sensor <b>54</b>), electrode harness or harnesses attached, impedance test results, myotome/EMG levels, stimulation levels, history reports, selected parameters, test results, etc . . . . In one embodiment, secondary display <b>46</b> may be configured to receive user input in addition to its display function. The secondary display <b>46</b> can thus be used as an alternate control point for the system <b>10</b>. The control unit <b>12</b> and secondary display <b>46</b> may be linked such that input may be received on from one display without changing the output shown on the other display. This would allow the surgeon to maintain focus on the patient and test results while still allowing other members of the OR staff to manipulate the system <b>10</b> for various purposes (e.g. inputting annotations, viewing history, etc . . . ). The secondary display <b>46</b> may be battery powered. Advantageously, the secondary display <b>46</b> may be positioned inside the sterile field as well as outside the sterile field. For positioning within the sterile field a disposable sterile case <b>47</b> may be provided to house the display. Alternatively, the display <b>46</b> may be sterile bagged. Both the sterile case <b>47</b> and the secondary display <b>46</b> may be mounted to a pole, bed frame, light fixture, or other apparatus found near and/or in the surgical field. It is further contemplated that multiple secondary displays <b>46</b> may be linked to the control unit <b>12</b>. This may effectively distribute neurophysiology information and control throughout the operating room. By way of example, a secondary display <b>46</b> may also be provided for the anesthesiologist. This may be particularly useful in providing the anesthesiologist with results from the Twitch Test and providing reminders about the use of paralytics, which may adversely affect the accuracy of the system <b>10</b>. Wired or wireless technology may be utilized to link the secondary display <b>46</b> to the control unit <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0069">Having described an example embodiment of the system <b>10</b> and the hardware components that comprise it, the neurophysiological functionality and methodology of the system <b>10</b> will now be described in further detail. Various parameters and configurations of the system <b>10</b> may depend upon the target location (i.e. spinal region) of the surgical procedure and/or user preference. In one embodiment, upon starting the system <b>10</b> the software will open to a startup screen, illustrated by way of example only, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>. The startup screen includes a profile selection window <b>160</b> from which the user may select from one of the standard profiles (e.g. &#x201c;Standard Cervical,&#x201d; &#x201c;Standard Thoracolumbar,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Standard Lumbar&#x201d;) or any custom profiles that have been previously saved to the system. Profiles may be arranged for selection, alphabetically, by spinal region, or by other suitable criteria. Profiles may be saved to the control unit hard drive or to a portable memory device, such as for example, a USB memory drive, or on a web server.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0070">Selecting a profile configures the system <b>10</b> to the parameters assigned for the selected profile (standard or custom). The availability of different function modes may depend upon the profile selected. By way of example only, selecting the cervical and thoracolumbar spinal regions may automatically configure the options to allow selection of the Twitch Test, SSEP Manual, SSEP Automatic, Basic Stimulated EMG, Dynamic Stimulated EMG, XLIF, MEP Manual, MEP Automatic, Free-Run EMG modes, while selecting the lumbar region may automatically configure the options to allow selection of the Twitch Test, Basic, Difference, and Dynamic Stimulated EMG Tests, XLIF&#xae;, and Nerve Retractor modes. Default parameters associated with the various function modes may also depend on the profile selected, for example, the characteristics of the stimulation signal delivered by the system <b>10</b> may vary depending on the profile. By way of example, the stimulation signal utilized for the Stimulated EMG modes may be configured differently when a lumbar profile is selected versus when one of a thoracolumbar profile and a cervical profile.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0071">As previously described above, each of the hardware components includes an identification tag that allows the control unit <b>12</b> to determine which devices are hooked up and ready for operation. In one embodiment, profiles may only be available for selection if the appropriate devices (e.g. proper electrode harness <b>80</b> and stimulation accessories) are connected and/or ready for operation. Alternatively, the software could bypass the startup screen and jump straight to one of the functional modes based on the accessories and/or harnesses it knows are plugged in. The ability to select a profile based on standard parameters, and especially on customized preferences, may save significant time at the beginning of a procedure and provides for monitoring availability right from the start. Moving on from the startup screen, the software advances directly to an electrode test screen and impedance tests, which are performed on every electrode as discussed above. When an acceptable impedance test has been completed, the system <b>10</b> is ready to begin monitoring and the software advances to a monitoring screen from which the neurophysiological monitoring functions of the system <b>10</b> are performed.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0072">The information displayed on the monitoring screen may include, but is not necessarily limited to, alpha-numeric and/or graphical information regarding any of the functional modes (e.g. Twitch Test, Free-Run EMG, Basic Stimulated EMG, Dynamic Stimulated EMG, XLIF, MEP Manual, MEP Automatic, TCNR Alert, TCNR Threshold, SSEP Manual, SSEP Automatic, and surgical correction planning and assessment), attached accessories (e.g. stimulation probe <b>16</b>, stimulation clip <b>18</b>, tilt sensor <b>54</b>), electrode harness or harnesses attached, impedance test results, myotome/EMG levels, stimulation levels, history reports, selected parameters, test results, etc . . . .

The XLIF mode is designed to detect the presence of nerves during the use of the various surgical access instruments of the system <b>10</b>, including the pedicle access needle <b>26</b>, k-wire <b>42</b>, dilator <b>44</b>, and retractor assembly <b>70</b>.

These functions will be explained now in brief detail.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0075">The system <b>10</b> performs neuromuscular pathway (NMP) assessments, via Twitch Test mode, by electrically stimulating a peripheral nerve (preferably the Peroneal Nerve for lumbar and thoracolumbar applications and the Median Nerve for cervical applications) via stimulation electrodes <b>22</b> contained in the applicable electrode harness and placed on the skin over the nerve or by direct stimulation of a spinal nerve using a surgical accessory such as the probe <b>116</b>. Evoked responses from the muscles innervated by the stimulated nerve are detected and recorded, the results of which are analyzed and a relationship between at least two responses or a stimulation signal and a response is identified. The identified relationship provides an indication of the current state of the NMP. The identified relationship may include, but is not necessarily limited to, one or more of magnitude ratios between multiple evoked responses and the presence or absence of an evoked response relative to a given stimulation signal or signals. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, details of the test indicating the state of the NMP and the relative safety of continuing on with nerve testing are conveyed to the surgeon via GUI display <b>34</b>. On the monitoring screen <b>200</b> utilized by the various functions performed by the system <b>10</b>, function specific data is displayed in a center result area <b>201</b>. The results may be shown as a numeric value <b>210</b>, a highlighted label corresponding to the electrode labels <b>86</b>, or (in the case of twitch test only) a bar graph of the stimulation results. On one side of center result area <b>201</b> is a collapsible device menu <b>202</b>. The device menu displays a graphic representation of each device connected to the patient module <b>14</b>. Opposite the device menu <b>202</b> there is a collapsible test menu <b>204</b>. The test menu <b>204</b> highlights each test that is available under the operable setup profile and may be used to navigate between functions. A collapsible stimulation bar <b>206</b> indicates the current stimulation status and provides start and stop stimulation buttons (not shown) to activate and control stimulation. The collapsible event bar <b>208</b> stores all the stimulation test results obtained throughout a procedure. Clicking on a particular event will open a note box and annotations may be entered and saved with the response for later inclusion in a procedure report. The event bar <b>208</b> also houses a chat box feature when the system <b>10</b> is connected to a remote monitoring system as described above. Within the result area <b>202</b> the twitch test specific results may be displayed.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0076">It should be appreciated that while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> depicts the monitoring screen <b>200</b> while the selected function is the Twitch Test, the features of monitoring screen <b>200</b> apply equally to all the functions. Result-specific data is displayed in a center result area <b>201</b>. A large color saturated numeric value (not shown) is used to show the threshold result. Three different options are provided for showing the stimulation response level. First, the user can view the waveform. Second, a likeness of the color coded electrode harness label <b>86</b> may be shown on the display. Third, the color coded label <b>212</b> may be integrated with a body image. On one side of center result area <b>201</b> there is a collapsible device menu <b>202</b>. The device menu displays a graphic representation of each device connected to the patient module <b>14</b>. If a device is selected from the device menu <b>202</b>, an impedance test may be initiated. Opposite the device menu <b>202</b> there is a collapsible test menu <b>204</b>. The test menu <b>204</b> highlights each test that is available under the operable setup profile and may be used to navigate between functions. A collapsible stimulation bar <b>206</b> indicates the current stimulation status and provides start and stop stimulation buttons (not shown) to activate and control stimulation. The collapsible event bar <b>208</b> stores all the stimulation test results obtained throughout a procedure so that the user may review the entire case history from the monitoring screen. Clicking on a particular event will open a note box and annotations may be entered and saved with the response for later inclusion in a procedure report chronicling all nerve monitoring functions conducted during the procedure as well as the results of nerve monitoring. In one embodiment the report may be printed immediately from one or more printers located in the operating room or copied to any of a variety of memory devices known in the prior art, such as, by way of example only, a floppy disk, and/or USB memory stick. The system <b>10</b> may generate either a full report or a summary report depending on the particular needs of the user. In one embodiment, the identifiers used to identify the surgical accessories to the patient module may also be encoded to identify their lot number or other identifying information. As soon as the accessory is identified, the lot number may be automatically added to the report. Alternatively, hand held scanners can be provided and linked to the control unit <b>12</b> or patient module <b>14</b>. The accessory packaging may be scanned and again the information may go directly to the procedure report. The event bar <b>208</b> also houses a chat box feature when the system <b>10</b> is connected to a remote monitoring system to allow a user in the operating room to contemporaneously communicate with a person performing the associated neuromonitoring in a remote location.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0077">The system <b>10</b> may also conduct free-run EMG monitoring while the system is in any of the modes described herein. Free-run EMG monitoring continuously listens for spontaneous muscle activity that might be indicative of potential danger. The system <b>10</b> may automatically cycle into free-run monitoring after 5 seconds of inactivity. Initiating a stimulation signal in the selected mode will interrupt the free-run monitoring until the system <b>10</b> has again been inactive for five seconds, at which time the free-run begins again.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0078">The system <b>10</b> may test the integrity of pedicle holes (during and/or after formation) and/or screws (during and/or after introduction) via the Basic Stimulation EMG and Dynamic Stimulation EMG tests. To perform the Basic Stimulation EMG a test probe <b>116</b> is placed in the screw hole prior to screw insertion or placed on the installed screw head and a stimulation signal is applied. The insulating character of bone will prevent the stimulation current, up to a certain amplitude, from communicating with the nerve, thus resulting in a relatively high I<sub>thresh</sub>, as determined via the basic threshold hunting algorithm described below. However, in the event the pedicle wall has been breached by the screw or tap, the current density in the breach area will increase to the point that the stimulation current will pass through to the adjacent nerve roots and they will depolarize at a lower stimulation current, thus I<sub>thresh </sub>will be relatively low. The system described herein may exploit this knowledge to inform the practitioner of the current I<sub>thresh </sub>of the tested screw to determine if the pilot hole or screw has breached the pedicle wall.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0079">In Dynamic Stim EMG mode, test probe <b>116</b> may be replaced with a clip <b>18</b> which may be utilized to couple a surgical tool, such as for example, a tap member <b>28</b> or a pedicle access needle <b>26</b>, to the system <b>10</b>. In this manner, a stimulation signal may be passed through the surgical tool and pedicle integrity testing can be performed while the tool is in use. Thus, testing may be performed during pilot hole formation by coupling the access needle <b>26</b> to the system <b>10</b>, and during pilot hole preparation by coupling the tap <b>28</b> to the system <b>10</b>. Likewise, by coupling a pedicle screw to the system <b>10</b> (such as via pedicle screw instrumentation), integrity testing may be performed during screw introduction.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0080">In both Basic Stimulation EMG mode and Dynamic Stimulation EMG mode, the signal characteristics used for testing in the lumbar testing may not be effective when monitoring in the thoracic and/or cervical levels because of the proximity of the spinal cord to thoracic and cervical pedicles. Whereas a breach formed in a pedicle of the lumbar spine results in stimulation being applied to a nerve root, a breach in a thoracic or cervical pedicle may result in stimulation of the spinal cord instead, but the spinal cord may not respond to a stimulation signal the same way the nerve root would. To account for this, the surgical system <b>10</b> is equipped to deliver stimulation signals having different characteristics based on the region selected. By way of example only, when the lumbar region is selected, stimulation signals for the stimulated EMG modes comprise single pulse signals. On the other hand, when the thoracic and cervical regions are selected the stimulation signals may be configured as multipulse signals.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0081">Stimulation results (including but not necessarily limited to at least one of the numerical I<sub>thresh </sub>value and color coded safety level indication) and other relevant data are conveyed to the user on at least main display <b>34</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b> and <b>23</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> illustrates the monitoring screen <b>200</b> with the Basic Stimulation EMG test selected. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> illustrates the monitoring screen <b>200</b> with the Dynamic Stimulation EMG test selected. In one embodiment of the various screw test functions (e.g. Basic and Dynamic), green corresponds to a threshold range of greater than 10 milliamps (mA), a yellow corresponds to a stimulation threshold range of 7-10 mA, and a red corresponds to a stimulation threshold range of 6 mA or below. EMG channel tabs may be selected via the touch screen display <b>26</b> to show the I<sub>thresh </sub>of the corresponding nerves. Additionally, the EMG channel possessing the lowest I<sub>thresh </sub>may be automatically highlighted and/or colored to clearly indicate this fact to the user.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0082">The system <b>10</b> may perform nerve proximity testing, via the XLIF mode, to ensure safe and reproducible access to surgical target sites. Using the surgical access components <b>26</b>-<b>32</b>, the system <b>10</b> detects the existence of neural structures before, during, and after the establishment of an operative corridor through (or near) any of a variety of tissues having such neural structures which, if contacted or impinged, may otherwise result in neural impairment for the patient. The surgical access components <b>26</b>-<b>32</b> are designed to bluntly dissect the tissue between the patient's skin and the surgical target site. Dilators of increasing diameter, which are equipped with one or more stimulating electrodes, are advanced towards the target site until a sufficient operating corridor is established to advance retractor <b>32</b> to the target site. As the dilators are advanced to the target site electrical stimulation signals are emitted via the stimulation electrodes. The stimulation signal will stimulate nerves in close proximity to the stimulation electrode and the corresponding EMG response is monitored. As a nerve gets closer to the stimulation electrode, the stimulation current required to evoke a muscle response decreases because the resistance caused by human tissue will decrease, and it will take less current to cause nervous tissue to depolarize. I<sub>thresh </sub>is calculated, using the basic threshold hunting algorithm described below, providing a measure of the communication between the stimulation signal and the nerve and thus giving a relative indication of the proximity between access components and nerves. An example of the monitoring screen <b>200</b> with XLIF mode active is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>. In a preferred embodiment, a green or safe level corresponds to a stimulation threshold range of 10 milliamps (mA) or greater, a yellow level denotes a stimulation threshold range of 5-9 mA, and a red level denotes a stimulation threshold range of 4 mA or below.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0083">In MEP modes, stimulation signals are delivered to the motor cortex via patient module <b>14</b> and resulting responses are detected from various muscles in the upper and lower extremities. An increase in I<sub>thresh </sub>from an earlier test to a later test may indicate a degradation of spinal cord function. Likewise, the absence of a significant EMG response to a given I<sub>stim </sub>on a channel that had previously reported a significant response to the same or lesser I<sub>stim </sub>is also indicative of a degradation in spinal cord function. These indicators are detected by the system in the MEP modes and reported to the surgeon. In MEP Manual mode, the user selects the stimulation current level and the system reports whether or not the stimulation signal evokes a significant response on each channel. Stimulation results may be shown on the display <b>34</b> in the form of &#x201c;YES&#x201d; and &#x201c;NO&#x201d; responses, or other equivalent indicia, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>. In MEP Automatic mode the system determines the I<sub>thresh </sub>baseline for each channel corresponding to the various monitored muscles, preferably early in the procedure, using the multi-channel algorithm described. Throughout the procedure subsequent tests may be conducted to again determine I<sub>thresh </sub>for each channel. The difference between the resulting I<sub>thresh </sub>values and the corresponding baseline are computed by the system <b>10</b> and compared against predetermined &#x201c;safe&#x201d; and &#x201c;unsafe&#x201d; difference values. The I<sub>thresh</sub>, baseline and difference values are displayed to the user, along with any other indicia of the safety level determined (such as a red, yellow, green color code), on the display <b>34</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>. Using either mode the surgeon may thus be alerted to potential complications with the spinal cord and any corrective actions deemed necessary may be undertaken at the discretion of the surgeon.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0084">In Transcutaneous Nerve Root Stimulation modes (TCNR), the system <b>10</b> is capable of ascertaining the health and/or status of at-risk nerves along the motor neural pathway superior and inferior to the surgical site before, during, and/or after the creation of the operative corridor to the surgical target site. To accomplish this, stimulation electrodes <b>22</b> may be placed on the skin over the desired spinal nerve roots (such as by way of example only, the L1 and L2 nerve roots and/or the location of the conus medullaris of the patient) and recording electrodes <b>24</b> are positioned on the recording sites (such as, by way of example only, the recording sites set forth above in Table 5). The control unit <b>12</b> and patient module <b>14</b> cooperate to transmit electrical stimulation signals to a stimulating cathode placed posteriorly on the patient's back. These stimulation signals cause nerves deep to the stimulating electrode to depolarize, evoking activity from muscles innervated by the nerves below. The system <b>10</b> detects and records the neuromuscular responses and optionally analyzes their relationship to the stimulation signal (discussed below). Resulting recording and/or assessment data is conveyed to the user, for example on screen <b>200</b>. The TCNR testing provides the ability to verify that the patient is positioned in a neutral way and that no neural structures have been impinged upon after the operative corridor has been established. In TCNR Alert mode, the underlying neurophysiologic principle of operation is to assess the health and status of the lower motor neural pathway periodically during the surgical procedure via the presence/absence of evoked neuromuscular responses for each muscle monitored. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref> depicts an example screen display for the Alert mode of the TCNR monitoring function. In TCNR Threshold mode, the underlying neurophysiologic principle is that, in order to monitor the health of the lumbar motor neural pathway, the user must be able to determine if the evoked responses are changing with respect to the stimulation signal. To monitor for this change, baseline TCNR responses are established for all muscles of interest (preferably prior to surgical manipulation) and then compared to subsequent TCNR responses periodically throughout the procedure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> depicts an example screen display for the Threshold mode of the TCNR monitoring function.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0085">In the surgical correction planning and assessment mode, the system <b>10</b> aids the user in planning and assessing the degree to which he/she has achieved the surgical goals during a spinal procedure. As illustrated, by way of example only, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>, there may be included a feature in which the system <b>10</b> is capable of digitizing implanted screw positions, outputting bend instructions for a rod, and previewing the shape of the rod on screen <b>200</b>. In some implementations, the rod bending instructions are for a rod shaped to custom-fit within the implanted screw locations. In other implementations, the system <b>10</b> is further capable of accepting correction inputs via one or more advanced option features for viewing bend instructions for a rod shaped to fit at locations apart from those implanted screw locations. Installing a rod shaped in this manner could correct a curvature deformity in the patient's spine according to a user's prescribed surgical plan. In some spinal procedures, restoring a patient's spine to a balanced position may be a desired surgical outcome. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, there may also be included a feature in which the system <b>10</b> is configured to receive and assess <b>1</b>) preoperative spinal parameter inputs; 2) target spinal parameter inputs; 3) intraoperative spinal parameter inputs; and/or postoperative spine parameter inputs via screen <b>200</b>. Spinal parameters may comprise the patient's Pelvic Incidence (PI), Pelvic Tilt (PT), Sacral Slope (SS), Lumbar Lordosis (LL), Superior Lumbar Lordosis (&#x2b06;LL), Inferior Lumbar Lordosis (&#x2b07;LL), C7 Plumb Line Offset (C7PL), Thoracic Kyphosis (TK), T1 Tilt, and Sagittal, Vertical Axis (SVA) measurements. One or more of these inputs may be tracked and/or compared against other inputs to assess how the surgical correction is progressing toward a surgical plan and utilized to develop/refine an operative plan to achieve the desired surgical correction.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0086">In the SSEP modes, the system <b>10</b> stimulates peripheral sensory nerves that exit the spinal cord below the level of surgery and then measures the electrical action potential from electrodes located on the nervous system superior to the surgical target site. Recording sites below the applicable target site are also preferably monitored as a positive control measure to ensure variances from normal or expected results are not due to problems with the stimulation signal delivered (e.g. misplaced stimulation electrode, inadequate stimulation signal parameters, etc.). To accomplish this, stimulation electrodes <b>22</b> may be placed on the skin over the desired peripheral nerve (such as by way of example only, the left and right Posterior Tibial nerve and/or the left and right Ulnar nerve) and recording electrodes <b>24</b> are positioned on the recording sites (such as, by way of example only, at least two of the C2 vertebra, Cp3 scalp, Cp4 scalp, Erb's point, Popliteal Fossa) and stimulation signals are delivered from the patient module <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0087">Damage in the spinal cord may disrupt the transmission of the signal up along the spinothalamic pathway through the spinal cord resulting in a weakened, delayed, or absent signal at the recording sites superior to the surgery location (e.g. cortical and subcortical sites). To check for these occurrences, the system <b>10</b> monitors the amplitude and latency of the evoked signal response. According to one embodiment, the system <b>10</b> may perform SSEP in either of two modes: Automatic mode and Manual mode. In SSEP Auto mode, the system <b>10</b> compares the difference between the amplitude and latency of the signal response vs. the amplitude and latency of a baseline signal response. The difference is compared against predetermined &#x201c;safe&#x201d; and &#x201c;unsafe&#x201d; levels and the results are displayed on display <b>34</b>. According to one embodiment, the system may determine safe and unsafe levels based on each of the amplitude and latency values for each of the cortical and subcortical sites individually, for each stimulation channel. That is, if either of the subcortical and cortical amplitudes decrease by a predetermined level, or either of the subcortical and cortical latency values increase by a predetermined level, the system may issue a warning. By way of example, the alert may comprise a Red, Yellow, Green type warning associated with the applicable channel wherein Red indicates that at least one of the determined values falls within the unsafe level, the color green may indicate that all of the values fall within the safe level, and the color yellow may indicate that at least one of the values falls between the safe and unsafe levels. To generate more information, the system <b>10</b> may analyze the results in combination. With this information, in addition to the Red, Yellow, and Green alerts, the system <b>10</b> may indicate possible causes for the results achieved. In SSEP Manual mode, signal response waveforms and amplitude and latency values associated with those waveforms are displayed for the user. The user then makes the comparison between a baseline the signal response.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b>-<b>36</b></figref> are exemplary screen displays of the &#x201c;SSEP Manual&#x201d; mode according to one embodiment of the neuromonitoring system <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> illustrates an setup screen from which various features and parameters of the SSEP Manual mode may be controlled and/or adjusted by the user as desired. Using this screen, the user has the opportunity to toggle between Manual mode and Automatic mode, select a stimulation rate, and change one or more stimulation settings (e.g. stimulation current, pulse width, and polarity) for each stimulation target site (e.g. left ulnar nerve, right ulnar nerve, left tibial nerve, and right tibial nerve). By way of example only, the user may change one or more stimulation settings of each peripheral nerve by first selecting one of the stimulation site tabs <b>264</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0089">Selecting one of the stimulation site tabs <b>264</b> will open a control window <b>265</b>, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>, from which various parameters of the SSEP manual test may be adjusted according to user preference. By way of example only, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> is an illustration of an onscreen display for the SSEP manual test settings of the left ulnar nerve stimulation site. The highlighted &#x201c;Left Ulnar Nerve&#x201d; stimulation site tab <b>264</b> and the pop-up window title <b>266</b> indicate that adjusting any of the settings will alter the stimulation signal delivered to the left ulnar nerve. Multiple adjustment buttons are used to set the parameters of the stimulation signal. According to one example, the stimulation rate may be selected from a range between 2.2 and 6.2 Hz, with a default value of 4.7 Hz. The amplitude setting may be increased or decreased in increments of 10 mA using the amplitude selection buttons <b>270</b> labeled (by way of example only) &#x201c;+10&#x201d; and &#x201c;&#x2212;10&#x201d;.

According to one example, the amplitude may be selected from a range of 1 to 100 mA with a default value of 10 mA. The selected amplitude setting is displayed in box <b>274</b>. The pulse width setting may be increased or decreased in increments of 50 &#x3bc;sec using the width selection buttons <b>276</b> labeled &#x201c;+50&#x201d; and &#x201c;&#x2212;50&#x201d;. According to one example, the pulse width may be selected from a range of 50 to 300 &#x3bc;sec, with a default value of 200 &#x3bc;sec. The precise pulse width setting <b>278</b> is indicated in box <b>278</b>. Polarity controls <b>280</b> may be used to set the desired polarity of the stimulation signal. SSEP stimulation may be initiated at the selected stimulation settings by pressing the SSEP stimulation start button <b>284</b> labeled (by way of example only) &#x201c;Start Stim.&#x201d; Although stimulation settings adjustments are discussed with respect to the left ulnar nerve, it will be appreciated that stimulation adjustments may be applied to the other stimulation sites, including but not limited to the right ulnar nerve, and left and right tibial nerve. Alternatively, as described below, the system <b>10</b> may utilize an automated selection process to quickly determine the optimal stimulation parameters for each stimulation channel.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0090">In order to monitor the health of the spinal cord with SSEP, the user must be able to determine if the responses to the stimulation signal are changing. To monitor for this change a baseline is determined, preferably during set-up. This can be accomplished simply by selecting the &#x201c;set as baseline&#x201d; button <b>298</b> next to the &#x201c;start stim&#x201d; button <b>284</b> on the setting screen illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>. Having determined a baseline recording for each stimulation site, subsequent monitoring may be performed as desired throughout the procedure and recovery period to obtain updated amplitude and latency measurements.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> depicts an exemplary screen display for Manual mode of the SSEP monitoring function. A mode indicator tab <b>290</b> on the test menu <b>204</b> indicates that &#x201c;SSEP Manual&#x201d; is the selected mode. The center result area <b>201</b> is divided into four sub areas or channel windows <b>294</b>, each one dedicated to displaying the signal response waveforms for one of the stimulation nerve sites. The channel windows <b>294</b> depict information including the nerve stimulation site <b>295</b>, and waveform waterfalls for each of the recording locations <b>291</b>-<b>293</b>. For each stimulated nerve site, the system <b>10</b> displays three signal response waveforms, representing the measurements made at three different recording sites. By way of example only, the three recording sites are a peripheral <b>291</b> (from a peripheral nerve proximal to the stimulation nerve), subcortical <b>292</b> (spine), and cortical <b>293</b> (scalp), as indicated for example in Table 6 above. Each section may be associated with a pictorial icon, illustrating the neural/skeletal structure. Although SSEP stimulation and recording is discussed with respect to the nerve stimulation site and the recording sites discussed above, it will be appreciated that SSEP stimulation may be applied to any number of peripheral sensory nerves and the recording sites may be located anywhere along the nervous system superior to the spinal level at risk during the procedure.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0092">During SSEP modes (auto and manual), a single waveform response is generated for each stimulation signal run (for each stimulation channel). The waveforms are arranged with stimulation on the extreme left and time increasing to the right. By way of example, the waveforms are captured in a 100 msec window following stimulation. The stimulation signal run is comprised of a predefined number of stimulation pulses firing at the selected stimulation frequency. By way of example only, the stimulation signal may include up to 300 pulses at a frequency of 4.7 Hz. A 100 ms window of data is acquired on each of three SSEP recording channels: cortical, subcortical, and peripheral. With each successive stimulation on the same channel during a stimulation run, the three acquired waveforms are summed and averaged with the prior waveforms during the same stimulation run for the purpose of filtering out asynchronous events such that only the synchronous evoked response remains after a sufficient number of pulses. Thus, the final waveform displayed by the system <b>10</b> represents an averaging of the entire set (e.g. <b>300</b>) of responses detected.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0093">With each subsequent stimulation run, waveforms are drawn slightly lower each time, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>33</b>-<b>35</b></figref>, until a total of four waveforms are showing. After more than four stimulation runs, the baseline waveform is retained, as well as the waveforms from the previous four stimulation runs. Older waveforms are removed from the waveform display. According to one embodiment, different colors may be used to represent the different waveforms. For example, the baseline waveforms may be colored purple, the last stimulation run may be colored white, the next-to-last stimulation run may be colored medium gray, and the earliest of the remaining stimulation runs may be colored dark gray.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0094">According to one example, the baseline and the latest waveforms may have markers <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> placed indicating latency and amplitude values associated with the waveform. The latency is defined as the time from stimulation to the first (earliest) marker. There is one &#x201c;N&#x201d; <b>314</b> and one &#x201c;P&#x201d; <b>316</b> marker for each waveform. The N marker is defined as the maximum average sample value within a window and the P value is defined as the minimum average sample value within the window. The markers may comprise cross consisting of a horizontal and a vertical line in the same color as the waveform. Associated with each marker is a text label <b>317</b> indicating the value at the marker. The earlier of the two markers is labeled with the latency (e.g. 22.3 ms). The latter of the two markers is labeled with the amplitude (e.g. 4.2 uV). The amplitude is defined as the difference in microvolts between average sample values at the markers. The latency is defined as the time from stimulation to the first (earliest) marker. Preferably, the markers are placed automatically by the system <b>10</b> (in both auto and manual modes). In manual mode, the user may select to place (and or move) markers manually.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0095">Further selecting one of the channel windows <b>294</b> will zoom in on the waveforms contained in that window <b>294</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref> is an example illustration of the zoom view achieved by selecting one of the channel windows <b>294</b>.

In similar fashion to the onscreen displays previously described for the SSEP Manual mode, the system <b>10</b> includes a channel window <b>294</b> for each nerve stimulation site. The channel window <b>294</b> may display information including the nerve stimulation site <b>295</b>, waveform recordings, and associated recording locations <b>291</b>-<b>293</b> (peripheral, sub cortical, and cortical) and the percentage change between the baseline and amplitude measurements and the baseline and latency measurements. By way of example only, each channel window <b>294</b> may optionally also show the baseline waveform and latest waveform for each recording site. In the event the system <b>10</b> detects a significant decrease in amplitude or an increase in latency, the associated window may preferably be highlighted with a predetermined color (e.g. red) to indicate the potential danger to the surgeon. Preferably, the stimulation results are displayed to the surgeon along with a color code so that the user may easily comprehend the danger and corrective measures may be taken to avoid or mitigate such danger. This may for example, more readily permit SSEP monitoring results to be interpreted by the surgeon or assistant without requiring dedicated neuromonitoring personnel. By way of example only, red is used when the decrease in amplitude or increase in latency is within a predetermined unsafe level. Green indicates that the measured increase or decrease is within a predetermined safe level. Yellow is used for measurements that are between the predetermined unsafe and safe levels. By way of example only, the system <b>10</b> may also notify the user of potential danger through the use of a warning message <b>334</b>.

Alerts may be displayed on the diagram to represent the peripheral and spinal segment regions as set forth, by way of example only, in Table 10. According to one or more embodiments, it may be desirable to record from all four stimulation sites (e.g. Left Posterior Tibial Nerve, Right Posterior Tibial Nerve, Left Ulnar Nerve, and Right Ulnar nerve) from just two recording sites (by way of example, one subcortical recording location referenced to one cortical recording location). Such a configuration potentially alleviates the complexity associated with the different alert criteria required when managing peripheral, subcortical, and cortical responses simultaneously. By having all four stimulation sites use the same recording location, the user may be provided with information as to the health and status of the spinal cord without differentiating between electrodes. This facilitates the ability to troubleshoot technical issues. For example, noise caused by a dislodged recording electrode can be limited to one recording electrode to be examined. This also facilitates taking into account anesthetic effects on SSEP signals. For example, if there is a change to the anesthetic regime that affects the amplitude and/or latency of any responses, all four SSEP responses will change by the same amount because all responses are equally affected by anesthesia. This provides a direct method for determining the overall impact the anesthetic regime is having on the SSEP responses.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00009" num="00009"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="84pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" rowsep="1">TABLE 10</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Change</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>from </entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Baseline</entry><entry>Anatomy</entry><entry>Highlight</entry><entry>Visual Alert/Audio Alert</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Amplitude &#x3e; </entry><entry>upper limb</entry><entry>green limb</entry><entry>No message, tone associated</entry></row><row><entry>50% and </entry><entry>cervical spine</entry><entry>green spine</entry><entry>with green</entry></row><row><entry>Latency &#x3c; </entry><entry>thoracic spine</entry><entry>green spine</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>10%</entry><entry>lower limb</entry><entry>green limb</entry><entry>No message, no tone</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>electrode</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Amplitude &#x2264; </entry><entry>upper limb</entry><entry>yellow limb</entry><entry>&#x201c;Significant change detected.</entry></row><row><entry>50% or</entry><entry>cervical spine</entry><entry>yellow spine</entry><entry>Notify Surgeon and</entry></row><row><entry>Latency &#x2265; </entry><entry>thoracic spine</entry><entry>yellow spine</entry><entry>Anesthesiologist.&#x201d;</entry></row><row><entry>10%</entry><entry/><entry/><entry>Tone associated with yellow</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>lower limb</entry><entry>yellow limb</entry><entry>&#x201c;Significant change detected.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>electrode</entry><entry>Notify Surgeon and</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Anesthesiologist.&#x201d;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Tone associated with yellow</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0113" num="0103">In accordance with the present disclosure, there are provided one or more algorithms executable on the control unit <b>14</b> of the system <b>10</b> that quickly enable the acquisition of a well-resolved SSEP waveform with a minimum number of stimulations, without the need for highly trained personal to be present to acquire or interpret the waveform. These algorithms may be used alone or in combination with one another to refine stimulation parameters until a combination resulting in the most desirable result is achieved. It is to be appreciated while the algorithms described below are described with respect to somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), it is equally applicable to all neurophysiologic modalities, including but not limited to motor evoked potential testing (MEP) and transcutaneous nerve root (TCNR) testing. It will also be appreciated that the algorithms described below are applicable to not just spine procedures but any procedure in which one or more aspects of the nervous system are at risk of permanent or transient injury or damage.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0104">According to a broad aspect of the present invention, there is provided a baseline hunting algorithm that quickly ascertains a noise rejection threshold (NRT) and automatically optimizes baseline stimulation parameters for use in subsequent SSEP testing performed during the surgical procedure. According to one implementation, the baseline hunting algorithm may include the following steps: (a) establish a rejection threshold to minimize the number of responses needed and the amount of noise allowed into the average; (b) use a noise floor window to isolate the white background noise level for comparison to the neurophysiological response; (c) analyze the stability of waveform markers to ensure they are reproducible amongst consecutive stimulations; and (d) store stimulation parameters for all stimulation sites when such stimulation parameters elicit clinically significant SSEP responses. Optionally, after the stimulation parameters are obtained for one stimulation site, the algorithm may optionally increase the stimulation frequency for the remaining stimulation sites to identify the proper stimulation parameters as quickly as possible. Once optimized baseline stimulation parameters are obtained, baseline SSEP recordings may be obtained and monitored during the procedure for significant changes to those baseline recordings.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0105">In general, minimizing the noise allowed into an SSEP average will reduce the number of responses required for a well-resolved response. In accordance with the present disclosure, a noise rejection threshold parameter is used to minimize the number of responses added to the average that have excessive interference. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b></figref>, at step <b>300</b>, the stimulating hunting algorithm process is started. The algorithm will first hunt for an optimal noise rejection threshold to ensure that a significant number of stimulations are being allowed into the average (step <b>302</b>). According to one embodiment, the system <b>10</b> analyzes how many stimulations are rejected as falling outside of the rejection threshold level. If the rejection rate is more than 50%, the system <b>10</b> increases the noise rejection threshold incrementally (e.g., +10 &#x3bc;V) shown as step <b>304</b> until the rejection rate is less than 50%. If the noise rejection threshold reaches a maximum (e.g., 250 &#x3bc;V) without reaching a less than 50% rejection rate, then the user is alerted to find the source of the interference before proceeding with SSEPs (e.g. a visual alert on the GUI screen &#x201c;check electrode connection&#x201d;). Once the rejection rate is less than 50%, the system <b>10</b> sets that rejection threshold level as the noise rejection level (i.e. noise floor) and the algorithm proceeds to refining the stimulation parameters as set forth below.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0106">Once the noise rejection threshold has been identified, the stimulation continues and the algorithm proceeds to evaluate the stability of the SSEP waveforms. Stability of the SSEP waveforms may be evaluated as the degree to which an SSEP response moves or shifts each time it is refreshed on the graphical user interface. A stable response may be one that does not move/shift an appreciable amount between stimulations and an unstable response may be one that does move/shift an appreciable amount between stimulations. By way of example, the system <b>10</b> may measure stability by tracking latency over time. This may be accomplished, for example, via a pixel analysis to determine when the waveform is settled down into a consistent averaged response. At step <b>306</b>, the system <b>10</b> continues to direct stimulation and measures the stability of the SSEP waveforms. According to one or more implementations, a waveform may be deemed &#x201c;stable&#x201d; when its latency markers does not vary more than 2 msec in between responses to successive stimulations.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0107">Once the waveform is deemed stabilized such that N and P markers <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> can be placed, the amplitude of the waveform is compared to the noise floor (defined as the noise rejection threshold obtained at step <b>302</b>). At step <b>308</b>, the system <b>10</b> compares the V<sub>pp </sub>of the response to the V<sub>pp </sub>of the noise floor to make sure that the response sufficiently greater than the noise floor to be deemed clinically significant. By way of example, a response may be deemed clinically significant when its amplitude is 2.2 times the amplitude of the noise floor. If the response is not sufficiently greater than the noise floor, the stimulation current is increased until a clinically significant response is evoked. By way of example, the stimulation intensity may be increased at step <b>310</b> incrementally (e.g. 10 mA) until a clinically significant response is found or until a maximum current is reached (e.g. 100 mA). The stimulation current level that produced that clinically significant response for that is recorded in memory at step <b>312</b>. This stimulation current will be used for the baseline stimulation and all subsequent stimulations throughout the procedure. Stimulation hunting continues until the optimal parameters have been stored for each stimulation site. As shown in step <b>314</b>, according to some implementations, the stimulation rate may be increased for remaining stimulation sites to make the hunting process as efficient as possible. By way example only, the stimulation rate may be increased to the maximum stimulation rate allowed for the remaining simulation sites that have not found a response.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0108">After the stimulation intensity has been determined for all stimulation sites, the stored stimulation parameters are used to run the baseline (step <b>316</b>). As shown in step <b>318</b>, subsequent stimulations are run during the surgical procedure and compared to the baseline to determine if there is a significant change in the SSEP responses in one or more channels. As shown in step <b>320</b>, SSEP changes are determined to be clinically significant if they exceed a predetermined criteria (e.g., an amplitude decrease of &#x3e;50% and/or a latency increase of &#x3e;10% from baseline). If the answer is yes, (step <b>322</b>) there is a deemed significant change. If the answer is no (step <b>324</b>), there is no significant change. These alerts are displayed to the user, by way of example, only, using one of the methods set forth above.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0109">As set forth above, SSEP monitoring involves recording very low level signals in the presence of other biologic signals and noise. To overcome the noise, the evoked response is recorded anywhere from 50 to 500 times to average out any non-coherent, non-time locked response. The result is a clear waveform representing the desired nerve signal. In prior art systems, the user of the manually selects the number of times that the signal will be recorded for the entire procedure. If the noise level is high, a high number of samples to be taken. If the noise is low, then a low number of samples is taken. However, the ability to quickly obtain an SSEP result once the waveform is sufficiently well-resolved provides feedback to the user in a meaningful way. The present disclosure describes an algorithmic means of determining the number of evoked responses to include in the data set.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0110">According to another broad aspect of the present invention, there is provided an algorithm for determining the number of evoked responses to include in a data set based on the variance of V<sub>pp </sub>amplitudes in the waveform. The algorithm will stop the averaging process once random biologic and noise information has been sufficiently averaged out. According to one implementation shown by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b></figref>, the positive and negative peaks of the waveform are located and their relative amplitude is measured (step <b>400</b>). The variance of the V<sub>pp </sub>of the waveform is monitored over time as stimulations continue (step <b>402</b>). When the variance achieves a specified consistency between data sets (for example &#x3c;5%), the algorithm will automatically stop the SSEP data collection (step <b>404</b>). For example, if the data collection is revealing a nerve signal peak-to-peak voltage of 1 &#x3bc;V and the next data set added to the average changes the amplitude by less than 5%, then the algorithm would command a stop to the data collection. It is to be appreciated that the tolerance for variations in the signal could be set parametrically (e.g. 0.5%, 1%, 5%) as well as the number of datasets that arrive within the established average (e.g. 1, 5, 10).</p><p id="p-0121" num="0111">Low amplitude SSEP signals are often recorded in the presence of AC power line noise (typically 60 Hz or 50 Hz). The available SSEP stimulation rates are calculated to capture alternate positive and negative phases of the AC power line frequency, maximizing the rejection of power line noise through cancellation. Very often, when gathering sweeps to include in an average, a number of sweeps may be excluded from a given average due to amplitude rejection criteria, data communication interruption, or other causes. If an unequal number of positive or negative phase sweeps are included in the average, the final SSEP average may retain an undesirably high residual level of line frequency noise. The larger the discrepancy between the number of positive and negative phases included in the average, the larger that remaining residual level will be.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0112">According to another broad aspect of the present invention, there is provided an algorithm to control the number of positive and negative phase sweeps included in the average. According to some implementations, the system <b>10</b> tracks the number of each phase included in the average, and adjust (by adding an appropriate number of positive or negative phase sweeps, whichever is lacking, or by removing an appropriate number of positive or negative phase sweeps, whichever is in excess) until the number of positive and negative phase sweeps in the average are equal. This could be done dynamically during, or at the end of an average.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0113">According to one embodiment, sequential stimulations are tracked through the use of an identification tag, and a score of positive phase and negative phase line frequency components can be maintained. The firmware and/or the software application can then determine if an unmatched phase of line frequency noise is in the data set and thereby choose to collect additional data sets or subtract a data set until the score is matched for both phases.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0114">While this invention has been described in terms of a best mode for achieving this invention's objectives, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that variations may be accomplished in view of these teachings without deviating from the spirit or scope of the present invention.
