No. 16/787,569, filed Feb. 11, 2020, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/804,144, filed Feb. 11, 2019, the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to substrate processing systems, and more specifically, to physical vapor deposition (PVD) processing systems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Sputtering, alternatively called physical vapor deposition (PVD), has long been used in depositing metals and related materials in the fabrication of semiconductor integrated circuits. Use of sputtering has been extended to depositing metal layers onto the sidewalls of high aspect-ratio holes such as vias or other vertical interconnect structures, as well as in the manufacture of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) mask blanks. In the manufacture of EUV mask blanks minimization of particle generation is desired, because particles negatively impact the properties of the final product.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Plasma sputtering may be accomplished using either DC sputtering or RF sputtering. Plasma sputtering typically includes a magnetron positioned at the back of the sputtering target to project a magnetic field into the processing space to increase the density of the plasma and enhance the sputtering rate. Magnets used in the magnetron are typically closed loop for DC sputtering and open loop for RF sputtering.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Agglomerated charged particles are typically not an issue observed in physical vapor deposition. Recently, large particles on wafers have been observed in some pulsed PVD chambers. There is need to provide apparatus and methods to prevent or minimize particulate damage to sputtered substrates.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One or more embodiments of the disclosure are directed to physical vapor deposition methods. A film is deposited on a substrate surface in a magnetron physical vapor deposition chamber with a plasma at a deposition pressure and creating particles in the plasma. The pressure in the physical vapor deposition chamber in increased to a particulate purge pressure greater than the deposition pressure to move at least some of the particles to an outer portion of the physical vapor deposition chamber. The plasma can then be extinguished.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additional embodiments of the disclosure are directed to physical vapor deposition methods comprising positioning a substrate having a substrate surface on a pedestal in a magnetron physical vapor deposition chamber. A deposition plasma is generated at a deposition pressure in the chamber to deposit a film on the substrate surface and create particulates in the plasma. The pressure in the chamber is increased to a particulate purge pressure greater than the deposition pressure to agglomerate particulates in the plasma and move the agglomerated particulates to an outer portion of the physical vapor deposition chamber.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further embodiments of the disclosure are directed to physical vapor deposition methods comprising positioning a substrate having a substrate surface on a pedestal in a magnetron physical vapor deposition chamber. The magnetron physical vapor deposition chamber comprises a carbon target with a flow of krypton. A film is deposited on the substrate surface by generating a deposition plasma at a deposition pressure less than or equal to about 40 mtorr in the chamber, depositing the film creates particulates in the plasma. Particulates falling on the substrate surface are decreased by increasing pressure in the chamber to a particulate purge pressure greater than or equal to about 70 mtorr to agglomerate particulates in the plasma and move the agglomerated particulates to an outer portion of the physical vapor deposition chamber.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">So that the manner in which the above recited features of the present disclosure can be understood in detail, a more particular description of the disclosure, briefly summarized above, may be had by reference to embodiments, some of which are illustrated in the appended drawings.

The process chamber <b>104</b> contains a substrate support <b>106</b> for receiving a substrate <b>108</b> thereon. The substrate support <b>106</b> may be located within a lower grounded enclosure wall <b>110</b>, which may be a chamber wall of the process chamber <b>104</b>. The lower grounded enclosure wall <b>110</b> may be electrically coupled to the grounding assembly <b>103</b> of the chamber body <b>101</b> such that an RF return path is provided to an RF or DC power source <b>182</b> disposed above the chamber body <b>101</b>.

In conventional PVD chambers having magnetrons, the magnetron drive shaft is typically disposed along the central axis of the chamber, preventing the coupling of RF energy in a position aligned with the central axis of the chamber. In one or more embodiments, the electrode <b>154</b> is aligned with the central axis <b>186</b> of the PVD chamber. As such, in some embodiments, the motor shaft <b>174</b> of the magnetron may be disposed through an off-center opening in the ground plate <b>156</b>. The end of the motor shaft <b>174</b> protruding from the ground plate <b>156</b> is coupled to a motor <b>176</b>. The motor shaft <b>174</b> is further disposed through a corresponding off-center opening through the source distribution plate <b>158</b> (e.g., a first opening <b>146</b>) and coupled to a gear box <b>178</b>. In some embodiments, one or more second openings (not shown) may be disposed though the source distribution plate <b>158</b> in a symmetrical relationship to the first opening <b>146</b> to advantageously maintain axisymmetric RF distribution along the source distribution plate <b>158</b>. The one or more second openings may also be used to allow access to the cavity <b>170</b> for items such as optical sensors or the like. In one or more embodiments, the backing plate assemblies described herein are particularly useful in multi-cathode PVD systems with rotating magnets. Prior art designs with larger cooling cavities limited the ability to utilize rotating magnets.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The gear box <b>178</b> may be supported by any suitable means, such as by being coupled to a bottom surface of the source distribution plate <b>158</b>. The gear box <b>178</b> may be insulated from the source distribution plate <b>158</b> by fabricating at least the upper surface of the gear box <b>178</b> from a dielectric material, or by interposing an insulator layer (not shown) between the gear box <b>178</b> and the source distribution plate <b>158</b>, or the like, or by constructing the motor shaft <b>174</b> out of a suitable dielectric material. The gear box <b>178</b> is further coupled to the magnet support member <b>172</b> via the gear box shaft assembly <b>184</b> to transfer the rotational motion provided by the motor <b>176</b> to the magnet support member <b>172</b> (and hence, the plurality of magnets <b>188</b>).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The magnet support member <b>172</b> may be constructed from any material suitable to provide adequate mechanical strength to rigidly support the plurality of magnets <b>188</b>.

The magnet support member <b>172</b> may have any shape suitable to allow the plurality of magnets <b>188</b> to be coupled thereto in a desired position. For example, in some embodiments, the magnet support member <b>172</b> may comprise a plate, a disk, a cross member, or the like.

The cavity <b>270</b> is a flow volume or cavity disposed between the backside of the target assembly and the source distribution plate, which also includes an extended portion of a fluid inlet end <b>218</b> and a fluid outlet end <b>220</b>.

In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the target <b>210</b> is cooled, but not effectively because cooling water is not replaced continuously, which causes a higher target temperature, which can lead to warping, spalling of the target, particle generation and defects.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">One or more embodiments of the disclosure are directed to methods of preventing particles from falling on wafers in PVD processes. Some embodiments advantageously provide methods that intentionally charge particles and modify particle transport properties to move particles away from the wafer surface. Some embodiments advantageously provide methods for trapping charged particles in a predetermined location using plasma created by pulsed PVD generators. After the trapping point for the particles inside the plasma will be altered using one or more of pressure and wafer bias. Once the particle is transported away from the vicinity of the wafer, the plasma can be extinguished and a clean wafer can be retrieved.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In a Pulsed sputtering chamber of, for example, carbon, there is sufficient particle generation from the target due to, for example, the integrity of the layered sputtered target. In order to prevent loose particles from falling on wafers during sputtering, process conditions of frequency and power is intentionally changed to create a charge on the particle generated. These charged particles will be suspended in plasma. The higher the frequency, the less amount of time (&#x201c;off-time&#x201d;) is given for the particles to discharge, thereby contributing to a higher trapping force due to the electrostatic force. The trapping point of the particle lies at the highest plasma density in the chamber, which is in the center of the target plasma sheath where the electrostatic force and the ion drag force balanced out. As the deposition time lengthened, clusters of particle will begin to form and grow in the trapping point of the plasma.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">After the trapping location has been established, a plasma purge step at the end of the deposition process can be introduced to modify the trapping location of the cluster. By increasing the pressure of the chamber to, for example, about 96 mtorr (by, for example, increasing gas flow), the trapping location will move from the center of the target toward the outside vicinity of the wafer. The cluster particle will then follow the change of trapping point and move away from the wafers. In some embodiments, it has been observed that in approximately six seconds, the charged particle travels outside the wafer vicinity. Afterward, the plasma source power can be turned off, causing the charged particle to fall into the part of the chamber away from the wafer surface. As a result, a clean carbon wafer can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In embodiments where there are small charged particles trapped in the bottom plasma sheath near the wafer surface (unaffected by the trapping point near target), the addition of voltage reversal capability in the source target (e.g., 7V at 30 us) or out of sync wafer bias can be used to create a negative potential on the wafer surface. As a result, since the charged particle is negative, it will repel and move away from the wafers due to electrostatic force</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Accordingly, one or more embodiments of the disclosure are directed to methods for physical vapor deposition which reduce, minimize or eliminate particle damage on the wafer surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A through <b>5</b>C</figref> illustrate a schematic representation of a process according to one or more embodiment of the disclosure in a magnetron physical vapor deposition chamber <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, a substrate <b>210</b>, also referred to as a wafer, is positioned on a pedestal <b>205</b> in the magnetron physical vapor deposition chamber <b>200</b>.
