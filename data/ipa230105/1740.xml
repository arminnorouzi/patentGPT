Applicant and in WO2012055677.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hereinafter, when reference is made to any range of values comprised between a minimum value and a maximum value, the aforementioned minimum and maximum values are included in the aforementioned range, unless expressly stated to the contrary.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Moreover, all of the ranges include any combination of the maximum and minimum values described and include any intermediate range, even if not expressly specifically described.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Any numerical value is considered to be preceded by the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; to also indicate any numerical value that differs slightly from the one described, for example to take into account the typical dimensional tolerances in the field of reference.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hereinafter the following definitions apply.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The term &#x201c;equatorial plane&#x201d; of the tyre is used to indicate a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis of the tyre and that divides the tyre into two symmetrically equal parts.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The terms &#x201c;radial&#x201d; and &#x201c;axial&#x201d; and the expressions &#x201c;radially inner/outer&#x201d; and &#x201c;axially inner/outer&#x201d; are used with reference, respectively, to a direction substantially parallel to the equatorial plane of the tyre and to a direction substantially perpendicular to the equatorial plane of the tyre, i.e. to a direction substantially perpendicular to the rotation axis of the tyre and to a direction substantially parallel to the rotation axis of the tyre, respectively.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The terms &#x201c;circumferential&#x201d; and &#x201c;circumferentially&#x201d; are used with reference to the direction of annular extension of the tyre, i.e. to the rolling direction of the tyre, which corresponds to a direction lying on a plane coinciding with or substantially parallel to the equatorial plane of the tyre.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The term &#x201c;substantially axial direction&#x201d; is used to indicate a direction inclined, with respect to the equatorial plane of the tyre, by an angle comprised between 70&#xb0; and 90&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The term &#x201c;substantially circumferential direction&#x201d; is used to indicate a direction oriented, with respect to the equatorial plane of the tyre, at an angle comprised between 0&#xb0; and 10&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The expressions &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; and &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; are used with reference to a predetermined direction and to a predetermined reference. Therefore, assuming for example a direction from left to right and a reference taken along said direction, a position &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; with respect to the reference indicates a position to the right of said reference and a position &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; with respect to the reference indicates a position to the left of said reference.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The term &#x201c;elastomeric material&#x201d; is used to indicate a material comprising a vulcanizable natural or synthetic polymer and a reinforcing filler, wherein such a material, at room temperature and after having been subjected to vulcanization, can undergo deformations caused by a force and is capable of quickly and energetically recovering the substantially original shape and size after the elimination of the deforming force (according to the definitions of ASTM D1566-11 Standard Terminology Relating To Rubber).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The term &#x201c;metallic reinforcing cord&#x201d; is used to indicate an element consisting of one or more elongated elements (also called &#x201c;wires&#x201d;) made of a metallic material and possibly coated by, or incorporated in, a matrix of elastomeric material.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The term &#x201c;hybrid reinforcing cord&#x201d; is used to indicate a reinforcing cord comprising at least one metallic wire twisted together with at least one textile yarn. Hereinafter, reference is made to hybrid reinforcing cords reference to refer, in particular, to reinforcing cords comprising textile yarns having low modulus, like for example nylon yarns.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The term &#x201c;mixed textile reinforcing cord&#x201d; is used to indicate a reinforcing cord comprising at least one textile yarn having a low modulus, like for example a nylon yarn, twisted together with at least one textile yarn having a high modulus, like for example an aramid yarn.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The term &#x201c;yarn&#x201d; is used to indicate an elongated element consisting of the aggregation of a plurality of textile filaments or fibers.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The yarns can have one or more &#x201c;ends&#x201d;, where the term &#x201c;end&#x201d; is used to indicate a bundle of filaments twisted together. Preferably, a single end or at least two ends twisted together are provided.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The yarn can be identified with a symbol that represents the textile material, the linear density of the fiber used and the number of ends that form the yarn. For example, an aramid yarn (aromatic polyamide) identified as Ar1672 indicates a textile yarn comprising Aramid fibers with a linear density of 1670 dtex, formed by two ends twisted together.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The term &#x201c;strand&#x201d; is used to indicate the union of at least two wires or yarns, or of at least one wire and at least one yarn, to constitute an elongated element intended to be twisted together with at least one other elongated element to form at least one part of a reinforcing cord.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The term &#x201c;diameter&#x201d; of a reinforcing cord, or of a wire, is used to indicate the diameter measured as prescribed by the method BISFA E10 (The International Bureau For The Standardization Of Man-Made Fibres, Internationally Agreed Methods For Testing Steel Tyre Cords, 1995 edition).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the case of yarns, the term &#x201c;diameter&#x201d; is used to indicate the diameter of an ideal circumference that circumscribes all of the filaments that define the yarn. The diameter of a yarn increases as the number of filaments and/or ends of the yarn increases.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The term &#x201c;thread count&#x201d; of a layer is used to indicate the number of reinforcing cords per unit length provided in such a layer. The thread count can be measured in cords/dm (number of cords per decimeter).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term &#x201c;linear density&#x201d; or &#x201c;count&#x201d; of a cord or yarn is used to indicate the weight of the cord or yarn per unit length. The linear density can be measured in dtex (grams per 10 km length).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The term &#x201c;modulus&#x201d; is used to indicate the ratio between load (or force) and elongation measured at any point of a load-elongation curve according to the BISFA standard. Such a curve is traced by calculating the first derivative of the load-elongation function that defines the aforementioned curve, normalized to the linear density expressed in Tex. The modulus is therefore expressed in cN/Tex.

Such tyres comprise, in the respective crossed belt structures, and/or in the bead reinforcing structures indicated below with &#x201c;chafer&#x201d; and &#x201c;flipper&#x201d;, metallic reinforcing cords comprising particularly light steel wires, for example having a diameter equal to 0.22 mm, 0.20 mm or 0.175 mm.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The choice of the Applicant to use in the aforementioned structural components of the tyre reinforcing cords comprising only steel wires derives from the fact that the steel wires, having a high rigidity and an excellent resistance to fatigue, are capable of providing the reinforcing cord, and thus the aforementioned structural components of the tyre, with a high resistance to the high compressive or bending stresses to which such structural components are typically subjected during travel of the vehicle on which the tyre is mounted. Moreover, thanks to the high heat conduction capability of steel, the steel wires have high thermal stability, providing the reinforcing cord with a stable mechanical behavior even in extreme conditions of use, like those typical of high performance tyres.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The Applicant has also observed that steel ensures good adhesion of the reinforcing cord to the surrounding elastomeric material, with consequent advantages in terms of quality of the tyre.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">However, the Applicant observed that in order to avoid risks of corrosion of the steel in the case of leakage of water inside the tyre and, at the same time, to maximize the adhesion between steel and elastomeric material, it is advisable to ensure that, at each cross section of the reinforcing cord and, therefore, along the entire longitudinal extension of the reinforcing cord, the elastomeric material surrounds as completely as possible each steel wire. In the case of reinforcing cords comprising a plurality of steel wires twisted together, it is also advisable for the elastomeric material to penetrate as much as possible into the space defined between the aforementioned wires. This is in order to avoid having zones of possible mutual contact of the steel wires, which would actually constitute zones of possible formation of cracks due to fatigue from fretting, at the expense of the structural integrity of the tyre.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The Applicant has also observed that steel wires, having a low part load elongation, are not suitable for being used in those structural components of the tyre where a high part load elongation is desired, like for example in the zero degrees belt layers of the tyre for automobiles or motorcycles. In such structural components it is deemed preferable to use textile reinforcing cords having a low modulus, like for example reinforcing cords made of nylon or, in the cases in which a high rigidity is also required at high loads (and thus a high modulus at high loads), mixed textile reinforcing cords or hybrid reinforcing cords.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">With particular reference to mixed textile reinforcing cords and hybrid reinforcing cords, they make it possible to obtain the desired part load elongation and the desired rigidity thanks to their characteristic &#x201c;double modulus&#x201d; mechanical behavior obtained through the use of a material having a low modulus and a material having a high modulus. At low loads, the mechanical behavior of the reinforcing cord is mainly dictated by the reaction offered by the material having low modulus, whereas at high loads the mechanical behavior of the reinforcing cord is mainly dictated by the reaction offered by the material having high modulus. Such types of reinforcing cords therefore have a mechanical behavior that translates, in a load-elongation graph, by a curve defined by two segments separated by a joining knee, wherein the segment on the left of the knee (indicative of the part load elongations) has a much lower inclination with respect to the horizontal axis than that of the segment on the right of the knee (indicative of the rigidity).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The Applicant has however observed that the textile and hybrid reinforcing cords, unlike the metallic ones, do not allow adequate adhesion of the surrounding elastomeric material. Therefore, it is necessary to coat them with adhesive substances or subject them to specific chemical or physical adhesive-fixing treatments.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The Applicant has thought that it would be desirable to also use metallic reinforcing cords in those structural components of the tyre where, in order to be able to obtain a high part load elongation, textile or hybrid reinforcing cords are currently used. Indeed, it would be possible in this case to also obtain in the aforementioned structural components the desired adhesion between reinforcing cord and surrounding elastomeric material without the need to apply an adhesive coating to the reinforcing cord or to subject it to adhesion-fixing treatments.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The Applicant has also thought that it would be desirable for the aforementioned metallic reinforcing cords to also allow an adequate penetration of the elastomeric material between the various metallic wires, so as to maximize the adhesion between reinforcing cord and elastomeric material and avoid both risks of corrosion caused by leakages of water inside the tyre, and risks of fretting of the metallic wires.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to the Applicant, moreover, an adequate penetration of the elastomeric material between the metallic wires would result in a more homogeneous thermodynamic and hysteresis behavior of the structural component of the tyre, with consequent reduction of the risks of formation of cracks inside the structural component at the transition zones between metallic wires and elastomeric material.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The Applicant has achieved all of the goals discussed above by manufacturing metallic reinforcing cords having a part load elongation greater than 3%, such reinforcing cords comprising at least two metallic wires twisted together with a predetermined twisting pitch.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to the Applicant, the mutual twisting of at least two metallic wires provides the aforementioned reinforcing cords with a geometry which is suitable both to allow the desired penetration of the elastomeric material and to ensure a high elongation when the reinforcing cords are subjected to loads, even small loads.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The Applicant has found that the aforementioned metallic reinforcing cords have, at low loads, a mechanical behavior that is comparable to that of the textile reinforcing cords having a low modulus (thus obtaining the desired part load elongation) and, at high loads, a mechanical behavior that is comparable to that of metallic reinforcing cords (thus obtaining a high rigidity). The high part load elongation is a consequence of the stretching of the helix defined in the metallic reinforcing cord by the twisting of the metallic wires (in this case the reinforcing cord behaves like a spring), whereas the high rigidity at high loads is a consequence of the high elastic modulus which is typical of the metallic material.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The elastomeric material arranged between the metallic wires also tends to behave like a structural component of the reinforcing cord and thus to also provide a contribution in terms of rigidity.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In practice, the metallic reinforcing cords of the invention have a &#x201c;double modulus&#x201d; mechanical behavior which is comparable to the one which is typical of mixed and hybrid textile reinforcing cords. It is therefore possible to use the aforementioned metallic reinforcing cords both in all of the structural components of the tyre in which metallic reinforcing cords are typically used and in all of the structural components of the tyre in which mixed and hybrid textile reinforcing cords are typically used, thus achieving all of the advantages discussed above in connection with the use of metallic reinforcing cords (in particular: fatigue resistance, thermostability and adhesion).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The present invention therefore relates to a metallic reinforcing cord for tyres for vehicle wheels, comprising at least two metallic wires twisted together with a predetermined twisting pitch.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Preferably, the metallic reinforcing cord has a part load elongation greater than 3%, more preferably greater than 3.5%, even more preferably greater than 4%.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Such a metallic reinforcing cord has, in addition to all the advantageous features which are typical of metallic reinforcing cords (rigidity at high loads, fatigue resistance, thermostability and adhesion to the elastomeric material), a high penetration of the elastomeric material inside the same and a high part load elongation.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The particular geometry (or construction) of the metallic reinforcing cord of the invention can be selected, depending on the particular application, by changing the twisting pitch of the metallic wires or the diameter of the metallic wires, or the number of metallic wires.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">For example, by changing the twisting pitch of the metallic wires and/or their diameter it is possible to increase the amount of elastomeric material incorporated between the metallic wires and more evenly distribute the metallic wires in a piece of structural component of predetermined thickness, thus achieving an increased rigidity of such a structural component and a better transmission of the stresses borne by such a structural component during the use of the tyre, to the benefit of responsiveness.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Depending on the particular geometry which is selected the reinforcing cord can be more suitable for being used in some structural components of the tyre with respect to other structural components of the tyre. For example, it is possible to provide for a geometry adapted to maximize the rigidity, and/or the breaking load and/or the penetration of the elastomeric material inside the space defined between the various metallic wires, or a different geometry adapted to maximize the part load elongation and/or the elongation at break.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">According to the Applicant, it is preferable to maximize the rigidity and/or the breaking load and/or the penetration when using the metallic reinforcing cord in the crossed belt structures of tyres for automobile wheels, or in the reinforcing structures of the bead, indicated below with &#x201c;chafer&#x201d; and &#x201c;flipper&#x201d;, of tyres for automobile or motorcycle wheels, or in the carcass structures of tyres for motorcycle wheels, whereas it is preferable to maximize the part load elongation and/or the elongation at break when using the metallic reinforcing cord in the zero degrees belt layers of tyres for automobile and motorcycle wheels.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The Applicant believes that it may be advantageous to maximize the part load elongation also in the carcass structures of tyres, in order to increase the penetration of the elastomeric material inside the reinforcing cords.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The Applicant believes that, for example:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0073">in order to maximize the rigidity and/or the breaking load it is possible to increase the number and/or the diameter of the metallic wires;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0074">in order to maximize the penetration it is possible to increase the twisting pitch of the metallic wires, while keeping the other parameters unchanged;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0075">in order to maximize the part load elongation and/or the elongation at break it is possible to reduce the twisting pitch of the metallic wires, while keeping the other parameters unchanged.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0074" num="0076">An advantageous effect linked to the high penetration of the elastomeric material between the metallic wires of the metallic reinforcing cord of the invention, and therefore to the greater uniformity of distribution of the metallic wires in the structural component of the tyre, is that the twisting pitch of the metallic wires can be increased with no risk that unravelling occurs.
