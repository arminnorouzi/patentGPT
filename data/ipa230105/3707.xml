Specialized drilling techniques and materials are utilized to form a wellbore and extract the fuels. A wellbore is a hole that extends from the surface to a location below the surface to permit access to hydrocarbon-bearing subsurface formations. During drilling, samples, known as cuttings, are collected at the rig site and used for preliminary evaluation of reservoir rock quality and hydrocarbon presence. Well site geologists may manually assess hundreds to thousands of cuttings samples per well in order to generate qualitative descriptions and drilling reports. The cuttings provide important constraints for correlation to surrounding stratigraphy, static reservoir models, calculation of hydrocarbons in place and geo-steering decisions. This process is time-consuming which limits the time from cuttings collection to actionable information. In addition, materials characterization may vary from one well-site geologist to the next.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, a need exists for methods of analyzing geologic samples in realtime to determine rock properties of a geologic sample. The present disclosure addresses this need by incorporating onsite analysis equipment to determine rock properties of a geologic sample. The rock properties may include a color of the geologic sample, a texture of the geologic sample, a shape of the geologic sample, grain size of the geologic sample, or combinations thereof. Onsite analysis equipment allows wellsite geologists to acquire qualitative data quickly and efficiently, reducing the time needed for characterization and analysis at the wellsite. The qualitative data acquired is also consistent over time and at each wellsite with the systems and methods described in this disclosure, therefore making it ideal for qualitative assessment for cuttings analysis.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, a method of analyzing a geologic sample includes illuminating the geologic sample with a halogen light beam and capturing an image of the geologic sample on a camera thereby collecting spectra reflected from a surface of the geologic sample.

As used in the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;formation&#x201d; refers to a body of rock that is sufficiently distinctive and continuous from the surrounding rock bodies that the body of rock can be mapped as a distinct entity. A formation is, therefore, sufficiently homogenous to form a single identifiable unit containing similar rheological properties throughout the formation, including, but not limited to, porosity and permeability. A single formation may include different regions, where some regions include hydrocarbons and others do not. To produce hydrocarbons from the hydrocarbon regions of the formation, production wells are drilled to a depth that enables these hydrocarbons to travel from the subsurface formation to the surface.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As stated previously, embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to methods of analyzing a geologic sample. The method may include drilling a wellbore. The method may include preparing a drilling fluid by combining a liquid carrier with a clay-based material. As used throughout this disclosure, the term &#x201c;clay-based material&#x201d; can refer to barite, bentonite, barite, or barium sulfate, as nonlimiting examples. These clay-based materials will increase the density or viscosity of the drilling fluid. The drilling fluid may be introduced into the subsurface formation through a drilling assembly. The drilling assembly may include a drilling platform that supports a derrick having a traveling block for raising and lowering a drill string. The drill string may include, but is not limited to, drill pipe and coiled tubing, as generally known to those skilled in the art. As used throughout this disclosure, the term &#x201c;drill string&#x201d; refers to the combination of the drill pipe, the bottomhole assembly and any other tools used to drill the wellbore or introduce fluid into the wellbore. As used throughout this disclosure, the term &#x201c;coiled tubing&#x201d; refers to a long, continuous length of pipe wound on a spool. The pipe is straightened prior to pushing into a wellbore and rewound to coil the pipe back onto the transport and storage spool. Depending on the pipe base diameter (1 in. to 4&#xbd; in.) and the spool size, coiled tubing can range from 2,000 ft to 15,000 ft (610 to 4,570 m) or greater length. A kelly may support the drill string as it is lowered through a rotary table. As used throughout this disclosure, the term &#x201c;kelly&#x201d; refers to a long square or hexagonal steel bar with a hole drilled through the middle for a fluid path. The kelly is used to transmit rotary motion from a rotary table or kelly bushing to the drillstring, while allowing the drillstring to be lowered or raised during rotation. A drill bit is attached to the distal end of the drill string and is driven either by a downhole motor or via rotation of the drill string from the well surface, or by both. As the bit rotates, it creates a wellbore that penetrates various subsurface formations.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A pump (e.g., a mud pump) circulates drilling fluid through a feed pipe and to the kelly, which conveys the drilling fluid downhole through the interior of the drill string and through one or more orifices in the drill bit. The drilling fluid is then circulated back to the surface via an annulus defined between the drill string and the walls of the wellbore. As used throughout this disclosure, the term &#x201c;drill pipe&#x201d; refers to a tubular steel conduit fitted with special threaded ends called tool joints. The drill pipe connects the rig surface equipment with the bottomhole assembly and the bit, both to pump drilling fluid to the bit and to be able to raise, lower and rotate the bottomhole assembly and bit. At the surface, the recirculated or spent drilling fluid exits the annulus and may be conveyed to one or more fluid processing units via an interconnecting flow line. After passing through the fluid processing units, a &#x201c;cleaned&#x201d; drilling fluid is deposited into a nearby mud pit. While illustrated as being arranged at the outlet of the wellbore via the annulus, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the fluid processing units may be arranged at any other location in the drilling assembly to facilitate its proper function, without departing from the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The method may include acquiring the geologic sample from the wellbore. In embodiments, the method may further include cleaning the geologic sample. Cleaning the geologic sample may include flushing the geologic sample with a solvent. The solvent may be chosen from the group consisting of acetone, chloroform, methanol, cyclohexane, ethylene chloride, methylene chloride, naphtha, tetrachloroethylene, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, trichloroethylene, xylene, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the geologic sample <b>10</b> may be placed within a housing <b>30</b> of a geologic analysis apparatus <b>100</b>, where the housing <b>30</b> comprises a sidewall <b>32</b> at least partially enclosing an imaging chamber <b>34</b>. In embodiments, placing the geologic sample <b>10</b> within the housing <b>30</b> includes placing the geologic sample <b>10</b> onto an imaging platform <b>36</b> positioned within the imaging chamber <b>34</b>. The imaging platform <b>36</b> may be slidably adjustable within the imaging chamber <b>34</b> in a horizontal direction.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The geologic sample <b>10</b> may then be illuminated with a light beam. The light beam may include a halogen light beam, a polarized light beam, a collimated light beam, or combinations thereof. The light beam may be formed by one or more light sources <b>20</b>. The one or more light sources <b>20</b> may be positioned within the imaging chamber <b>34</b> on an interior of the sidewall <b>32</b>. In embodiments, there may be two light sources <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In embodiments, there may be one light source <b>20</b> (not shown) or more than two light sources <b>20</b> (not shown), such as three, four, five, six, or seven light sources <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As stated previously, the camera <b>40</b> may include an image sensor and a focusing lens. In some embodiments, the focusing lens may be a telecentric lens. Conventional lenses have angular fields of view, which means that as the distance between the lens and object increase, the magnification decreases. This angular field of view results in parallax error, also known as perspective error. Telecentric lenses eliminate this parallax error by having a constant, non-angular field of view. With telecentric lenses, magnification remains constant with object displacement, provided the object stays within the telecentric range, meaning the total distance above and below an object that remains in focus and at constant magnification.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The focusing lens may be optically coupled to the image sensor. The image sensor includes a hyperspectral camera. The image sensor may have a pixel count of at least 10 megapixels, allowing the image sensor to capture high resolution images. In embodiments, the pixel count may be as low as 16 by 16 pixels, 256 by 256 pixels, 640 by 480 pixels, 1024 by 768 pixels, 1280 by 1024 pixels, 1920 by 1080 pixels, or 4064 by 2704 pixels.

Mud logging is an important step in the real time monitoring of drilling a well.

Determining the subsurface lithology and/or the fluids present within that subsurface lithology as the well is being drilled may allow the specific lithography/reservoir characteristics of the subsurface formation to be determined in real time as that depth is being encountered, allowing decisions to be made. For example, and not by way of limitation, those decisions may include adjusting drilling operations depending on the subsurface lithography. Adjusting drilling operations may include changing drilling parameters depending on where the drillbit is relative to the known or expected geology, deciding whether or not it is productive to continue drilling, and deciding in real time when the well has reached the target depth, the target formation, the target reservoir, or combinations thereof.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 1</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A geologic sample was placed within a geologic analysis apparatus as described in this disclosure.
