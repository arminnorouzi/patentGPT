The optical fiber cable includes superabsorbent polymer (SAP) powder that contains a relatively high concentration of a silica-based flow aid disposed between two components of the optical fiber cable. For the purposes of discussion, the SAP powder will be described in relation to an optical fiber cable containing a thin film tube and an armor layer. The thin film tube surrounds a plurality of buffer tubes containing optical fibers, and the armor layer surrounds the thin film tube. In this exemplary embodiment of a cable construction, the SAP powder containing the high concentration of silica-based flow aid is disposed between the thin film tube and the armor layer to not only provide water-blocking protection for the optical fiber cable but also to prevent bonding between the armor layer and the thin film tube. In this context, using the SAP powder containing the high concentration of flow aid to overcome the issue of partially bonding between the armor layer and the thin film tube allows for use of the thin film tube in the optical fiber cable construction. The thin film tube provides easy access for a customer as it eliminates the need to cut through counter helically wrapped polyester yarns conventionally used around buffer tubes, and it provides several cost and processing advantages over conventional binder wraps. These and other aspects and advantages will be discussed more fully below and in relation to the drawing. The embodiments presented herein are provided by way of example and not by way of limitation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of an optical fiber cable <b>10</b>. The embodiment of the optical fiber cable <b>10</b> presented herein is for the purpose of illustration only, and the disclosure pertaining to the SAP powder containing the silica-based flow aid is application to other optical fiber cable constructions. With respect to the embodiment presented herein, the optical fiber cable <b>10</b> includes a cable jacket <b>12</b>. The cable jacket <b>12</b> has an inner surface <b>14</b> and an outer surface <b>16</b>. In embodiments, the outer surface <b>16</b> of the cable jacket <b>12</b> is the outermost surface of the optical fiber cable <b>10</b>. Disposed within the cable jacket <b>12</b> are a plurality of buffer tubes <b>20</b>. Each buffer tube <b>20</b> includes one or more optical fibers <b>22</b>. In the embodiment depicted, the optical fibers <b>22</b> are arranged in the buffer tubes <b>20</b> in a loose tube configuration. Further, the optical fibers <b>22</b> are individual optical fibers <b>22</b>, but in other embodiments, the optical fibers <b>22</b> could be arranged, e.g., in one or more ribbons. In embodiments, the buffer tubes <b>20</b> run along or are stranded around a central strength member <b>24</b>. In embodiments, a water-blocking yarn <b>26</b> is wrapped around the central strength member <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the embodiment depicted, the buffer tubes <b>20</b> are surrounded by a thin film tube <b>28</b>. The thin film tube <b>28</b> has an interior surface <b>30</b> and an exterior surface <b>32</b> defining an average thickness therebetween of from 0.08 mm to 0.30 mm, more particularly 0.10 mm to 0.20 mm. In embodiments, the thin film tube <b>28</b> is made of a polyolefin, such as linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), polypropylene impact copolymer, or a flexible polyvinyl chloride (PVC), among others. As used herein, the thin film tube <b>28</b> and the cable components contained therein may be referred to as a cable core <b>34</b>. In this regard, the exterior surface <b>32</b> of the thin film tube <b>28</b> may be the outermost surface of the cable core <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">SAP powder is contained within the thin film tube <b>28</b> around the buffer tubes <b>20</b> to provide a measure of water blocking on the interior of the cable core <b>34</b>. Conventional cable designs typically use water-blocking tapes and yarns wrapped around the buffer tubes <b>20</b>. However, the thin film tube <b>28</b> of the presently disclosed optical fiber cable <b>10</b> is less expensive in terms of material cost than water-blocking tapes and yarns, and the thin film tube <b>28</b> is easier to apply by extruding around the buffer tubes and is not length limited. That is, the thin film tube <b>28</b> can be extruded continuously without stopping, whereas water blocking tapes and yarns are wound around the buffer tubes from spools that have to be changed as they run out, which creates disruptions during processing.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Provided around the cable core <b>34</b> in the embodiment depicted is an armor layer <b>36</b>. The armor layer <b>36</b> circumferentially surrounds the cable core <b>34</b> along the length of the optical fiber cable <b>10</b> so as to protect the cable core <b>34</b>, e.g., from damage by rodents. In embodiments, the armor layer <b>36</b> is formed from a metal tape that is wrapped around the cable core <b>34</b>, which may provide a region where edges of the metal tape overlap to close the armor layer <b>36</b>. In embodiments, the armor layer <b>36</b> is corrugated. Further, in embodiments, the armor layer <b>36</b> is laminated with a coating (e.g., of polyethylene or a polyethylene copolymer) to prevent rusting of the armor layer <b>36</b>. As will be discussed more fully below, SAP powder containing a relatively high amount of a flow aid is provided between the exterior surface <b>32</b> of the thin film tube <b>28</b> and the armor layer <b>36</b>. The SAP powder containing the flow aid not only provides water blocking along the exterior length of the cable core <b>34</b>, but the SAP powder containing the flow aid also inhibits or prevents bonding between the armor layer <b>36</b> and the exterior surface <b>32</b> of the thin film tube <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the embodiment depicted, the cable jacket <b>12</b> circumferentially surrounds the armor layer <b>36</b> along the length of the optical fiber cable <b>10</b>. In embodiments and as discussed below, the cable jacket <b>12</b> is extruded around the armor layer <b>36</b> such that the inner surface <b>14</b> of the cable jacket <b>12</b> contacts the exterior of the armor layer <b>36</b>. In embodiments, the optical fiber cable <b>10</b> includes an access feature shown as ripcords <b>38</b>. The ripcords <b>38</b>, which may be made from aramid yarn, can be pulled to split open the armor layer <b>36</b> to provide access to the cable core <b>34</b> to allow for mid-span access to the buffer tubes <b>20</b> or the optical fibers <b>22</b> contained therein. In other embodiments, the cable jacket <b>12</b> may be coextruded with a strip of dissimilar polymer (e.g., one or more polypropylene strips in a polyethylene jacket) to provide a fast access feature so that the cable jacket <b>12</b> can be split open with a side cutter and pulled apart by hand. Additionally, in embodiments, an access feature, such as a ripcord (not shown), may be provided within the thin film tube <b>28</b> to provide access to the interior of the thin film tube <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> provides a flow diagram for a method <b>100</b> of manufacturing an optical fiber cable, such as the optical fiber cable <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For context, in the discussion of the method <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, reference will be made to the components of the optical fiber cable <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In a first step <b>101</b> of the method <b>100</b>, buffer tubes <b>20</b> are stranded around the central strength member <b>24</b>. In a second step <b>102</b>, the thin film tube <b>28</b> is formed around the buffer tubes <b>20</b>, e.g., by extruding the thin film tube <b>28</b> around the buffer tubes <b>20</b>. As mentioned above, extruding the thin film tube <b>28</b> around the buffer tubes <b>20</b> allows for continuous operation without having to stop to change spools as has been the case when using water blocking tapes and/or yarns around the buffer tubes.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a third step <b>103</b>, SAP powder containing a flow aid is applied between the thin film tube <b>28</b> and the armor layer <b>36</b>. In embodiments, the SAP powder is a potassium acrylate acrylamide copolymer. In embodiments, the average particle size of the SAP powder ranges from 0 to 230 &#x3bc;m. Further, in embodiments, the SAP powder contains a relatively high concentration of a flow aid compared to a typical SAP powder. Conventionally, an SAP powder contains less than 1 wt % of a flow aid, in particular about 0.3 wt % to 0.5 wt % of a flow aid. However, according to the present disclosure, the SAP powder contains at least 1 wt % of a flow aid. In an embodiment, the SAP powder contains from 1 wt % to 5 wt % of the flow aid, in particular about 2 wt % (e.g., from 1.5 wt % to 2.5 wt %) of the flow aid. In embodiments, the flow aid is a silica-based flow aid. Specifically, in embodiments, the silica-based flow aid has a platelet structure designed to surround the SAP powder particles to enhance the flow characteristics. In embodiments, the silica-based flow aid comprises silica particles. In a specific embodiment, the silica particles are fumed silica particles having an average particle size 100 nm or less, in particular, from 5 nm to 50 nm. Further, in embodiments, the silica-based flow aid is hydrophobic, which provides processing advantages in that it does not tend to clog application equipment. An example of hydrophobic silica is fumed silica treated with dimethyldichlorosilane (such as AEROSIL&#xae; R972, available from Evonik Resource Efficiency GmbH, Hanau-Wolfgang, Germany).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of a powder applicator <b>200</b> usable for applying the SAP powder containing the flow aid to the cable core <b>34</b>. The powder applicator <b>200</b> includes a process line inlet <b>202</b> through which the cable core <b>34</b> and partially formed armor layer <b>36</b> run. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the armor layer <b>36</b> is partially formed to create a trough under the cable core <b>34</b>. The powder applicator <b>200</b> includes an SAP powder inlet port <b>204</b> through which the SAP powder containing the flow aid is injected into the powder applicator <b>200</b>. The SAP powder inlet port <b>204</b> allows for direct application of the SAP powder and flow aid to the cable core <b>34</b> and interior surface of the armor layer <b>36</b>. In this way, when the armor layer <b>36</b> is fully formed around the cable core <b>34</b>, the SAP powder and flow aid completely surround the circumference of the cable core <b>34</b>. The powder applicator <b>200</b> also includes a pressured gas inlet <b>206</b>. In embodiments, the pressurized gas inlet <b>206</b> disperses the SAP powder to prevent clumping and to better and more uniformly coat the cable core <b>34</b>. The pressurized gas may be, e.g., compressed air, N<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, Ar, or another substantially inert gas.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The powder applicator <b>200</b> also includes an exhaust port <b>208</b> surrounded by a Venturi region <b>210</b>. The SAP powder containing the flow aid that does not coat the cable core <b>34</b> or the armor layer <b>36</b> is circulated in the Venturi region <b>210</b> by the pressured gas, and the centrifugal force causes the SAP powder containing the flow aid to circulate back to the cable core <b>34</b> and armor layer <b>36</b> where it can be applied or recirculated by the pressurized gas. The pressurized gas exits via the exhaust port <b>208</b>. Additional description of embodiments of the powder applicator <b>200</b> may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 10,427,177, issued on Oct. 1, 2019, and owned by the common assignee to the present application. U.S. Pat. No. 10,427,177 is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference thereto.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">After the SAP powder containing the flow aid is applied to the cable core <b>34</b> and armor layer <b>36</b>, the method <b>100</b> involves a fourth step <b>104</b> of closing the armor layer <b>36</b> around the cable core <b>34</b>. Thereafter, in a fifth step <b>105</b>, the cable jacket <b>12</b> is extruded around the armor layer. In embodiments, between the fourth step <b>104</b> and the fifth step <b>105</b>, the cable core <b>34</b> having the armor layer <b>36</b> closed around it may pass through another powder applicator in which talc is applied to the outer surface of the armor layer <b>36</b> to prevent sticking between the armor layer <b>36</b> and the cable jacket <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">During extruding in the fifth step <b>105</b>, the extruded polymer of the cable jacket <b>12</b> may be at a temperature of from 180&#xb0; C. to 230&#xb0; C., and because of the high temperature, the polymer material of the cable jacket <b>12</b> transfers heat through the armor layer <b>36</b> to the thin film tube <b>28</b>. Previously, the heat could in certain circumstances cause the thin film tube <b>28</b> to partially bond to the armor layer <b>36</b>, especially between the polymer coating of a laminated armor layer <b>36</b> and the thin film tube <b>28</b>. However, according to the present disclosure, the use of an SAP containing a high concentration (1 wt % to 5 wt %) of the silica-based flow aid inhibits or prevents the partial bonding between the thin film tube <b>28</b> and the armor layer <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thus, according to the present disclosure, the optical fiber cable <b>10</b> is able to take advantage of the longer, uninterrupted processing runs associated with the use of the thin film tube <b>28</b> without also experiencing the issue of partial bonding between the coating of the armor layer <b>36</b> and the thin film tube <b>28</b>. The prevention of such partial bonding is associated with the use of the SAP powder containing the relatively high concentration of the silica-based flow aid.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">While the present disclosure has been framed in terms of preventing partial bonding between a thin film tube <b>28</b> and an armor layer <b>26</b>, the SAP powder comprising the high concentration of silica-based flow aid can be used to prevent bonding between other cable components in an optical fiber cable <b>10</b>. Such cable components may include the optical fibers <b>22</b>, the buffer tubes <b>20</b>, the thin film tube <b>28</b>, the armor layer <b>36</b>, and/or the cable jacket <b>12</b>, among other cable components known in the art as they relate to other cable constructions. For example, the SAP powder may be used to prevent bonding between the thin film tube <b>28</b> and the cable jacket <b>12</b> (i.e., without an armor layer <b>36</b> being present therebetween). Additionally, in embodiments, the SAP powder may be used to prevent bonding between the buffer tubes <b>20</b> and the thin film tube <b>28</b> or between the buffer tubes <b>20</b> and the cable jacket <b>12</b> (i.e., without a thin film tube <b>28</b> or armor layer <b>26</b> being present therebetween). Still further, in other embodiments, the SAP powder may be used to prevent bonding between the optical fibers <b>22</b> and the buffer tubes <b>20</b> during the buffer process. In general, the SAP powder may be used where it is desired to prevent bonding between two cable component surfaces in an optical fiber cable, especially between two polymeric cable components or cable components coated with a polymer and especially where heat is applied or transferred to the cable components.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Unless otherwise expressly stated, it is in no way intended that any method set forth herein be construed as requiring that its steps be performed in a specific order.
