One such problem is rapid metabolism that causes it to be cleared too rapidly from the body. While higher dosing may attain a higher plasma level of the drug, it often also causes poor patient compliance, undesirable side effects, and increased cost of treatment. A rapidly metabolized drug may also expose patients to undesirable toxic or reactive metabolites. Despite the beneficial activities of Resiquimod, there is a continuing need for new compounds to treat the diseases and conditions for which Resiquimod is found effective.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0004">This invention relates to novel derivatives of the imidazoquinolinyl compound Resiquimod (1-(4-Amino-2-(ethoxymethyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-1-yl)-2-methylpropan-2-ol),</p><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="33.02mm" wi="41.57mm" file="US20230002370A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0009" num="0000">pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, and hydrates thereof.

Thus, a preparation of resiquimod will inherently contain small amounts of deuterated isotopologues. The concentration of naturally abundant stable hydrogen and carbon isotopes, notwithstanding this variation, is small and immaterial as compared to the degree of stable isotopic substitution of compounds of this invention. See, for instance, Wada, E et al., Seikagaku, 1994, 66: 15; Gannes, L Z et al., Comp Biochem Physiol Mol Integr Physiol, 1998, 119:725.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0018">In the compounds of this invention any atom not specifically designated as a particular isotope is meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom. Unless otherwise stated, when a position is designated specifically as &#x201c;H&#x201d; or &#x201c;hydrogen&#x201d;, the position is understood to have hydrogen at its natural abundance isotopic composition. Also unless otherwise stated, when a position is designated specifically as &#x201c;D&#x201d; or &#x201c;deuterium&#x201d;, the position is understood to have deuterium at an abundance that is at least 3340 times greater than the natural abundance of deuterium, which is 0.015% (i.e., at least 50.1% incorporation of deuterium).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0019">The term &#x201c;isotopic enrichment factor&#x201d; as used herein means the ratio between the isotopic abundance and the natural abundance of a specified isotope.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0020">In various embodiments, compounds of this invention have an isotopic enrichment factor for each designated deuterium atom of at least 3500 (52.5% deuterium incorporation at each designated deuterium atom), at least 4000 (60% deuterium incorporation), at least 4500 (67.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 5000 (75% deuterium), at least 5500 (82.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 6000 (90% deuterium incorporation), at least 6333.3 (95% deuterium incorporation), at least 6466.7 (97% deuterium incorporation), at least 6600 (99% deuterium incorporation), or at least 6633.3 (99.5% deuterium incorporation).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0021">The term &#x201c;isotopologue&#x201d; refers to a species that differs from a specific compound of this invention only in the isotopic composition thereof.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0022">The term &#x201c;compound,&#x201d; when referring to a compound of this invention, refers to a collection of molecules having an identical chemical structure, except that there may be isotopic variation among the constituent atoms of the molecules. Thus, it will be clear to those of skill in the art that a compound represented by a particular chemical structure containing indicated deuterium atoms, will also contain lesser amounts of isotopologues having hydrogen atoms at one or more of the designated deuterium positions in that structure. The relative amount of such isotopologues in a compound of this invention will depend upon a number of factors including the isotopic purity of deuterated reagents used to make the compound and the efficiency of incorporation of deuterium in the various synthesis steps used to prepare the compound. However, as set forth above the relative amount of such isotopologues in toto will be less than 49.9% of the compound. In other embodiments, the relative amount of such isotopologues in toto will be less than 47.5%, less than 40%, less than 32.5%, less than 25%, less than 17.5%, less than 10%, less than 5%, less than 3%, less than 1%, or less than 0.5% of the compound.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0023">The invention also provides salts, solvates or hydrates of the compounds of the invention.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0024">A salt of a compound of this invention can be formed, for example, between a basic group of the compound, such as an amino functional group.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount which, when administered in a proper dosing regimen, is sufficient to treat (therapeutically or prophylactically) the target disorder. For example, to reduce or ameliorate the severity, duration or progression of the disorder being treated, prevent the advancement of the disorder being treated, cause the regression of the disorder being treated, or enhance or improve the prophylactic or therapeutic effect(s) of another therapy.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0113">The interrelationship of dosages for animals and humans (based on milligrams per meter squared of body surface) is described in Freireich et al., (1966) Cancer Chemother. Rep 50: 219. Body surface area may be approximately determined from height and weight of the patient. See, e.g., Scientific Tables, Geigy Pharmaceuticals, Ardsley, N.Y., 1970, 537.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0114">In one embodiment, an effective amount of a compound of this invention can range from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg/day. In more specific aspects of this embodiments, an effective amount of a compound of this invention ranges from about 1.0 mg-400 mg/day, from about 5 mg-300 mg/day, from about 10 mg-250 mg/day, from about 20 mg-200 mg/day, from about 50 mg-200 mg/day and from about 100 mg-200 mg/day. Effective dosage amounts may be administered as a single dose once a day, or as split doses administered two, three or four times a day, e.g., 50 mg once per day, or 25 mg twice per day; 100 mg once per day, or 50 mg twice per day; or 200 mg once per day, or 100 mg twice per day.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0115">Effective doses will also vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, depending on the diseases treated, the severity of the disease, the route of administration, the sex, age and general health condition of the patient, excipient usage, the possibility of co-usage with other therapeutic treatments such as use of other agents and the judgment of the treating physician. For example, guidance for selecting an effective dose can be determined by reference to the prescribing information for a compound of formula (I).</p><p id="p-0140" num="0116">For pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a second therapeutic agent, an effective amount of the second therapeutic agent is between about 20% and 100% of the dosage normally utilized in a monotherapy regime using just that agent. Preferably, an effective amount is between about 70% and 100% of the normal nontherapeutic dose. The normal nontherapeutic dosages of these second therapeutic agents are well known in the art. See, e.g., Wells et al., eds., Pharmacotherapy Handbook, 2nd Edition, Appleton and Lange, Stamford, Conn.
