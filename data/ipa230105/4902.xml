In the same type of embedding vector, the worse the predicted air quality is, the higher the greening processing priority is. For example, in a same type of the embedding vector a and the embedding vector b, if the predicted air quality of the monitoring region corresponding to the embedding vector a is worse than the air quality of the monitoring region corresponding to the embedding vector b, the greening processing priority of the region corresponding to the embedding vector a may be higher than that of the region corresponding to the embedding vector b.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, based on the region population density and traffic flow features, the greening processing priority may be determined after screening regions with the same population density and traffic flow features. Different greening processing priorities may be determined for the regions with the same traffic density and population density but different air qualities so as to give priority to the physical health of the resident and beautify the environment.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In some embodiments, when air qualities of the monitoring regions corresponding to the feature vectors of a same type are the same or satisfy a preset range, greening processing priority with a large vegetation anomaly amount in each monitoring region may be high.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">The preset range may refer to a preset difference range of the air quality scores of predicted air qualities in different regions. For example, the preset range may be that differences of air quality scores do not exceed <b>5</b> points.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">In some embodiments, if the predicted air quality corresponding to the same type of embedding vector is the same or satisfies the preset range, the greening processing priority of the region with large vegetation anomaly corresponding to the embedding vector may be higher than that of the region with small vegetation anomaly. For example, the air quality corresponding to the embedding vector a and the embedding vector b of the same type is the same, or the difference between the air quality scores is not more than 5 points, the vegetation anomaly amount of the region A corresponding to the embedding vector a accounts for 40%, and the vegetation anomaly amount of the region B corresponding to the embedding vector b accounts for 30%, then the greening processing priority of the region A may be higher than the greening processing priority of the region B.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the greening processing priority is determined by comparing the vegetation anomaly amount in regions with the same air quality. The urgency of greening processing under different conditions of air quality and vegetation anomaly amount is considered to make the determined priority more reasonable.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the greening processing priority is determined based on the air quality, considering the impact of air quality on people's life and health, which satisfies the actual needs.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">The basic concepts have been described above.
