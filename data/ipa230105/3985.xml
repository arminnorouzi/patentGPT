to a surgical microscope system and a microscope camera adapter, and more particularly to a surgical microscope system and microscope camera adapter capable of simultaneously adjusting right and left images in observation of a three-dimensional image.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In order to display/record an image observed by a microscope used for surgery (hereinafter, also simply referred to as a surgical microscope), a camera adapter for attaching an external camera is becoming widespread.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, with increasing demand for three-dimensional images observed by a surgical microscope, there has been proposed a camera adapter that optically connects two cameras and a surgical microscope in order to display/record both a right-eye image and a left-eye image.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">With a camera adapter, in order to enhance sense as a three-dimensional image, it is important to eliminate difference between a right-eye image and a left-eye image so that a sense of depth (disparity) can be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, a technique has been proposed in which a focus adjustment function is provided to each of a camera that captures a right-eye image and a camera that captures a left-eye image so that focus of each of the right-eye image and left-eye image can be adjusted (refer to Patent Document 1).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, a technique in which an intermediate lens barrel is provided with a mechanism capable of adjusting a distance between optical axes (refer to Patent Document 2), or the like has been proposed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p

and may increase surgery time.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0010">The present disclosure has been made in view of such a problem, and an object of the present disclosure is to facilitate adjustment of a

Note that, although description will be given on assumption that the microscope <b>21</b> is a surgical microscope in this specification, the technology according to the present disclosure can also be applied to a microscope for other than surgery.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0034">The microscope <b>21</b> includes an upper lens barrel <b>31</b> including eye lenses (<b>31</b>LL, <b>31</b>LR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>)) and a lower lens barrel <b>32</b> including an objective lens <b>32</b>TL (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0035">Normally, the microscope <b>21</b> is configured such that a connection part <b>31</b>D of the upper lens barrel <b>31</b> and a connection part <b>32</b>U of the lower lens barrel <b>32</b> are connected in a state where optical axes of a left-eye eyepiece <b>31</b>L and right-eye eyepiece <b>31</b>R of the upper lens barrel <b>31</b> and a corresponding left-eye transmission part <b>32</b>L and right-eye transmission part <b>32</b>R of the lower lens barrel <b>32</b> coincide with each other.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0036">Therefore, by using the microscope <b>21</b>, an observer (for example, the surgeon) can enlarge and visually recognize the operative field Zr by looking into the microscope <b>21</b> through the right-eye eyepiece <b>31</b>R and left-eye eyepiece <b>31</b>L with right and left eyes.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0037">The microscope system <b>11</b> has a configuration in which the camera adapter <b>51</b> is sandwiched and detachably connected between the upper lens barrel <b>31</b> and lower lens barrel <b>32</b> of the microscope <b>21</b>. That is, although not illustrated, when the connection part <b>31</b>D of the upper lens barrel <b>31</b> and the connection part <b>32</b>U of the lower lens barrel <b>32</b> are directly connected without the camera adapter <b>51</b> being sandwiched, the microscope <b>21</b> functions as a general microscope.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0038">With such a configuration, the camera adapter <b>51</b> optically splits and extracts a portion of light from the operative field Zr visually recognized through the right-eye eyepiece <b>31</b>R and the left-eye eyepiece <b>31</b>L, and enables cameras <b>61</b>L, <b>61</b>R (imaging devices) to capture an image of the operative field Zr.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0039">Then, the cameras <b>61</b>L, <b>61</b>R (imaging devices) capture images of the operative field Zr extracted via the camera adapter <b>51</b>, and causes the captured images to be displayed on the monitor <b>81</b> via the CCUs <b>71</b>L, <b>71</b>R.

Furthermore, if positions of the lenses <b>104</b>L<b>1</b>, <b>104</b>R<b>1</b> and lenses <b>104</b>L<b>3</b>, <b>104</b>R<b>3</b> are accurately adjusted, it is possible to maintain a state where
