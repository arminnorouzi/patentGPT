The invention further relates to the slice management system and to a network virtualization system and to a computer program comprising instructions for performing said method.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Telecommunication networks are typically deployed on physical network equipment. This network equipment may for example comprise ethernet cables, optical-fiber cables, routers and switches. Following 3GPP TS28.530 [1], the combination of this network equipment may be referred to as a &#x2018;Transport Network&#x2019; (TN). A TN management system may be used to manage the TN physical layer. The TN management system may monitor active devices in the transport network.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Next generation network architectures, such as 5G, may separate network functions from the underlying physical network equipment. For that purpose, so-called Network Virtualization (NV) techniques may be used, and in particular Network Function Virtualization (NFV) techniques which provide network functions that are instantiable in software using the hardware of one or more of the network nodes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A design target of 5G and similar next generation network architectures is to provide networks which may be &#x2018;tailored&#x2019; to the requirements of the applications which use the network. Such tailoring may be obtained by instantiation of different network slices which represent virtual networks with different feature sets, e.g., providing different network functions and/or having different network characteristics. Such network slices may be instantiated and managed by a slice management system, such as in the case of 5G network architecture, a 3GPP slice management system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Network slicing typically builds on the ability to have multiple virtual networks on top of a single TN, i.e., as &#x2018;overlay networks&#x2019;. While network slices may represent more than only virtual networks, network slices typically do depend on these virtual networks. Accordingly, it may be desired by a slice management system to be able to obtain information on virtual networks of instantiated network slices, such as utilization data indicative of at least one of: a bandwidth capacity, computing capacity and storage capacity of the one or more physical links via which traffic of the virtual networks are routed. This may, for example, enable the slice management system to verify that the virtual networks are not affected by traffic in other virtual networks (isolation) and that the virtual networks provide Quality of Service (QoS) in accordance with requirements set by the slice management system.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Disadvantageously, a TN management system may currently be unable to provide information on virtual networks of instantiated network slices to a slice management system, and even if it were able to do so, the slice management system would not be able to relate the virtual networks to instantiated network slices. As such, current slice management systems may be unable to verify that, for example, the virtual networks are not affected by traffic in other virtual networks or that the virtual networks provide QoS in accordance with requirements set by the slice management system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">REFERENCES</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">[1] 3GPP TS 28.530 V16.0.0 (2019-09), <i>Technical Specification, </i>3<i>rd Generation Partnership Project;

Effectively, the system may &#x2018;bridge the gap&#x2019; between the slice management system operating in the domain of network slices and the network management system operating in the domain of physical network equipment. To establish such an interface, the system may make use of existing functionality of a network management system by which the network management system may administer, for a respective virtual network, via which one or more physical links traffic of the virtual network is routed. This functionality by itself may be known per se.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0026">The interfacing system may further involve a third entity in establishing the interface between the network management system and the slice management system, namely a network virtualization system of the telecommunication network, so as to be able to identify which virtual networks are comprised in a respective network slice. Namely, the network virtualization system may instantiate network services based on respective network service descriptions, which may also be referred to as &#x2018;network service descriptors&#x2019;. A network service description or descriptor may be a template for the network virtualization system to instantiate a network service. The instantiation of the network service may involve instantiating one or more virtual networks, which may also be referred to as &#x2018;VirtualLinks&#x2019;. The template may be generated, e.g., by the slice management system, to instantiate a network service for a network slice. The network virtualization system may thus have knowledge on a relation between a network service description (and thereby a corresponding network slice) and the corresponding one or more virtual network (VirtualLinks) which are instantiated for this network slice.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0027">In particular, the interfacing system may obtain identification data from the network virtualization system which identifies which one or more virtual networks are comprised in a respective network slice. The interfacing system may use this identification data to communicate with the network management system on the basis of virtual network identifiers, which the network management system may understand on the basis of administering the relation between virtual networks and physical links. Here, the term &#x2018;communicate . . . on the basis of virtual network identifiers&#x2019; may comprise such identifiers being included in one or more messages exchanged between the interfacing system and the networking management system. Effectively, the identification data may enable the interfacing system to &#x2018;translate&#x2019; from the network slice domain to the virtual network domain, which may be required as the network management system may not have any knowledge on network slices.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0028">In particular, the interfacing system may use the identification data to obtain utilization data from the network management system which relates to the utilization, e.g., in terms of bandwidth, computing capacity or load, memory or persistent storage allocation, of the physical links involved in transporting the traffic of one or more particular virtual networks. The interfacing system may thereby obtain utilization data of the physical links used in/for a particular network slice. To enable the slice management system to act upon such utilization data, the interfacing system may provide the utilization data to the slice management system, for example in response to a request from the slice management system or as a &#x2018;push&#x2019;-type message.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0029">By providing the interfacing system, the slice management system may not need to concern itself with the specifics of virtual networks (or even physical links) while the network management system does not need to concern itself with network slices. Effectively, the interfacing system may provide a mapping between the slice domain managed by the slice management system and the physical layer managed by the network management system by obtaining identification information from a third entity which completes the mapping, namely from the network virtualization system.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0030">A slice management system may now obtain utilization data via the interfacing system which is relevant for instantiated network slices, such as utilization data which is indicative of at least one of: a bandwidth capacity, computing capacity and storage capacity of the physical links via which the traffic of a virtual network of a particular network slice is routed. Such information may be provided in various ways, e.g., as remaining non-allocated capacity, but also by a combination of an allocation percentage and the overall capacity in terms of bandwidth, computing and/or storage. For example, the computing capacity may be indicated as a load. The storage capacity may be a memory capacity and/or a persistent storage capacity, e.g., indicating a storage capacity to cache data such as (parts of) media streams. Such information may enable the slice management system to, for example, verify that the virtual networks are not affected by traffic in other virtual networks, and/or that the virtual networks provide QoS in accordance with requirements set by the slice management system. In a specific example, the utilization data may enable the slice management system to influence or enforce QoS in the virtual networks of network slices.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0031">In some embodiments, the interfacing system may simply pass the utilization data to the slice management system, e.g., in response to a request from the slice management system. In some embodiments, the interfacing system may internally administer a relation between network slices, virtual networks and physical links, e.g., by generating an internal mapping representing said relation. In some embodiments, the interfacing system may internally buffer recent utilization data for the physical links of the administered virtual networks and network slices, which may enable the interfacing system to provide utilization data to the slice management system directly in response to a request from the slice management system. In some embodiments, the interfacing system may be configured to generate overview information relating to the utilization by aggregating or in other ways processing the utilization data obtained from the network management system.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0032">In an embodiment, the processor subsystem may be configured to, based on the identification data, instruct the network management system to monitor the one or more physical links via which the traffic of the one or more virtual networks is routed and to periodically generate the utilization data. In accordance with this embodiment, the interfacing system may request the network management system to monitor certain physical links and to periodically generate the utilization data. This may cause the network management system to instruct routers, switches and/or other network nodes to generate such utilization data, which may then be aggregated or in other ways processed by the network management system before providing the utilization data to the interfacing system. This may be advantageous in case it is desired, for example by the slice management system, to monitor network traffic associated with a particular network slice on a periodic, or a continuous or semi-periodic, basis.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0033">In an embodiment, the processor subsystem may be configured to periodically obtain the utilization data from the network management system by at least one of:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0034">subscribing with the network management system to periodically receive the utilization data from the network management system; and</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0035">periodically sending a request to the network management system.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0024" num="0036">In accordance with this embodiment, the interfacing system may periodically request or subscribe-to-periodically-receive the utilization data from the network management system.

Namely, the slice management system may determine from the utilization data that changes are needed on the physical network level for one or more of the instantiated network slices. Accordingly, the slice management system may instruct the interfacing system to effect those changes by sending appropriate instructions to the network management system. In doing so, the interfacing system may map the instructions from the network slice domain to the virtual network domain, e.g., on the basis of previously obtained identification data and by including an identifier of a virtual network in the instructions to the network management system, and in some embodiments may even map the instructions to the physical network level. The network management system may then effect the requested changes, for example by rerouting traffic, (re)configuring QoS etc.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0042">In an embodiment, the network virtualization system may be a network function virtualization system which comprises a network function virtualization orchestrator and a virtual infrastructure manager, wherein the processor subsystem may be configured to obtain the identification data by:<ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0014" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0043">obtaining a network identifier from the network function virtualization orchestrator; and</li>        <li id="ul0014-0002" num="0044">based on the network identifier, obtaining the identification data from the virtual infrastructure manager.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0029" num="0045">In accordance with this embodiment, the network virtualization system may specifically be a network function virtualization system, such as the so-called network functions virtualization (NFV) management and network orchestration (MANO) system, e.g., as defined by FIG. 5.1 of [4]. In such an embodiment, the identification data may be obtained in two steps, namely by first obtaining a network identifier from the network function virtualization orchestrator (NFVO) and subsequently obtaining the identification data from the virtual infrastructure manager (VIM) based on the network identifier, for example by providing the network identifier to the virtual infrastructure manager.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0046">In an embodiment, the data communication interface subsystem may comprise one or more network interfaces for communicating with at least one of: the slice management system, the network management system and the network virtualization system. The data communication of the interfacing system may at least in part take place via network communication. In some embodiments, the data communication may at least in part also take place via internal data communication, for example if the interfacing system is a subsystem of the slice management system or the network management system or the network virtualization system. Accordingly, the data communication interface subsystem may comprise multiple interfaces, such as one or more network interfaces and one or more internal (e.g., software-based) interfaces.

This may enable the interfacing system to directly respond to requests, e.g., from the slice management system, for utilization data of a particular network slice. Namely, by obtaining said data, the interfacing system may internally buffer utilization data of the physical links of the virtual networks of the set or all of the network slices, which may enable the interfacing system to provide utilization data to the slice management system directly in response to a request from the slice management system. In some embodiments, the interfacing system may explicitly administer a relation between network slices, virtual networks and physical links, e.g., by generating an internal mapping representing said relation. Such a mapping may enable the interfacing system to easily retrieve utilization data for a particular network slice, in that the interfacing system may determine the virtual network(s) in the network slice and the physical links involved in routing the traffic of the virtual network(s) from the mapping.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0054">In a further aspect of the invention, the slice management system may be configured to provide an identifier of the selected network slice to the interfacing system and to receive the utilization data for the selected network slice from the interfacing system. In accordance with this embodiment, the slice management system may communicate with the interfacing system on the basis of identifiers of network slices, e.g., by including the identifiers in one or more messages. The interfacing system may understand such identifiers on the basis of the identification data obtained from the network virtualization system, in that it may be able to map such identifiers to one or more virtual networks which may be enumerated in the identification data.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0055">In an embodiment, the interfacing system may be configured for, if the traffic of a respective virtual network is transmitted via an encrypted tunnel, administering a correspondence between an identifier of the virtual network and a network port via which the traffic enters the encrypted tunnel to enable, based on the network port, identifying and monitoring the at least one of: bandwidth capacity, computing capacity and storage capacity of the one or more physical links via which the traffic of the virtual network is routed. If the traffic of a respective virtual network is encrypted, i.e., transmitted via an encrypted tunnel for at least part of the telecommunication network, it may conventionally not be possible to obtain utilization data which directly relates to the physical links which transport the encrypted traffic of a particular virtual network, as it may not be known, due to the encryption, which physical links transport which traffic. In accordance with this embodiment, the interfacing system may administer a correspondence between an identifier of the virtual network and a network port via which the traffic enters the encrypted tunnel. Since such a network port may remain visible despite the subsequent encryption of the traffic, the interfacing system may still be able to obtain the utilization data for the traffic which is transmitted via the encrypted tunnel on the basis of the network port, for example by specifying the network port instead of the identifier of the virtual network to the network management system. This may enable the interfacing system to provide utilization data for virtual networks which transmit encrypted traffic.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0056">In a further aspect of the invention, the network management system may be configured for, if the traffic of a respective virtual network is transmitted via an encrypted tunnel, administering a correspondence between an identifier of the virtual network and a network port via which the traffic enters the encrypted tunnel to enable, based on the network port, identifying and monitoring the at least one of: bandwidth capacity, computing capacity and storage capacity of the one or more physical links via which the traffic of the virtual network is routed.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0057">In addition or as an alternative to the interfacing system maintaining such a correspondence for virtual networks which encrypted traffic, the network management system may maintain such a correspondence.

The slice management system may be aware of the requirements of the applications which use the network slice, and may thus identify if the bandwidth capacity, computing capacity and/or storage capacity of one or more physical links is insufficient in respect of these requirements. Accordingly, the slice management system may generate an alarm signal if the allocated bandwidth, computational load and/or allocated persistent storage or memory of one or more physical links exceeds a threshold or if the available bandwidth, computing capacity, persistent storage or memory falls below a threshold, such as a static threshold, e.g., based on static application requirements, or a dynamic threshold, e.g., based on dynamic application requirements.

However, the concepts described in the following embodiments may equally apply, mutatis mutandis, to any other type of telecommunication network having a network management system, a slice management system and a network virtualization system as defined by the wording of the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a context of at least some of the embodiments, showing how network traffic of different network slices may be transported between network nodes. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a physical infrastructure comprised of physical network nodes <b>100</b>-<b>102</b>, such as routers or switches or similar type of physical network equipment, which may be connected via physical connections <b>110</b>-<b>112</b> such as ethernet cables, optical fiber cables, microwave links, satellite links, etc. The combination of such types of physical network equipment and their physical connections is often referred to as a transport network (TN), but may in the following embodiment also be referred to as a &#x2018;physical layer&#x2019; or simply as a &#x2018;network&#x2019; other than a virtual network. Respective parts or segments of the physical infrastructure may be referred to as &#x2018;physical links&#x2019;. A physical link may thus in general comprise one or more physical network nodes, one or more physical connections or a combination of one or more physical network nodes and one or more physical links.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0156">The transport network may support virtual networks. Such virtual networks may be based on VLAN (virtual local area network), VXLAN (virtual extensible LAN), GRE (generic routing encapsulation), MPLS (multiprotocol label switching), LISP (locator/ID separation protocol) or any other overlay network technology.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0157">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, three virtual networks are shown which may be used in respective networks slice instances (NSIs), with NSI1 being used for enhanced mobile broadband (EMBB), NSI2 being used for an internet of things (IOT) application and NSI3 being used for ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0158"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> further illustrates the current bandwidth usage <b>120</b>-<b>122</b> in relation to the total bandwidth capacity of each respective physical connection <b>110</b>-<b>112</b>. For example, it can be seen that the virtual network of NSI1 takes up 50% of the 10 Gbps bandwidth <b>120</b> of the physical connection <b>110</b>, that the respective virtual networks of NSI2 and NSI3 take up 20%+20%=40% of the 10 Gbps bandwidth <b>121</b> of the physical connection <b>111</b> and that all three virtual networks take up 50%+20%+20%=90% of the 10 Gbps bandwidth <b>122</b> of the physical connection <b>112</b>. While the bandwidth capacity of all physical connection <b>110</b>-<b>112</b> may be sufficient for the network traffic of the virtual networks of the network slice instances NSI1-NSI3, the bandwidth of at least the physical connection <b>112</b> may be easily exceeded, for example if the network traffic of only one of the network slices increases by 1 Gbps. It may therefore occur that a physical connection is at or near its maximum bandwidth capacity.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0159">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> refers to the bandwidth of physical connections, also physical network nodes such as routers and switches may have a bandwidth which may be exceeded. This also applies to the physical links formed by a combination of physical network nodes and/or physical connections, in that also this combination may have a bandwidth (e.g., as defined by the most limited bandwidth of a respective part of the link, e.g., the &#x2018;bottleneck) which may be exceeded. Similar problems may occur with computing capacity, which is typically expressed as a computational load. For example, the computational load of a physical network node, being for example a router or switch, may be limited. Since network routing may cause computational load, the capacity of a router or switch for network routing may be limited, e.g., in terms of numbers of connections. Similar problems may occur with storage. For example, a physical network node may provide persistent storage, e.g., for caching purposes, which may be limited and thus exceeded during operation. Similarly, a physical network node may have a memory of which the memory capacity may be exceeded.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0160">It is noted that the computational capacity of a physical link comprising several physical network nodes may be defined in any suitable manner, e.g., as an aggregated computing capacity or as individual capacities of the respective links or conversely as an individual or aggregated load representing the relation between available and allocated computing capacity. Similarly, the storage capacity of a physical link comprising several physical network nodes may be defined in any suitable manner, e.g., as an aggregated or as individual storage capacity of the respective links.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0161">Given such and similar situations, there may be a need for a slice management system, which may be a system capable of instantiating and subsequently managing the network slice instances NSI1-NSI3, to be able to obtain information on virtual networks of instantiated network slices, and in particular to obtain utilization data indicative of at least one of: a bandwidth capacity, computing capacity and storage capacity of one or more physical links via which traffic of the virtual networks is routed. Such information may be desired so as to enable the slice management system to, for example, verify that the virtual networks are not affected by traffic in other virtual networks, or that the virtual networks provide QoS in accordance with requirements set by the slice management system. For that purpose, an interfacing system may be provided, as described in the following.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0162"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a network management system <b>200</b>, a slice management system <b>220</b> and an interfacing system <b>240</b> which may be configured to interface between the network management system <b>200</b> and the slice management system <b>220</b>. The network management system <b>200</b> may be configured to manage physical network equipment of a network having physical links, which is in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and elsewhere represented by the NFVI <b>290</b> which may encompass the physical infrastructure and which may also include partially virtualized functions, see e.g., [<b>4</b>]. The network may support instantiation of virtual networks over the physical links, and the network management system <b>200</b> may be configured for administering, for a respective virtual network, via which one or more physical links traffic of the virtual network is routed. The network management system, which may also be considered and therefore referred to as a transport network management system, may be a known type of network management system manufactured by telecommunication equipment manufacturers such as Nokia, Ericsson etc., and is also described in 3GPP, see e.g. FIG. 4.7.1 and its corresponding description in [1].</p><p id="p-0073" num="0163">The slice management system <b>220</b> may be configured for instantiating and managing network slices which each comprise one or more of the virtual networks. For example, the slice management system may be a 3GPP slice management system, which may be comprised of one or more of the CSMF, NSMF and NSSMF, e.g., as described in FIG. 4.10.1 and its corresponding description in [2]. The slice management system <b>220</b> may interface with a network virtualization system <b>260</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0164">The network virtualization system <b>260</b> may be configured for instantiating virtual networks based on network service descriptors which represent respective network slices and for administrating which one or more virtual networks are comprised in a respective network slice. For example, the network virtualization system <b>260</b> may be NFV-MANO as for example described by FIG. 5.1 and its corresponding description in [4]. However, this is not a limitation, in that the network virtualization system may also be a different type of network virtualization system, such as a &#x2018;Openstack Heat&#x2019; (https://wiki.openstack.orq/wiki/Heat)-based system or a network virtualization system based on the Open Network Automation Platform (ONAP, https://www.onap.orq/) or in general any other appropriately configured network virtualization system.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0165">During operation, and for example based on service and/or operator requirements for the network slice (NS), the slice management system <b>220</b> may create a network service description (NSD) for the network slice (NS), which may then be used by the NFV-MANO to create virtualized network functions (VNFs) and virtual networks that will be part of the NS instance (NSI) from the point of view of the slice management system <b>220</b>. An example of an interface of a 3GPP slice management system to an NFV-MANO is described by Figure A.4.1 and its corresponding description in [3].

In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and other examples, the interfacing system <b>240</b> is shown to be part of the slice management system <b>220</b>. This is however not a limitation, in that the interfacing system <b>240</b> may also be part of the network virtualization system <b>260</b> (as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) or part of a different system or a standalone system.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0168">The interfacing system <b>240</b> may be configured to communicate with the slice management system, the network management system and the network virtualization system. In particular, the interfacing system <b>240</b> may be configured to obtain identification data from the network virtualization system <b>260</b>, wherein the identification data identifies, for at least one network slice, which one or more virtual networks are comprised in the respective network slice. The interfacing system <b>240</b> may be further configured to, based on the identification data, obtain utilization data from the network management system <b>200</b>, wherein the utilization data is indicative of at least one of: a bandwidth capacity, computing capacity and storage capacity of one or more physical links via which traffic of the one or more virtual networks is routed. The interfacing system <b>240</b> may be further configured to provide the utilization data for the at least one network slice to the slice management system <b>220</b>, which may involve making the utilization data available as internal data if the interfacing system <b>240</b> is an internal part of the slice management system <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0169">Due to its interfacing between the network management system <b>200</b> and the slice management system <b>220</b>, the interfacing system <b>240</b> may also be referred to as &#x2018;STN mapper&#x2019; (STN: Slice&#x2014;Transport Network), with the term &#x2018;mapper&#x2019; referring to the system's function of providing a mapping of information from the physical network equipment domain to the network slice domain. In general, the interfacing system <b>240</b> may, based on the data obtained from the network management system <b>200</b> and the network virtualization system <b>260</b>, keep track of the virtual networks instantiated on top of the network, e.g., by appropriate data administration. The interfacing system <b>240</b> may administer for each virtual network which physical nodes are used and which NSI is supported. The interfacing system <b>240</b> may maintain an overview of the data usage per physical link of an NSI. Furthermore, through the interfacing system <b>240</b>, the slice management system <b>220</b> may instruct the network management system <b>200</b> to reroute traffic of virtual networks, change certain QoS parameters for traffic flows in the virtual network and/or to limit the bandwidth available for individual virtual networks.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0170">For that purpose, the interfacing system <b>240</b> may obtain and exchange various data with the network virtualization system <b>260</b>, including but not limited to data comprising information on which network slices are using which virtual networks. This information may for example be obtained in the form of a network service descriptor (NSD) which may for example indicate that virtual networks A to C are used in NSI1. In case of an NFV-MANO as network virtualization system, the so-called Os-Nfvo interface may be used to obtain such information. The interfacing system <b>240</b> may further obtain information on which virtual network uses which virtual network (overlay) identifier.

Here, the term &#x2018;part of&#x2019; is to be understood as including that the functionality of the interfacing system is integrated with the functionality of the NFV-MANO <b>260</b>. A challenge may be that the NFV-MANO <b>260</b> may not have knowledge on network slices but rather on network services. The functionality of the interfacing system may thus be somewhat different, in that a network slice may be directly mapped to a network service in the NFV-MANO <b>260</b>.

It is noted that certain parts of the transport network (TN) can be encrypted. This may be required if parts of the TN go over untrusted infrastructure. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, which shows a transport network comprising at least an edge router <b>300</b>, a further non-edge router <b>310</b>, a security gateway <b>320</b> and a core network <b>330</b>. While the data communication in the core network <b>330</b> and between the core network <b>330</b> and the security gateway <b>320</b> may remain unencrypted <b>360</b>, the data communication from the security gateway <b>320</b> onwards to the routers <b>310</b>, <b>300</b> may be encrypted <b>350</b>. Accordingly, the traffic of network slices, which may in the specific example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> be routed via virtual networks in the form of VXLANs which may be mapped to UDP ports <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, may now transmitted in an encrypted manner, e.g., via IP security (IPSec).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0212">Such encryption of traffic may for example be used by mobile network operators for traffic which is transmitted outside of the core network <b>330</b> or a data center. This may provide an extra layer of security. However, this extra layer of security may create an extra layer of complexity for network monitoring. In particular, if the encryption takes place on layer <b>3</b> of the transport network, then the content of the encrypted traffic may not be distinguished anymore. This means that virtual networks may in principle not be monitored anymore in the transport network. To address this, the interfacing system and/or the network management system as described in this specification may be configured for, if the traffic of a respective virtual network is transmitted via an encrypted tunnel, administering a correspondence between an identifier of the virtual network and a network port via which the traffic enters the encrypted tunnel to enable, based on the network port, identifying and monitoring the at least one of: bandwidth capacity, computing capacity and storage capacity of the one or more physical links via which the traffic of the virtual network is routed. This may be further explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0213"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> shows an open systems interconnection (OSI) stack in which encryption is performed on the transport network level, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> shows an open systems interconnection (OSI) stack in which encryption is performed within each virtual extensible local area network (VXLAN). More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, in a default scenario, encryption may take place directly after the first IP header. This method may prevent VXLAN monitoring in the encrypted part of the network. A straightforward solution for this could be to apply encryption on a later layer after the VXLAN tunneling, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>. This way, traffic may still be distinguished in the transport network. However, this approach also has a drawback in that each virtual tunnel end point (VTEP) may need to encrypt its traffic before having the traffic enter a VXLAN tunnel. This approach may not be desired because of performance requirements and because traffic in the core network may not need to be encrypted.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0214"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref> shows an open systems interconnection (OSI) stack in which an additional user datagram protocol (UDP) layer is added. This additional UDP layer may be used to map each VXLAN port to a different UDP source port. Accordingly, the security gateway may still perform the encryption and the traffic in the core network may remain unencrypted. It may only be needed to maintain a list of which VXLAN is mapped to which UDP port. This may be done by the security gateway and the network management system, or by the security gateway and the interfacing system. The messages or steps <b>1</b>-<b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be maintained, except that step <b>2</b> may be extended with an instruction to the network management system to map VXLAN tunnel identifiers to an UDP port at points where traffic transitions from a non-encrypted to an encrypted environment and with an instruction to monitor these UDP ports in the encrypted environment instead of VXLANs. In general, this approach may also be applied to other types of virtual networks and to other (e.g., non-UDP) types of network ports or to a security parameter index (SPI). Accordingly, to account for encrypted traffic, the network management system or the interfacing system may administer a correspondence between network overlay identifiers and (UDP) port or SPI.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0215">Another embodiment of the interfacing system may relate to the following. The network management system may in many cases be a traditional network management system for routers and switches. However, the transport network may also be implemented on the basis of the software defined network (SDN) paradigm where a central controller has an overview of the network. This controller may manage, monitor and instruct switches and routers in the transport network. In such an embodiment, the SDN controller may be seen as the network management system since the SDN controller may also instruct the routers and switches to monitor certain traffic flows and periodically report back to the SDN controller. The SDN controller may then send the aggregated data as utilization data back to the interfacing system, which in turn may provide the utilization data to the slice management system. In other words, the network management system as described elsewhere may be an SDN controller.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0216">Another embodiment of the interfacing system may relate to the following.
