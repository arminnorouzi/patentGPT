For example, the density of a component (e.g., a count of the component per unit volume) may be determined by counting the component within a microscopic image. Similarly, the concentration and/or density of a component may be measured by performing optical absorption, transmittance, fluorescence, and/or luminescence measurements upon the sample. Typically, the sample is placed into a sample carrier and the measurements are performed with respect to a portion of the sample that is contained within a sample chamber of the sample carrier. The measurements that are performed upon the portion of the sample that is contained within the sample chamber of the sample carrier are analyzed in order to determine a property of die sample.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with some applications of the present invention, a portion of a blood sample that comprises a cell suspension is placed within a sample chamber that is a cavity that includes a base surface. Typically, the cells in the cell suspension are allowed to settle on the base surface of tire sample chamber to form a monolayer of cells on the base surface of the sample chamber. Subsequent to the cells having been left to settle on the base surface of the sample chamber (e.g., by having been left to settle for a predefined time interval), at least one microscopic image of at least a portion of the monolayer of cells is typically acquired. Typically, a plurality of images of the monolayer are acquired, each of the images corresponding to an imaging field that is located at a respective, different area within the imaging plane of the monolayer. Typically, an optimum depth level at which to focus the microscope in order to image the monolayer is determined, e.g., using techniques as described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,176,565 to Greenfield, which is incorporated herein by reference. For some applications, respective imaging fields have different optimum depth levels from each other. For some applications, platelets that have settled within the monolayer are identified within the at least one microscopic image of at least a portion of the monolayer of cells.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The inventors of the present application have noticed that it is often the case that, even after having been left to settle such as to form a monolayer using the techniques described herein, not all of the platelets within a blood sample settle within the monolayer, and some cells continue to be suspended within the cell solution. More specifically, the inventors have found that it is typically the case that, even after the sample has been left to settle for approximately two minutes, between 10 percent and 70 percent of the platelets within the sample do not settle within the monolayer focus field. Typically, if the monolayer is allowed to form over a longer time period, then more platelets settle within the monolayer focus field. However, the inventors have found that even if the monolayer is allowed to form over a relatively long time period (e.g., between 15 and 30 minutes), some platelets still remain suspended within the solution such that the platelets ate not disposed within the monolayer focus field. Typically, the number of platelets that remain suspended within the solution (such that the platelets are not disposed within the monolayer focus field) is dependent on the time for which the monolayer is allowed to form, in addition to the height of the cavity in which the cell solution is placed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, for some applications, in order to accurately estimate the number of platelets in the sample, platelets that arc suspended within the cell solution arc identified, in addition to identifying platelets within the monolayer focus field. Typically, such platelets are identified by focusing the microscope at additional depth levels to tire depth level(s) to which the microscope is focused in order to image the monolayer of cells (referred to herein as &#x201c;the monolayer depth level(s)&#x201d;), and acquiring images at the additional depth levels. Typically, the platelets within the images that are acquired at the additional depth levels are identified and counted, and, based upon the count of platelets within those images, a total count of the platelets that are suspended within the cell solution is estimated.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For some applications, a count of the platelets that have settled within the monolayer is compared to a count of the platelets that have not settled within the monolayer. Typically, an output is generated in response to the comparison. For some applications, a clinical condition is derived and outputted to a user, based upon the comparison of the count of the platelets that have settled within the monolayer and the count of the platelets that have not settled within the monolayer. For example, the extent of platelet activation within the sample may be derived, at least partially based upon the comparison. Alternatively or additionally, a clinical condition may be derived based upon the size, shape, settling time, and/or settling dynamics of the platelets. For some such applications, the settling dynamics of the platelets are determined by imaging the same imaging field a plurality of times, with a lime interval between each of the image acquisitions, and/or by determining until what height within the sample chamber platelets are present at a given time.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For some applications, a computer processor generates an output indicating that the sample should be prepared in a different way to how it was prepared (e.g., by modifying the diluent within which the sample is diluted, by adding a platelet activation agent, and/or by adding a coagulation agent), based upon the comparison.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For some applications, based upon the comparison between the count of the platelets that have settled within the monolayer and the count of the platelets that have not settled within the monolayer, the portion of the blood sample is invalidated from being used for performing at least some measurements upon the sample. For example, if the ratio of unsettled platelets to settled platelets is greater than a first given threshold, and/or lower than a second given threshold, then this might be interpreted as being indicative of a problem with the sample and/or the preparation thereof.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For some applications, a parameter of the sample (such as platelet volume, mean platelet volume, and/or median platelet volume) is determined based upon a measurement that is performed upon the portion of the sample. For some applications, the measurement is calibrated, based upon the comparison between properties of the platelets that have settled within the monolayer and properties of the platelets that have not settled within the monolayer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">There is therefore provided, in accordance with some applications of the present invention, a method including:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">placing at least a portion of a blood sample that is a cell suspension within a sample chamber that is a cavity that includes a base surface:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0013">allowing the cells in the cell suspension to settle on the base surface of the sample chamber to form a monolayer of cells on the base surface of the sample chamber;</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0014" num="0014">acquiring at least one first microscopic image of at least a portion of the monolayer of cells, using a microscope while the microscope is focused at a monolayer-depth-level, at which the monolayer is within focus of the microscope;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0015">identifying platelets that have settled within the monolayer, within the at least one microscopic image;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0016">based upon the platelets that ate identified within the at least one microscopic image, determining a first platelet count of platelets that have settled within the monolayer;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0017">acquiring at least one additional microscopic image of the portion of tire sample using the microscope, while the microscope is focused at a different depth level from the monolayer-depth-level;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0018">identifying platelets that have not settled within the monolayer, within the at least one additional microscopic image;<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0019">based upon the platelets that ate identified within the at least one additional microscopic image, determining a second platelet count of platelets that have not settled within the monolayer;

Typically, a biological sample (e.g., a blood sample) is placed into a sample carrier <b>22</b>. While die sample is disposed in the sample carrier, optical measurements are performed upon the sample using one or more optical measurement devices <b>24</b>. For example, the optical measurement devices may include a microscope (e.g., a digital microscope), a spectrophotometer, a photometer, a spectrometer, a camera, a spectral camera, a hyperspectral camera, a fluorometer, a spectrofluorometer, and/or a photodetector (such as a photodiode, a photoresistor, and/or a phototransistor). For some applications, the optical measurement devices include dedicated light sources (such as light emitting diodes, incandescent light sources, etc.) and/or optical elements for manipulating light collection and/or light emission (such as lenses, diffusers, filters, etc.).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0095">A computer processor <b>28</b> typically receives and processes optical measurements that are performed by the optical measurement device. Further typically, the computer processor controls the acquisition of optical measurements that are performed by the one or more optical measurement devices. The computer processor communicates with a memory <b>30</b>. A user (e.g., a laboratory technician, or an individual from whom the sample was drawn) sends instructions to the computer processor via a user interface <b>32</b>. For some applications, the user interface includes a keyboard, a mouse, a joystick, a touchscreen device (such as a smartphone or a tablet computer), a touchpad, a trackball, a voice-command interface, and/or other types of user interfaces that arc known in the art. Typically, the computer processor generates an output via an output device <b>34</b>. Further typically, the output device includes a display, such as a monitor, and the output includes an output that is displayed on the display. For some applications, the processor generates an output on a different type of visual, text, graphics, tactile, audio, and/or video output device, e.g., speakers, headphones, a smartphone, or a tablet computer. For some applications, user interface <b>32</b> acts as both an input interface and an output interface, i.e., it acts as an input/output interface. For some applications, the processor generates an output on a computer-readable medium (e.g., a non-transitory computer-readable medium), such as a disk, or a portable USB drive, and/or generates an output on a printer.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0096">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C</figref>, which are schematic illustrations of an optical measurement unit <b>31</b>, in accordance with some applications of tire present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows an oblique view of the exterior of the fully assembled device, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref> shows respective oblique views of the device with the cover having been made transparent, such components within the device are visible. For some applications, one or more optical measurement devices <b>24</b> (and/or computer processor <b>28</b> and memory <b>30</b>) is housed inside optical measurement unit <b>31</b>. In order to perform the optical measurements upon the sample, sample carrier <b>22</b> is placed inside the optical measurement unit. For example, the optical measurement unit may define a slot <b>36</b>, via which the sample earner is inserted into the optical measurement unit. Typically, the optical measurement unit includes a stage <b>64</b>, which is configured to support sample carrier <b>22</b> within the optical measurement unit. For some applications, a screen <b>63</b> on the cover of the optical measurement unit (e.g., a screen on the front cover of the optical measurement unit, as shown) functions as user interface <b>32</b> and/or output device <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0097">Typically, the optical measurement unit includes microscope system <b>37</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B-C</figref>) configured to perform microscopic imaging of a portion of the sample. For some applications, the microscope system includes a set of light sources <b>65</b> (which typically include a set of brightfield light sources (e.g. light emitting diodes) that are configured to be used for brightfield imaging of the sample, a set of fluorescent light sources (e.g. light emitting diodes) that are configured to he used for fluorescent imaging of the sample), and a camera (e.g., a CCD camera, or a CMOS camera) configured to image the sample. Typically, the optical measurement unit also includes an optical-density-measurement unit <b>39</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) configured to perform optical density measurements (e.g., optical absorption measurements) on a second portion of the sample. For some applications, the optical-density-measurement unit includes a set of optical-density-measurement light sources (e.g., light emitting diodes) and light detectors, which are configured for performing optical density measurements on the sample. For some applications, each of the aforementioned sets of light sources (i.e., the set of brightfield light sources, the set of fluorescent light sources, and the set optical-density-measurement light sources) includes a plurality of light sources (e.g. a plurality of light emitting diodes), each of which is configured to emit light at a respective wavelength or at a respective hand of wavelengths.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0098">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, which are schematic illustrations of respective views of sample carrier <b>22</b>, in accordance with some applications of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows a top view of the sample carrier (the top cover of the sample carrier being shown as being opaque in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, for illustrative purposes), and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows a bottom view (in which the sample carrier has been rotated around its short edge with respect to the view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). Typically, the sample carrier includes a first set <b>52</b> of one or more sample chambers, which are used for performing microscopic analysis upon the sample, and a second set <b>54</b> of sample chambers, which arc used for performing optical density measurements upon the sample. Typically, the sample chambers of the sample carrier are filled with a bodily sample, such as blood via sample inlet holes <b>38</b>. For some applications, the sample chambers define one or more outlet holes <b>40</b>. The outlet holes are configured to facilitate filling of the sample chambers with the bodily sample, by allowing air that is present in the sample chambers to be released from the sample chambers. Typically, as shown, the outlet holes are located longitudinally opposite the inlet holes (with respect to a sample chamber of the sample carrier). For some applications, the outlet holes thus provide a more efficient mechanism of air escape than if the outlet holes were to be disposed closer to the inlet holes.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0099">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, which shows an exploded view of sample carrier <b>22</b>, in accordance with some applications of the present invention. For some applications, the sample carrier includes at least three components; a molded component <b>42</b>, a glass layer <b>44</b> (e.g., a glass sheet), and an adhesive layer <b>46</b> configured to adhere the glass layer to an underside of the molded component. The molded component is typically made of a polymer (e.g., a plastic) that is molded (e.g., via injection molding) to provide the sample chambers with a desired geometrical shape. For example, as shown, the molded component is typically molded to define inlet holes <b>38</b>, outlet holes <b>40</b>, and gutters <b>48</b> which surround the central portion of each of the sample chambers. The gutters typically facilitate filling of the sample chambers with the bodily sample, by allowing, air to flow to the outlet holes, and/or by allowing the bodily sample to flow around the central portion of the sample chamber.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0100">For some applications, a sample carrier as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-C</figref> is used when performing a complete blood count on a blood sample. For some such applications, the sample carrier is used with optical measurement unit <b>31</b> configured as generally shown and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-C</figref>. For some applications, a first portion of the blood sample is placed inside first set <b>52</b> of sample chambers (which are used for performing microscopic analysis upon the sample, e.g., using microscope system <b>37</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B-C</figref>)), and a second portion of the blood sample is placed inside second set <b>54</b> of sample chambers (which are used for performing optical density measurements upon the sample, e.g., using optical-density-measurement unit <b>39</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>)). For some applications, first set <b>52</b> of sample chambers includes a plurality of sample chambers, while second set <b>54</b> of sample chambers includes only a single sample chamber, as shown. However, the scope of the present application, includes using any number of sample chambers (e.g., a single sample chamber or a plurality of sample chambers) within either the first set of sample chambers or within the second set of sample chambers, or any combination thereof. The first portion of the blood sample is typically diluted with respect to the second portion of the blood sample. For example, the diluent may contain pH buffers, stains, fluorescent stains, antibodies, sphering agents, lysing agents, etc. Typically, the second portion of the blood sample, which is placed inside second set <b>54</b> of sample chambers is a natural, undiluted blood sample. Alternatively or additionally, the second portion of the blood sample may be a sample that underwent some modification, including, for example, one or more of dilution (e.g., dilution in a controlled fashion), addition of a component or reagent, or fractionation.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0101">For some applications, one or more staining substances are used to stain the first portion of the blood sample (which is placed inside first set <b>52</b> of sample chambers) before the sample is imaged microscopically. For example, the staining substance may he configured to stain DNA with preference over staining of other cellular components. Alternatively, the staining substance may be configured to stain all cellular nucleic acids with preference over staining of other cellular components. For example, the sample may be stained with acridine orange reagent. Hoechst reagent, and/or any other staining substance that is configured to preferentially stain DNA and/or RNA within the blood sample. Optionally, the staining substance is configured to stain all cellular nucleic acids but the staining of DNA and RNA are each more prominently visible under some lighting and filter conditions, as is known, for example, for acridine orange. Images of the sample may be acquired using imaging conditions that allow detection of cells (e.g., brightfield) and/or imaging conditions that allow visualization of stained bodies (e.g. appropriate fluorescent illumination). Typically, the first portion of the sample is stained with acridine orange and with a Hoechst reagent. For example, the first (diluted) portion of the blood sample may be prepared using techniques as described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,329,129 to Pollak, which is incorporated herein by reference, and which describes a method for preparation of blood samples for analysis that involves a dilution step, the dilution step facilitating the identification and/or counting of components within microscopic images of the sample. For some applications, the first portion of the sample is stained with one or more stains that cause platelets within the sample to be visible under brightfield imaging conditions and/or under fluorescent imaging conditions, e.g., as described hereinabove. For example, the first portion of the sample may be stained with methylene blue and/or Romanowsky stains.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0102">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B-C</figref>, typically, sample carrier <b>22</b> is supported within the optical measurement unit by stage <b>64</b>. Further typically, the stage has a forked design, such that the sample carrier is supported by the stage around the edges of the sample carrier, but such that the stage does not interfere with the visibility of the sample chambers of the sample carrier by the optical measurement devices. For some applications, the sample carrier is held within the stage, such that molded component <b>42</b> of the sample carrier is disposed above the glass layer <b>44</b>, and such that an objective lens <b>66</b> of a microscope unit of the optical measurement unit is disposed below the glass layer of the sample carrier. Typically, at least some light sources <b>65</b> that are used during microscopic measurements that are performed upon the sample (for example, light sources that are used during brightfield imaging) illuminate the sample carrier from above the molded component. Further typically, at least some additional light sources (not shown) illuminate the sample carrier from below the sample carrier (e.g., via the objective lens). For example, light sources that are used to excite the sample during fluorescent microscopy may illuminate the sample carrier from below the sample carrier (e.g., via the objective lens).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0103">Typically, prior to being imaged microscopically, the first portion of blood (which is placed in first set <b>52</b> of sample chambers) is allowed to settle such as to form a monolayer of cells, e.g., using techniques as described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,329,129 to Pollack, which is incorporated herein by reference. It is noted that, in the context of the present application, the term monolayer is used to mean a layer of cells that have settled, such as to be disposed within a single focus field of the microscope. Within the monolayer there may be some overlap of cells, such that within certain areas there are two or more overlapping layers of cells. For example, red blood cells may overlap with each other within the monolayer, and/or platelets may overlap with, or be disposed above, red blood cells within the monolayer.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0104">For some applications, die microscopic analysis of the first portion of the blood sample is performed with respect to the monolayer of cells. Typically, the first portion of the blood sample is imaged under brightfield imaging, i.e., under illumination from one or more light sources (e.g., one or more light emitting diodes, which typically emit light at respective spectral bands). Further typically, the first portion of the blood sample is additionally imaged under fluorescent imaging. Typically, the fluorescent imaging is performed by exciting stained objects (i.e., objects that have absorbed the stain(s)) within the sample by directing light toward the sample at known excitation wavelengths (i.e., wavelengths at which it is known that stained objects emit fluorescent light if excited with light at those wavelengths), and detecting the fluorescent light. Typically, for the fluorescent imaging, a separate set of light sources (e.g., one or more light emitting diodes) is used to illuminate the sample at the known excitation wavelengths.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0105">As described with reference to US 2019/0302099 to Pollak, which is incorporated herein by reference, for some applications, sample chambers belonging to set <b>52</b> (which is used for microscopy measurements) have different heights from each other, in order to facilitate different measurands being measured using microscope images of respective sample chambers, and/or different sample chambers being used for microscopic analysis of respective sample types. For example, if a blood sample, and/or a monolayer formed by the sample, has a relatively low density of red blood cells, then measurements may be performed within a sample chamber of the sample carrier having a greater height (i.e., a sample chamber of the sample carrier having a greater height relative to a different sample chamber having a relatively lower height), such that there is a sufficient density of cells, and/or such that there is a sufficient density of cells within the monolayer formed by the sample, to provide statistically reliable data. Such measurements may include, for example red blood cell density measurements, measurements of other cellular attributes, (such as counts of abnormal red blood cells, red blood cells that include intracellular bodies (e.g., pathogens, Howell-Jolly bodies), etc.), and/or hemoglobin concentration. Conversely, if a blood sample, and/or a monolayer formed by the sample, has a relatively high density of red blood cells, then such measurements may be performed upon a sample chamber of the sample carrier having a relatively low height, for example, such that there is a sufficient sparsity of cells, and/or such that there is a sufficient sparsity of cells within the monolayer of cells formed by the sample, that the cells can be identified within microscopic images. For some applications, such methods are performed even without the variation in height between the sample chambers belonging to set <b>52</b> being precisely known.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0106">For some applications, based upon the measurand that is being measured, the sample chamber within the sample carrier upon which to perform optical measurements is selected. For example, a sample chamber of the sample carrier having a greater height may be used to perform a white blood cell count (e.g., to reduce statistical errors which may result from a low count in a shallower region), white blood cell differentiation, and/or to detect more rare forms of white blood cells. Conversely, in order to determine mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), red blood cell morphologic features, and/or red blood cell abnormalities, microscopic images may be obtained from a sample chamber of the sample carrier having a relatively low height, since in such sample chambers the cells are relatively sparsely distributed across the area of the region, and/or form a monolayer in which the cells are relatively sparsely distributed. Similarly, in order to count platelets, classify platelets, and/or extract any other attributes (such as volume) of platelets, microscopic images may be obtained from a sample chamber of the sample carrier having a relatively low height, since within such sample chambers there are fewer red blood cells which overlap (fully or partially) with the platelets in microscopic images, and/or in a monolayer.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0107">In accordance with the above-described examples, it is preferable to use a sample chamber of the sample carrier having a lower height for performing optical measurements for measuring some measurands within a sample (such as a blood sample), whereas it is preferable to use a sample chamber of the sample carrier having a greater height for performing optical measurements for measuring other measurands within such a sample. Therefore, for some applications, a first measurand within a sample is measured, by performing a first optical measurement upon (e.g., by acquiring microscopic images of) a portion of the sample that is disposed within a first sample chamber belonging to set <b>52</b> of the sample carrier, and a second measurand of the same sample is measured, by performing a second optical measurement upon (e.g., by acquiring microscopic images of) a portion of the sample that is disposed within a second sample chamber of set <b>52</b> of the sample carrier. For some applications, the first and second measurands are normalized with respect to each other, for example, using techniques as described in US 2019/0145963 to Zait, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0108">Typically, in order to perform optical density measurements upon the sample, it is desirable to know the optical path length, the volume, and/or the thickness of the portion of the sample upon which the optical measurements were performed, as precisely as possible. Typically, an optical density measurement is performed on the second portion of the sample (which is typically placed into second set <b>54</b> of sample chambers in an undiluted form). For example, the concentration and/or density of a component may be measured by performing optical absorption, transmittance, fluorescence, and/or luminescence measurements upon the sample.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0109">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, for some applications, sample chambers belonging to set <b>54</b> (which is used for optical density measurements), define at least a first region <b>56</b> (which is typically deeper) and a second region <b>58</b> (which is typically shallower), the height of the sample chambers varying between the first and second regions in a predefined manner, e.g., as described in US 2019/0302099 to Pollak, which is incorporated herein by reference. The heights of first region <b>56</b> and second region <b>58</b> of the sample chamber are defined by a lower surface that is defined by the glass sheet and by an upper surface that is defined by the molded component. The upper surface at the second region is stepped with respect to the upper surface at the first region. The step between the upper surface at the first and second regions, provides a predefined height difference &#x394;h between the regions, such that even if the absolute height of the regions is not known to a sufficient degree of accuracy (for example, due to tolerances in the manufacturing process), the height difference &#x394;h is known to a sufficient degree of accuracy to determine a parameter of the sample, using the techniques described herein, and as described in US 2019/0302099 to Pollak, which is incorporated herein by reference. For some applications, the height of the sample chamber varies from the first region <b>56</b> to the second region <b>58</b>, and the height then varies again from the second region to a third region <b>59</b>, such that, along the sample chamber, first region <b>56</b> defines a maximum height region, second region <b>58</b> defines a medium height region, and third region <b>59</b> defines a minimum height region. For some applications, additional variations in height occur along the length of the sample chamber, and/or the height varies gradually along the length of the sample chamber.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0110">As described hereinabove, while the sample is disposed in the sample carrier, optical measurements are performed upon the sample using one or more optical measurement devices <b>24</b>. Typically, the sample is viewed by the optical measurement devices via the glass layer, glass being transparent at least to wavelengths that are typically used by the optical measurement device. Typically, the sample carrier is inserted into optical measurement unit <b>31</b>, which houses the optical measurement device while the optical measurements are performed. Typically, the optical measurement unit houses the sample carrier such that the molded layer is disposed above the glass layer, and such that the optical measurement unit is disposed below the glass layer of the sample carrier and is able to perform optical measurements upon the sample via the glass layer. The sample carrier is formed by adhering the glass layer to the molded component. For example, the glass layer and the molded component may be bonded to each other during manufacture or assembly (e.g. using thermal bonding, solvent-assisted bonding, ultrasonic welding, laser welding, beat staking, adhesive, mechanical clamping and/or additional substrates). For some applications, the glass layer and the molded component are bonded to each other during manufacture or assembly using adhesive layer <b>46</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0111">In accordance with some applications of the present invention, a portion of a blood sample that comprises a cell suspension is placed within a sample chamber that is a cavity <b>55</b> that includes a base surface <b>57</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>). In accordance with respective applications, the cavity is a closed (i.e., covered) cavity, or is an open (i.e., uncovered) cavity. For example, as described hereinabove, the first portion of the blood sample is typically placed in first set <b>52</b> of the sample chambers. For some applications, the first portion of the blood sample is placed in first set <b>52</b> of the sample chambers, subsequent to the first portion of the blood sample having been diluted. Typically, the cells in the cell suspension are allowed to settle on the base surface of the sample chamber to form a monolayer of cells on the base surface of the sample chamber. As noted hereinabove, in the context of the present application, the term monolayer is used to mean a layer of cells that have settled, such as to be disposed within a single focus field of the microscope (referred to herein as &#x201c;the monolayer focus field&#x201d;). Within the monolayer there may be some overlap of cells, such that within certain areas there are two or more overlapping layers of cells. For example, red blood cells may overlap with each other within the monolayer, and/or platelets may overlap with, or be disposed above, red blood cells within the monolayer.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0112">Subsequent to the cells having been left to settle on the base surface of the sample chamber (e.g. by having been left to settle for a predefined time interval), at least one microscopic image of at least a portion of the monolayer of cells is typically acquired. Typically, a plurality of images of the monolayer are acquired, each of the images corresponding to an imaging field that is located at a respective, different area within the imaging plane of the monolayer. Typically, an optimum depth level at which to focus the microscope in order to image the monolayer is determined, e.g., using techniques as described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,176,565 to Greenfield, which is incorporated herein by reference. For some applications, respective imaging fields have different optimum depth levels from each other. For some applications, platelets that have settled within the monolayer are identified within the at least one microscopic image of at least a portion of the monolayer of cells.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0113">The inventors of the present application have noticed that it is often the case that, even after having been left to settle such as to form a monolayer using the techniques described herein, not all of the platelets within a blood sample settle within the monolayer, and some cells continue to be suspended within the cell solution. More specifically, the inventors have found that it is typically the case that, even after the sample has been left to settle for approximately two minutes, between 10 percent and 70 percent of the platelets within the sample do not settle within the monolayer focus field. Typically, if the monolayer is allowed to form over a longer time period, then more platelets settle within the monolayer focus field. However, the inventors have found that even if the monolayer is allowed to form over a relatively long time period (e.g., between 15 and 30 minutes), some platelets still remain suspended within the solution such that the platelets are not disposed within the monolayer focus field. Typically, the number of platelets that remain suspended within the solution (such that the platelets are not disposed within the monolayer focus field) is dependent on the time for which the monolayer is allowed to form, in addition to the height of the cavity in which the cell solution is placed.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0114">Therefore, for some applications, in order to accurately estimate the number of platelets in the sample, platelets that are suspended within the cell solution are identified, in addition to identifying platelets within the monolayer focus field. Typically, such platelets are identified by focusing the microscope at additional depth levels to the depth level(s) to which the microscope is focused in order to image the monolayer of cells (referred to herein as &#x201c;the monolayer depth level(s)&#x201d;), and acquiring images at the additional depth levels. Typically, the platelets within the images that are acquired at the additional depth levels are identified and counted, and, based upon the count of platelets within those images, a total count of the platelets that are suspended within the cell solution is estimated.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0115">As described hereinabove, typically, the platelets that are suspended within the cell solution are identified by acquiring microscopic images at additional depth levels. Typically, the height interval between successive additional depth levels at which the cell solution is imaged is dependent upon the depth of focus of the microscope optical system. For example, depending upon the depth of focus of the microscope optical system, the microscope may be focused at additional depth levels that are separated from each other by a given height difference (e.g., between 1 micron and 10 microns), over the height of the portion of the sample that is within the sample chamber. Typically, within the monolayer depth level(s), microscopic images of the sample chamber are acquired from a relatively large number of imaging fields, as described hereinabove. For example, microscopic images of tire monolayer may be acquired from between 100 and 500 imaging fields. Typically, between 5 and 100 (e.g., between 10 and 50) of these imaging fields are optimized for identifying platelets, by acquiring these images at an increased exposure time relative to other images. For some applications, for each of the additional depth levels, microscopic images are acquired from only a subset of the imaging fields, in order to reduce the amount of time that it takes to image the portion of the sample relative to if microscopic images are acquired from all of the imaging fields. For example, microscopic images from between 3 and 10 imaging fields may be acquired within each of the additional depth levels. For some applications, the ratio of (a) the number of imaging fields at which the monolayer is imaged and that are optimized for identifying platelets (e.g., by having an increased exposure time, as described above) to (b) the number of imaging fields at which each of the additional depth levels is imaged, is between 2:1 and 10:1. For some applications, the ratio is 1:1.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0116">For some applications, the portion of the sample is imaged at the additional depth levels under brightfield imaging, e.g., as described hereinabove. Alternatively or additionally, the portion of the sample is imaged at the additional depth levels under fluorescent imaging, e.g., as described hereinabove. For some applications, the first portion of the sample is stained with one or more stains that cause platelets within the sample to be visible under bright field imaging conditions and/or under fluorescent imaging conditions, e.g., as described hereinabove. For example, the first portion of the sample may be stained with methylene blue and/or Romanowsky stains. For some applications, images having imaging parameters that are not necessarily optimized for platelet detection are acquired at the additional depth levels, for example, in order to detect other entities, which may otherwise be confused with platelets.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0117">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, which are microscope images acquired from the monolayer depth level under brightfield imaging using respective imaging parameters, in accordance with some applications of the present invention.

Again, a platelet <b>60</b> is identifiable within the images.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0119">Typically, platelets that have not settled within the monolayer are identified within the images that are acquired at the additional depth levels. (It is noted the identified platelets may include platelets that are out of focus within the additional depth levels.) Further typically, based upon the platelets that are identified within the images that are acquired at the additional depth levels, a count of the platelets that have not settled within the monolayer is estimated. For some applications, in order to perform the above-described estimate, the computer processor is configured to avoid duplicate counts of platelets within images that are acquired at adjacent depth levels, by identifying platelets within images that are acquired at adjacent depth levels that are disposed at similar locations to each other within the imaging plane and determining whether the platelets as identified at each of the depth levels are likely to correspond to a single (i.e., the same) platelet. For some applications, in determining whether the platelets as identified at each of the adjacent depth levels are likely to correspond to a single (i.e., the same) platelet, the computer processor accounts for lateral movement of the platelets between the images acquired at each of the adjacent depth levels. For some applications, in order to perform the above-described estimate, the computer processor is configured to account for interference with the visibility of platelets by white blood cells that are disposed within the monolayer and/or that are suspended within the cell solution. For example, within fluorescent images that am acquired at the additional depth levels, white blood cells that fluoresce within the monolayer are typically visible and interfere with the visibility of platelets that are disposed above the white blood cells. Therefore, platelets that are disposed above white blood cells within the monolayer may be excluded from the platelet count. Since platelets within the volumes above white blood cells am excluded from the count, the number of platelets within these volumes may be estimated. Alternatively or additionally, in order to perform the above-described estimate, the computer processor is configured to account for interference with the visibility of platelets by red blood cells that are disposed within the monolayer, and that may interfere with the identification of platelets within bright field images.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0120">For some applications, counts of platelets within the monolayer depth level and/or within the additional depth levels are normalized, and/or other statistical analysis techniques are applied to one or both of these counts. For example, the count of the platelets within a given imaging field may be normalized with respect to the red blood cell count within that field, the time dynamics of the settling of the platelets may be incorporated into the estimate of platelets that are not settled within the monolayer, and/or outliers may be removed from the estimates. For some applications, additional imaging fields are imaged, if there is a low platelet count, if there arc outlier fields (e.g., with very high or very low platelet counts), and/or if imaging fields that are imaged at the additional depth levels are rejected due to errors.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0121">For some applications, a count of the platelets that have settled within the monolayer is compared to a count of the platelets that have not settled within the monolayer. Typically, an output is generated in response to the comparison. For some applications, a clinical condition is derived and outputted to a user, based upon tire comparison of the count of the platelets that have settled within the monolayer and the count of the platelets that have not settled within the monolayer. For example, the extent of platelet activation within the sample may be derived, at least partially based upon the comparison. Alternatively or additionally, a clinical condition may be derived based upon the size, shape, settling time, and/or settling dynamics of the platelets. For some such applications, the settling dynamics of the platelets are determined by imaging the same imaging field a plurality of times, with a lime interval between each of the image acquisitions, and/or by determining until what height within the sample chamber platelets are present at a given time.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0122">For some applications, the computer processor generates an output indicating that the sample should be prepared in a different way to how it was prepared (e.g., by modifying the diluent within which the sample is diluted, by adding a platelet activation agent, and/or by adding a coagulation agent), based upon the comparison.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0123">For some applications, based upon the comparison between the count of the platelets that have settled within the monolayer and the count of the platelets that have not settled within the monolayer, the portion of the blood sample is invalidated from being used for performing at least some measurements upon the sample. For example, if the ratio of unsettled platelets to settled platelets is greater than a First given threshold, and/or lower than a second given threshold, then this might be interpreted as being indicative of a problem with the sample and/or the preparation thereof.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0124">For some applications, a parameter of the sample (such as platelet volume, mean platelet volume, and/or median platelet volume) is determined based upon a measurement that is performed upon the first portion of the sample.
