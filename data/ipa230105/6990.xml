particular, to a method and related apparatus for logging in to an in-vehicle system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Currently, an in-vehicle system uses a login mechanism of a user account to implement personalized vehicle configuration for a user based on the user account. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The personalized configuration of the in-vehicle system includes a plurality of aspects such as autonomous driving data, driving behavior habit data, vehicle seat rearview mirror adjustment data and a driving mode. In other words, the user may log in to in-vehicle systems of different vehicles by using a user account of the user, and the different vehicles may also provide, based on personalized data of the user account, a driver with a service that conforms to a personal habit of the driver. This achieves intelligent vehicle use experience that &#x201c;a vehicle understands me&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, there are two login manners for the in-vehicle system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a first manner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an app of a mobile phone is connected to a vehicle through Bluetooth. When an app of the mobile phone and the vehicle are within a Bluetooth near field communication range, data transmission and account verification are performed. After the data transmission and the account verification succeed, account login is completed. In this manner, if a vehicle end has no account information, account login cannot be completed until boarding. Therefore, login needs to be completed in advance, and the account information is stored locally. In addition, a Bluetooth near field communication manner is vulnerable to a relay attack. After a Bluetooth signal is intercepted, the Bluetooth signal may be copied to complete account login. In this case, if this account includes a vehicle control permission, the vehicle control permission is indirectly obtained.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a second manner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a user remotely sends an instruction via a mobile phone, and sends an instruction to a vehicle via a telematics service provider (telematics service provider, TSP). In this way, the vehicle completes remote login. In this manner, the user needs to determine a boarding time, and then completes account login in advance. Consequently, user experience is poor.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, both the foregoing two manners have unavoidable disadvantages. However, there is no in-vehicle system login manner currently that balances convenience and security.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of this application provide a method and related apparatus for logging in to an in-vehicle system, to provide a convenient and secure solution for logging in to the in-vehicle system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a first aspect, a method for logging in to an in-vehicle system is provided, where the method is used for a mobile terminal to request to log in to the in-vehicle system with a first user account. The method includes: establishing, by the mobile terminal, a near field communication link to a vehicle, where the vehicle corresponds to the in-vehicle system; negotiating a login binding code with the vehicle through the near field communication link; and providing the login binding code to a network side device, where the login binding code is used by the network side device to verify whether the in-vehicle system can be logged in to with the first user account.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The method provided in the first aspect may be performed by the mobile terminal. The mobile terminal mentioned herein may be the mobile terminal device or an apparatus that may support the mobile terminal device in implementing a function of the method, for example, a chip system. For example, the mobile terminal device is a mobile phone.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In this embodiment of this application, the mobile terminal establishes the near field communication connection to the vehicle, and negotiates the login binding code with the vehicle through the near field communication link, so that the network side device verifies, based on the login binding code, whether the in-vehicle system may be logged in to with the first user account on the mobile terminal. In the method, the user does not need to determine a boarding time, and does not need to log in to the in-vehicle system with the first user account for the first time, so that operations are convenient. In addition, the login binding code is determined through negotiation between the mobile terminal and the vehicle. A near field communication association relationship between the vehicle and the mobile terminal can be verified by using the login binding code. This helps improve security of logging in to the in-vehicle system.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Solution 1: The login binding code may be generated by the network side device, for example, the network side device generates the login binding code based on at least one of the first user account, a mobile terminal identifier used to identify the mobile terminal, an in-vehicle system identifier used to identify the in-vehicle system, or a vehicle identifier used to identify the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For the foregoing solution 1, there are a plurality of manners in which the mobile terminal negotiates a login binding code with the vehicle through the near field communication link. For example, the following manner 1 to manner 3 are used.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Manner 1: The mobile terminal is configured to: send a first login request message to the vehicle through the near field communication link; and receive, through the near field communication link, a login request feedback message returned by the vehicle, where the login request feedback message includes the login binding code, and the login binding code is requested from the network side device by the vehicle. The providing the login binding code to a network side device includes: sending a first verification request message to the network side device, where the first verification request message includes the login binding code, and the first verification request message further includes at least one of the first user account or the in-vehicle system identifier.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">That is, in the manner 1, the login binding code determined through negotiation between the mobile terminal and the in-vehicle system is a login binding code requested from the network side device by the vehicle. The mobile terminal provides the login binding code to the network side device for verification. In the method, the user does not need to determine a boarding time, and does not need to log in to the in-vehicle system with the first user account for the first time, so that operations are convenient. In addition, the login binding code is determined through negotiation between the mobile terminal and the vehicle. An association relationship between the vehicle and the mobile terminal can be verified by using the login binding code. This helps improve security of logging in to the in-vehicle system.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Manner 2: The mobile terminal is configured to: send a first binding code application message to the network side device; receives a first binding code feedback message returned by the network side device, where the first binding code feedback message includes the login binding code; and sends a third verification request message to the vehicle through the near field communication link, where the third verification request message includes the login binding code. The providing the login binding code to a network side device includes: indirectly providing the login binding code to the network side device by sending the third verification request message to the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">That is, in the manner 2, the login binding code determined through negotiation between the mobile terminal and the in-vehicle system is a login binding code requested from the network side device by the mobile terminal. The mobile terminal indirectly provides the login binding code to the network side device for verification through the vehicle. In the method, the user does not need to determine a boarding time, and does not need to log in to the in-vehicle system with the first user account for the first time, so that operations are convenient. In addition, the login binding code is determined through negotiation between the mobile terminal and the vehicle. An association relationship between the vehicle and the mobile terminal can be verified by using the login binding code. This helps improve security of logging in to the in-vehicle system.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Manner 3: The mobile terminal is configured to: send a first binding code application message to the network side device; receive a first binding code feedback message returned by the network side device, where the first binding code feedback message includes the login binding code; and send a second login request message to the vehicle through the near field communication link, where the second login request message includes the login binding code. The providing the login binding code to a network side device includes: sending a first verification request message to the network side device, where the first verification request message includes the login binding code, and the first verification request message further includes at least one of the first user account or the in-vehicle system identifier.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">That is, in the manner 3, the login binding code determined through negotiation between the mobile terminal and the in-vehicle system is a login binding code requested from the network side device by the mobile terminal. The mobile terminal provides the login binding code to the network side device (correspondingly, the vehicle may also provide the login binding code to the network side device) for verification. In the method, the user does not need to determine a boarding time, and does not need to log in to the in-vehicle system with the first user account for the first time, so that operations are convenient. In addition, the login binding code is determined through negotiation between the mobile terminal and the vehicle. An association relationship between the vehicle and the mobile terminal can be verified by using the login binding code. This helps improve security of logging in to the in-vehicle system.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Solution 2: The login binding code is generated by the mobile terminal, or is generated by the vehicle, or is generated by both the mobile terminal and the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">An example is as follows: there may be a plurality of manners in which the mobile terminal negotiates a login binding code with the vehicle through the near field communication link. For example, the mobile terminal generates a first login binding code and sends the first login binding code to the vehicle, where the first login binding code is a finally negotiated login binding code. Alternatively, the vehicle generates a first login binding code and sends the first login binding code to the mobile terminal, where the first login binding code is a finally negotiated login binding code. Alternatively, the mobile terminal generates a first login binding code and sends the first login binding code to the vehicle, and the vehicle generates a second login binding code based on the first login binding code, and sends the second login binding code to the mobile terminal, where the second login binding code is a finally negotiated login binding code. Alternatively, the vehicle generates a first login binding code and sends the first login binding code to the mobile terminal, and the mobile terminal generates a second login binding code based on the first login binding code, and sends the second login binding code to the vehicle, where the second login binding code is a finally negotiated login binding code. This is not limited in this embodiment of this application.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">For the foregoing solution 2, that the mobile terminal provides the login binding code to a network side device includes: the mobile terminal sends a first verification request message to the network side device, where the first verification request message includes the login binding code, and the first verification request message further includes at least one of the first user account or the in-vehicle system identifier.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be understood that the login binding code is generated by the vehicle and/or the mobile terminal. The mobile terminal may send the login binding code to the network side device for verification. Alternatively, the vehicle may send the login binding code to the network side device for verification. An association relationship between the vehicle and the mobile terminal can be verified by using the login binding code. This helps improve security of logging in to the in-vehicle system.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With reference to the first aspect, in a possible implementation of the first aspect, the method further includes: logging in to a first application on the mobile terminal with the first user account, where the network side device is an application server of the first application.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first application may be any application on the mobile terminal, for example, Baidu Map, AutoNavi Map, or another application. The application server corresponding to the first application verifies whether the in-vehicle system can be logged in to with the first user account via which the first application is logged in to, so as to avoid loss of user information in a process of sending the first user account to another server when another server is used. This improves user information security to some extent.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">With reference to the first aspect, in a possible implementation of the first aspect, the method further includes: The mobile terminal receives a verification feedback message sent by the network side device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">That is, after completing the verification, the network side device may send the verification feedback message to the mobile terminal, for example, the verification feedback message about whether the verification succeeds or fails, so as to prompt the user that the login succeeds or fails.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to the first aspect, in a possible implementation of the first aspect, the method further includes: The mobile terminal receives a login success message sent by the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">That is, after logging in to the in-vehicle system with the first user account, the vehicle sends the login success message to the mobile terminal, so as to prompt the user that the login to the in-vehicle system succeeds.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">With reference to the first aspect, in a possible implementation of the first aspect, the first verification request message or the second login request message further includes at least one of the mobile terminal identifier or the vehicle identifier.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, the network side device may know the mobile terminal identifier. For example, after logging in to the first application with the first user account, the mobile terminal reports the mobile terminal identifier to the network side device, and then the network side device determines a correspondence between the first user account and the mobile terminal identifier. The first verification request message, including the mobile terminal identifier, can verify whether the in-vehicle system can be logged in to with the first user account more accurately. This helps improve login security of the in-vehicle system.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">For another example, it is assumed that the network side device may know the vehicle identifier. For example, when the vehicle requests the login binding code from the network side device, the vehicle reports the vehicle identifier to the network side device. The first verification request message, including the vehicle identifier, can verify whether the in-vehicle system can be logged in to with the first user account.

The mobile terminal identifier is an identifier used to identify the mobile terminal, for example, a model or a serial number of the mobile terminal.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">5) Terms &#x201c;system&#x201d; and &#x201c;network&#x201d; may be used interchangeably in embodiments of this application. &#x201c;A plurality of&#x201d; means two or more. In view of this, &#x201c;a plurality of&#x201d; may also be understood as &#x201c;at least two&#x201d; in embodiments of this application. &#x201c;At least one&#x201d; may be understood as one or more, for example, one, two, or more. For example, &#x201c;including at least one&#x201d; means including one, two, or more, and does not limit which items are included. For example, if at least one of A, B, and C is included, A, B, C, A and B, A and C, B and C, or A, B, and C may be included. Similarly, understanding of description such as &#x201c;at least one type&#x201d; is similar. The term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; describes an association relationship for describing associated objects and represents that three relationships may exist. For example, A and/or B may represent the following three cases: Only A exists, both A and B exist, and only B exists. In addition, the character &#x201c;I&#x201d; generally indicates an &#x201c;or&#x201d; relationship between the associated objects.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">Unless otherwise specified, ordinal numbers such as &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; in embodiments of this application are used to distinguish between a plurality of objects, and are not intended to limit a sequence, a time sequence, priorities, or importance of the plurality of objects.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">The following describes a communication system provided in an embodiment of this application.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a communication system according to an embodiment of this application. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the communication system includes a mobile terminal <b>100</b>, a vehicle <b>200</b>, and a network side device <b>300</b>. For example, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> is a mobile phone. A first application on the mobile terminal <b>100</b> is logged in to with a first user account. The network side device <b>300</b> may be an application server corresponding to the first application. When the user carries the mobile terminal <b>100</b> and approaches the vehicle <b>200</b>, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> establishes a near field communication connection, for example, a Bluetooth connection, to the vehicle <b>200</b>. The mobile terminal <b>100</b> requests, through the near field communication link, to log in to an in-vehicle system of the vehicle <b>200</b> with the first user account. The mobile terminal <b>100</b> negotiates a login binding code with the vehicle <b>200</b> through the near field communication link, and provides the login binding code to the network side device <b>300</b>. The login binding code is used by the network side device to verify whether the in-vehicle system can be logged in to with the first user account. When the network side device <b>300</b> verifies that the in-vehicle system can be logged in to with the first user account, the network side device <b>300</b> sends a login indication and personalized data corresponding to the first user account to the vehicle <b>200</b>. The in-vehicle system of the vehicle <b>200</b> is logged in to with the first user account.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">Therefore, in this embodiment of this application, the vehicle <b>200</b> does not need to locally store a user account, that is, the in-vehicle system of the vehicle <b>200</b> does not need to be pre-logged in to with the first user account. In other words, in the technical solution provided in this embodiment of this application, automatic login may also be implemented when the in-vehicle system of the vehicle <b>200</b> is logged in to for the first time. In addition, in this embodiment of this application, the user does not need to determine a boarding time. When the user carriers the mobile terminal <b>100</b> and approaches the in-vehicle system <b>200</b>, the user can automatically log in to the in-vehicle system <b>200</b>. This facilitates an operation and improves user experience.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">It should be understood that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is merely an example of a communication system. The solution of this application may be further applicable to another system, for example, a communication system that includes a mobile terminal, a network side device, and an airplane/unmanned aerial vehicle and that is used to log in to an aircraft.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of a method for logging in to an in-vehicle system according to an embodiment of this application. The procedure may be applicable to the communication system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the procedure of the method includes the following steps.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">Step <b>100</b>: Log in to a first application on a mobile terminal with a first user account.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">For example, the first application is, for example, AutoNavi Map, Baidu Map, or another application related to a vehicle. This is not limited in this embodiment of this application.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">Step <b>200</b>: The mobile terminal establishes a near field communication link to the vehicle. The near field communication connection is, for example, a Bluetooth connection or another short-range connection.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">The Bluetooth connection is used as an example. A process in which the mobile terminal establishes the Bluetooth connection to the vehicle may include Bluetooth pairing, connection, and the like. Details are not described herein.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">In some embodiments, to prevent a plurality of mobile terminals from establishing Bluetooth connections to the vehicle, the vehicle may determine a mobile terminal that requests to establish a Bluetooth connection. If the vehicle locally stores a terminal identifier of the mobile terminal, the vehicle agrees to establish a Bluetooth connection to the mobile terminal. If the vehicle does not locally store a terminal identifier of the mobile terminal, the vehicle refuses to establish a Bluetooth connection to the mobile terminal. For example, after the vehicle establishes a Bluetooth connection to a mobile terminal (for example, establishes a Bluetooth connection for the first time), the vehicle locally stores a device identifier of the mobile terminal. When the mobile terminal approaches the vehicle, the vehicle may find the device identifier of the mobile terminal, and establish the Bluetooth connection to the mobile terminal when it is compared that the device identifier is consistent with the stored device identifier. When it is compared that the device identifier is inconsistent with the stored device identifier, the vehicle may refuse to establish the Bluetooth connection to the mobile terminal. Therefore, any mobile terminal may be prevented from establishing a Bluetooth connection to the vehicle. This improves security.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">Alternatively, when finding an identifier of a vehicle, a mobile terminal may determine whether the identifier of the vehicle is consistent with a locally stored vehicle identifier, to prevent the mobile terminal from establishing Bluetooth connections to a plurality of vehicles. If the identifier of the vehicle is consistent with the locally stored vehicle identifier, the mobile terminal initiates a Bluetooth connection to a vehicle corresponding to the vehicle identifier. Otherwise, the mobile terminal does not establish a Bluetooth connection to a vehicle corresponding to the vehicle identifier. Therefore, the mobile terminal may be prevented from establishing a Bluetooth connection to any vehicle. This improves security.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">Optionally, when determining that a distance between the mobile terminal and the vehicle is less than a second threshold, the mobile terminal may accurately establish a near field communication link to the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">Optionally, after step <b>200</b>, the vehicle may be automatically powered on. Alternatively, after step <b>200</b>, the mobile terminal sends a power-on request to the vehicle, to request the in-vehicle system to be powered on. After receiving the power-on request, the vehicle completes power-on of the in-vehicle system. The mobile terminal may send the power-on request when determining that a distance between the mobile terminal and the in-vehicle system is less than a first threshold. Optionally, the first threshold may be less than the second threshold. A specific value is not limited in this embodiment of this application. That is, in a process in which the mobile terminal detects that the distance between the mobile terminal and the in-vehicle system gradually decreases, the mobile terminal first establishes a near field communication connection to the vehicle, and then triggers power-on of the in-vehicle system.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">Step <b>300</b>: The mobile terminal negotiates a login binding code with the vehicle through the near field communication link.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">There may be a plurality of implementations in which the mobile terminal negotiates the login binding code with the vehicle through the near field communication link. For example, the login binding code is generated by a network side device. For example, the mobile terminal applies to the network side device for a login binding code, and sends the login binding code to the vehicle; or the vehicle applies to the network side device for a login binding code, and sends the login binding code to the mobile terminal. For another example, the login binding code is generated by the mobile terminal and sent to the vehicle; or the login binding code is generated by the vehicle and sent to the mobile terminal; or the login binding code is generated by both the mobile terminal and the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">Step <b>400</b>: The mobile terminal and/or the vehicle provide/provides the login binding code to the network side device, where the login binding code is used by the network side device to verify whether the in-vehicle system can be logged in to with the first user account.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">Step <b>500</b>: The network side device verifies, based on the login binding code, whether the in-vehicle system can be logged in to with the first user account, determines that the in-vehicle system can be logged in to with the first user account and performs a subsequent step when the verification succeeds; otherwise, the network side device stops performing a subsequent step, or may further send a verification failure indication to the vehicle or the mobile terminal.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">It should be noted that step <b>300</b> has a plurality of implementations, and step <b>400</b> and step <b>500</b> are related to step <b>300</b>. Therefore, step <b>400</b> and step <b>500</b> also correspondingly have a plurality of implementations, which are separately described in the following.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">Step <b>600</b>: The network side device sends a login indication and personalized data of the first user account to the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">For example, the login indication herein may be, for example, a token. For the personalized data of the first user account, refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and details are not described herein again.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">Step <b>700</b>: Log in to the in-vehicle system with the first user account on the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">Step <b>800</b>: The network side device sends a verification feedback message to the mobile terminal.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">It should be noted that step <b>800</b> and step <b>900</b> are optional steps, and therefore are represented by dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The verification feedback message may be, for example, an indication message indicating that the verification performed by the network side device on the received login binding code succeeds or fails.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">Step <b>900</b>: The vehicle sends a login success indication to the mobile terminal, where the login success indication is used to indicate that the in-vehicle system is successfully logged in to with the first user account. For example, after receiving the login success indication, the mobile terminal may display prompt information such as a text or a picture, to prompt the user that the in-vehicle system is successfully logged in.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">The following separately describes a plurality of implementations of step <b>300</b> and corresponding implementations of step <b>400</b> and step <b>500</b>.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading><p id="p-0228" num="0227"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> are a schematic flowchart of a method for logging in to an in-vehicle system according to an embodiment of this application. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> may be understood as details of some steps in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.
