To date, the cathode materials developed for lithium-ion batteries include layered LiMO<sub>2 </sub>(M=Mn, Co, and Ni), spinel (LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), and olivine (LiFeO<sub>4</sub>) crystal structures that are capable of intercalating lithium ions into transition-metal oxide host frameworks, such as Fe, Mn, Co, and Ni, and several conversion-type transition-metal fluorides MF<sub>3</sub>, MF<sub>2 </sub>(M=Fe, Mn, Cu, Co, Ni).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most cathode materials currently used are transition-metal-based intercalation oxides, which are capable of generating a high voltage compared with conversion-type cathode materials. However, transition-metal-based intercalation oxides have a disadvantage in that they have a relatively low capacity. In contrast, conversion-type materials have a relatively high capacity.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Chromium oxides, such as CrO<sub>2</sub>, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and Cr<sub>8</sub>O<sub>21</sub>, have been reported as potential cathode materials. Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>and Cr<sub>8</sub>O<sub>21 </sub>showed high specific capacities of 200-350 mAhg<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>in the voltage range of 2-4.5 V vs. Li<sup>+</sup>/Li and can be synthesized by thermal decomposition of CrO<sub>3 </sub>at 350&#xb0; C. and 270&#xb0; C., respectively. The crystal structure of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>was predicted by Hewston and Chamberland using the crystallographic data of Cr<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12 </sub>single crystals reported by Wilhelmi. The crystallographic formula of Cr<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12 </sub>is Cr<sup>3+</sup><sub>2</sub>(Cr<sup>6+</sup>O<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, with an atomic ratio of 3:2 for Cr<sup>6+</sup> in tetrahedral sites to Cr<sup>3+</sup> in octahedral sites. Contrastingly, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>has a formula of Cr<sup>3+</sup><sub>2</sub>(Cr<sup>6+</sup>O<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(Cr<sup>6+</sup><sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) with a Cr<sup>6+</sup>/Cr<sup>3+</sup> atomic ratio of 4:2. The crystal structure of Cr<sub>8</sub>O<sub>21 </sub>was analyzed by Norby et al. using neutron diffraction experiments, and the formula was predicted as C<sup>3+</sup><sub>2</sub>(Cr<sup>6+</sup>O<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(Cr<sup>6+</sup><sub>4</sub>O<sub>13</sub>), with a Cr<sup>6+</sup>/Cr<sup>3+</sup> ratio of 6:2. The battery test results of these compounds indicated a higher specific capacity for Cr<sub>8</sub>O<sub>21 </sub>than that for Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. This can be attributed to the higher content of Cr<sup>6+</sup> ions in Cr<sub>8</sub>O<sub>21 </sub>than that in Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, since the redox reaction occurs to Cr<sup>6+</sup> ions when Li<sup>+</sup> ions are inserted in the compound. Therefore, a novel cathode material can be designed by substituting Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions with another transition metal having an active redox couple to improve the energy density.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, the present invention has been developed based on the above-stated problems, with the objective to provide an iron-chromium oxide suitable for application as a novel cathode material for lithium-ion batteries, which has a high specific capacity and generates a high voltage.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">More specifically, a cathode material with a high capacity may be achieved by replacing the Cr<sup>3+</sup> ions with Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions, which may positively contribute to the electrochemical oxidation/reduction reaction compared with the previously developed Cr<sub>8</sub>O<sub>21 </sub>and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>compounds.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, provided is a method preparing an iron-chromium oxide, the method including a step of providing an ion exchange column substituted with Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions;
