The protective layer protects the information recorded on the recording layer, and also enhances the slidability of the magnetic head. However, satisfactory durability for the magnetic recording medium cannot be achieved simply by providing a protective layer on the recording layer. Therefore, a lubricant layer is generally formed by applying a lubricant to the surface of the protective layer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0005">Examples of lubricants that have been proposed for the lubricant that is used when forming the lubricant layer of a magnetic recording medium include lubricants containing a fluorine-based polymer having a repeating structure containing CF<sub>2 </sub>and having polar groups such as hydroxyl groups at the polymer terminals (for example, see Patent Documents 1 and 2).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0006">Specifically, Patent Document 1 discloses a compound having a plurality of hydroxyl groups at both of the terminal portions.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0007">Further, Patent Document 2 discloses a compound having a perfluoropolyether main chain, wherein a terminal group of the molecule contains at least two polar groups, each of those polar groups is bonded to a different carbon atom, and the carbon atoms to which the polar groups are bonded are linked via a linking group containing a carbon atom to which no polar groups are bonded.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART LITERATURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent (Granted) Publication No. 4632144</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0009">Patent Document 2: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2018-24614</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0010">In magnetic recording and playback devices, in addition to improved recording density, higher reliability would also be desirable, such as an improvement in chemical substance resistance and pickup suppression.

In a lubricant layer containing the fluorine-containing ether compound of this embodiment, the PFPE chain represented by R<sup>2 </sup>coats the surface of the protective layer, and also imparts lubricity to the lubricant layer, thereby reducing the frictional force between the magnetic head and the protective layer. Moreover, in a lubricant layer containing the fluorine-containing ether compound of this embodiment, the PFPE chain represented by formula (2), which has a repeating unit of good rigidity formed from a linear fluorinated alkyl ether chain, adheres (adsorbs) to the protective layer via the hydroxyl groups of the terminal groups positioned at both ends of the PFPE chain.

As a result, in those cases where the protective layer to which the lubricant is applied is formed from carbon or a nitrogen-containing carbon, the following two effects are achieved. Firstly, the lubricant spreads readily across the protective layer without any aggregation of the hydroxyl groups of R<sup>1</sup>, meaning the coating properties can be more easily improved. Secondly, the three hydroxyl groups of R<sup>1 </sup>orient more readily in the same direction relative to the surface of the protective layer, producing a three-dimensional arrangement that enables the hydroxyl groups to adhere more readily to the protective layer surface.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0058">Accordingly, it is thought that a lubricant layer containing the fluorine-containing ether compound of an embodiment of the present invention is able to exhibit more favorable adhesion to the protective layer, better suppress pickup, and also exhibit excellent chemical substance resistance, particularly in those cases where the protective layer is formed from carbon or a nitrogen-containing carbon.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0059">Specifically, the fluorine-containing ether compound of an embodiment of the present invention is preferably a compound represented by one of formulas (A) to (V) shown below.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0060">The symbols xa to xj and xu in the following formulas (A) to (J) and (U) correspond with q in formula (2).
