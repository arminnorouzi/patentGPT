description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to a cleaning agent composition and to a cleaning method.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0002">Conventionally, electronic elements and wires are 2-dimensionally (within a plane) integrated on a semiconductor wafer. In a trend toward further integration, demand has arisen for a semiconductor integration technique which achieves 3-dimensional integration (i.e., stacking) in addition to 2-dimensional integration. In the technique of 3-dimensional integration, a number of layers are stacked with wire connection by the mediation of through silicon vias (TSVs). In integration of multiple layers, each component wafer to be stacked is thinned by polishing (i.e., grinding) a surface opposite the circuit-furnished surface (i.e., a back surface), and the thus-thinned semiconductor wafers are stacked.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">Before thinning, the semiconductor wafer (may also be called simply &#x201c;wafer&#x201d;) is fixed to a support for facilitating polishing by means of a polishing machine (i.e., grinder). Since the fixation must be easily removed after polishing, the fixation is called temporary bonding. Temporary bonding must be easily removed from the support. When such temporary bonding is removed by excessive force, in some cases a thinned semiconductor wafer may be broken or deformed. In order to prevent such a phenomenon, the temporarily bonded support is detached in a gentle manner. However, from another aspect, it is not preferred that the temporarily bonded support be removed or slid by a stress applied during polishing of the back surface of the semiconductor wafer. Therefore, temporary bonding must withstand the stress during polishing and must be easily removed after polishing. For example, one required performance includes having high stress (i.e., strong adhesion) within the plane during polishing and low stress (i.e., weak adhesion) toward the thickness direction during detaching. Furthermore, in processing steps, the temperature of a workpiece may exceed 150&#xb0; C. in some cases. Thus, temporary bonding must be stable at such high temperatures.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Under such circumstances, polysiloxane adhesives meeting the aforementioned characteristic requirements are mainly used as temporary adhesives in the semiconductor industry. In temporary bonding by use of a polysiloxane adhesive, an adhesive residue often remains on a substrate surface after removal of the thinned substrate. In order to avoid an undesired phenomenon in a subsequent step, there has been developed a cleaning agent composition for removing such a residue and cleaning the surface of a semiconductor substrate (see, for example, Patent Documents 1 and 2). Currently, there is continuous demand for a new cleaning agent composition in the semiconductor field. Patent Document 1 discloses a siloxane resin-remover containing a polar, aprotic solvent and a quaternary ammonium hydroxide, and Patent Document 2 discloses a cured resin-remover containing an alkylammonium fluoride. However, development of a more effective cleaning agent composition is expected.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">Patent Document 1: WO 2014/092022</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0006">Patent Document 2: U.S. Pat.

Thus, an object of the invention is to provide a cleaning agent composition which exhibits excellent cleaning performance to an adhesive residue remaining after debonding a laminate that has been temporarily bonded by the mediation of an adhesive layer formed from, for example, a polysiloxane adhesive.

In cleaning of a substrate (e.g., a semiconductor substrate) on which an adhesive residue remains after debonding a laminate that has been temporarily bonded by the mediation of an adhesive layer formed from a polysiloxane adhesive, when a cleaning agent composition containing a quaternary ammonium salt and a solvent is employed, a specific amide derivative and a non-amide organic solvent other than the amide derivative are used in combination as the solvent. Also, the water content of the cleaning agent composition is regulated to a level lower than a specific value. As a result, a cleaning agent composition that has excellent cleaning performance and that can shorten cleaning time can be provided.

Specifically, the adhesive composition obtained in Preparation Example 1 was applied onto a 12-inch silicon wafer by means of a spin coater so as to adjust the coating thickness to 100 &#x3bc;m, and cured at 150&#xb0; C. for 15 minutes, then 190&#xb0; C. for 10 minutes. The thus-coated wafer was cut into square chips (4 cm&#xd7;4 cm), and the layer (film) thickness of one of the chips was measured by means of a contact-type film thickness meter. Thereafter, the chip was placed in a 9-cm Petri dish made of stainless steel, and the cleaning agent composition (7 mL) was added, followed by closing the dish. The closed Petri dish was placed on Agitator H, and the chip was cleaned through agitation at 23&#xb0; C. for 5 minutes. After cleaning, the chip was removed and washed with isopropanol and pure water, and then dry-baked at 150&#xb0; C. for 1 minute. The layer (film) thickness of the chip was measured again by means of the contact-type film thickness meter. Through dividing the decrease in layer (film) thickness after cleaning by the cleaning time, etching rate [&#x3bc;m/min] was calculated. The etching rate was employed as an index for cleaning performance. Table 1 shows the results.</p><heading id="h-0033" level="2">[3-3] Evaluation of Dissolution Property</heading><p id="p-0251" num="0216">For determining the persistency in cleaning performance of each of the prepared cleaning agent compositions, the following adhesive dissolution test was conducted. Specifically, the adhesive composition obtained in Preparation Example 2 was applied onto a 12-inch silicon wafer by means of a spin coater and cured at 120&#xb0; C. for 1.5 minutes and 200&#xb0; C. for 10 minutes. Subsequently, the cured adhesive composition was scraped off by use of a cutter blade from the 12-inch wafer. A portion (1 g) of the cured adhesive composition was transferred to and weighed in a 9-mL screw tube, and then the cleaning agent composition (2 g) was added to the tube. The dissolution state of the cured product was observed at 23&#xb0; C. When the cured product was completely dissolved within 1 to 2 hours, the state was rated as &#x201c;Excellent.&#x201d; When the cured product was completely dissolved within 2 to 12 hours, the state was rated as &#x201c;Very good.&#x201d; When the cured product was substantially dissolved within 12 to 24 hours, the state was rated as &#x201c;Good.&#x201d; When the cured product was substantially not dissolved over a long period of time, the state was rated as &#x201c;Bad.&#x201d; Table 1 shows the results.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Water content</entry><entry>Etching rate</entry><entry>Dissolution</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>(%)</entry><entry>[&#x3bc;m/min]</entry><entry>test</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Ex. 1</entry><entry>0.67</entry><entry>10.8</entry><entry>Excellent</entry></row><row><entry>Ex. 2</entry><entry>0.65</entry><entry>14.72</entry><entry>Excellent</entry></row><row><entry>Ex. 3</entry><entry>0.67</entry><entry>10.62</entry><entry>Excellent</entry></row><row><entry>Ex. 4</entry><entry>0.63</entry><entry>11.51</entry><entry>Excellent</entry></row><row><entry>Ex. 5</entry><entry>0.63</entry><entry>8.72</entry><entry>Excellent</entry></row><row><entry>Ex. 6</entry><entry>0.63</entry><entry>10.28</entry><entry>Excellent</entry></row><row><entry>Ex. 7</entry><entry>0.78</entry><entry>13.85</entry><entry>Excellent</entry></row><row><entry>Ex. 8</entry><entry>0.73</entry><entry>9.93</entry><entry>Excellent</entry></row><row><entry>Ex. 9</entry><entry>0.71</entry><entry>10.26</entry><entry>Excellent</entry></row><row><entry>Ex. 10</entry><entry>0.72</entry><entry>8.32</entry><entry>Very good</entry></row><row><entry>Comp.
