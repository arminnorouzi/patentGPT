For example, mobile devices facilitate communication with an employee of a corporation even when the employee is away from the corporation's offices. For this and other reasons, corporations may desire use of mobile devices by employees. Costs associated with mobile devices include the cost of the mobile device (i.e., equipment costs) and the cost of the mobile service (i.e., a cellular usage plan). The cellular usage plan may include a talk portion and a data portion. For example, the plan may provide a user, for a first set monthly price, with an allotment of X minutes of talk time using the mobile device and of Y bytes of data transmission/reception. The cost of the data plan may be included within the first set monthly price or a separate data plan price.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It may be advantageous for the corporation to own the mobile devices used by their employees and/or to pay for the service. These costs may be referred to as a corporation-liable expense. Many companies enroll their employees in a company-wide shared cellular usage plan provided by a cellular service provider. Billing is simplified by having all of the employees enrolled with a single cellular service provider. An employee also can be required to return the mobile device to the corporation upon termination of their employment with the corporation if the corporation owns the mobile device. Furthermore, the corporation may be entitled to delete data stored on the mobile device upon termination of the employment if the corporation owns the mobile device. Maintaining control of the equipment and data is beneficial to the corporation; however, the corporation may not be able to meet employee requests for access to different types of equipment and service provided by different cellular phone service providers. Furthermore, typically the corporation is responsible for customer service, provisioning of the mobile devices, and other support functions related to a corporate owned and paid mobile phone service.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To satisfy employee requests for choice in their mobile device and/or plan, the corporation may provide employees with a mobile phone benefit. For example, the corporation may agree to pay for an employee's mobile usage plan; however, ultimately the employee is liable to a mobile service provider (i.e., an employee-liable expense). The corporation may reimburse the employee upon receipt of a reimbursement request from the employee. Manual entry and processing of the reimbursement requests is burdensome and does not provide an inventory of mobile devices being paid for by the corporation. Furthermore, there is no connection between the reimbursement requests and a human resources department of the corporation, where, for example, records of the corporation's agreements regarding payment of employee mobile expenses and a current employee status typically are maintained.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Alternatively, the corporation may provide the employee with a monthly stipend included in a pay check and earmarked for payment of mobile phone expenses. Reimbursement of mobile phone expenses in this manner does not provide the corporation with an inventory of mobile devices and also does not provide a connection between requests for reimbursement and the corporation's human resources department. Furthermore, an employee stipend of this sort may have negative tax consequences when compared to payments made by the corporation in response to a reimbursement request. For example, an employee stipend may be taxed as income to the employee. In contrast, a payment made by the corporation in response to a reimbursement request may be designated as a business expense. However, by paying for the mobile device expenses, the corporation may maintain the right to delete data stored on the mobile device of an employee upon termination of the employee.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, it is desirable to have a network-based system and method of managing employee-liable expenses by an employer that will address the disadvantages of the known systems described above.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, a computer-based method is provided, for managing payments made as part of an employee-liable expense reimbursement program, wherein a plurality of employees are enrolled in the program and submit requests for reimbursement for expenses related to a service provided to the employees by a service provider for which the employees are liable.

The payment is made by the employer as a benefit to the employee. More specifically, the methods and systems described herein facilitate, for example, distributing payments from the employer directly to accounts with a service provider for which the employee is liable, or optionally, directly to an employee. In the exemplary embodiment, an expense manager receives data from the employer and data from the employee, enrolls the employee in a reimbursement program, generates an invoice for employer approval, and distributes a payment to the service provider. The expense manager utilizes an expense management system to perform the processes described herein. In some embodiments, the expense manager is a separate entity from the employer, that is, a third-party who provides expense management services. In other embodiments, the functions of the expense manager and the expense management system are included within, and performed by, the employer. The expense management system provides the employer with reports of employee-liable expenses paid by the employer and an inventory of employee-liable devices. The methods and systems described herein allow an employer to provide a reimbursement benefit associated with employee-liable devices and provide the employer with an inventory and records typically only available to an employer with respect to employer-liable devices. In a specific example, the employee-liable reimbursement program described herein allows an employer to provide a mobile phone benefit to employees, without assuming responsibilities for customer service and/or support functions, and while employees are able to choose service providers, devices, plans, and/or features.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a specific embodiment, the systems and processes described herein credit an employee's personal account with a service provider for use of a personal mobile device. A technical effect of the systems and processes described herein include at least one of: (a) receiving, by the computer system, requests for reimbursement; (b) aggregating the requests for reimbursement scheduled for payment within a predefined time period and associated with the service provider; (c) generating an invoice that includes a payment amount to be paid to a first service provider; (d) automatically requesting funds from an employer of the plurality of employees for the payment amount included in the invoice; (e) electronically transferring funds associated with the employer to one of the service provider and the employee; (f) transferring funds directly to the employee; (g) receiving, by the computer system, approval of the invoice from the employer; (h) storing a reimbursement record for each of the plurality of employees enrolled in the program, wherein the reimbursement record includes at least one of a reimbursement amount, an employee account identifier, and a service provider account identifier; (i) generating the invoice based at least partially on the reimbursement amounts included within the reimbursement records; (j) including within the generated invoice details as to a portion of the payment amount to be paid to the service provider associated with each employee of the plurality of employees; (k) providing data to the employer that identifies a portion of the payment amount associated with at least one of a cost center within the employer and a geographic location of the employees; (l) providing the data to the employer comprises providing the employer with access to a webpage, wherein the webpage provides the employer with options on how to organize the data associated with the employer that is stored by the memory device; (m) providing the invoice to the employer; (n) transmitting the invoice to the employer, wherein the invoice has a predefined format that is compatible with software utilized by the employer; (o) providing the employer with access to the invoice, wherein the invoice has a predefined format that is compatible with software utilized by the employer; (p) receiving, by the computer system, data associated with a request for reimbursement from an employee of the plurality of employees; (q) generating, by the computer system, a request for reimbursement based at least partially on the data received from the employee; (r) requesting approval, from the employer, of the request for reimbursement; (s) receiving approval of the request for reimbursement; and (t) initiating recurring reimbursement program payments for approved requests for reimbursement.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, a computer program is provided, and the program is embodied on a computer-readable medium and utilizes a Structured Query Language (SQL) with a client user interface front-end for administration and a web interface for standard user input and reports.

As described above, enrolling <b>422</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) employee <b>42</b> in the reimbursement program includes determining <b>426</b> if employee <b>42</b> qualifies for registration in the reimbursement program. In the exemplary embodiment, expense management system <b>16</b> determines <b>426</b> that employee <b>42</b> qualifies for registration in the reimbursement program when employee <b>42</b> completes an employee registration process. The registration process includes activating an employee account within expense management system <b>16</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).

If an employee record already exists in the HR profile table, expense management system <b>16</b> determines <b>616</b> if the employee associated with the employee record has previously registered in the reimbursement program. If the employee has already registered, expense management system <b>16</b> updates <b>618</b> the employment status of the employee from data included within the most recent HR feed. Updating the employment status ensures that reimbursement payments are only provided for employees with a proper employment status (e.g., no payments made for terminated employees). Updating the records within the HR profile table periodically with data provided by the human resources department of employer <b>20</b> provides an automatic cross-check of at least one expense of employer <b>20</b> with current human resource data.

In the exemplary embodiment, expense management system <b>16</b> determines <b>428</b> that the device qualifies for reimbursement through the reimbursement program based on answers provided by employee <b>42</b> during a device registration process. The device registration process includes obtaining device data from employee <b>42</b>. The device data includes, but is not limited to, data used to identify the device and data used to determine if costs associated with the device are employee-liable expenses or employer-liable expenses. Furthermore, the device registration process facilitates creating a device list for use by employer <b>20</b> in tracking employee-liable devices and/or employer-liable devices.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the exemplary embodiment, expense management system <b>16</b> requests <b>810</b> that employee <b>42</b> provide an identifier associated with a device used by employee <b>42</b>.

For example, expense management system <b>16</b> may also store information related to employer-liable devices of employer <b>20</b>. Employer-liable devices are devices that employer <b>20</b> owns and is liable for associated costs. If expense management system <b>16</b> determines <b>816</b> the device associated with the provided identifier is in the employer-liable device inventory, expense management system <b>16</b> designates <b>818</b> the device as an employer-liable device.

The profile inventory may include records for both employee-liable devices and employer-liable devices. Although employer-liable devices are not eligible for the reimbursement program, expense management system <b>16</b> creates <b>822</b> profile inventory records for the employer-liable devices in order to provide employer <b>20</b> with a combined directory of employer-liable and employee-liable devices.

For example, expense management system <b>16</b> may ask if the device is billed directly to employee <b>42</b>. If the device is billed directly to employee <b>42</b>, expense management system <b>16</b> designates <b>832</b> the device as an employee-liable/expensed device.

The employee-liable inventory information requested by expense management system <b>16</b> may include, but is not limited to, a device type, a device description, a device carrier (e.g., a service provider associated with the device), a device model, a device make, and/or a device master account number. In the exemplary embodiment, expense management system <b>16</b> determines <b>846</b> if the device is an invalid device. For example, expense management system <b>16</b> analyzes the employee-liable inventory information provided by employee <b>42</b> to identify contradictory information and/or missing information that would require human interaction to resolve. The method of determining <b>428</b> if a device is eligible may be repeated, as employee <b>42</b> may seek to register more than one device in the employee-liable expense reimbursement program. For example, employee <b>42</b> may be liable for expenses related to a mobile phone, expenses related to a tablet computing device (e.g., an iPad&#xae;, iPad&#xae; is a registered trademark of Apple, Inc.), and expenses related to a home computer (e.g., Internet access).

In another alternative embodiment, the employee-liable expense reimbursement level that an employee is eligible to have reimbursed is determined based on a position the employee holds with employer <b>20</b>, and a reimbursement level provided by employer <b>20</b> associated with that position. For example, employer <b>20</b> may provide expense management system <b>16</b> with a list of job titles and the reimbursement level associated with each of those job titles.

After receiving an approval or denial from the manager, expense management system <b>16</b> again provides the list of requests for reimbursement awaiting review to the manager so the manager can review the remaining requests.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a flow chart <b>1020</b> of an exemplary method for initiating <b>1022</b> recurring reimbursement program payments. As described above, requests for reimbursement are provided <b>1010</b> to an administrator of expense management system <b>16</b> for review once the request for reimbursement is approved by employer <b>20</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, initiating <b>1022</b> recurring reimbursement program payments includes reviewing <b>1024</b> approved requests for reimbursement and creating <b>1026</b> a reimbursement record associated with an employee. For example, an administrator of expense management system <b>16</b> may review <b>1024</b> an approved request for reimbursement submitted by employee <b>42</b> and create <b>1026</b> a reimbursement record within the employee record associated with employee <b>42</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the reimbursement record includes the information needed to make payments to a service provider account associated with employee <b>42</b>, for example, but not limited to, an amount and frequency of payment, a service provider master account identifier, and/or a service provider account identifier. In the exemplary embodiment, the service provider master account identifier corresponds to a service provider, for example, service provider <b>30</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Furthermore, in the exemplary embodiment, the service provider account identifier corresponds to an individual employee's account with service provider <b>30</b>. In other words, each service provider account is a sub-account of a service provider master account. In order to enable an option for direct employee payment to be exercised, the reimbursement record will also contain employee account information if payments are to be made electronically to employee <b>42</b> or address and other information that may be necessary if payments are to be made to employee <b>42</b> by check.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the exemplary embodiment, expense management system <b>16</b> will request approval of payments, and make payments to service providers, associated with employees who have a reimbursement record included within their employee records, or make payments directly to employees who have a reimbursement record included within their employee records, and with respect to whom the direct employee payment option has been exercised. More specifically, once a reimbursement record associated with employee <b>42</b> is created, expense management system <b>16</b> will submit an invoice to employer <b>20</b> on a periodic basis that includes the payment requested by employee <b>42</b> in the approved request for reimbursement. For example, expense management system <b>16</b> may submit an invoice to employer <b>20</b> once every month requesting approval of the payment requested by employee <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">To facilitate reviewing <b>1024</b> approved requests for reimbursement, expense management system <b>16</b> may provide <b>1010</b> the administrator with an &#x201c;administrator review&#x201d; webpage. For example, the administrator may access <b>1030</b> a list of reimbursement requests through the &#x201c;administrator review&#x201d; webpage. Furthermore, the administrator may access <b>1032</b> the approved reimbursement requests through the &#x201c;administrator review&#x201d; webpage. In the exemplary embodiment, reviewing <b>1024</b> includes reviewing <b>1036</b> the employee identifier, device identifier, name of the service provider, service provider account identifier, and/or other information included within the request for reimbursement.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the exemplary embodiment, to create <b>1026</b> a reimbursement record, the administrator is provided <b>1040</b> with access to a &#x201c;manage employees&#x201d; webpage. For example, to create <b>1026</b> the reimbursement record, the administrator adds the reimbursement record to the employee record associated with employee <b>42</b>. More specifically, to create <b>1026</b> the reimbursement record, the administrator selects <b>1042</b> employee <b>42</b> and a device associated with employee <b>42</b> that has been registered in the reimbursement program and adds the device identifier associated with the device and/or the service provider account identifier associated with the device, to the reimbursement record. The administrator also selects <b>1044</b> a reimbursement level that employee <b>42</b> is eligible to have reimbursed. This level may be determined <b>430</b> as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. The administrator also selects <b>1044</b> a service provider master account identifier corresponding to the service provider employee <b>42</b> named as the service provider associated with the device. For example, employee <b>42</b> may indicate in the request for reimbursement that they have an employee-liable service provider account with Service Provider A. The administrator selects <b>1044</b> the service provider master account identifier predefined as corresponding to Service Provider A within expense management system <b>16</b> and it is included within the reimbursement record. Typically, in an invoice generated by a service provider, the service provider provides a service provider identifier used for recordkeeping and to aid in submission of payments to the service provider. However, as is described further below, expense management system <b>16</b> does not have access to the invoices associated with employee-liable devices. To facilitate generating invoices, and associated records, expense management <b>16</b> assigns a predefined master account identifier to each service provider included in reimbursement requests from employees of employer <b>20</b>. Although described above as a manual data entry process performed by the administrator, creating <b>1026</b> the reimbursement record may be performed automatically by expense management system <b>16</b>. Alternatively, if the option has been selected for employee <b>42</b> to be reimbursed directly, the administrator selects <b>1044</b> an employee account identifier associated with an employee account which employee <b>42</b> has designated for receipt of reimbursement payments.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Once the administrator enters the information necessary to create the reimbursement record within the employee record, the administrator selects <b>1046</b> an &#x201c;approve reimbursement&#x201d; option and the reimbursement record is created. The reimbursement records may be reviewed <b>1048</b> and/or a notification may be transmitted <b>1050</b> to employee <b>42</b> indicating that the reimbursement record has been created.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a flow chart <b>1080</b> of an exemplary method for distributing <b>434</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) payments to employee-liable service provider accounts or employee accounts, in the case of direct employee reimbursement. As described above, employee <b>42</b> is liable for expenses related to services provided to employee <b>42</b> by service provider <b>30</b>. Employee <b>42</b> has registered with service provider <b>30</b> and has been assigned a service provider account, identified by a first service provider account identifier, to track payments made to the service provider and amounts owed to the service provider for services rendered. Similarly, second employee <b>44</b> has registered with service provider <b>32</b> and has been assigned a service provider account, identified by a second service provider account identifier. Furthermore, third employee <b>46</b> has registered with service provider <b>34</b> and has been assigned a service provider account, identified by a third service provider account identifier. Moreover, as described above, typically a first plurality of employees will be party to contracts with service provider <b>30</b>, a second plurality of employees will be party to contracts with service provider <b>32</b>, and a third plurality of employees will be party to contracts with service provider <b>34</b>. Each of the employees included within first, second, and third plurality of employees will be assigned a service provider account and associated service provider account identifier. These service provider account identifiers allow expense management system <b>16</b> to apply reimbursement amounts to the intended account with each service provider. Alternatively, each of the employees for whom a direct payment option applies, will provide an employee account and an employee account identifier. These employee account identifiers will likewise enable expense management system <b>16</b> to apply reimbursement amounts with the intended employee account associated with each employee.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the exemplary embodiment, distributing <b>434</b> payments to employee-liable service provider accounts includes generating <b>1100</b> an invoice. Since the expenses reimbursed using expense management system <b>16</b> are employee-liable expenses, invoices detailing amounts owed to the service provider for services rendered are provided to the employee that is liable for the expenses. For example, service provider <b>30</b> will not send an invoice to expense manager <b>14</b> or employer <b>20</b> that details amounts owed by employee <b>42</b>, since, it is employee <b>42</b> who is liable for the amount owed to service provider <b>30</b>. Therefore, in order for expense manager <b>14</b> to obtain approval of payments made associated with the employee-liable reimbursement program, and for employer <b>20</b> to have detailed records of payments made associated with the program, expense management system <b>16</b> generates <b>1100</b> an invoice. Typically, an invoice is generated by the party who is owed a payment, however, to facilitate payments to the service providers, without having access to the invoices issued by the service providers, expense management system <b>16</b> generates <b>1100</b> invoices of amounts and payments that will be made as part of the program, rather than amounts actually owed to the service providers.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the exemplary embodiment, expense management system <b>16</b> generates <b>1100</b> the invoice based on the reimbursement records included within the employee records (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> for creation of the reimbursement records). As described above, once a manager approves a reimbursement request from an employee, an administrator creates a reimbursement record within the employee's record. Expense management system <b>16</b> accesses the reimbursement records and generates <b>1100</b> the invoice. The invoice may be a single invoice that includes all payments scheduled for payment within a predefined time period, for example, the upcoming month, associated with approved reimbursement requests.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the exemplary embodiment, the invoice is provided <b>1102</b> to employer <b>20</b> in an electronic format, for example, expense management system <b>16</b> may provide <b>1102</b> employer <b>20</b> with access to a webpage. The webpage may provide <b>1102</b> employer <b>20</b> with options on how to organize the data included within the invoice. For example, employer <b>20</b> may be able to organize the invoice to view expenses associated with a specific service provider master account identifier or employee account identifier. More specifically, employer <b>20</b> may be able to view and approve a total amount that expense management system <b>16</b> is to pay to all the service providers or employees over the predefined time period or employer <b>20</b> may be able to view and approve individual amounts that expense management system <b>16</b> is to pay to first service provider <b>30</b>, second service provider <b>32</b>, and/or third service provider <b>34</b>, and/or to employee <b>42</b>, employee <b>44</b>, and/or employee <b>46</b>. Although described as a single invoice, the customization of the invoice provided by expense management system <b>16</b> allows employer <b>20</b> to request and receive multiple invoices that include a more detailed description of the amounts to be paid by expense management system <b>16</b> and to analyze the reimbursement program data in a number of ways. Employer <b>20</b> may also be able to organize the invoice to view expenses associated with each individual employee having a service provider account or employee account that is scheduled to receive funds within the predefined time period pending approval by employer <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Furthermore, expense management system <b>16</b> may provide other data associated with the reimbursement program to employer <b>20</b>. For example, expense management system <b>16</b> may provide data to employer <b>20</b> that identifies a portion of the payment amount included in the invoice that is associated with a specific cost center within employer <b>20</b>. Expense management system <b>16</b> may also provide data to employer <b>20</b> that identifies a portion of the payment amount that is associated with a specific geographic location of the employees. The data provided by expense management system <b>16</b> may include any other types of data that facilitate analysis of spending by employer <b>20</b> associated with the reimbursement program.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The data associated with the reimbursement program that is provided to employer <b>20</b> may be provided in the form of a report. In the exemplary embodiment, expense management system <b>16</b> stores data associated with the reimbursement program and accesses the data to generate historical reports. Types of reports may include, but are not limited to: a report detailing payment information and payment history for an individual enrolled in the reimbursement program; a report detailing payments made to a single service provider over a selectable time period; an IRU inventory report detailing all IRU devices, the employee associated with each of the IRU devices, the geographical location of the employee, the cost center associated with the employee, the service provider providing service to the employee, and a phone number associated with each of the IRU devices; and a report detailing corporate spending by service provider and/or personal spending by service provider. These reports may be customized by employer <b>20</b> and/or employee <b>42</b>, for example, to show a historical spending trend over a selectable time period.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Moreover, in the exemplary embodiment, expense management system <b>16</b> provides <b>1102</b> the invoice and/or other data to employer <b>20</b> in a predefined format that is compatible with record-keeping software utilized by employer <b>20</b>. For example, the format may allow software of employer <b>20</b> to import records included within the invoice to a general ledger of employer <b>20</b>. Furthermore, the format may be the same format used to process invoices received that are associated with employer-liable devices. For example, employer <b>20</b> may receive an invoice, in a first format, from service provider <b>30</b> that includes amounts owed for use of employer-liable devices. In another example, employer <b>20</b> may receive invoices, in a first format, from expense management system <b>16</b> for amounts owed for use of employer-liable devices (i.e., expense management system <b>16</b> may also manage payments to service providers associated with employer-liable devices). Also providing the employee-liable reimbursement program invoice in the first format improves integration of the employee-liable reimbursement program into the day-to-day recordkeeping of employer <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In at least one embodiment, expense management system <b>16</b> provides <b>1102</b> the invoice to employer <b>20</b> in a predefined format that is compatible with record-keeping software utilized by employer <b>20</b> and provides <b>1102</b> other data to employer <b>20</b> using a web-based interface. For example, expense management system <b>16</b> may provide <b>1102</b> employer <b>20</b> with access to a webpage. The webpage may provide <b>1102</b> employer <b>20</b> with options on how to organize the data stored by expense management system <b>16</b> associated with employer <b>20</b>. For example, employer <b>20</b> may be able to organize the data to create the reports described above.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the exemplary embodiment, expense management system <b>16</b> receives <b>1104</b> approval of at least a portion the invoice from employer <b>20</b>. For example, employer <b>20</b> may approve all payments included within the invoice provided <b>1102</b> by expense management system <b>16</b>. Alternatively, employer <b>20</b> may approve some of the payments included within the invoice. Once expense management system <b>16</b> receives <b>1104</b> approval of at least a portion of the invoice from employer <b>20</b>, expense management system <b>16</b> automatically requests funds from employer <b>20</b> to cover the approved payments.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the exemplary embodiment, expense management system <b>16</b> also electronically transfers <b>1106</b> funds from an employer associated account to the service providers associated with the approved payments, and/or to employees receiving direct reimbursement. More specifically, expense management system <b>16</b> electronically transfers <b>1106</b> funds to the service provider accounts associated with the approved employees, and/or to the employee accounts associated with the approved employees. As described above, when approved, a reimbursement record is included within an employee record. The reimbursement record includes the data necessary for expense management system <b>16</b> to direct payments to the service provider accounts associated with the approved employees, including a service provider account identifier. For example, expense management system <b>16</b> may provide a payment associated with first employee <b>42</b> to first service provider <b>30</b>, a payment associated with second employee <b>44</b> to second service provider <b>32</b>, and a payment associated with third employee <b>46</b> to third service provider <b>34</b>. Furthermore, when a plurality of employees enrolled in the reimbursement program have service provider accounts with first service provider <b>30</b>, expense management system <b>16</b> may provide a single payment to first service provider <b>30</b>, with instructions how to allocate that payment (e.g., a list of service provider accounts in which to apply the funds, and an amount associated with each service provider account on the list). The transfer <b>1106</b> of funds includes transfers made under a direct payment option to employee accounts associated with approved employees. In the exemplary embodiment, expense management system <b>16</b> electronically transfers <b>1106</b> funds using ACH/CTX payment transactions.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the exemplary embodiment, a plurality of employees, for example, employees <b>40</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) are enrolled <b>422</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) in the employee-liable expense reimbursement program offered by their employer, for example, employer <b>20</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Requests for reimbursement submitted by employees <b>40</b> are processed <b>432</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) by expense management system <b>16</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Approval, by employer <b>20</b>, of the requests for reimbursement, prompts expense management system <b>16</b>, or alternatively, an administrator associated with expense manager <b>14</b>, to create <b>1026</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>) a reimbursement record. Expense management system <b>16</b> periodically generates <b>1100</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>) an invoice based on the reimbursement records. For example, expense management system <b>16</b> may generate <b>1100</b> an invoice, once each month, for each of the service providers participating in the employee-liable expense reimbursement program (e.g., one invoice per month for each of service providers <b>28</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In at least one example, each invoice includes a total amount to be paid to the corresponding service provider that month.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the exemplary embodiment, expense management system <b>16</b> provides <b>1102</b> the invoice to employer <b>20</b>. For example, the invoice may request approval from employer <b>20</b> of a $30, 425 payment to be made to first service provider <b>30</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Once expense management system <b>16</b> receives <b>1104</b> approval of this payment to first service provider <b>30</b>, expense management system <b>16</b> requests that $30, 425 be funded, by employer <b>20</b>, to a financial account associated with expense manager <b>14</b> within a predefined time period (e.g., two business days). In this example, expense management system <b>16</b> also creates and transmits an ACH transaction for $30, 425 to first service provider <b>30</b>, with CTX transaction details that include instructions for first service provider <b>30</b> as to which sub-accounts to apply the funds, and the amount associated with each sub-account. In other words, the CTX transaction details created by expense management system <b>16</b> appear to first service provider <b>30</b> as if expense management system <b>16</b> is paying one invoice for each of employees <b>40</b> (e.g., possibly hundreds of individual invoices). In response to the ACH/CTX transaction submitted by expense management system <b>16</b>, first service provider <b>30</b> applies a payment credit equal to the amount specified in the ACH/CTX transaction to each employee's personal account (i.e., their service provider account with first service provider <b>30</b>). Any problem applying the funds is communicated by first service provider <b>30</b> to expense management system <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Described herein are exemplary methods and systems for managing payment of employee-liable expenses. An expense management system administers a periodic distribution of payments directly to a service provider, and more specifically, directly to an account with the service provider associated with an employee. Optionally, payments are made directly to employees for employee-liable expenses associated with services provided by the service provider. More specifically, the methods and systems described herein allow administrators to configure various reimbursement levels based on policies developed by an employer. The administrators electronically invite employees to participate in the employer's employee-liable device reimbursement program. Employees are directed through an online questionnaire process for the purposes of determining eligibility, determining reimbursement level, and gaining management approval. The methods and systems described herein facilitate administering a periodic distribution of payments directly to the service providers electronically to approved employee-liable accounts via ACH/CTX payment transactions. The methods and systems described herein also facilitate reporting on the status of payments, what service providers or employees were paid, how much each employee has paid on their behalf, where within the employer each payment is accounted for, and other reporting functions necessary for auditing the validity of the expense. An inventory of devices is provided and a periodic validation of employee reimbursed devices and accounts is performed. An expense manager may electronically request funds from the employer and provide an automated general ledger upload file for recording employee-liable device payments. The systems and methods described herein also match employee-liable device payments to human resource records to ensure payments are made only for valid employees.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The methods and systems described herein facilitate efficient and economical payment of employee-liable expenses.
