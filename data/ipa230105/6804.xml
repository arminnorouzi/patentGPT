One approach to improving coverage range is to distribute tones of a regular resource unit (RU) (herein interchangeably referred to as &#x201c;rRU&#x201d;, &#x201c;regular RU&#x201d; and &#x201c;logical RU&#x201d;) over a wider bandwidth or a large frequency subblock, thereby resulting in interleaved, interlaced or otherwise dRUs and dMRUs to boost transmission power and achieve better coverage range for 6 GHz low-power indoor (LPI) systems. Unlike rRUs in which subcarriers are basically continuous or adjacent to one another, the subcarriers in dRUs are spread over a wider bandwidth and hence the tones are separated apart with different distances therebetween. While BCC interleavers and LDPC tone mappers are used in rRU transmission to achieve diversity gain, how to optimize parameters for BCC interleavers and LDPC tone mappers to achieve better performance or simpler design in dRU/dMRU applications still needs to be defined. This is because of different tone patterns between a rRU and a dRU, as the tones of rRUs are consecutive during transmission while the tones of dRUs/dMRUs are distributed over a wider bandwidth and not consecutive or adjacent with one another as with rRUs. As such, parameters for BCC interleavers and LDPC tone mappers need to be optimized for transmission of dRUs/dMRUs. Therefore, there is a need for a solution for optimization of BCC interleavers and LDPC tone mappers for dRUs and dMRUs in 6 GHZ LPI systems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be limiting in any way.

Specifically, scenario <b>400</b> shows a scenario of tone mapper and frequency mapping for dMRUs under the proposed scheme. For a dMRU (e.g., a distributed MRU78 or MRU132), similar to a regular MRU, a joint tone mapper may be applied in tone/frequency mapping. Under the proposed scheme, inside the frequency mapping functional block, the tones of an MRU may be distributed based on dMRU subcarrier indices shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. That is, a number of tones d<b>1</b>, d<b>2</b>, d<b>3</b>, . . . , dN (with N denoting the number of tones) may be received and processed jointly by the tone mapper to produce tones d&#x2032;<b>1</b>, d&#x2032;<b>2</b>, d&#x2032;<b>3</b>, . . . , d&#x2032;N that are distributed based on corresponding dMRU subcarrier indices. For instance, for dMRU78 (as an aggregate of two RUs, namely RU26 and RU52, with N=78), the first 24 data tones may be distributed using the subcarrier indices of a 26-tone dRU for frequency mapping while the remaining data tones may be distributed using the subcarrier indices of a 52-tone dRU for frequency mapping, with some of the 78 tones being pilot tones.
