For example, individuals often seek to obtain signatures on clothing or music albums from well-known musicians at concerts to commemorate attending those concerts, turning the signed clothing or music albums into unique items. Similarly, individuals often seek to purchase outfits, props, animation stills, and other items that were used to create a movie or television show.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Digital assets can include, for example, images, videos, audio clips, three-dimensional models, and the like. Generally, digital assets are fungible, meaning that any one copy of a given digital asset is interchangeable with any other copy of the same digital asset.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An extended reality (XR) device is a device that displays an environment to a user, for example through a head-mounted display (HMD), glasses, a mobile handset, or other device. The environment is at least partially different from the real-world environment in which the user is located. The user can generally change their view of the environment interactively, for example by tilting or moving the HMD (e.g., by moving the user's head, etc.) or other device. Virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) are examples of XR.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some examples, systems and techniques are described for creating, modifying, tracking, authenticating, and/or transferring non-fungible digital assets associated with a device position.

embodiments of this disclosure are provided below. Some of these aspects and embodiments may be applied independently and some of them may be applied in combination as would be apparent to those of skill in the art. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the application. However, it will be apparent that various embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. The figures and description are not intended to be restrictive.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The ensuing description provides exemplary embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the disclosure. Rather, the ensuing description of the exemplary embodiments will provide those skilled in the art with an enabling description for implementing an exemplary embodiment. It should be understood that various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the spirit and scope of the application as set forth in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Individuals often find it meaningful to own, use, or trade unique or rare physical items related to respected celebrities, activities, or locations. For example, individuals often seek to get their clothing or music albums signed by well-known musicians at concerts to commemorate attending those concerts, turning the signed clothing or music albums into unique items. Similarly, individuals often seek to purchase outfits, props, animation stills, and other items that were used to create a movie or television show.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">A camera is a device that receives light and captures image frames, such as still images or video frames, using an image sensor. The terms &#x201c;image,&#x201d; &#x201c;image frame,&#x201d; and &#x201c;frame&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein. Cameras can be configured with a variety of image capture and image processing settings. The different settings result in images with different appearances. Some camera settings are determined and applied before or during capture of one or more image frames, such as ISO, exposure time, aperture size, f/stop, shutter speed, focus, and gain. For example, settings or parameters can be applied to an image sensor for capturing the one or more image frames. Other camera settings can configure post-processing of one or more image frames, such as alterations to contrast, brightness, saturation, sharpness, levels, curves, or colors. For example, settings or parameters can be applied to a processor (e.g., an image signal processor or ISP) for processing the one or more image frames captured by the image sensor.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Digital assets can include, for example, images or videos captured by a camera, audio clips captured by a microphone, three-dimensional point clouds and/or models from a range sensor, and the like. Generally, digital assets are fungible, meaning that any one copy of a given digital asset is interchangeable with any other copy of the same digital asset.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some examples, systems and techniques are described herein for creating, modifying, tracking, authenticating, and/or transferring non-fungible digital assets associated with a device position. A media device may include sensors, such as image sensors, positioning sensors (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes, inertial measurement units (IMUs), global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers), range sensors (e.g., light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensors, radio detection and ranging (RADAR) sensors, sound detection and ranging (SODAR) sensors, sound navigation and ranging (SONAR) sensors, time-of-flight (ToF) sensors, structured light sensors), microphones, other sensors described herein, or combinations thereof. The media device may capture sensor data using its sensors. The media device may generate and/or obtain media data based on its sensor data. The media data may include the sensor data. In some examples, the media data may include processed and/or modified variants of the sensor data. For example, the media data may include virtual content (e.g., virtual objects) generated for XR output. The media data may include maps generated based on positioning data from positioning sensors. The media data may include high dynamic range (HDR) images generated by merging multiple images.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Positioning data indicating a pose of the media device during capture of the sensor data may be obtained from the media device, for instance from the positioning sensors of the media device and/or based on one or more short-range wireless communications between the media device and a local device. Positioning data indicating the pose of the media device during capture of the sensor data may be obtained from a local device that communicates with the media device using one or more short-range wireless communications. The media device can send the media data to a network device. Based on the positioning data, a network device can verify that the media device was in a predetermined geographic area during capture of the sensor data. The geographic area can be, for example, a museum, a sports venue, a concert venue, and the like. In some cases, the geographic area can be defined by the range of the range of the local device's short-range wireless communications, and verification of the media device's position can be based on verifying that communications transmitted between the media device and the local device were accurately received by the media device and/or the local device. In response to verifying that the media device was in the predetermined geographic area during capture of the sensor data, the network device can generate a token for the media data. The network device can enter the token into a distributed ledger, such as a blockchain ledger, by generating a block with the token in its payload and appending the block to the distributed ledger, or by requesting that a block-generating device generate the block with the token in its payload and appending the block to the distributed ledger. The token may be associated with smart contracts stored in the distributed ledger that control transfer of the token associated with the media data. The network device may in some cases be part of the media device.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some examples, the media device may be an extended reality (XR) device. An XR device is a device that displays an environment to a user, and can include, for example, a head-mounted display (HMD), glasses (e.g., augmented reality (AR) glasses), a mobile handset, or other device. The environment is at least partially different from the real-world environment in which the user and the device are located, and may for instance include virtual content. In some examples, the environment that the XR device displays to the user can be at least partially virtual. In some cases, the user can interactively change their view of the environment that the XR device displays, for example by tilting the XR device and/or or moving the XR device laterally. Tilting the XR device can include tilts or rotations along the pitch axis, the yaw axis, the roll axis, or a combination thereof. Lateral movements of the XR device can include lateral movements along paths charted within a 3-dimensional volume having 3 perpendicular axes, such as an X, a Y axis, and a Z axis. XR devices that only track rotation of the XR device can be referred to XR devices with three degrees of freedom (3DoF). XR devices that track both tilting and lateral movement of the XR device can be referred to XR devices with six degrees of freedom (6DoF). Extended reality (XR) can include virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Generating a token corresponding to the media data and entering the token into a distributed ledger can provide technical advantages over ordinary transfers of images or other digital assets. The token transforms the media data from a fungible state into a non-fungible state, allowing individual copies or instances of the media data to be securely, efficiently, and automatically tracked, owned, transferred, rented, licensed, and the like. Having generation of the token be based on verification that the position of the media device during capture of the sensor data is in the geographic area can provide additional security and verification as to the authenticity that a representation of an object, environment, or individual in the media data is authentic.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Various aspects of the application will be described with respect to the figures. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an architecture of an image capture and processing system <b>100</b>. The image capture and processing system <b>100</b> includes various components that are used to capture and process images of scenes (e.g., an image of a scene <b>110</b>). The image capture and processing system <b>100</b> can capture standalone images (or photographs) and/or can capture videos that include multiple images (or video frames) in a particular sequence.

For example, based on the focus setting, the focus control mechanism <b>125</b>B can move the lens <b>115</b> closer to the image sensor <b>130</b> or farther from the image sensor <b>130</b> by actuating a motor or servo, thereby adjusting focus. In some cases, additional lenses may be included in the system <b>100</b>, such as one or more microlenses over each photodiode of the image sensor <b>130</b>, which each bend the light received from the lens <b>115</b> toward the corresponding photodiode before the light reaches the photodiode. The focus setting may be determined via contrast detection autofocus (CDAF), phase detection autofocus (PDAF), or some combination thereof. The focus setting may be determined using the control mechanism <b>120</b>, the image sensor <b>130</b>, and/or the image processor <b>150</b>. The focus setting may be referred to as an image capture setting and/or an image processing setting.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The exposure control mechanism <b>125</b>A of the control mechanisms <b>120</b> can obtain an exposure setting. In some cases, the exposure control mechanism <b>125</b>A stores the exposure setting in a memory register. Based on this exposure setting, the exposure control mechanism <b>125</b>A can control a size of the aperture (e.g., aperture size or f/stop), a duration of time for which the aperture is open (e.g., exposure time or shutter speed), a sensitivity of the image sensor <b>130</b> (e.g., ISO speed or film speed), analog gain applied by the image sensor <b>130</b>, or any combination thereof. The exposure setting may be referred to as an image capture setting and/or an image processing setting.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The zoom control mechanism <b>125</b>C of the control mechanisms <b>120</b> can obtain a zoom setting. In some examples, the zoom control mechanism <b>125</b>C stores the zoom setting in a memory register. Based on the zoom setting, the zoom control mechanism <b>125</b>C can control a focal length of an assembly of lens elements (lens assembly) that includes the lens <b>115</b> and one or more additional lenses. For example, the zoom control mechanism <b>125</b>C can control the focal length of the lens assembly by actuating one or more motors or servos to move one or more of the lenses relative to one another. The zoom setting may be referred to as an image capture setting and/or an image processing setting. In some examples, the lens assembly may include a parfocal zoom lens or a varifocal zoom lens. In some examples, the lens assembly may include a focusing lens (which can be lens <b>115</b> in some cases) that receives the light from the scene <b>110</b> first, with the light then passing through an afocal zoom system between the focusing lens (e.g., lens <b>115</b>) and the image sensor <b>130</b> before the light reaches the image sensor <b>130</b>. The afocal zoom system may, in some cases, include two positive (e.g., converging, convex) lenses of equal or similar focal length (e.g., within a threshold difference) with a negative (e.g., diverging, concave) lens between them. In some cases, the zoom control mechanism <b>125</b>C moves one or more of the lenses in the afocal zoom system, such as the negative lens and one or both of the positive lenses.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The image sensor <b>130</b> includes one or more arrays of photodiodes or other photosensitive elements. Each photodiode measures an amount of light that eventually corresponds to a particular pixel in the image produced by the image sensor <b>130</b>. In some cases, different photodiodes may be covered by different color filters, and may thus measure light matching the color of the filter covering the photodiode. For instance, Bayer color filters include red color filters, blue color filters, and green color filters, with each pixel of the image generated based on red light data from at least one photodiode covered in a red color filter, blue light data from at least one photodiode covered in a blue color filter, and green light data from at least one photodiode covered in a green color filter. Other types of color filters may use yellow, magenta, and/or cyan (also referred to as &#x201c;emerald&#x201d;) color filters instead of or in addition to red, blue, and/or green color filters. Some image sensors may lack color filters altogether, and may instead use different photodiodes throughout the pixel array (in some cases vertically stacked). The different photodiodes throughout the pixel array can have different spectral sensitivity curves, therefore responding to different wavelengths of light. Monochrome image sensors may also lack color filters and therefore lack color depth.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some cases, the image sensor <b>130</b> may alternately or additionally include opaque and/or reflective masks that block light from reaching certain photodiodes, or portions of certain photodiodes, at certain times and/or from certain angles, which may be used for phase detection autofocus (PDAF). The image sensor <b>130</b> may also include an analog gain amplifier to amplify the analog signals output by the photodiodes and/or an analog to digital converter (ADC) to convert the analog signals output of the photodiodes (and/or amplified by the analog gain amplifier) into digital signals.

In some examples, other devices in the distributed network may also verify that the pose of the media device <b>205</b> is in the geographic area (block <b>290</b>), may verify that the token is proper, verifying that the block is proper (e.g., the Merkle root accurately reflects the payload and the hash accurately reflects the prior block), or a combination thereof. Generating the block and verifying that the block is proper may be followed by appending the block to the distributed ledger <b>295</b>, and sending the block to other devices in the distributed network to append the block to all copies of the distributed ledger <b>295</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In some examples, verification that the pose of the media device <b>205</b> is in the geographic area (block <b>290</b>) may also include receipt of recorded audio information recorded by one or more microphones of the media device <b>205</b>, and comparison of the recorded audio information to trusted audio information known to be from the geographic area. In some examples, the trusted audio information may be recorded by one or more microphones of the local device <b>270</b>. In some examples, the trusted audio information may be generated by and/or output by one or more speakers of the local device <b>270</b>.

Thus, it may be more efficient to store this media off-chain in one or more off-chain locations, such as the data structures <b>650</b>. The on-chain pointer can include a uniform resource identifier (URI), such as a uniform resource locator (URL), that points to the one or more network locations of the one or more off-chain locations. In some examples, hashes can be stored of the off-chain media, so that a verifying device can compute a hash of the off-chain media and compare the computed hash to the stored hash that is stored on-chain to verify that the off-chain media is accurate. In some examples, the off-chain media may be immutable. In some examples, the off-chain media may be mutable. In some examples, the pointer may be immutable.

While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> discusses use of a blockchain ledger <b>500</b>, it should be understood that a non-linear ledger structure, such as the directed acyclic graph (DAG) ledger structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, may be used instead of or in addition to the blockchain ledger <b>500</b> discussed herein. The term &#x201c;distributed ledger&#x201d; as used herein should be understood to refer to at least one of a blockchain ledger <b>500</b> (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), a DAG ledger <b>700</b> (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), or a combination thereof. In a DAG ledger, each block header includes the hashes of blocks, or block headers, of a predetermined number of other &#x201c;parent&#x201d; blocks in the DAG ledger selected either at random or in some other non-linear manner, rather than the hash of a single previous block in the blockchain. Where each block header includes multiple hashes corresponding to different parent blocks or their headers, these hashes can be combined together (e.g., using a Merkle root).</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">For example, in the DAG ledger of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the predetermined number is two, at least after the first two blocks are generated. In the web DAG ledger of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the parent blocks are indicated using arrows. Block <b>710</b> includes hashes of the block headers of parent blocks <b>720</b> and <b>750</b>. Block <b>720</b> includes hashes of the block headers of parent blocks <b>740</b> and <b>760</b>.

The resulting structure is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of blocks, where each vertex block includes a hash of its parent vertex block(s), rather than a linear stream of blocks as in a blockchain. A DAG ledger may sometimes be referred to as a &#x201c;web,&#x201d; a &#x201c;tangle,&#x201d; or a &#x201c;hashgraph.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">In some examples, the number of parent blocks of a given block in a DAG ledger is not predetermined, but there may be a predetermined minimum number of parent blocks, such as a two-parent minimum or a one-parent minimum, meaning that each block has at least the predetermined minimum number of parent blocks. In some cases, each block in a DAG ledger may only identify only a single payload element (e.g., a token <b>600</b>) rather than multiple payload elements, and may therefore forego a Merkle root <b>520</b>/<b>350</b>/<b>380</b> of payload elements and/or replace it with a hash of the single payload element. In other implementations, each block may identify multiple payload elements associated with a predetermined time period, and/or may include a Merkle root <b>520</b>/<b>350</b>/<b>380</b> of the payload elements. In some examples, DAG ledgers <b>700</b> may provide benefits over blockchain ledgers <b>500</b> by providing parallelized validation, which may provide higher throughput.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is a perspective diagram <b>800</b> illustrating a user <b>805</b> using a media device <b>810</b> to capture a digital asset <b>840</b> (an image) of a portrait in a museum.
