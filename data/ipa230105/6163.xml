level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a light-emitting device including a layer containing an organic compound as a light-emitting layer, and a manufacturing method for the light-emitting device. For example, the present invention relates to an electronic device in which a light-emitting display device having an organic light-emitting element is mounted as a component.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Note that in this specification, a semiconductor device refers to all devices that can function by utilizing semiconductor characteristics, and electro-optic devices such as light-emitting devices, semiconductor circuits, and electronic devices are all semiconductor devices.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A light-emitting element using an organic compound as a light-emitting body, which has features such as thinness, lightness, high-speed response, and DC drive at a low voltage, has been examined to be applied to a next-generation flat panel display or next-generation lighting. In particular, a display device in which light-emitting elements are arranged in matrix is considered to have advantages in a wide viewing angle and excellent visibility over a conventional liquid crystal display device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A light-emitting mechanism of a light-emitting element is thought as follows: when voltage is applied between a pair of electrodes with an EL layer interposed therebetween, electrons injected from a cathode and holes injected from an anode are recombined at emission centers in the EL layer to form molecular excitons, and the molecular excitons release energy and emit light when relax to the ground state. Singlet excitation and triplet excitation are known as excited states, and it is considered that light emission can probably be achieved through either of the excited states.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An EL layer included in a light-emitting element has at least a light-emitting layer. In addition, the EL layer can have a stacked-layer structure including a hole-injection layer, a hole-transport layer, an electron-transport layer, an electron-injection layer, or the like, in addition to the light-emitting layer.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, as a material having semiconductor characteristics, metal oxides attracts attention.

However, in the case where the channel length (L) is shortened, there is a problem of switching characteristics, for example, an on/off ratio becomes small. In addition, when the channel width (W) is increased, there is a problem in that the capacity load of a thin film transistor itself is increased.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0014">Therefore, an object of the present invention is also to provide a light-emitting device including a thin film transistor having stable electric characteristics even when the channel length is short.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0015">In addition, when a plurality of circuits which are different from each other is formed over an insulating surface, for example, when a pixel portion and a driving circuit portion are formed over one substrate, excellent switching characteristics such as a high on/off ratio are needed for a thin film transistor used for the pixel portion, while high operation speed is needed for a thin film transistor used for the driving circuit portion.

In order to obtain an i-type (intrinsic) oxide semiconductor layer, it is effective to perform a dehydration or dehydrogenation process.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0040">In the case where heat treatment is performed in an atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen or a rare gas (for example, argon or helium), the oxide semiconductor layer is changed into an oxygen-deficient oxide semiconductor layer by the heat treatment. Thus, a low-resistant oxide semiconductor layer, that is, an n-type (such as n<sup>&#x2212;</sup>-type) oxide semiconductor layer is formed. Then, the oxide semiconductor layer is brought into an oxygen-excess state by formation of an oxide insulating film which is in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer and heat treatment after the formation of the oxide insulating film, so that a high-resistance oxide semiconductor layer, that is, an i-type oxide semiconductor layer is formed. This process can also be referred to as solid phase oxidation by which the oxide semiconductor layer is placed in an oxygen-excess state. In this manner, a light-emitting device including a thin film transistor having high electric characteristics and high reliability can be manufactured and provided.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0041">For dehydration or dehydrogenation, heat treatment is performed in an inert gas atmosphere of nitrogen or a rare gas (such as argon or helium) at a temperature of 400&#xb0; C. to 750&#xb0; C., preferably 420&#xb0; C. to 570&#xb0; C., so that impurities such as moisture included in the oxide semiconductor layer are reduced. Further, water (H<sub>2</sub>O) can be prevented from entering again in the oxide semiconductor layer later.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0042">The heat treatment for dehydration or dehydrogenation is preferably performed in a nitrogen atmosphere with an H<sub>2</sub>O concentration of 20 ppm or lower. Alternatively, the heat treatment may be performed in ultra-dry air with an H<sub>2</sub>O concentration of 20 ppm or lower.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0043">The oxide semiconductor layer is subjected to heat treatment for dehydration or dehydrogenation under a condition that two peaks of water or at least one peak of water at around 300&#xb0; C. is not detected even if TDS is performed at up to 450&#xb0; C. on the oxide semiconductor layer after being subjected to dehydration or dehydrogenation.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0044">Therefore, even if TDS is performed at up to 450&#xb0; C. on a thin film transistor including an oxide semiconductor layer subjected to dehydration or dehydrogenation, at least the peak of water at around 300&#xb0; C. is not detected.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0045">In addition, when the temperature is lowered from a heating temperature T at which dehydration or dehydrogenation is performed, it is important to prevent the dehydrated or dehydrogenated oxide semiconductor layers from being exposed to air by continuously using a furnace in which dehydration or dehydrogenation is performed, so that water or hydrogen is prevented from entering the oxide semiconductor layers. A thin film transistor is formed using an oxide semiconductor layer obtained by changing an oxide semiconductor layer into a low-resistant oxide semiconductor layer, that is, an n-type (such as n<sup>&#x2212;</sup>-type) oxide semiconductor layer by dehydration or dehydrogenation, and then by changing the low-resistant oxide semiconductor layer into a high-resistant oxide semiconductor layer so as to be an i-type semiconductor layer. In that case, the threshold voltage (Vth) of the thin film transistor can be positive value, so that a so-called normally-off switching element can be realized. It is desirable for a semiconductor device (a light-emitting device) that a channel be formed with a threshold voltage that is a positive value and as close to 0 V as possible. If the threshold voltage of the thin film transistor is negative, the thin film transistor tends to be a so-called normally on, in other words, a current flows between the source electrode and the drain electrode even when the gate voltage is 0 V. In an active matrix display device, the electric characteristics of a thin film transistor included in a circuit are important and significantly affect the performance of the display device. A threshold voltage value is specifically important in the electric characteristics of a thin film transistor. In the case where a positive value of the threshold voltage is high or the threshold voltage is a negative value even when the field-effect mobility is high, it is difficult to control the circuit. Further, in the case of a thin film transistor having a large absolute value of the threshold voltage, the thin film transistor cannot perform switching function at low driving voltage and may be a load. In the case of an n-channel thin film transistor, it is desirable that a channel be formed and a drain current begins to flow only when the positive voltage is applied to a gate. It is unsuitable for a thin film transistor used in a circuit that a channel is not formed unless driving voltage is raised and a channel is formed and a drain current begins to flow even in a negative voltage state.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0046">Furthermore, the gas atmosphere in which the temperature is lowered from the heat temperature T may be switched to a gas atmosphere which is different from the gas atmosphere in which the temperature is raised to the heat temperature T. For example, cooling is performed while the furnace used for dehydration or dehydrogenation is filled with a high-purity oxygen gas, a high-purity N<sub>2</sub>O gas, or an ultra-dry air (with a dew point of &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. or lower, preferably &#x2212;60&#xb0; C. or lower) without exposure to the air.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0047">By using an oxide semiconductor film cooled slowly (or cooled) in an atmosphere that does not contain moisture (with a dew point of &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. or lower, preferably &#x2212;60&#xb0; C. or lower) after moisture contained in the film is reduced by heat treatment for dehydration or dehydrogenation, the electric characteristics of a thin film transistor are improved and high-performance thin film transistors that can be mass-produced are realized.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0048">In this specification, heat treatment in an inert gas atmosphere of nitrogen or a rare gas (such as argon or helium) is referred to as heat treatment for dehydration or dehydrogenation.

In addition, a region overlapping with the source electrode layer is formed as a high-resistance source region (also referred to as an HRS region) which is an oxygen-deficient region.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0051">Specifically, the carrier concentration of the high-resistance drain region is 1&#xd7;10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or higher and is at least higher than the carrier concentration of the channel formation region (less than 1&#xd7;10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>). Note that the carrier concentration in this specification refers to a value of carrier concentration obtained by Hall effect measurement at room temperature.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0052">The channel formation region is formed by placing at least a part of the dehydrated or dehydrogenated oxide semiconductor layer in an oxygen-excess state to have higher resistance, that is, to become an i-type region. Note that as the treatment for placing the dehydrated or dehydrogenated oxide semiconductor layer in an oxygen-excess state, the following treatment is given: formation of an oxide insulating film which is in contact with the dehydrated or dehydrogenated oxide semiconductor layer by a sputtering method; heat treatment or heat treatment in an atmosphere including oxygen, or cooling treatment in an oxygen atmosphere or ultra-dry air (having a dew point of &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. or lower, preferably &#x2212;60&#xb0; C. or lower) after heat treatment in an inert gas atmosphere, after the deposition of the oxide insulating film; or the like.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0053">Further, in order to use at least a part (a portion overlapping with a gate electrode layer) of the dehydrated or dehydrogenated oxide semiconductor layer as the channel formation region, the oxide semiconductor layer may be selectively made to be in an oxygen-excess state so as to be a high-resistance oxide semiconductor layer, that is, an i-type oxide semiconductor layer. The channel formation region can be formed in the following manner: a source electrode layer and a drain electrode layer formed using metal electrodes of Ti or the like are formed on and in contact with the dehydrated or dehydrogenated oxide semiconductor layer and exposure regions that do not overlap with the source electrode layer and the drain electrode layer are selectively made to be in an oxygen-excess state. When the exposure regions are selectively made to be in an oxygen-excess state, a first high-resistance source region overlapping with the source electrode layer and a second high-resistance drain region overlapping with the drain electrode layer are formed, and a region between the first high-resistance source region and the second high-resistance drain region serves as the channel formation region. That is, a channel length of the channel formation region is formed between the source electrode layer and the drain electrode layer in a self-aligned manner.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0054">In this manner, a light-emitting device including a thin film transistor having high electric characteristics and high reliability can be manufactured and provided.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0055">Note that by forming the high-resistance drain region in the oxide semiconductor layer overlapping with the drain electrode layer, the reliability can be improved when a driving circuit is formed. Specifically, by forming the high-resistance drain region, the conductivity can vary stepwise from the drain electrode layer to the high-resistance drain region and the channel formation region. Therefore, in the case where the thin film transistor operates with the drain electrode layer connected to a wiring for supplying a high power supply potential VDD, the high-resistance drain region serves as a buffer and a high electric field is not applied locally even if a high electric field is applied between the gate electrode layer and the drain electrode layer, so that the withstand voltage of the thin film transistor can be improved.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0056">In addition, the high-resistance drain region and the high-resistance source region are formed in the oxide semiconductor layer overlapping with the drain electrode layer and the source electrode layer, respectively, whereby reduction in leakage current can be achieved in the channel formation region when forming the driving circuit. In particular, by forming the high-resistance drain region, leakage current flowing between the drain electrode layer and the source electrode layer of the transistor flows through the drain electrode layer, the high-resistance drain region on the drain electrode layer side, the channel formation region, the high-resistance source region on the source electrode layer side, and the source electrode layer in this order. At this time, in the channel formation region, leakage current flowing from the high-resistance drain region on the drain electrode layer side to the channel formation region can be concentrated on the vicinity of an interface between the channel formation region and a gate insulating layer which has high resistance when the transistor is off. Thus, the amount of leakage current in a back channel portion (a part of a surface of the channel formation region, which is apart from the gate electrode layer) can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0057">Further, the high-resistance source region overlapping with the source electrode layer and the high-resistance drain region overlapping with the drain electrode layer, although depending on the width of the gate electrode layer, overlap with each other with a part of the gate electrode layer and the gate insulating layer interposed therebetween, and the intensity of an electric field in the vicinity of an end portion of the drain electrode layer can be reduced more effectively.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0058">Furthermore, an oxide conductive layer may be formed between the oxide semiconductor layer and the source and drain electrodes. The oxide conductive layer preferably contains zinc oxide as a component and preferably does not contain indium oxide. For example, zinc oxide, zinc aluminum oxide, zinc aluminum oxynitride, or gallium zinc oxide can be used. The oxide conductive layer also functions as a low-resistance drain region (LRD, also referred to as an LRN (low-resistance n-type conductivity) region). Specifically, the carrier concentration of the low-resistance drain region is higher than that of the high-resistance drain region (the HRD region) and preferably in a range of 1&#xd7;10<sup>20</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 1&#xd7;10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. Provision of the oxide conductive layer between the oxide semiconductor layer and the source and drain electrodes can reduce contact resistance and realizes higher speed operation of the transistor.

Note that a pulse direct current (DC) power supply is preferable because dust can be reduced and the film thickness can be uniform. The In&#x2014;Ga&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;O-based non-single-crystal film is formed to have a thickness of 5 nm to 200 nm.

An RF sputtering method is mainly used in the case of forming an insulating film, and a DC sputtering method is mainly used in the case of forming a metal film.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0117">Further, there is a multi-source sputtering apparatus in which a plurality of targets of different materials can be set.

A resist mask <b>137</b> is formed over the oxide semiconductor film <b>130</b>, and unnecessary portions of the oxide semiconductor film <b>130</b> and the gate insulating layer <b>102</b> are removed by etching to form a contact hole <b>119</b> reaching the first terminal <b>121</b> and a contact hole <b>123</b> reaching the conductive layer <b>162</b> in the gate insulating layer <b>102</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0121" num="0121">Thus, when the contact holes are formed in the gate insulating layer <b>102</b> while the oxide semiconductor film <b>130</b> is formed over the entire surface of the gate insulating layer <b>102</b>, the resist mask is not in direct contact with the surface of the gate insulating layer <b>102</b>; accordingly, contamination of the surface of the gate insulating layer <b>102</b> (e.g., attachment of impurities or the like to the gate insulating layer <b>102</b>) can be prevented. Thus, a favorable state of the interface between the gate insulating layer <b>102</b> and the oxide semiconductor film <b>130</b> can be obtained, leading to improvement in reliability.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0122">Alternatively, a resist pattern may be formed directly on the gate insulating layer, and then contact holes may be formed. In such a case, heat treatment is preferably performed to dehydrate or dehydrogenate the surface of the gate insulating film after removal of the resist. For example, impurities such as hydrogen and water included in the gate insulating layer may be removed by heat treatment (at 400&#xb0; C. to 750&#xb0; C.) under an inert gas (e.g., nitrogen, helium, neon, or argon) atmosphere or an oxygen atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0123">Next, the resist mask <b>137</b> is removed.

Alternatively, the resist masks <b>135</b><i>a </i>and <b>135</b><i>b </i>used for forming the island-shaped oxide semiconductor layers may be formed by an ink-jet method. When the resist masks are formed by an ink-jet method, a photomask is not used, leading to reduction in manufacturing cost.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0124">Next, the oxide semiconductor layers <b>131</b> and <b>132</b> are subjected to dehydration or dehydrogenation, so that dehydrated or dehydrogenated oxide semiconductor layers <b>133</b> and <b>134</b> are formed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). The temperature of first heat treatment at which dehydration or dehydrogenation is performed is 400&#xb0; C. to 750&#xb0; C., preferably 425&#xb0; C. or higher. Note that in the case where the temperature of the first heat treatment is 425&#xb0; C. or higher, the heat treatment time may be one hour or less, while in the case where the temperature of the first heat treatment is lower than 425&#xb0; C., the heat treatment time is set to more than one hour. Here, the substrate is introduced into an electric furnace which is one example of heat treatment apparatuses, and the oxide semiconductor layers are subjected to heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere. Then, the oxide semiconductor layers are not exposed to air so as to prevent water and hydrogen from entering the oxide semiconductor layers again. In this manner, the oxide semiconductor layers <b>133</b> and <b>134</b> are formed. In this embodiment, slow cooling is performed from the heating temperature T at which the oxide semiconductor layers are dehydrated or dehydrogenated to a temperature low enough to prevent water from entering again. Specifically, slow cooling is performed to a temperature that is lower than the heating temperature T by 100&#xb0; C. or more, in a nitrogen atmosphere in one furnace. Without limitation to a nitrogen atmosphere, dehydration or dehydrogenation may be performed in a rare gas atmosphere such as helium, neon, or argon.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0125">When the oxide semiconductor layers are subjected to heat treatment at 400&#xb0; C. to 700&#xb0; C., the dehydration or dehydrogenation of the oxide semiconductor layers can be achieved; thus, water (H<sub>2</sub>O) can be prevented from being contained again in the oxide semiconductor layers in later steps.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0126">Note that the heat treatment apparatus is not limited to the electric furnace, and for example, an RTA (rapid thermal annealing) apparatus such as a GRTA (gas rapid thermal annealing) apparatus or an LRTA (lamp rapid thermal annealing) apparatus can be used. An LRTA apparatus is an apparatus for heating an object to be processed by radiation of light (an electromagnetic wave) emitted from a lamp such as a halogen lamp, a metal halide lamp, a xenon arc lamp, a carbon arc lamp, a high-pressure sodium lamp, or a high-pressure mercury lamp. In addition, the LRTA apparatus may be provided with not only a lamp but also a device which heats an object to be processed by heat conduction or heat radiation from a heater such as a resistance heater. GRTA is a method of heat treatment using a high-temperature gas. As the gas, an inert gas which does not react with an object to be processed by heat treatment, for example, nitrogen or a rare gas such as argon, is used.

Further, depending on the conditions of the first heat treatment and the material of the oxide semiconductor layers, the oxide semiconductor layers may become amorphous oxide semiconductor layers containing no crystalline component. Furthermore, in some cases, the oxide semiconductor film became an amorphous oxide film in which a microcrystal portion (the grain size of the microcrystal portion is 1 nm to 20 nm (typically, 2 nm to 4 nm)) is mixed.

By formation of the silicon oxide film by a sputtering method, an excessive amount of oxygen can be contained in the silicon oxide film, and oxygen can enter the oxide semiconductor layers and can be diffused thereinto through the heat treatment. Oxygen enters the oxide semiconductor layers and is diffused thereinto, whereby the channel region can have higher resistance (such as i-type conductivity).

In addition, this heat treatment may be performed before formation of the oxide insulating film under a reduced pressure. Under the reduced pressure, the heat treatment time can be shortened. With such heat treatment, hydrogen is introduced from the oxide semiconductor layers to the oxide insulating layer; thus, normally-off thin film transistors can be obtained.

In addition, the LRTA apparatus may be provided with not only a lamp but also a device which heats an object to be processed by heat conduction or heat radiation from a heater such as a resistance heater. GRTA is a method of heat treatment using a high-temperature gas. As the gas, an inert gas which does not react with an object to be processed by heat treatment, for example, nitrogen or a rare gas such as argon, is used.

For example, a fluorescent compound which exhibits fluorescence or a phosphorescent compound which exhibits phosphorescence can be used. In addition, as the second electrode layer <b>195</b>, a material with a low work function is used.

A channel formation region is provided between the drain region and the source region and current can flow through the drain region, the channel region, and the source region. Here, since the source and the drain of the thin film transistor may change depending on the structure, the operating condition, and the like of the thin film transistor, it is difficult to define which is a source or a drain. Therefore, a region functioning as a source or a drain is not called a source or a drain in some cases. In such a case, for example, one of the source and the drain may be referred to as a first terminal and the other thereof may be referred to as a second terminal.</p><p id="p-0463" num="0463">Note that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, a capacitor for performing bootstrap operation by setting the node A floating may be additionally provided.

Then, the first terminal of the first transistor <b>31</b>, that is, the terminal on the power supply line <b>51</b> side, comes to serve as a source of the first transistor <b>31</b>. Therefore, in the first transistor <b>31</b>, a high bias voltage is applied and thus significant stress is applied between the gate and the source and between the gate and the drain, which might cause deterioration in the transistor. Thus, with the ninth transistor <b>39</b> whose gate electrode is supplied with the second power supply potential VCC, the potential of the node A is raised by bootstrap operation, but at the same time, an increase in the potential of the second terminal of the first transistor <b>31</b> can be prevented. In other words, with the ninth transistor <b>39</b>, the level of a negative bias voltage applied between the gate and the source of the first transistor <b>31</b> can be lowered. Accordingly, with a circuit structure in this embodiment, a negative bias voltage applied between the gate and the source of the first transistor <b>31</b> can be lowered, so that deterioration in the first transistor <b>31</b>, which is due to stress, can be further restrained.</p><p id="p-0467" num="0467">Note that the ninth transistor <b>39</b> is provided so that the first terminal and the second terminal of the ninth transistor <b>39</b> are connected between the second terminal of the first transistor <b>31</b> and the gate of the third transistor <b>33</b>. In the case where a shift register includes a plurality of pulse output circuits of this embodiment, the ninth transistor <b>39</b> may be eliminated in a signal line driving circuit which has more stages than a scan line driving circuit, which is advantageous in reducing the number of the transistors.</p><p id="p-0468" num="0468">When an oxide semiconductor is used for each of the semiconductor layers of the first to thirteenth transistors <b>31</b> to <b>43</b>, the amount of off current of the thin film transistors can be reduced, the amount of on current and field-effect mobility can be increased, and the rate of deterioration can be decreased, whereby malfunctions of the circuit can be reduced. Further, a transistor including an oxide semiconductor has a lower rate of deterioration of the transistor due to application of a high potential to a gate electrode, as compared to a transistor including amorphous silicon. Therefore, even when the first power supply potential VDD is supplied to the power supply line to which the second power supply potential VCC is supplied, similar operation can be performed and the number of power supply lines provided between the circuits can be reduced, whereby size reduction in a circuit can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0469" num="0469">Note that a similar effect is obtained even when a connection relation is changed so that a clock signal which is supplied to the gate electrodes (the lower gate electrode and the upper gate electrode) of the seventh transistor <b>37</b> through the third input terminal <b>23</b> is a clock signal which is supplied to the gate electrodes (the lower gate electrode and the upper electrode) of the seventh transistor <b>37</b> through the second input terminal <b>22</b>; and a clock signal which is supplied to the gate electrodes (the lower gate electrode and the upper gate electrode) of the eighth transistor <b>38</b> through the second input terminal <b>22</b> is a clock signal which is supplied to the gate electrodes (the lower electrode and the upper electrode) of the eighth transistor <b>38</b> through the third input terminal <b>23</b>.
