Pressure sensitive hot melt adhesives are tacky at room temperature and are useful in a wide variety of applications, such as for tape and label, rigid or flexible packaging, nonwoven hygiene articles, paper products, automotive and other transportation application, and appliances. In most of these applications, the hot melt adhesive is heated to its molten state and then applied to a substrate, often named as the primary substrate. For preparation of a tape or label, often only a primary substrate is used. In other applications, a second substrate, often named as the secondary substrate, is then immediately brought into contact with and compressed against the first. The adhesive solidifies on cooling to form a strong bond. A major advantage of hot melt adhesives is the absence of a liquid carrier, as would be the case of water or solvent based adhesives, thereby eliminating the costly process associated with water or solvent removal.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Over the years, adhesive formulators have utilized a variety of different polymers as well as other additives in their formulations to obtain a balance of these attributes (adhesion, creep resistance, flexibility, and heat environmental resistance). These polymers include, but are not limited to, polyolefins (ethylene- or propene-based polymers), functionalized polyolefins (ethylene or propene copolymers with oxygen containing monomers), or APAOs (ethylene-, propene-, or butene copolymers). Some of these polymers are crystalline and can lead to adhesives which exhibit blocking. Blocking is defined as the undesired adhesion of a coated adhesive to substrates it comes into contact with during shipping and/or storage.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) polymers, other polymers have also been utilized in an attempt to improve an adhesive's hot tack and adhesion characteristics. These polymers include, but are not limited to, random copolymers of ethylene methyl acrylate copolymers (EMA), ethylene n-butyl acrylate (EnBA), and ethylene methyl acrylate acrylic acid copolymers. These polymers exhibit narrower poly-dispersity when compared to olefin polymers, such as APAO and have lower overall melt peaks as observed by DSC (Differential Scanning calorimetry). This results in an adhesive that is prone to blocking or bond failure at elevated temperatures if not reinforced with some other crystalline additive. While the incorporation of certain waxes or other crystalline additives can increase the elevated temperature resistance of the adhesive, they can reduce the adhesive's hot tack, adhesion, and flexibility.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Hot melt adhesives typically comprise a polymer, a plasticizer, a tackifying resin, and an antioxidant package. Other ingredients, such as waxes, fillers, colorants, and UV absorbers, can also be used to modify the adhesive properties or to provide special attributes. These ingredients are prone to heat degradation under the coating conditions of the adhesive. For example, a widely used commercial hot melt adhesive based on styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) triblock copolymer, when subjected to 175&#xb0; C. for 24 hours, can suffer from a viscosity drop of about 50 percent from its original value. A styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) based hot melt may cause problems by crosslinking under similar conditions. Crosslinking can result in a dramatic increase in viscosity and may eventually render the adhesive un-flowable by the formation of a three dimensional polymer network. The viscosity change is often accompanied by charring, gelling, and formation of skin on top of the molten material. The degradation will inevitably lead to deterioration of the adhesive properties and performance. In addition, this degradation can also lead to equipment damage. The rate of degradation is temperature dependent; the higher the temperature, the faster the degradation. Thus, reducing the coating temperature of the adhesive can slow down degradation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hot melt adhesives may be applied to a substrate in a number of ways, such as by directly coating. Besides directly coating, several indirect or noncontact coating methods, through which a hot melt adhesive can be spray coated with the aid of compressed air onto a substrate from a distance, are also developed. These non-contact coating techniques include conventional spiral spray and various forms of melt-blown methods. Indirect coating methods, however, require that the viscosity of the adhesives must be sufficiently low, usually in the range of 2,000 to 30,000 mPa s, preferably in the range of 2,000 to 15,000 mPa s, at the application temperature in order to obtain an acceptable coating pattern. Many other physical factors, especially the rheological properties of the adhesive, come into play in determining the sprayability of a hot melt. The majority of commercial hot melt products do not lend themselves to spray applications. There are no accepted theoretical models or guidelines to predict sprayability, which must be determined empirically with application equipment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There remains a need in the art to develop a hot melt a pressure sensitive adhesive which performs comparably to styrene block copolymer adhesives, but provides an alternative polymer source. In addition, there remains a further need in the art to develop a hot melt pressure sensitive adhesive which performs comparably to polyolefin-based hot melt adhesives for pressure sensitive applications but does not experience a drop in tack with time.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the needs in the art outlined above and according to an embodiment of the invention, a hot melt pressure sensitive adhesive composition comprises: (a) a block copolymer comprising a first polymer block comprising an ethylene residue and a second polymer block comprising a C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>4 </sub>alkyl acrylate residue, wherein the block copolymer has a melt index as measured in accordance with ASTM D1238 of between about 0.1 and about 250 g/10 min, preferably between about 0.1 and about 200 g/10 min, more preferably between about 0.5 and about 100 g/10 min, and most preferably between about 1 and about 50 g/10 min; (b) a tackifying resin; and (c) a plasticizer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another embodiment of the invention, a method for making a laminate comprises the steps of: applying the hot melt pressure sensitive adhesive composition of the invention in a molten state to a primary substrate; and allowing the adhesive to cool to form a bond with said primary substrate.

Such adhesives appear to show better compatibility among the ingredients of the adhesive. This is surprising in view of the fact that the alkyl acrylate block is present to a lesser extent in the block copolymer than the ethylene block. Such adhesives have shown better high temperature resistance; they have a higher shear adhesive failure temperature. In this embodiment, the tackifier comprises a rosin ester. More particularly, the tackifier may have resin acids and rosin acids and esters, along with pentaerythritol. Such tackifiers are commercially available as Sylvalite RE 100L from Kraton Corporation. In this embodiment, the plasticizer is generally polar and has a polarity similar to the polarity of the second polymer block. In this embodiment, the plasticizer may comprise a benzoate ester (or dibenzoates). The plasticizer might consist solely of pure benzoate esters or could be primarily made of benzoate esters. The plasticizer could be or include di(propylene glycol) dibenzoate. Alternatively, the plasticizer could be or include a mixture of di(propylene glycol) dibenzoate and di(ethylene glycol) dibenzoate. Exemplary plasticizers in this embodiment include Benzoflex 9-88 and Benzoflex 50, commercially available from Eastman Chemical Company.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0024">The hot melt pressure sensitive adhesive of the present invention may also include a stabilizer or an antioxidant in an amount of from about 0.1% to about 5% by weight of the adhesive composition. Preferably, from about 0.1% to 2% of a stabilizer or antioxidant is incorporated into the composition. The stabilizers which are useful in the hot melt pressure sensitive adhesive compositions of the present invention are incorporated to help protect the polymers noted above, and thereby the total adhesive system, from the effects of thermal and oxidative degradation which normally occur during the manufacture and application of the adhesive as well as in the ordinary exposure of the final product to the ambient environment. Among the applicable stabilizers are hindered phenols and multifunction phenols, such as sulfur and phosphorous-containing phenols. Antioxidants, such as hindered amine phenols, may be characterized as phenolic compounds that also contain bulky radicals in close proximity to the phenolic hydroxyl group thereof and are preferred. In particular, tertiary butyl groups generally are substituted onto the benzene ring in at least one of the ortho positions relative to the phenolic hydroxyl group. The presence of these sterically bulky substituted radicals in the vicinity of the hydroxyl group serves to retard its stretching frequency and correspondingly, its reactivity; this steric hindrance thus provides the phenolic compound with its stabilizing properties.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0025">It should be understood that other optional, auxiliary additives may be incorporated into the adhesive composition of the present invention in order to modify particular physical properties.
