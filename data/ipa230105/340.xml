This allows to easily distinguish reflection values originating from the anterior part of the eye and from the retina, i.e. to isolate the reflection values ri from the retina. The reflection value ri depends on the eye's transmission properties along the respective A-scan at location xi, yi, which allows to obtain a spatially resolved indication how well the eye transmits light along the probe beam of A-scan i.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0011">This information can be used for determining a large number of different parameters. Some examples include:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0012">The parameter can be descriptive of at least one aspect of the point-spread-function PSF of the eye. For example, the method can comprise the step of determining, using the reflection values ri, a one- or two-dimensional representation of the point-spread-function, and/or it may deliver a characteristic of the same, such as its half-width along one or more directions.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0013">The parameter can be descriptive of absorbing and/or scattering structures in the anterior segment of the eye. For example, the method can comprise the step of determining, using the reflection values ri, the location and/or spatial extent, in particular the location along xi and/or yi, of absorbing and/or scattering structures in the anterior segment of the eye, e.g. by representing the reflection values ri as an image in xi-yi-space.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0014">Advantageously, the plurality of A-scans includes a first plurality of A-scans, advantageously at least 10 A-scans, in particular at least 100 A-scans, having parallel directions of incidence. In other words, the A-scans differ by their locations xi, yi but not by the direction of the light beams outside the eye as it impinges on the cornea. This allows to record the eye's transmission properties for light coming from a given direction. Further, for an eye accommodated to infinity, all such A-scans will substantially be incident on a common location of the retina, thereby providing better robustness of the measurement against spatially varying retina reflection.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0015">In particular, the &#x201c;parallel direction of incidence&#x201d; may be parallel to the eye's visual axis, which allows to record the transmission properties along the patient's natural viewing direction.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0016">In this context, &#x201c;parallel&#x201d; advantageously is understood to encompass a parallelism within 5&#xb0;, in particular within 1&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0017">Advantageously, the A-scans include a plurality of A-scans, advantageously at least 10 A-scans, in particular at least 100 A-scans, that do not overlap at a cornea of the eye. In other words, these A-scans enter the eye at different locations xi, yi, allowing to record information with good spatial resolution.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0018">In this context, advantageously, two A-scans do not overlap if their center distances on the cornea are larger than their half-width-diameter. The &#x201c;half-width-diameter&#x201d; is the diameter, in the x-y-plane perpendicular to the direction of the A-scan outside the eye, over which the intensity of the light used for the A-scan drops by 50%.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0019">In another important embodiment, the probe beams of at least part of the A-scans are focused onto an anterior part of the eye, i.e. the probe beams have their minimum diameter in this anterior part. This allows to spatially resolve scattering or structures in that part of the eye.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0020">In this context, an A-scan is advantageously considered to be focused at an anterior part of the eye if the minimum diameter of its probe beam is located somewhere within 1 mm before the cornea and 5 mm behind the eye's lens.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0021">Alternatively or in addition thereto, the focus may, for at least part of the probe beams, also be located between the posterior surface of the eye's lens and the retina. This may be useful to e.g. detect vitreous floaters.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0022">In one embodiment, the invention comprises the step of displaying the reflection values ri as a function of the locations xi, yi. Hence, an image is displayed representing the reflection value ri as a function of xi and yi. For example, the image can comprise pixels, where the pixel coordinates are mapped to the coordinates xi, yi and the pixel color and/or brightness is a function of the reflection value ri. Such an image allows to locate the regions where light rays are poorly transmitted through the eye, e.g. due to scattering and/or absorption.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0023">This e.g. allows to locate absorbing structures in the anterior section of the eye. Again, the anterior section of the eye may e.g. be a section between the cornea and a location 5 mm behind the eye's lens.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0024">To achieve good lateral resolution for absorbing or scattering structures in the vitreous, it is advantageous to place the focus between the posterior lens surface and the retina.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0025">In another embodiment, the invention comprises a Fourier analysis of the dataset ri(xi, yi). This Fourier analysis comprises at least the following steps:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0026">Performing a Fourier transform on a dataset based on the reflection values ri: This dataset can e.g. be the dataset ri(xi, yi), with the Fourier transform carried at along at least one dimension of the xi-yi-space. It may e.g. also be ri(&#x3b8;xi, &#x3b8;yi), with &#x3b8;xi and &#x3b8;yi being the horizontal and vertical angles of the direction of propagation at the posterior side of the lens, in respect to the eye's optical or visual axis, of the probe beam entering the eye at xi, yi.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0027">Deriving said at least one parameter from the result of the Fourier transform: For example, the result can be the Fourier components, which describe the point-spread-function of the eye along at least one direction, or it can be a parameter derived from the Fourier components, such as a width (e.g. the half-width) or a contrast (e.g. ratio of peak amplitude and noise floor) of the PSF in at least one direction.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0022" num="0028">Advantageously, a two-dimensional Fourier transform is used, which allows to assess the PSF (or a parameter thereof) in two dimensions.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0029">Alternatively or in addition to using the Fourier transform, ray tracing may be used for calculating the PSF, which allows to take into account the eye's refractive structures and in particular their aberrations, as they can e.g. be determined by means of the OCT measurements.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0030">The method may further comprise at least one of the following steps:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0031">Determining the axial length of the eye between the pupil and the retina from the A-scans by means of optical coherence tomography: This data can be easily derived from the A-scans.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0032">Determining the diameter of the pupil: This data can also be easily derived from the A-scans or by means of a calibrated microscope.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0025" num="0033">Further the data from the A-scans may be used to extract the topology of at least one structure of the eye. This structure may e.g. be at least one of the following:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0034">the cornea,</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0035">the iris,</li>        <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0036">the anterior surface of the lens, and/or</li>        <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0037">the posterior surface of the lens.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0026" num="0038">In that case, the method can further include the step of determining the at least one parameter using the reflection values ri and the topology of the structure, e.g. using ray tracing calculus.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0039">The invention also relates to an ophthalmologic device comprising<ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0040">An optical coherence tomography interferometer: This OCT interferometer is used to record the A-scans.</li>        <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0041">A control unit structured and adapted to carry out the method described herein: This control unit is provided with suitable software and hardware for carrying out the steps of the invention.

Light impinging on mirror <b>18</b> is sent back into beam splitter <b>12</b> and from there, at least in part, to a light detector <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0057">The second arm is the sample arm <b>16</b>. It comprises collimation optics <b>22</b> for collimating the probe light coming from beam splitter <b>12</b>. The light is then fed through two scanner mirrors <b>24</b><i>a, </i><b>24</b><i>b </i>and an objective lens <b>26</b> for generating a probe beam <b>28</b>. Depending on the position of the scanner mirrors <b>24</b><i>a, </i><b>24</b><i>b, </i>probe beam <b>28</b> can be laterally offset in an x-y-plane perpendicular to the optical axis z of the device.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0058">In the present embodiment, an interferometer generating telecentric probe beams <b>28</b> is used, i.e. the probe beams <b>28</b> for various x- and y-coordinates (such as beam <b>28</b> and beam <b>28</b>&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) are parallel to each other. This can be realized by placing the pivot point of the scanning system approximately at the back focal plane of lens <b>26</b>. A telecentric scan geometry simplifies the analysis in the context of the techniques described below.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0059">In the shown embodiment, the probe beams are shown to be focused on the anterior surface of the cornea, but they may also be focused on any other part of the eye <b>30</b> that is of particular interest. For the reasons mentioned above, the probe beams are advantageously focused on the anterior segment of the eye.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0060">The focusing optics, e.g. the position and/or the power of lenses <b>22</b> and/or <b>26</b>, may be adjustable to vary the position of the focus along the z-direction.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0061">Probe beam <b>28</b> enters eye <b>30</b>, where it is reflected or scattered by the structures of the eye.

For each such A-scan i, probe beam <b>28</b> is brought to a desired xi- and yi-position by means of the scanner mirrors <b>24</b><i>a, </i><b>24</b><i>b. </i>Then, the central wavelength of light source <b>10</b> is tuned over a given wavelength range, which wavelength range is typically much broader than the spectral width of the light from light source <b>10</b>. The light at light detector <b>20</b> is measured as a function of the central wavelength.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0063">Spectral analysis, in particular a Fourier transform, of the signal from detector <b>20</b> can then be used for generating the reflection values of eye <b>30</b> along axis z for the given A-scan. Reflection values are meant to relate to reflected and scattered light as described above. As customary in OCT imaging, reflection values might be represented by values proportional to the reflected intensity or by values proportional to a logarithm of the reflected intensity or e.g. by other range-compressed values. In more general terms, a &#x201c;reflection value&#x201d; is indicative of the amount of light returned from a certain position along an A-scan. Advantageously, it may be linear to the amount of light or a logarithm thereof or any other function thereof.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0064">This type of OCT measurement is known to the skilled person, and it is e.g. described in EP 3572765 and the references cited therein.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0065">The device further comprises a control unit <b>32</b>, which may e.g. be provided with a microprocessor <b>34</b><i>a </i>and with a memory <b>34</b><i>b </i>as well as with a display <b>34</b><i>c. </i>Memory <b>34</b><i>b </i>may hold the data as well as the program instructions required for carrying out the steps of the present method.
