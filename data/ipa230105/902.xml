The present invention also relates to air circulation systems, both large and small scale, featuring gaseous nitric oxide.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Background Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">2019-new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection (COVID-19) is highly contagious and responsible for thousands of casualties world-wide. Because it is highly contagious, efforts to prevent its spread appear to be largely ineffective. The progression of infection begins with an extended period of mild symptoms typical of a viral respiratory infection. However, approximately 20% of patients with the viral infection develop Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), accompanied with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients succumbing to this infection all experience this progression to SARS. While therapies which are efficacious against SARS (or the related Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) that it initiates), a method of treating a patient with a therapeutic to prevent the development of SARS is highly desirable. There is an urgent need for a broadly deployed therapeutic effective against the development of SARS from a coronavirus infection.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Gaseous nitric oxide (NO) has been tried as a means of treating a number of respiratory indications, but often with little success because it has been difficult to determine correct dosing schedules and reconcile dosing with toxicology outcomes to enable the use of high (and effective) doses.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">From the toxicological aspect, NO has a half-life in the body of less than 6 seconds and a radius of action of approximately 200 microns from its site of origin, beyond which it is inactivated through binding to sulfhydryl groups of cellular thiols or by nitrosylation of the heme moieties of hemoglobin to form methemoglobin (MetHb). MetHb reductase reduces NO to nitrates in the blood serum. Nitrate has been identified as the predominant nitric oxide metabolite excreted in the urine, accounting for more than 70% of the nitric oxide dose inhaled. Nitrate is cleared from the plasma by the kidney at rates approaching the rate of glomerular filtration. Blood levels of MetHb in healthy humans are typically less than 2%.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Potential side effects of high dose NO treatment hence include the binding of NO to hemoglobin and the formation of MetHb, which could lead to decreased oxygen transport, and the capacity of NO to act as a nitrosylating agent on proteins and other cell constituents. Acute pulmonary injury, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, changes in surface tension of surfactant, reduced alveolar numbers, and airway responsiveness are associated with high airway levels of NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, and other oxides of nitrogen. Thus, concerns have been raised regarding the potential use of NO as a therapeutic agent in various clinical scenarios.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Without wishing to limit the present invention to any theory or mechanism, it is believed that the methods of the present invention can help prevent the coronavirus infection from developing into SARS. Notably, certain prior art methods that have attempted treatment of coronavirus with NO therapy have not been very effective. Such methods have focused on patients already experiencing SARS due to their coronavirus infection. At this stage of infection, the major complication is the Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) caused by the viral infection rather than the virus itself. While stopping further infection at this point is expected to be beneficial, it may not be sufficient to solve that patient's current problem, which is the CRS. Indeed, the prior art reflects that NO (at currently accepted administered doses) has been evaluated for ARDS and found to be not sufficiently effective. In addition, prior art methods use low levels of NO gas, which may not be sufficient.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Certain aspects of the disclosure relate to methods for the treatment of an infection, for the prevention of worsening of symptoms associated with the infection, and for ameliorating symptoms associated with the infection.

The present invention provides methods for minimizing the interaction between O<sub>2 </sub>and NO, e.g., so that maximum NO could be delivered to the infected cells.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">For example, the methods provide alternating breath cycles, e.g., a NO-loaded breath and followed by an O<sub>2</sub>-loaded breath. O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations of the O<sub>2</sub>-loaded breath may be, for example, from 20-100%, e.g., 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 100% (balanced with N<sub>2 </sub>or ambient air, etc.). The NO-loaded breath may be mixed with O<sub>2</sub>, e.g., the NO may be mixed with oxygen, e.g., 0-100%, e.g., 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, etc.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">Alternating breath cycles may involve repeated cycles of one breath of NO followed by one breath of O<sub>2</sub>. However, the present invention also encompasses variations thereof, such as repeated cycles of one breath of NO followed by two breaths of O<sub>2</sub>, two breaths of NO followed by one breath of O<sub>2</sub>, one breath of NO followed by three breaths of O<sub>2</sub>, one breath of O<sub>2 </sub>followed by two breaths of NO, two breaths of O<sub>2 </sub>followed by one breath of NO, one breath of O<sub>2 </sub>followed by three breaths of NO, etc.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">The patient may be equipped with separate NO and O<sub>2 </sub>lines, e.g., one O<sub>2 </sub>line to the nose and one NO line to the mouth, or vice versa. As an example, the NO line to the mouth may feature NO (e.g., 100-300 ppm) with a low level of oxygen (e.g., 20%), and the oxygen line to the nose may feature an oxygen concentration of 80%. Table 1 below shows non-limiting examples of embodiments of the present invention, wherein a particular gas mixture is delivered to the nose, and a particular gas mixture is delivered to the mouth.

For example, mechanisms for switching of ventilation may be achieved with assist control (AC), synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV), etc.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0234">The present invention also provides the use of different carrier gasses.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0235">INOMAX (nitric oxide gas) is a drug administered by inhalation. The INOMAX formulation is a gaseous blend of nitric oxide and nitrogen (0.08% and 99.92%, respectively for 800 ppm). Gaseous NO is supplied in aluminum cylinders as a compressed gas under high pressure (2000 pounds per square inch gauge [psig]). Exemplary devices for blending NO gas with room air and or oxygen, for example the INOBLENDER allows users to select a concentration of NO gas to be mixed into a user set flow of oxygen which is delivered to a patient. When the device is used with an oxygen/air blender, specifications can be set to deliver NO with 100% oxygen. In particular, the use of 100% oxygen at 3.4 bar (50 psig) is the labeled specification for the INOBLENDER device. A user may determine that some clinical conditions may necessitate the use of an oxygen/air blender with the device to achieve FiO2 levels less than 100%. Using oxygen/air mixtures (21% to 95% v/v) will reduce the delivered NO concentration by up to 10% of setting or 1 ppm (whichever is greater) compared to using 100% oxygen alone, resulting in a cumulative error up to +/&#x2212;30% of setting or 3 ppm (whichever is greater).</p><p id="p-0238" num="0236">The present invention describes the use of Argon as a larger constituent of the makeup gas compared to N<sub>2</sub>. Ambient air comprises about 1% Ar. The methods herein feature the use of higher levels of Ar, e.g., 2% Ar, which may help decrease NO to NOx conversions by oxygen.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0237">Another carrier gas may include helium (see, for example, Gentile, M., 2011 Respiratory Care 56:1341-1359). Heliox (a mixture of helium and oxygen) has been reported to be effective in a variety of respiratory conditions such as upper-airway obstruction, status asthmaticus, decompression sickness, post-extubation stridor, bronchiolitis, and ARDS.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0238">reducing the work of breathing (WOB). Heliox converts areas of extreme turbulence and makes these areas less turbulent. Additionally, Heliox converts some areas of turbulence to areas of more efficient laminar flow. Thus, Heliox improves the efficiency of gas flow through narrowed orifices.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0239">Other carrier gasses may include carbon dioxide (see Curosurf below) and low levels of Carbon Monoxide (e.g., up to 1000 ppm)</p><p id="p-0242" num="0240">The present invention also includes NOx scrubbing. NOx scrubbing features a filter that scrubs the NOx species out of the gas line just before being inhaled by the patient. Non-limiting examples of NOx scrubbing compositions include alkali salts like KOH pellets. The scrubbing compositions and methods may be incorporated as an in-line device added to the gas delivery tube.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0241">The present invention also provides methods for enhancing the uptake of NO. Because NO is lipophilic, entry into solution is not optimal for biological systems. The present invention provides methods for enhancing solubility/entry of NO into the cells, for example by combining NO with a nebulized treatment of a NO gas transmission facilitator.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0242">Non-limiting examples of NO gas transmission facilitators (that area administered via inhalation) include perfluron, fluosol, perfluorinated hydrocarbons, pulmonary surfactants (e.g., lipoprotein complexes formed by type II alveolar cells, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), phosphatidylcholine, surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, SP-D), colfosceril palmitate, pumactant, KL-4, venticute, lucinactant, beractant, calfactant, poractant alfa (Curosurf), etc.), etc. For example, nebulized perflubon is a synthetic surfactant having mucolytic properties. In certain embodiments, the perflubron-based formulation may be emulsified with lecithin (e.g., as the only surfactant). In certain embodiments, the perflubron-based formulation has a median particle diameter of &#x2dc;0.17 pm. Fluosol is an oxygen-carrying emulsion comprising two perfluorochemicals (perfluorodecalin and perfluorotripropylamine).</p><p id="p-0245" num="0243">The present invention also includes combination therapies, wherein NO gas is combined with one or a combination of other therapeutic agents (e.g., antiviral agent, etc.) or therapeutic treatments. Agents or treatments may be administered via any appropriate mechanism, such as local administration via inhalation, systemic administration, etc. Non-limiting examples of other therapeutic agents that may be combined with NO gas includes: antiviral drugs (e.g., remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, duranavir/cobicistat, umifenovir, etc.), an antibody or antibodies (e.g., monoclonal antibodies, antibody cocktails, etc.), chloroquine, amodiquine, bevacizumab, alpha-interferon, a corticosteroid (e.g., dexamethasone, methylprednisolone), the like, combinations thereof, etc. Secondary therapeutic agents may be administered as appropriate, e.g., via inhalation, systemic, etc.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading><p id="p-0246" num="0244">The following is a non-limiting example of proposed clinical endpoints for a clinical trial.
