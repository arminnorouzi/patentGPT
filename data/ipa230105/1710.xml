id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2021-109088, filed on Jun. 30, 2021, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a printer, a control method, and a non-transitory computer readable medium storing a control program.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A printer is known that performs gloss printing using photocurable ink. The gloss printing is a printing method that creates a glossy printed object, by smoothing a layer of the photocurable ink formed on an object to be printed. For example, in the known printer, a color ink head, a clear ink head, a plurality of color LEDs, and a plurality of white/clear LEDs are provided on a carriage. The color ink head and the clear ink head are aligned with each other in a sub-scanning direction, and respectively eject photocurable color ink and photocurable clear ink onto the object to be printed. The plurality of color LEDs are arranged in the plurality thereof on both sides of the color ink head in a main scanning direction, and irradiate light onto the object to be printed. The plurality of white/clear LEDs are arranged in the plurality thereof on both sides of the clear ink head in the main scanning direction, and irradiate light onto the object to be printed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At the time of the gloss printing, the printer ejects the color ink from the color ink head onto the object to be printed and causes the plurality of color LEDs to be illuminated, while moving the carriage in the main scanning direction. The printer ejects the clear ink from the clear ink head onto the object to be printed and causes the plurality of clear LEDs to be illuminated. The printer conveys the object to be printed in a direction from the color ink head toward the clear ink head in the sub-scanning direction. By repeating these operations, the printer forms a layer of color ink on the object to be printed, and forms a layer of clear ink on the layer of color ink.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">At the time of the gloss printing, in order to secure a time from when the clear ink layer is formed on the object to be printed to when the smoothing is performed, the above-described printer causes only the white/clear LEDs furthermost upstream in a progress direction of the carriage in the main scanning direction to be illuminated, of the plurality of white/clear LEDs.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Note that, in the above-described printer, when the clear ink layer is not formed on the color ink layer, for example, it is conceivable to perform the gloss printing by smoothing the color ink layer. In this case also, in a similar manner to the white/clear LEDs, in order to secure a time from when the color ink layer is formed on the object to be printed to when the smoothing is performed, it is conceivable that the printer causes only the color LEDs furthermost upstream in the progress direction of the carriage in the main scanning direction to be illuminated, of the plurality of color LEDs.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">When performing these modes of the gloss printing, in a first scan, depending on how the ink is cured at a boundary between a region, of the ink layers of the clear ink, the color ink, and the like, that is irradiated with the light and a region that is not yet irradiated, there is a case in which a striped pattern occurs in the ink layers of the clear ink, the color ink, and the like. As a result, a deterioration in print quality could occur.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a printer, a control method, and a non-transitory computer readable medium storing a computer-readable control program capable of suppressing, in a gloss print mode, the occurrence of a striped pattern in an ink layer and improving print quality.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure a printer includes a platen, a first head, a second head, an illumination device, a processor, and a memory. The platen is configured to have an object to be printed placed thereon. The first head is configured to eject a first ink onto the object to be printed. The first ink is a photocurable ink. The second head is configured to eject a photocurable second ink onto the object to be printed. The illumination device is aligned with the first head and the second head in a main scanning direction, and includes a light source that is configured to irradiate light onto the object to be printed. The memory stores computer-readable instructions that, when executed by the processor, instruct the processor to perform following processes. In a normal print mode, the processor causes the first head, the second head, and the illumination device to move relatively with respect to the platen in the main scanning direction, in a state in which, in a height direction, a distance between the platen and a predetermined position of the illumination device in the height direction is a first distance. The height direction is orthogonal to the main scanning direction. The processor causes one or both of the first head and the second head to eject the ink onto the object to be printed, while the first head, the second head, and the illumination device are moving in the normal print mode. The processor causes the light source to irradiate the light onto the ink ejected onto the object to be printed, while the first head, the second head, and the illumination device are moving in the normal print mode. In a gloss print mode different from the normal print mode, the processor causes the first head, the second head, and the illumination device to move relatively with respect to the platen in the main scanning direction, in a state in which the distance between the platen and the predetermined position in the height direction is a second distance larger than the first distance. The processor causes one or both of the first head and the second head to eject the ink onto the object to be printed while the first head, the second head, and the illumination device are moving in the gloss print mode in the gloss print mode. The processor causes the light source to illuminate the light onto the ink ejected onto the object to be printed in the gloss print mode.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a second aspect of the present disclosure, a control method for controlling a printer including a platen configured to have an object to be printed placed thereon, a first head configured to eject a first ink onto the object to be printed, the first ink being a photocurable ink, a second head configured to eject a photocurable second ink onto the object to be printed, and an illumination device aligned with the first head and the second head in a main scanning direction and including a light source configured to irradiate light onto the object to be printed, includes following steps.

Moving the first head, the second head, and the illumination device relatively with respect to the platen in the main scanning direction in a gloss print mode, in a state in which the distance between the platen and the predetermined position in the height direction is a second distance larger than the first distance.

As a result, the illuminance difference is smaller when the platen <b>5</b> is positioned at the lowered position P<b>2</b> than when the platen <b>5</b> is positioned at the raised position P<b>1</b>. Thus, in the front-rear direction, the difference between the curing speed of the ink layer <b>100</b> at both the end portions of the irradiation region D and the curing speed of the ink layer <b>100</b> at the center portion of the irradiation region D becomes smaller when the platen <b>5</b> is positioned at the lowered position P<b>2</b> compared to when the platen <b>5</b> is positioned at the raised position P<b>1</b>.
