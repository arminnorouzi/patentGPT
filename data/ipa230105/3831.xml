Full Duplex (FD) technologies have a range of applications. For example, Full Duplex (FD) technologies have been approved as an option for the 802.11ax WiFi standard. Of particular interest is the use of Full Duplex (FD) technologies in radars, in particular in weather radars due to the operating environment being relatively static.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A known Full Duplex (FD) weather radar detects weather features (e.g. cloud formations) and comprises two receiver paths, one receiver path for detecting near objects less than a predetermined distance (referred to herein as the near receive path) and another receiver path for detecting objects greater than the predetermined distance (referred to herein as the far receive path). In this known system it is only necessary to implement Full Duplex (FD) communications for the near receive path since signals (e.g. caused by reflections) are received while the transmit pulse is still being transmitted.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A known challenge with Full Duplex (FD) technologies is achieving sufficient cancellation of self-interference. Self-interference arises in Full Duplex (FD) technologies when a high power transmit signal leaks into the receiver path. Achieving sufficient Self-Interference Cancellation (SiC) enables the detection of the desired signal (e.g. a reflection from a distant object), which has a power many orders of magnitude (100+dB) lower than the signal being transmitted.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For weather radars self-interference cancellation of around 158 decibels (dB) is required between transmit and receive paths due to large transmit powers of around 100 Watts (W). Furthermore, some weather radars have even greater transmit powers, in the order of Kilowatts, so higher Self-Interference Cancellation could be required.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One way to achieve Self-Interference Cancellation (SiC) is to use a combination of Radio Frequency (RF) cancellation and digital baseband cancellation. Radio Frequency (RF) cancellation occurs prior to the received signal entering a low noise amplifier (LNA). Radio Frequency (RF) cancellation often involves adjusting the amplitude and phase of the signal being transmitted in order to produce an approximate replica of the self-interference in the analogue domain. This signal is then used to (at least partially) cancel the self-interference present in the received signal. However, self-interference is not the only form of distortion that arises in Full Duplex (FD) systems.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Both the near receive path and the far receive path include limiters to prevent overload and damage to their low noise amplifiers (LNA). Limiters are non-linear components that are often, but not exclusively, implemented using diodes. Limiters often introduce distortion in the received signal. This distortion cannot by cancelled by using Radio Frequency (RF) Self-Interference Cancellation (SiC) because the distortion is not related to the signal that appears in the transmit path (which is subsequently used by the Self-Interference Cancellation filter to generate a cancellation signal).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In light of this there is a need to reduce the effect of limiter distortion in Full Duplex (FD) communication systems.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Arrangements of embodiments will be understood and appreciated more fully from the following detailed description, made by way of example only and taken in conjunction with drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a radar system;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example of a radar transmission signal;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a Full Duplex (FD) radar system;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> shows the effect of distortion on radar pulses;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> shows the effect of distortion on the output of the Self-Interference cancellation circuit;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows simulated results for a radar system with and without Radio Frequency (RF) self-interference cancellation and/or a limiter;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an approach to reducing the effect of limiter distortion in a Full Duplex (FD) radar system;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a Full Duplex (FD) radar system with limiter distortion suppression using a variable impedance according to an example;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> shows a circuit for generating a variable impedance according to an example;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> shows an implementation of the circuit for generating a variable impedance according to an example;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a performance comparison of the radar system according to an example and other known radar systems;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> shows a circuit for generating a variable impedance according to another example; and</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> shows a circuit for generating a variable impedance according to a further example.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a first aspect there is provided a full duplex radio apparatus comprising: a transmit path configured to transmit a first signal; a receive path configured to receive a received signal; a near-receive path for observing a first period of the received signal; a far-receive path for observing a second period of the received signal, the far-receive path comprising a radio frequency limiter; a self-interference cancellation circuit coupled between the transmit path and the near receive path and configured to cancel at least a portion of a self-interference in the received signal; a variable impedance component; and a directional coupler comprising a first port, a second port, a third port, and a fourth port.

The radar system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> comprises a power amplifier <b>101</b> connected to the transmit path of the radar system. The power amplifier is electrically coupled to a circulator <b>102</b>. The circulator <b>102</b> is coupled to an antenna <b>103</b>. As known in the art, a circulator is a passive device that is used to control the direction of signal flow in an electronic circuit. It is common in radar systems for there to be a single antenna for reception and transmission. Consequently, the circulator <b>102</b> is used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to provide isolation between the transmit path and the receive path. The circulator <b>102</b> is also coupled to a Radio Frequency (RF) limiter <b>104</b>. The Radio Frequency (RF) limiter <b>104</b> is coupled to a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) <b>105</b>, the output of which is connected to the receive path of the radar system.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> the Radio Frequency (RF) limiter <b>104</b> is provided to protect the Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) from the power generated during transmission, which can equal 100 Watts. The circulator <b>102</b> typically provides approximately 20 decibels (dB) of isolation between the port connected to the transmit path and the port connected to the receive path. In this case a power of 1 Watt leaks through the circulator <b>102</b> to the input of the Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) <b>105</b>. Furthermore, there can often be a mismatch between the antenna and the transmit path that reflects back part of the transmitted signal. The power of this reflected signal can be of a similar level to the leakage power of the circulator <b>102</b> (i.e. 1 Watt).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example of a radar transmission signal. Radar systems transmit short pulses. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a radar transmission signal <b>201</b> comprising a first pulse <b>202</b> and a second pulse <b>203</b>. It will be appreciated that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is not to scale and is for illustrative purposes only. The pulse width (i.e. the elapsed time between a rising edge and a falling edge of a pulse of energy) is typically of the order of 40 &#x3bc;s. Given the typical transmission frequencies of radar signals, this pulse width is equivalent to a range during which reception is not possible for the first 6 kilometers. Consequently, without sufficient self-interference cancellation it would not be possible to observe objects closer than 6 kilometers because the self-interference from the transmission signal would overpower any reflections from the objections.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The pulse period (i.e. the time between a rising edge of the first pulse <b>202</b> and a rising edge of the second pulse <b>203</b>) is typically 400 &#x3bc;s, to allow detection up to 60 kilometers. The pulses of the transmission signal <b>201</b> have defined rise and fall times. These are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> as linear slopes. Shaping the transmit signal to have a gradual transition ensures the transmitted signal is kept within a spectral emission mask and complies with regulations.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">If reception below 6 kilometers is required, there are three options.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">A first option is to transmit a second shorter pulse on a different frequency. However this approach requires double the frequency resources.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">A second option is to transmit two alternative pulses. A first pulse of a short pulse width for detecting near objects and a second pulse of a longer pulse width to detect far objects. However this approach adds complexity and doubles the imaging time (or halves the imaging rate).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">A third approach is to exploit Full Duplex (FD) techniques. In this case one long pulse can be used for the reception of signals (e.g. reflections) from both near and far objects because the Full Duplex (FD) techniques allow near field signals to be observed during the transmit phase of the radar.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a Full Duplex (FD) radar system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a Full Duplex (FD) radar system that uses a single frequency channel and comprises two receive paths: a near receive path and a far receive path.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In detail, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a power amplifier <b>301</b> electrically coupled to a transmit path of the radar system.
