The first support columns are located in a same plane parallel to the substrate <b>10</b>. The first capacitive structure <b>41</b> may be supported by the plurality of first support columns <b>331</b>, and thus the capacitive structure is prevented from collapsing. In some embodiments, a material of each first support column <b>331</b> includes single-crystal silicon, single-crystal germanium, single-crystal silicon germanium, or Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide (IGZO), so that the first support columns <b>331</b> are sufficient to support the first capacitive structure <b>41</b>. The IGZO is an amorphous oxide containing indium, gallium and zinc, which has desirable carrier migration performance. In this embodiment, the material of the first support columns <b>331</b> may be IGZO, so that the performance of the first capacitive structure <b>41</b> is improved.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The first capacitive structure <b>41</b> includes a first lower electrode layer <b>411</b>, a first dielectric layer <b>412</b> and first upper electrode layers <b>413</b>.

The first dielectric layer <b>412</b> covers the first lower electrode layer <b>411</b>. It can be seen, from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, that, in the first capacitive structure <b>41</b>, a part of the first lower electrode layer <b>411</b> is disposed around the first support columns <b>331</b>; a part of the first dielectric layer <b>412</b> is disposed around the first lower electrode layer <b>411</b>; and a part of the first lower electrode layer <b>411</b> and a part of the first dielectric layer <b>412</b> also cover the substrate <b>10</b>. In the first capacitive structure <b>41</b>, the first upper electrode layer <b>413</b> covers the first dielectric layer <b>412</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, in this embodiment, the plurality of first support columns <b>331</b> and the first capacitive structure <b>41</b> together form first capacitive assemblies <b>61</b>. In a direction perpendicular to the substrate <b>10</b> (that is, in a Y-axis direction), a plurality of first capacitive assemblies <b>61</b> arranged in stack are disposed on the substrate <b>10</b>. For example, three first capacitive assemblies <b>61</b> arranged in stack may be disposed on the substrate <b>10</b>.
