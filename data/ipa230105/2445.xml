In particular, the inventors have established that the peptides characterised herein have the ability to suppress, prevent or treat an inappropriate inflammatory response. In an embodiment, the peptides can be used to suppress an inflammatory response that is associated with immune system activation. In another embodiment, the peptides described herein can be used to suppress an inflammatory response in the absence of an accompanying immune system activation.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0106">The peptides as described herein have been shown to have utility in a number of models that are commonly used to assess activation of the inflammatory response, including dermatitis and psoriasis. These models are well characterised in the art to comprise episodes of acute inflammation and/or chronic inflammation. The inventors therefore recognise the application of the defined peptides for a wide range of diseases or conditions which are accompanied by inflammation, of which those disclosed are just some examples.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0107">The peptides described herein have particular utility in the suppression of erythema which is a key feature of the inflammatory process. In one aspect, this is achieved through the suppression of monocytic/macrophage or other phagocytic cell infiltration into an effected area. In particular, the peptides are capable of reducing the secretion of inflammatory chemokines or cytokines and the expression of surface activation markers of pro-inflammatory immune cells. Non-limiting examples include CD86, MHCII and levels of IL-6, IL-12/IL-23, TNF-alpha and MCP-1. The inventors also establish the surprising finding that the effect of suppression of the inflammatory response is in the absence of any cytostatic or cytotoxic effects to the cells. The peptides described herein surprisingly can reduce activation of antigen presenting cells, reduce spontaneous activation of dermal dendritic cells, reduce levels of TCR&#x3b1;&#x3b2;<sup>+</sup> T cells and increase CD4<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells. These data point to a potential role for the peptides in inhibiting inflammation in a wide range of inflammatory conditions, including any inflammatory condition mediated by TNF-&#x3b1; and other pro-inflammatory cytokines or any inflammatory condition suppressed by the induction of regulatory cells like CD4<sup>+</sup> T regulatory cells.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0108">The data obtained by the inventors suggests that the peptides of the invention suppress pro-inflammatory responses by innate immune cells that are involved in the stimulation of inflammation under many different stimuli, including autoinflammation, tissue damage, cancer or infection. Using models that are either characteristically Th1-type inflammation, or IL-17/Th17 driven, the inventors show that the peptides of the invention may moderate (reduce) stimulation of Th1/Th17 type responses, and/or promote a regulatory response (FoxP3+CD4+ T-cells). These data therefore indicate that the peptides of the invention are likely to be suitable in the treatment of inflammatory disorders including indications such as psoriasis, dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, IBD, transplant rejection/tolerance (graft versus host disease, GVHD).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0109">The peptides characterised herein therefore have utility in suppressing, treating or preventing an inflammatory response that is characterised by one or more of:</p><p id="p-0088" num="0110">1. erythema;</p><p id="p-0089" num="0111">2. monocytic/macrophage infiltration;</p><p id="p-0090" num="0112">3. increased levels of cytokines and/or chemokines;</p><p id="p-0091" num="0113">4. activation of cell receptors/markers on inflammatory cells;</p><p id="p-0092" num="0114">5. activation of dendritic cells; and/or</p><p id="p-0093" num="0115">6. activation of lymphocytes.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0116">The inventors also establish that the peptides described have utility in reducing local inflammation in a manner that avoids unwanted immune system suppression. This is important because most clinically prescribed immunosuppressant drugs cause systemic immune suppression.

Alternately, the peptides described herein can suppress an inappropriate acute inflammatory response that is associated with an immune response which may be an innate response, adaptive immune response, or both.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0118">The term suppression of an inappropriate inflammatory response or treating an inappropriate immune response means a reduction in one or more of the symptoms of inflammation including erythema (redness), edema (swelling), pain and pruritus which are characteristic of inflammatory conditions. This may also be understood to be a reduction in one or more pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or chemokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, CXCL1, CXCL2, IL-1beta, prostaglandin E2 and IL-23/IL-17 as well as other chemokines/cytokines known in the art.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0119">In an embodiment, the peptides described herein have utility in treating or suppressing an acute inflammatory response with or without an accompanying immune response. In an embodiment, the peptides can suppress an acute inflammatory response that is associated with an innate immune response.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0120">Acute inflammation is understood to be a short-term process occurring in response to tissue injury, and usually appears within minutes or hours. It is characterized by five cardinal signs: pain, redness, immobility (loss of function), swelling and heat. The acute inflammatory response involves the recruitment of blood leukocytes, activation of tissue-resident cells (mast cells, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, macrophages), and production of a series of mediators including IL-1 and TNF alpha. The results of this may include ultimate resolution of the inflammatory process, triggering events that lead to cell regeneration or wound healing, or progression of the inflammatory response, which may be characterised as chronic inflammation.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0121">In an embodiment, the peptides described herein have utility in treating or suppressing a chronic inflammatory response with or without an accompanying immune response. In an embodiment, the peptides can suppress a chronic inflammatory response that is associated with an adaptive immune response.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0122">Chronic inflammation is understood to be slow, long-term inflammation lasting for prolonged periods of several months to years. Chronic inflammation may be caused by a number of varying factors including: (1) failure to eliminate an agent causing acute inflammation such as infectious organisms including <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, protozoa, fungi, and other parasites that can resist host defenses and remain in the tissue for an extended period; (2) exposure to a low level of a particular irritant or foreign materials that cannot be eliminated by enzymatic breakdown or phagocytosis in the body; (3) an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system is sensitized to the normal component of the body; (4) recurrent episodes of acute inflammation; or (5) inflammatory and biochemical inducers that cause oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0123">It will be understood that a chronic inflammatory process can be diagnosed by one of many known tests in the art. These include (1) serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) which shows concomitant hypoalbuminemia and polyclonal increase in all gamma globulins (polyclonal gammopathy); (2) measurement of serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and fibrinogen (normal serum levels for hsCRP is less than 0.55 mg/L in men and less than 1.0 mg/L in women, and normal levels of fibrinogen are 200 to 300 mg/dl); and detecting pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interleukin 12/23 (IL-12/23).</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Adaptive and Innate Immune Responses</heading><p id="p-0102" num="0124">The peptides described herein have utility in suppressing inflammatory processes that are associated with adaptive or innate immune responses.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0125">Adaptive or acquired immunity involves humoral (B lymphocytes) and cell-mediated (T lymphocytes) immune responses. Humoral immunity involves B cells and their products, including antibodies. Cell-mediated immunity involves the activation of phagocytes, antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+T-lymphocytes, and the release of various cytokines in response to an antigen. Cell mediated immunity results in the activation of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells that are able to induce apoptosis in cells displaying epitopes of foreign antigen on their surface, such as virus-infected cells or cells with intracellular bacteria. A cell-mediated immune response, particularly CD4+ helper responses, also involves activation of B cells. A cell mediated immune response also involves macrophages and innate lymphocytes (e.g. natural killer cells) for the destruction of pathogens via recognition and secretion of cytotoxic granules (for natural killer cells) and phagocytosis (for macrophages), as well as the stimulation of cells to secrete cytokines. Cell-mediated immunity is largely T-cell-driven, utilising helper (CD4+) and cytotoxic (CD8+) subtypes, and is involved in responses to viral infection, graft rejection, chronic inflammation and tumour immunity. Activated T-cells can take several days to initiate a cell-mediated attack after exposure to a novel antigen, but memory T-cells respond rapidly if primed by previous exposure. The peptides described herein have utility in the treatment of chronic inflammatory processes associated with an adaptive immune response as known in the art and as described herein.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0126">In contrast, the innate immune system consists of barriers to infection (epithelia of skin, gastrointestinal, respiratory, genitourinary tracts), antimicrobial peptides and proteins, humoral components (i.e. complement and opsonins) and cellular components (i.e. mast cells, neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, and innate lymphoid cells). Innate immunity serves as the front line of host defense and plays an essential role in preventing infection while tolerating normal host flora. The innate immune system directs the subsequent development of adaptive immune responses.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0127">It will be understood that the peptides described herein have utility in suppressing an inappropriate inflammatory response associated with an innate immune response within such barrier layers of the body including the skin, gastrointestinal, joints and respiratory tract.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0128">A skilled person will also understand that the inappropriate inflammatory response may be associated with activation of both the adaptive and innate immune responses.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">GM-CSF</heading><p id="p-0107" num="0129">In an embodiment, the peptide, pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of a peptide described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof does not comprise granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).</p><p id="p-0108" num="0130">GM-CSF is a monomeric glycoprotein secreted by macrophages, T cells, mast cells, natural killer cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts that functions as a cytokine.

Psoriasis can be triggered by many factors, including injury, trauma, infection and medications. The disease is assessed clinically using the Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index (PASI) scale which ranks severity of erythema (redness), induration (thickness) and desquamation (scale). Study parameters include in-life clinical evaluation of skin, histopathological evaluation of skin sections and optional cytokine analysis in skin and/or internal immune organs.

Acting as a hapten, it induces a cell-mediated response and causes activation of keratinocytes to produce chemical mediators such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and prostaglandin E2, causing migration and maturation of skin dendritic cells. These cytokines then activate vascular endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules (ie ICAM-1 and P/E selectins) which guide T cells to migrate from the blood to tissues.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0166">Haptens such as DNFB also activate mast cells and keratinocytes to produce neutrophil-recruiting chemokines such as CXCL1 and CXCL2, leading to neutrophil recruitment and the innate immune response. The activation of such dendritic cells (ie antigen presenting cells) then leads to the induction of cell-mediated immunity and the infiltration of T cells, leading to the production of IFN-gamma and IL-17. Treg cells regulate contact dermatitis by dampening the leukocyte influx and degrading ATP.

The peptide of the invention and the linker may be directly or indirectly linked. Preferably, the linker is located at the N-terminus of the peptide. In an embodiment, the linker comprises the sequence GGG and a peptide according to the invention comprises or consists of KKKKGGGMTPGTQSPFFLLLLLTVLTVV (SEQ ID NO: 22) or functional variants thereof (such as TPGTQSPFFLLLLLTVLTVV having the same modification and linker, i.e., SEQ ID NO: 23: KKKKGGGPGTQSPFFLLLLLTVLTVV).</p><p id="p-0185" num="0206">In addition, the proteins may be purified in higher yields and show better solubility than the corresponding natural polypeptide, at least under certain purification and storage conditions. For many proteins, including the extracellular domain of a membrane associated protein or the mature form(s) of a secreted protein, it is known in the art that one or more amino acids may be deleted from the N-terminus or C-terminus without substantial loss of biological function.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0207">However, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other biological activities may still be retained. Thus, the ability of the shortened protein to induce and/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature from of the protein generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature protein are removed from the N-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N-terminal residues of a complete protein retains its required activity can be determined by routine methods known in the art.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0208">Accordingly, the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the amino acid sequences of the molecules. Similarly, many examples of biologically functional C-terminal deletion mutants are known.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0209">However, even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C-terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein, other biological activities may still be retained. Thus, the ability of the shortened protein to induce and/or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature form of the protein generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature protein are removed from the C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C-terminal residues of a complete protein retains such biological activity can be determined by routine methods known in the art.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0210">In addition to terminal deletion forms of the protein discussed above, it also will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art that some amino acid sequences of the therapeutic polypeptides of the invention can be varied without significant effect of the structure or function of the protein. If such differences in sequence are contemplated, a skilled person would understand how to determine which domains are critical areas to retain function of the protein.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0211">Such mutants include deletions, insertions, inversions, repeats, and type substitutions, selected according to general rules known in the art, so as to have little effect on activity. For example, guidance on how to make phenotypically silent amino acid substitutions is provided in Bowie et al., (1990) Science 247:1306-1310, wherein the authors indicate that there are two main approaches for studying the tolerance of an amino acid sequence to change. The first method relies on the process of evolution, in which mutations are either accepted or rejected by natural selection.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0212">The second approach uses genetic engineering to introduce amino acid changes at specific positions of a cloned gene and selections, or screens, to identify sequences that maintain functionality. These studies report that proteins are surprisingly tolerant of amino acid substitutions. It is known that certain amino acid changes are likely to be permissive at a certain position of the protein. For example, most buried amino acid residues require nonpolar side chains, whereas few features of surface side chains are generally conserved.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0213">Typically seen as conservative substitutions are the replacements, one for another, among the aliphatic amino acids Ala (A), Val (V), Leu (L), and Ile (I); interchange of the hydroxyl residues Ser (S) and Thr (T), exchange of the acidic residues Asp (D) and Glu (E), substitution between the amide residues Asn (N) and Gln (Q), exchange of the basic residues Lys (K) and Arg (R), and replacements between the aromatic residues Phe (F) and Tyr (Y). Thus, a fragment, derivative, or analog of a polypeptide may be (i) one in which one or more of the amino acid residues are substituted with a conserved or nonconserved amino acid residue; such a substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code; (ii) one in which one or more of the amino acid residues includes a substituent group; (iii) one in which the mature polypeptide is fused with another compound, such as a compound to increase the half-life of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol); or (iv) one in which the additional amino acids are fused to the above form of the polypeptide, such as an IgG Fc fusion region peptide, a leader or secretory sequence, a sequence employed to purify the above form of the polypeptide, or a proprotein sequence. Such fragments, derivatives, and analogs are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0214">Thus, the therapeutic polypeptides of the invention may include one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, or additions, either from natural mutations or human manipulation. As indicated, these changes may be of a minor nature, such as conservative amino acid substitutions, that do not significantly affect the folding or activity of the protein. For instance, the one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, or additions will not affect the ability of the peptides described herein to suppress, treat or prevent an inappropriate inflammatory response.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0215">Conservative amino acid substitutions include the aromatic substitutions Phe, Trp, and Tyr; the hydrophobic substitutions Leu, Iso, and Val; the polar substitutions Glu and Asp; the basic substitutions Arg, Lys, and His; the acidic substitutions Asp and Glu; and the small amino acid substations Ala, Ser, Thr, Met, and Gly.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0216">Amino acids essential for the functions of the therapeutic polypeptides of the invention can be identified by methods known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The latter procedure introduces single alanine mutations. The resulting mutant molecules are then tested for biological activity such as receptor binding, or in vitro or in vitro proliferative activity.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0217">Further, substitutions of charged amino acids with other charged or neutral amino acids which may produce proteins with highly desirable improved characteristics, such as less aggregation. Aggregation may not only reduce activity but also be problematic when preparing pharmaceutical formulations, because, for example, aggregates can be immunogenic.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0218">Replacing amino acids can also change the selectivity of the binding of a ligand to cell surface receptors. Sites that are critical for ligand-receptor binding can also be determined by structural analysis such as crystallization, nuclear magnetic resonance, or photoaffinity labelling.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0219">The invention also provides nucleic acids or fragments thereof that encode the proteins defined herein comprising a sequence of DNA or RNA, including one having an open reading frame that encodes the therapeutic polypeptide and is capable, under appropriate conditions, of being expressed as one of the therapeutic polypeptides of the instant invention.

They also encompass single-stranded, double-stranded, and triple helical molecules that are either DNA, RNA, or hybrid DNA/RNA and that may encode a full-length gene or a biologically active fragment thereof.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0222">Polynucleotides of the invention include single nucleotide polymorphisms. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occur frequently in eukaryotic genomes. The nucleotide sequence determined from one individual of a species may differ from other allelic forms present within the population. The present invention encompasses such SNPs. The subject polynucleotides include those that encode variants of the polypeptides described in the instant specification.

A non-limiting example is photoleucine, which is a synthetic derivative of the leucine amino acid that is used as its natural analog and is characterized for having photo-reactivity.

It is within the ability of a skilled physician to determine a suitable dosage, e.g., by commencing with a sub-optimal dosage and incrementally modifying the dosage to determine an optimal or useful dosage. Alternatively, to determine an appropriate dosage for treatment/prophylaxis, data from the cell culture assays or animal studies are used, wherein a suitable dose is within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED<sub>50 </sub>of the active compound with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. A therapeutically/prophylactically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC<sub>50 </sub>(i.e., the concentration or amount of the compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma maybe measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="2">Pharmaceutical Compositions and Routes of Administration</heading><p id="p-0245" num="0274">Provided herein is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of a peptide described herein.

A minimum of 24 hours later, RP23 (SEQ ID NO:12) was delivered via sub-cutaneous injection at the abdomen in 50 &#x3bc;l phosphate buffered saline. Seven days later, mice were topically sensitised to 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNFB, 0.5 vol %) in olive oil/acetone (1:4, v/v, 30 &#x3bc;l) via application to the shaved abdomen. Five days after sensitisation, mice were challenged on the ears with topical DNFB (0.25 vol %) in olive oil/acetone (1:4, v/v, 15 &#x3bc;l per ear). Ear thickness was measured daily using manual callipers from immediately before challenge, up to 96 hours post challenge. Positive controls for ear swelling consisted of mice that were injected with PBS instead of RP23. Negative or irritant controls consisted of a group of mice that received the DNFB challenge, but not the sensitisation. The average of the change in ear thickness from this control group was subtracted from the change in ear thickness of other samples to account for non-specific irritation due to the application of DNFB, olive oil and acetone.</p><heading id="h-0028" level="2">Imiquimod-Induced Psoriasis Model&#x2014;Methodology</heading><p id="p-0310" num="0339">The backs of 8-week old female C57BL/6 mice (Australian BioResources) were coarse shaved. A minimum of 24 hours later, 10 nmol RP23 was delivered via sub-cutaneous injection at the lower back in 200 &#x3bc;l phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Groups of mice acting as positive controls for disease development received injection of PBS only. One or seven days later, psoriasis-like inflammation was induced via topical application of 5% imiquimod cream (Aldara, Inova Pharmaceuticals) to the shaved back (57.5 mgs) and one ear (5 mg, divided between dorsal and ventral sides). The contralateral ear served as a negative control for imiquimod-induced inflammation. Imiquimod application was repeated daily for four consecutive days. C57BL/6 mice experience rapid weight loss (up to 20%) upon application of imiquimod cream. Supportive care was provided in the form of dietary supplementation commenced 2 days prior to imiquimod application, and intra-peritoneal injection of 300 &#x3bc;l sterile PBS on days two and three of imiquimod application. Disease progression was monitored for five days, by recording weight loss and grading disease of the back skin using a modified Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) clinical scoring system, that assessed only disease severity. Additionally, erythema meter (DSM II ColorMeter, Cortex Technology, Denmark) readings were taken at four quadrants on the back skin and skin backfold thickness measurements were recorded using manual callipers. Disease progression of the ear skin was determined by recording ear thickness, measured by manual callipers. As a positive control for immune suppressive therapy, groups of mice received daily topical application of betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% (MSD) cream (30 mgs on the back, 10 mgs on the ear). Mice receiving steroid therapy experienced a greater degree of weight loss, and substantial reductions in spleen weight, indicative of systemic immune suppression.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0340">The inventors initially trialled RP23 (SEQ ID NO: 12) as a vaccine antigen in a murine skin tumour model. To their surprise, they did not observe reduced skin tumour growth in mice treated with RP23, but rather a modest increase in tumour growth, suggestive of an immune suppressive effect (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). They then assessed whether RP23 could reduce inflammation in a murine model of contact dermatitis, using a contact hypersensitivity assay (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>). A single nanomolar injection of RP23 prior to sensitisation was able to significantly suppress elicitation of inflammation, as measured by a reduction in ear thickness (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>) and inflammatory myeloid cell skin infiltrate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c</i></figref>). This immune suppression was specific to the RP23 sequence, as a peptide bearing the same amino acids in a scrambled order did not significantly reduce ear swelling (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>). RP23 considerably increased the synthetic yield without significantly altering immune suppression when compared to the effect of SEQ ID NO: 3 (MUC1SP) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>). Using RP23, the inventors carried out a dose-response assay to titrate the immune suppression. Using three doses in the low nanomole range (2, 5 or 10 nmol, about 0.3 0.8, 1.6 mg/kg), a dose-dependent reduction in ear swelling of up to 100% compared to controls was observed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>c</i></figref>). Including GM-CSF in the assay abrogated much of the suppression afforded by RP23 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>d</i></figref>). Further, in a murine model of imiquimod-induced psoriasis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>), a single injection of RP23 reduced local erythema, skin thickness and scaling (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b,c</i></figref>). This immunomodulatory effect was isolated to the area in which RP23 was delivered, unlike topical application of a glucocorticoid which caused unwanted systemic immune suppression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>d</i></figref>). No adverse reactions of any kind have been observed in mice receiving RP23 injection, even when a 10 nmol dose was given daily for 6 days by sub-cutaneous injection (data not shown), supportive of this peptide being non-toxic and non-irritating.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0341">Using an in vitro culture system, it was determined whether RP23 could suppress the activity of specific pro-inflammatory immune cells. In primary murine splenic dendritic cells, RP23 reduced the secretion of inflammatory chemokines (data not shown) and expression of surface activation markers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>). The culture of murine bone marrow derived macrophages with RP23 led to reduced IL-6, MCP-1 and TNF release after LPS-stimulation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b</i></figref>). Similarly, primary human blood derived macrophages had reduced IL-6 and IL-12/23 release after stimulation with either LPS or imiquimod (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>c</i></figref>). RP23 was able to induce these changes in macrophages without causing any cytostatic or cytotoxic effects to the cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), indicating that the peptide is non-toxic. When RP23 was injected intra-dermally into healthy human skin explants it reduced spontaneous activation of dermal dendritic cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0313" num="0342">In conclusion, the peptides described herein offer potential as a novel, locally acting peptide-based therapy for patients seeking improved management of inflammatory skin diseases.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0343">Additionally, the immune pathways modified, in particular the reduction of IL-12/23, IL-6, and TNF (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) as well as the reduction in the activation status of pro-inflammatory immune cells such as macrophages and DCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>15</b></figref>) suggest broader applicability of RP23 beyond inflammatory skin indications. The RP23-mediated reduction in TCR&#x3b1;&#x3b2;+ T-cells in the skin of psoriatic mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>), and the increase in FoxP3+ CD4+ T-cells in the skin draining lymph nodes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>), also suggest suitability for use in inflammatory conditions mediated by T-cells. This may include inflammatory conditions further characterised by T-helper 1 or 17 type inflammation, such as RA and IBD, that may be initiated by, or further aggravated via pro-inflammatory innate immune cells.</p><heading id="h-0029" level="1">Example 3: Effects of Variants of RP23 (SEQ ID NO:12) on the Inflammatory Response</heading><p id="p-0315" num="0344">The inventors then conducted additional in vivo studies, using a model of contact hypersensitivity, to determine the portion of RP23 responsible for its immunomodulatory activity. Mice received one injection of peptide (10 nmol) subcutaneously at the abdomen, seven days prior to sensitisation of the skin with a contact irritant (DNFB). Five days later, mice were challenged with DNFB at a distal site, on the ears. The thickness of the ears was measured over 72 hours.

This reiterates the importance of the SEQ ID NO: 30 amino acid sequence for the immune suppressive effect, and indicates that the specified chemical modifications do not impact the efficacy of RP23. Therefore, the modified RP23 SEQ ID NOs: 32 and 35, may be used in place of RP23 for the assessment of RP23-induced immune modulation.</p><heading id="h-0031" level="1">Example 5: Effects of Peptides Described Herein in Combination with Corticosteroid Administration on the Inflammatory Response</heading><p id="p-0323" num="0350">Aldara cream (5% imiquimod, 57.5 mgs) was applied daily (days 0-4) to the backs of C57BL/6 female mice to induce psoriasis.

At early time points, that is at day 1 and 2, there were minor reductions in the clinical scores of mice receiving both RP23+BD, compared to RP23 alone or BD alone. Notably, as the disease progressed, the protective effect from BD alone was lost, whereas protection was maintained when both RP23+BD are used. However, there was no advantage of the combination compared to RP23 alone at the later time points.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0351">RP23 and BD therapy were also tested when given synergistically at a therapeutic timepoint (at day 1). Psoriasis was induced as above, but clinical scores were determined daily for 10 days after ceasing imiquimod application at day 5, to record the rate and degree of psoriasis disease resolution (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>). Again, RP23+BD provided an early advantage in reduction of disease (at day 2), and provided improvement compared to BD only treatment in terms of rate and degree of disease resolution.

RP23 treatment reduced the proportion of total CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in the back skin, suggesting reduced proliferation or recruitment of pro-inflammatory T-cells to the skin in the context of psoriasis.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0353">CD3+CD4+ TCR&#x3b1;&#x3b2; T-cells in the skin draining lymph nodes (inguinal) were phenotyped by transcription factor staining and flow cytometry to identify cells with a regulatory phenotype (i.e., FoxP3+).

This suggests that RP23 treatment promotes responses that regulate T-cell responses, including Th1 or Th17-type inflammation, supporting the utility of RP23 in any inflammatory indication where this type of inflammation is pathogenic, including psoriasis, contact dermatitis, IBD (e.g ulcerative colitis or Crohn's) and rheumatoid arthritis.</p><heading id="h-0033" level="1">Example 7: Peptide Formulation for Topical Application</heading><p id="p-0327" num="0354">RP23<sup>AF594 </sup>was formulated for topical application in an adapted stock emulsion consisting of dimethicone, liquid paraffin, 4-chloro-3-methylphenol, cetrimide and octadecan-1-ol.

MHCII expression was substantially reduced on DC in the lung tissue (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>). To determine if this effect would be maintained once potent lung inflammation was induced, C57BL/6 mice (n=4) received either PBS, scramble RP23 peptide, or RP23 by intra-nasal instillation, then 24 hours later, Pam2Cys-SK<sub>4</sub>-PEG(OH) was given intra-nasally to induce an inflammatory state. RP23 treated mice again had reduced MHCII expression on lung DC and also on DC in the bronchoalveolar space (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>).
