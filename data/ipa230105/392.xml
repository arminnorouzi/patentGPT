For example, pressure sensing devices include analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that digitize voltage. When the ADCs are similarly or identically-configured and used with sensors having different characteristics, various ranges of the span of the ADCs become unutilized during operation. This results in a loss of ADC resolution. Additionally, voltages corresponding to some pressure measurements may fall outside the range of the ADCs.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Described herein is a sensing device that is calibrated to improve the interoperability between an ADC and a sensor of a sensing device and better use the resolution of the ADC. The sensing device is calibrated in a calibration stage. In an embodiment, the calibration includes setting a reference voltage of the ADC and a resistance value of a voltage-dividing resistance. The sensing device then operates with the reference voltage and the resistance value that are set during the calibration stage.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a system <b>100</b> for measuring and reporting pressure applied to a pressure sensing device <b>102</b>.

In the event of a fall, the pressure sensing device <b>102</b> is operative to detect the fall by virtue of a removal applied pressure.

In some embodiments, the calibration device <b>130</b> determines the second resistance of the voltage-dividing resistance <b>114</b> computationally, empirically and/or iteratively.

Thus, it is desirable to determine the second resistance that results in bridging a gap between the output voltage and the reference voltage, while retaining the output voltage at a level less than that of the reference voltage. Retaining the output voltage at a level less than the reference voltage avoids ADC <b>118</b> clipping. For example, for an 8-bit ADC with <b>256</b> quantization levels ranging from 0 to 255, the second resistance that results in the ADC output being at the 254th, 253rd or 250th quantization level, among others, is determined.

The voltage-dividing resistance <b>114</b>, as a variable resistance, has known minimum and maximum available resistance levels. The voltage-dividing resistance <b>114</b> is initially set to the first resistance. In some embodiments, the first resistance corresponds to the minimum available resistance level. The calibration device <b>130</b> performs the binary search to determine the second resistance that results in the output voltage of the ADC <b>118</b> being below the reference voltage.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the voltage supply source <b>116</b> supplies the system voltage (V<sub>dd</sub>) of the pressure sensing device <b>102</b> (e.g., 3.3V) to the voltage-dividing resistance <b>114</b>. Thus, the voltage divider (including the voltage-dividing resistance <b>114</b> and the variable resistance <b>112</b>) is coupled between ground voltage (e.g., 0V) and the system voltage (V<sub>dd</sub>) (e.g., 3.3V). This allows the voltage divider to vary the sensor <b>110</b> reading in a range of 3.3V and 0V asymptotically. The reference voltage of the ADC <b>116</b> is lower than the system voltage (V<sub>dd</sub>) and within the range. Thus, the calibration device <b>130</b> determines a specific matching resistance of the voltage-dividing resistance <b>114</b>. The matching resistance places the maximum reading of the sensor <b>110</b> (or zero pressure point) at the reference voltage of the ADC <b>118</b>. This maximizes the available ADC range as it relates to the sensor <b>110</b> output and provides the maximum amount of sensor <b>110</b> sensitivity.

In the method <b>600</b>, the calibration device <b>130</b> (or the controller <b>132</b> thereof), at <b>602</b>, sets a lower limit of the binary search to a resistance corresponding to the minimum available resistance and sets an upper limit of the binary search to a resistance corresponding to the maximum available resistance.

At <b>604</b>, the calibration device <b>130</b> determines a mid-value between the lower limit and the upper limit. In some embodiments, the mid-value is any value between the lower and upper limits. In some embodiments, the mid-value is a mean of the lower and upper limits or any other function of the lower and upper limits.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The calibration device <b>130</b> tests the mid-value to determine whether the mid-value satisfies the sought condition of the output voltage of the ADC <b>118</b> being below the reference voltage and to guide the direction of the binary search. The calibration device <b>130</b> sets the resistance of the voltage-dividing resistance <b>114</b> to the mid-value at <b>606</b> and determines whether the output voltage of the ADC <b>118</b> is less than the reference voltage at <b>608</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">If a negative determination is made, it is concluded that the mid-value is lower than desired and does not result in the condition being met. In this case, a resistance that is higher than the mid-value is tested. Accordingly, if a negative determination is made, the calibration device <b>130</b>, at <b>610</b>, sets the lower limit to the mid-value. Accordingly, the calibration device <b>130</b> establishes the mid-value as the lower limit of the binary search, whereas the upper limit of the binary search remains at the resistance corresponding to the maximum available resistance and satisfies the sought condition. The method <b>600</b> then proceeds to <b>614</b>, where the calibration device <b>130</b> determines whether a criterion for halting met. If a negative determination is made at <b>614</b>, the method proceeds to <b>604</b>, where a subsequent mid-value is determined based on the upper limit and newly-established lower limit. The subsequent mid-value is tested and used to guide the direction of the binary search again.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">If a positive determination is made, it is concluded that the mid-value satisfies the sought condition. The binary search is continued to determine a lower value than the mid-value that also satisfies the condition. To do so, the calibration device <b>130</b> sets the upper limit of the binary search to the mid-value at <b>612</b>. Thus, the binary search is narrowed and the determination at <b>608</b> steers the direction of the binary search to lower resistances.

In some embodiments, the criterion is a duration of time consumed in performing the binary search.

In some embodiments, the criterion for halting is met when the difference between the output voltage of the ADC <b>118</b> and the reference voltage is below a threshold, such as 0.1 or 0.01V. In some embodiments, the criterion for halting is met when the number of iterations of the binary search that have been performed exceeding a threshold, such as 10 or 50 iterations, where an iteration is the number of times that the output voltage of the ADC <b>118</b> was compared to the reference voltage or the number of times that the comparison yielded a positive determination. In some embodiments, the criterion for halting is met when the duration of time consumed in performing the binary search reaches a threshold, such as five or ten seconds. In some embodiments, the criterion for halting is met when the binary search has fully converged on the resistance of the voltage-dividing resistance. In some embodiments, the binary search fully converges when the determination, at <b>604</b>, does not result in a new or different mid-value or when setting the resistance, at <b>604</b>, does not result in a new or different resistance. In some embodiments, a complex criterion for halting is used.
