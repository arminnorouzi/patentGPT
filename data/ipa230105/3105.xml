Well servicing tools can be lowered from a servicing rig at surface on a work string to a desired or target position in the well. The location of the well servicing tools with respect to a target depth may be difficult to determine due to the wellbore geometry. The location of the well servicing tools can be determined with well surveying tool, but such tools require additional trips into and out of the wellbore adding delay and associated expense. In certain work strings having a retrievable service packer, the up and down manipulation of the work string to anchor the well servicing tools with the retrievable service packer within the target depth can move well servicing tools out of position. There is a need to reposition well servicing tools to a correct position after the service packer has been set and without the aid of a separate surveying tool.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For a more complete understanding of the present disclosure, reference is now made to the following brief description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings and detailed description, wherein like reference numerals represent like parts.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic view of a wellbore environment showing an embodiment of the downhole adjustment tool assembly.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a partial sectional view of an adjustment tool and activation tool according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A-B</figref> are partial sectional views of an adjustment tool according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A-B</figref> are partial sectional views of an adjustment tool according to still another embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a partial sectional view of an adjustment tool with a gearing system according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a partial sectional view of an adjustment tool with a threaded extension according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a partial sectional view of an adjustment tool with an electromagnet system according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flow chart of a method according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flow chart of a method according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more embodiments are illustrated below, the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or not yet in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations, drawings, and techniques illustrated below, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Service companies routinely lower well servicing tools into the wellbore to perform treatment operations on oil and gas wells. The typical well servicing tools can include retrievable service packers, reservoir testing tools, and perforating equipment. These well servicing tools can be attached to a work string such as coil tubing, production tubing, or drill pipe to be lowered into the wellbore from equipment (rig, platform, etc.) located at an onshore or offshore surface above the well. Well servicing tools can require work string manipulation (e.g., raising, lowering, or rotation) to activate, perform the operation, and deactivate for retrieval from the well. Operations deep within the wellbore can inhibit movement of the tool string to actuate or manipulate the well servicing tools. The wellbore geometry of extended horizontal wellbores, deviated wellbores, and wellbores with multiple changes in directions can result in high friction forces between the inner surface of the casing and the work string. The combination of high friction forces and changes of wellbore direction can cause the well servicing tools to move up and down in a jerky motion, e.g., motion with sudden starts and stops, and generally appear &#x201c;sticky&#x201d; at surface. The sudden start and stops of the well servicing tool can inhibit and generally prevent the accurate placement of the perforating guns. In some cases, the motion of the work string can prevent the setting of a service packer at a desired location resulting in the perforating guns to being out of position. In some cases, the target zone can be relatively small in length, e.g., small target zone, resulting in considerable amount of time spent to locate the perforating guns in the target zone. In some cases, the target zone can be located in a deviated wellbore that is difficult to determine the position of the tool string. Perforating the wellbore in the wrong position or partially in the wrong position can inhibit or prevent the production of the desired formation fluids, e.g., oil and gas. The service packer may need to be unset, repositioned, and reset to place the perforating gun into the correct position. The additional manipulation of the work string can cause unwanted delays and increase the risk of an adverse event. A perforating gun assembly positioning method is needed.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">One solution of positioning perforating guns at a desired position is to utilize an adjustment tool that can move the perforating guns independent of the service packer. In an embodiment, the service tool string can include a positioning tag, a service packer, an adjustment tool, and a perforating gun assembly. The work string can lower the service tool string to an estimated target depth. The depth of the formation can be determined by a casing survey and one or more logging runs. The depth of the service tool string can be estimated by correlating the measured length of the work string to the casing survey. Lowering the service tool string to an estimated target depth may place the perforating gun assembly within or close to a target zone. The target zone can be a distance along the casing where the casing intersects the formation with the desired hydrocarbons, also referred to as the production zone or pay zone. The target zone can be the depth where the production zone begins, e.g., intersects the casing, to the depth the production zone ends. The perforating guns on the service tool string can perforate the casing and cement within the target zone to allow the desired hydrocarbons to enter the casing and be produced to surface. The target depth for the service tool string with perforating guns and an adjustment tool can be a distance that includes the length of the target zone, e.g., the depth the production zone begins and ends, and the adjustment length of the adjustment tool. A tag locating tool can be conveyed into the work string on wireline to locate the tag on the service tool string and a casing tag or other reference point having a known location within the wellbore, and provide a measurement of the location of the two tags. The depth of the service tool string can be determined by the location of the casing tag and the distance from the casing tag to the tag on the service tool string. The service tool string can be repositioned if the service tool string is not within the target depth. The tag locating tool can remeasure the distance between tags after the service tool string has been repositioned. If the service tool string is located within the target depth, a signal can be sent from surface down the work string to the adjustment tool. The adjustment tool can have an initial length, e.g., the assembled length or run-in length. The adjustment tool can lengthen (e.g., extend from an initial length to a longer length), retract (e.g., retract from an initial length to a shorter length), or both, to change the location of the perforating gun assembly and move the perforating gun assembly to the desired location. In some embodiments, the adjustment tool can extend and/or retract from an initial length (e.g., a run-in length), from a first intermediate length (a length associated with a firing of a first perforating gun), from a second intermediate length (a length associated with a firing of a second perforating gun), and/or to final length (e.g., a run-out length) to change the location of the perforating gun assembly. The service packer on the service tool string can be set with work string manipulation. The adjustment tool can send a location confirmation signal back to surface. The perforating guns can perforate the casing. The work string can then unset the packer and retrieve the packer, adjustment tool, and the spent perforating gun assembly.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another solution to position the perforating gun assembly at the desired depth, e.g., target depth, is to utilize an adjustment tool with an anchoring mechanism to set the service packer. The adjustment tool can provide a precise location of the perforating guns for short production zones, e.g., production zones with a short distance between the beginning depth of the zone and the ending depth of the zone. The adjustment tool can include an anchoring mechanism that anchors the perforating guns to the casing so that the adjustment tool can extend to actuate the slips, e.g., anchoring the slips to the casing, of the service packer so that the service tool string doesn't move to set the service packer. In an embodiment, the service tool string can include a positioning tag, a service packer, an adjustment tool with an anchoring system, and a perforating gun assembly. The work string can lower the service tool string to the estimated target depth. A tag locating tool can be lowered into the work string on wireline to locate the tag on the service tool string and a casing tag or other indicator of a reference point having a known location within the wellbore, and provide a measurement of the location of the two tags. The work string can be manipulated to reposition the service tool string with the perforating gun assembly. The tag locating tool can remeasure the distance between tags. If the service tool string is within the target depth, a signal can be sent from surface down the work string to the adjustment tool. The adjustment tool with the anchoring mechanism can activate the anchoring mechanism to anchor the adjustment tool, and thereby anchor the perforating gun assembly, to the casing. The adjustment tool, while anchored to the casing, can extend to compress the bottom of the service packer and set the slips on the service packer. The work string can be lowered to fully set, e.g., anchor and seal, the service packer. After the packer is set, the anchoring system on the adjustment tool can be deactivated and the adjustment tool can lengthen or shorten to change the location of the perforating gun assembly while the packer remains set and stationary. The adjustment tool can send a confirmation signal back to surface. The perforating guns can perforate the casing. The work string can then unset the packer and retrieve the packer, adjustment tool, and the spent perforating gun assembly.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment, the adjustment tool for changing the location of the perforating gun assembly can include a mechanism for axial and/or rotational orientation of the perforating gun assembly that orients the perforating gun to a desired direction. In addition, the setting module can be activated independent of the adjustment tool (e.g., without moving the adjustment tool) or can be activated dependent on the adjustment tool (e.g., by movement of the adjustment tool).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a wellbore operating environment <b>10</b> in which a service tool string can be deployed is described. The wellbore operating environment <b>10</b> comprises a servicing rig <b>12</b> that extends over and around a wellbore <b>14</b> that penetrates a subterranean formation <b>16</b> for the purpose of recovering hydrocarbons from one or more production zones <b>18</b>. The wellbore <b>14</b> can be drilled into the subterranean formation <b>16</b> using any suitable drilling technique. While shown as extending vertically from the surface, the wellbore <b>14</b> can also be deviated, horizontal, and/or curved over at least some portions of the wellbore <b>14</b>. The wellbore <b>14</b> can also include one or more lateral wellbores drilled off of the primary wellbore <b>14</b>. The wellbore <b>14</b> can be cased, open hole, contain tubing, and a casing <b>20</b> can be placed in the wellbore <b>14</b> and secured at least in part by cement. The casing <b>20</b> can include a casing tag <b>22</b> or other location reference point indicator, e.g., a radioactive tag, housed within a coupling or a housing at a predetermined distance from surface. A wellbore <b>14</b> can include one or more production zones <b>18</b> with perforations <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The servicing rig <b>12</b> can be one of a drilling rig, a completion rig, a workover rig, a coil tubing rig, an offshore platform or ship, or other structure and supports a toolstring <b>26</b> disposed in the wellbore <b>14</b>. In other embodiments, other surface systems or structures can also support the toolstring <b>26</b>. The servicing rig <b>12</b> can also comprise a derrick with a rig floor through which the toolstring <b>26</b> extends downward from the servicing rig <b>12</b> into the wellbore <b>14</b>. In some cases, such as in an off-shore location, the servicing rig <b>12</b> can be supported by piers extending downwards to a seabed. Alternatively, the servicing rig <b>12</b> can be supported by columns sitting on hulls and/or pontoons that are ballasted below the water surface, which can be referred to as a semi-submersible platform or floating rig. In deep water applications, the servicing rig <b>12</b> can be supported by a drillship. In an off-shore location, a casing <b>20</b> can extend from the servicing rig <b>12</b> to the ocean floor to exclude sea water and contain drilling fluid returns. It is understood that mechanical mechanisms known to those in the arts can control the run-in and withdrawal of the toolstring <b>26</b> in the wellbore <b>14</b>, for example a draw works coupled to a hoisting apparatus, another servicing vehicle, a coiled tubing unit and/or other apparatus.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment, a well servicing toolstring <b>26</b> can include a conveyance string or work string <b>28</b>, a location tag <b>30</b>, a service packer <b>32</b>, an adjustment tool <b>34</b>, an anchoring mechanism <b>36</b>, and a perforating gun assembly <b>38</b>. The work string <b>28</b> can be any of a string of jointed pipes, a coiled tubing, and a wireline. For example, the work string <b>28</b> can be drill pipe, production tubing, workover tubing, or any type of threaded tubing. The term &#x201c;location tag&#x201d; as used herein includes any suitable type of indicator that can be associated with (e.g., affixed at) (i) a given component (e.g., tool to wellbore completion component) and/or (ii) a known location or reference point in the wellbore and subsequently located or interrogated by an interrogator/reader device in order to provide an indication of the location of the interrogator/reader device relative to (i) the position of the given component and/or (ii) the known location or reference point within the wellbore. For example, in one scenario, the location tag <b>30</b> can be a radioactive pellet contained within a radioactive marker sub, e.g., a coupling or housing. In a second scenario, the location tag <b>30</b> can be a radioactive coating, e.g., paint, applied to the inner bore or outer surface of one or more tools, e.g., a coupling or housing. In a third scenario, the work string <b>28</b> could have a restriction, e.g., reduced inner surface or removable ball, that could be located with a wireline run. The casing <b>20</b> could have a restriction, e.g., a reduced inner surface, that the well servicing toolstring <b>26</b> can locate, e.g., cannot pass through. The service packer <b>32</b> can be a retrievable packer that sets and unsets by work string <b>28</b> manipulation. The anchoring mechanism <b>36</b> can be coupled to the adjustment tool <b>34</b>. The adjustment tool <b>34</b> can be coupled to the service packer <b>32</b>. The perforating gun assembly <b>38</b> can be coupled to the adjustment tool <b>34</b>. In some embodiments, the anchoring mechanism <b>36</b> can be omitted.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The service packer <b>32</b> can be a retrievable packer comprising a sealing element, a set of slips <b>42</b>, and a drag block assembly <b>44</b>. The set of slips <b>42</b> can releasably anchor the service packer <b>32</b> to the inner surface <b>50</b> of the casing <b>20</b>. The drag block assembly <b>44</b> can include a plurality of spring loaded pads that slidingly engage the inner surface <b>50</b> of the casing <b>20</b>. A packer actuation assembly, coupled to the drag block assembly <b>44</b>, can configure the service packer <b>32</b> into the run-in position or the set position. The packer actuation assembly comprises a limiting mechanism to restrict or allow the service packer <b>32</b> to set from manipulation of the work string <b>28</b>, e.g., up and down motion. The packer actuation assembly can comprise a lug, also called a pin or key, within a j-slot. One or more lugs can be coupled to a rotator ring. The j-slot can be a simple j-slot with two positions or a continuous j-slot with multiple positions. The packer actuation assembly can restrict the service packer <b>32</b> to the run-in position, e.g., un-set position, with the lug in a first position within the j-slot. The packer actuation assembly can allow the service packer <b>32</b> to actuate, e.g., set position, with the lug in a second position within the j-slot. The activation assembly can control the activation, e.g., retain or deployment of the set of slips <b>42</b>. Upward movement of the work string <b>28</b> can move the packer actuation assembly to the set position. Downward movement of the work string <b>28</b> can activate the set of slips <b>42</b> to grip the inner surface <b>50</b> of the casing <b>20</b>. After the slips <b>42</b> are set, the work string <b>28</b> can be lowered to apply weight and compress the sealing elements to form a seal against the inner surface <b>50</b> of the casing <b>20</b>. The service packer <b>32</b> can anchor and seal to the casing <b>20</b> to isolate the upper annulus <b>46</b> from the lower annulus <b>48</b>. The service packer <b>32</b> can include additional features such as an internal valve, a pressure equalizing mechanism, and a second anchoring mechanism.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The perforating gun assembly <b>38</b> may be of conventional design which may comprise a plurality of explosive devices (e.g., perforating charges or shaped charges) disposed within a gun body that are evenly radially distributed, e.g., 360 degrees, and detonated in order to perforate the casing, e.g., perforations <b>24</b> in casing <b>20</b>. The perforating gun assembly <b>38</b> may include elements such as a charge carrier, a detonation cord coupled to each perforating charge. The perforating gun assembly <b>38</b> may be coupled to the adjustment tool <b>34</b>, the anchoring mechanism <b>36</b>, or a combination of the two. The perforating gun assembly <b>38</b> may include an apparatus, e.g., firing head, to fire the perforating charges. The perforating gun assembly <b>38</b> can comprise 1, 2, 3, or any number of perforating gun sections that can be individually fired. The perforating gun assembly <b>38</b> can perforate a production zone, e.g., <b>18</b>, for each perforating gun section. Alternatively, the perforating gun assembly <b>38</b> can include one or more gun sections with radially oriented perforating charges, e.g., perforating charges pointing to a single position on a compass, i.e. zero degrees.

The cylinder <b>162</b> can be coupled to a control sub <b>204</b> via a connector sub <b>202</b>. The control sub <b>204</b> can be coupled to the service packer <b>32</b> via a connector sub <b>184</b>. The control sub <b>204</b> comprises the manifold <b>210</b>, a bleed port, a gas generator <b>222</b>, a first fluid path <b>208</b>, a controller <b>136</b>, and a communication system <b>140</b>. The first fluid path <b>208</b> fluidly connects the gas generator <b>222</b> the manifold <b>210</b>. The gas generator <b>222</b> can produce gas of a sufficient quantity of pressure and volume to actuate the adjustment tool <b>220</b>. The gas generator <b>222</b> can be configured to produce gas from a chemical reaction or from combusting a fuel source. The gas generator <b>222</b> can be configured to segregate a catalyst, e.g., copper or iron sulphate, from a reactant, e.g., hydrogen peroxide. The gas generator <b>222</b> can be configured to mix the hydrogen peroxide with the copper/iron sulphate when activated by controller <b>136</b> to produce an exothermic reaction with oxygen and water as the products of the reaction. The gas pressure, e.g., oxygen, can be held within the reaction chamber or transferred via the manifold <b>210</b> to one of the cylinders, e.g., cylinder <b>108</b> or <b>102</b>. The gas generator <b>222</b> can be configured to combust a fuel source, for example, a pyrotechnic charge. The gas generator <b>222</b> can utilize a pyrotechnic or &#x201c;black power&#x201d; charge (e.g., a charge similar to a road flare) to develop a high pressure gas within a firing chamber with the ignition of the pyrotechnic charge. The high pressure generated by the burning or firing of the pyrotechnic charge can be held within the gas generator <b>222</b> or transferred via the manifold <b>210</b> to one of the cylinders, e.g., cylinder <b>108</b> or <b>102</b>. By &#x201c;burning&#x201d; or &#x201c;firing&#x201d; it is meant the continuous generation, sometimes relatively slowly, of pressure by ignition of a power charge initiated reaction which results in a pressure increase within a firing chamber of transmittable gaseous pressure within the apparatus. The gas generator <b>222</b> can comprise a single chamber or a plurality of chambers that produce gas on a as needed basis. A first control line <b>214</b> fluidly connects the first cylinder <b>102</b> to the manifold <b>210</b>. The manifold <b>210</b> comprises a plurality of valves that fluidly connect the first cylinder <b>102</b> and the second cylinder <b>108</b> to one of the gas generator <b>222</b>, a bleed port, a fluid stop, or combination thereof. The bleed port fluidly connects the manifold to a port to the annulus <b>48</b>. During the run-in of the toolstring <b>26</b>, the second chamber <b>108</b> is filled with hydraulic fluid. The weight of the perforating gun assembly <b>38</b> pressurizes the fluid within the second chamber <b>108</b> via the piston <b>164</b>. The weight of the perforating gun assembly <b>38</b> transfers to the piston <b>164</b> via the lower mandrel <b>168</b>. The manifold <b>210</b> can be configured to close the cylinder <b>108</b> and control line <b>212</b> with a fluid stop to maintain the fluid pressure within the chamber <b>108</b>. The controller <b>138</b> can comprise a printed circuit board, a transceiver, a microprocessor, non-transitory memory, and an application executing in memory. The application executing in non-transitory memory can include instructions stored therein, e.g., the application, defining the operation of the adjustment tool <b>160</b>. The controller <b>138</b> can include a power source such as one or more batteries or ultracapacitors. The controller <b>138</b> can be communicatively coupled to the manifold <b>210</b> and the communication system <b>140</b>. As previously described, the communication system <b>140</b> can be configured to receive and transmit acoustic signals via the wellbore.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The operational sequence of locating the perforating gun assembly within the target zone with the service packer <b>32</b>, adjustment tool <b>220</b>, and perforating gun assembly <b>38</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, is described.
