loose, and a service priority of the eMBB is usually shorter than that of the URLLC.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is found in an application process that an eMBB HARQ-ACK may be lost, which will

Alternatively, the UE <b>11</b> may also be a roadside device, for example, a street lamp, a signal lamp, or other roadside devices with a wireless communication function.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The base station <b>12</b> may be a network side device in a radio communication system. The radio communication system may be a 5G system, which is also referred to as a new radio (NR) system or a 5G NR system. Alternatively, the radio communication system may be a system supporting New Radio-Unlicensed (NR-U) spectrum communication. Alternatively, the radio communication system may be a next generation system of the 5G system. Herein, an access network in the 5G system can be called a New Generation-Radio Access Network (NG-RAN).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The base station <b>12</b> may be a base station (gNB) having a centralized-distributed architecture in the 5G system. When the base station <b>12</b> adopts a centralized-distributed architecture, the base station <b>12</b> typically includes a Central Unit (CU) and at least two Distributed Units (DUs).

However, if the HARQ-ACK PUCCH resource carrying the URLLC overlaps with the eMBB PUSCH resource in the time domain, the eMBB PUSCH resource will be dropped or partially dropped. If the eMBB HARQ-ACK is transmitted by using the eMBB PUSCH resource in a multiplex manner at this time, the carried eMBB HARQ-ACK may be dropped or partially dropped, resulting in the base station not receiving or correctly receiving the HARQ of the eMBB service fed back by the UE, thereby causing retransmission of unnecessary eMBB service data.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">If both the PUCCH resource carrying the URLLC HARQ-ACK and the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK overlap with the eMBB PUSCH resource in the time domain, but the PUCCH resource carrying the URLLC HARQ-ACK does not overlap with the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK in the time domain, transmitting the eMBB HARQ-ACK by using the eMBB PUSCH resource in a multiplex manner may cause the eMBB HARQ-ACK to be dropped or partially dropped.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, there is provided a method for transmitting a HARQ-ACK, performed by user equipment (UE), including:</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">S<b>110</b>: in a case that there is an overlap between a PUCCH resource carrying an eMBB HARQ-ACK and an eMBB PUSCH resource in a time domain, in response to determining, before a predetermined moment, that there is an overlap between the PUCCH resource carrying an URLLC HARQ-ACK and the eMBB PUSCH resource in the time domain while there is no overlap between the PUCCH resource carrying the URLLC HARQ-ACK and the PUCCH resource of the eMBB HARQ-ACK in the time domain, the eMBB HARQ-ACK is transmitted on the PUCCH resource of the eMBB HARQ-ACK, wherein the predetermined moment is an earlier one of a time domain start moment of the eMBB PUSCH resource and a time domain start moment of the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the method is applied to various UEs. The UE may be a human-mounted mobile terminal and/or a vehicle-mounted mobile terminal. For example, the human-mounted mobile terminal may be a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a wearable device, or the like. The vehicle-mounted mobile terminal may include vehicle-mounted devices on vehicles such as private cars and buses.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The PUCCH resource is a communication resource allocated to the PUCCH, where the communication resource includes a time domain resource and a frequency domain resource.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK is a communication resource scheduled on the PUCCH to transmit the eMBB HARQ-ACK. The eMBB HARQ-ACK is feedback information of downlink eMBB service data.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The PUCCH resource carrying the URLLC HARQ-ACK is a communication resource scheduled on the PUCCH to transmit the URLLC HARQ-ACK.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The eMBB PUSCH resource may be a PUSCH resource for the UE to upload the eMBB service data. Therefore, the UE can send the eMBB service data to the base station on a corresponding resource of the PUSCH.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The eMBB HARQ-ACK is feedback information for the eMBB service data transmitted on the PDSCH, and can be divided into an acknowledgement (ACK) and a non-acknowledgement (NACK). The ACK indicates that the data is successfully received, and the NACK indicates that the data fails to be received.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The URLLC HARQ-ACK is feedback information for the URLLC service data transmitted on the PDSCH, and can also be divided into the ACK and NACK.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">If the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK and the eMBB PUSCH resource overlap in time domain, it will be further determined whether the PUCCH resource carrying the URLLC HARQ-ACK overlaps with the eMBB PUSCH resource and the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK in the time domain, respectively; namely, whether there is an overlapping relationship between the PUCCH resource carrying the URLLC HARQ-ACK and the eMBB PUSCH resource in the time domain, and whether there is an overlapping relationship between the PUCCH resource carrying the URLLC HARQ-ACK and the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK in the time domain.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The overlapping relationship includes overlap in the time domain and no overlap in the time domain. Herein, the overlap in the time domain means that times occupied by the two resources have an overlapping part, and the no overlap in the time domain means that the times occupied by the two resources have no overlapping part.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The predetermined moment is a relatively early one of a time domain start moment of the eMBB PUSCH resource and a time domain start moment of the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK. For example, if the start moment of the eMBB PUSCH resource is earlier than that of the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK, the predetermined moment is the start moment of the eMBB PUSCH resource; and if the start moment of the eMBB PUSCH resource is later than that of the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK, the predetermined moment is the start moment of the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, a start position of the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK is compared with that of the eMBB PUSCH resource in the time domain to determine the earlier one.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Since a delay of an URLLC service is shorter than that of an eMBB service, when the URLLC HARQ-ACK is transmitted, if the limitation of the transmit power of the UE and/or the UE transmitting the URLLC HARQ-ACK and the eMBB service data on the PUSCH resource simultaneously at one point in time leads to high power consumption, the UE may drop the eMBB PUSCH resource; at this time, if the eMBB HARQ-ACK is still transmitted by using the eMBB PUSCH resource in a multiplex manner, the base station will not receive the eMBB HARQ-ACK, thereby causing downlink retransmission of unnecessary eMBB service data by the base station.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In view of this, if the PUCCH resource carrying the URLLC HARQ-ACK overlaps with the eMBB PUSCH resource and the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK also overlaps with the eMBB PUSCH resource, in order to ensure the timely transmission of the eMBB HARQ-ACK, the eMBB HARQ-ACK will not be transmitted by using the eMBB PUSCH resource in a multiplex manner, but it is further determined whether to drop the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK according to the overlapping relationship between the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK and the PUCCH resource carrying the URLLC HARQ-ACK in the time domain. If there is no overlap between the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK and the PUCCH resource carrying the URLLC HARQ-ACK in the time domain, the eMBB HARQ-ACK is not required to avoid due to the low latency of the URLLC HARQ-ACK, and thus, the eMBB HARQ-ACK is still transmitted using the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK at this time. Further, since there is no overlap between the PUCCH resource carrying the URLLC HARQ-ACK and the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK in the time domain, the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK and the PUCCH resource carrying the URLLC HARQ-ACK can be used respectively to transmit the eMBB HARQ-ACK and the URLLC HARQ-ACK within a time domain position of the eMBB PUSCH resource, thereby reducing the missed transmission of the eMBB HARQ-ACK due to directly transmitting the eMBB HARQ-ACK by using the eMBB PUSCH resource in a multiplex manner when there is an overlap between the eMBB HARQ-ACK and the eMBB PUSCH resource in the time domain.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the method further includes:</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">S<b>101</b>: a first time domain resource position of the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK is determined;</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">S<b>102</b>: a second time domain resource position of the eMBB PUSCH resource is determined; and</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">S<b>103</b>: it is determined whether there is an overlap between the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK and the eMBB PUSCH resource in the time domain based on the first time domain resource position and the second time domain resource position.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Since the URLLC service is generally a burst and low-latency service, if there is a need for transmission, it is necessary to schedule a corresponding resource for transmission as soon as possible, it is necessary to know a transmission status of the URLLC in time, and it is necessary to retransmit as soon as possible when the transmission fails. Therefore, a time interval between a delivery moment of a downlink scheduling instruction used by the base station while scheduling a resource carrying the URLLC service and a start moment of scheduling the PUSCH resource carrying the URLLC service or transmitting the URLLC HARQ-ACK is small. However, a delay requirement of the eMBB service is shorter than that of the URLLC service, and thus an interval between a transmission resource carrying the eMBB service and a transmission resource of the eMBB HARQ-ACK is relatively large in the time domain. Therefore, when it is determined that there is a URLLC HARQ-ACK needs to be fed back, the UE can predict in advance whether there is an overlap between the eMBB PUSCH resource and the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK in the time domain based on this resource configuration feature. If there is no overlap in the time domain, the eMBB HARQ-ACK is transmitted on a corresponding PUCCH resource, and whether the eMBB PUSCH resource is dropped depends on whether there is an overlap among the PUCCH resources carrying the URLLC HARQ-ACK the time domain. If there is an overlap between the eMBB PUSCH resource and the PUCCH resource carrying the URLLC HARQ-ACK in the time domain, the eMBB PUSCH resource is dropped or punched.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The first time domain resource position is a position of a time domain resource occupied by the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK, for example, a start moment and an end moment of the PUCCH resource.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The second time domain resource position is a position of a time domain resource occupied by the eMBB PUSCH resource, for example, a start moment and an end moment of the eMBB PUSCH resource.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">There are many manners to determine the first time domain resource position and the second time domain resource position. Specifically, the first time domain resource position and the second time domain resource position can be determined according to a scheduling manner of the eMBB physical downlink shared channel (Physical Downlink Shared Channel, PDSCH) and a scheduling manner of the eMBB PUSCH.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">For example, in response to dynamic scheduling of the eMBB PDSCH resource, the first time domain resource position is determined according to a downlink scheduling instruction for scheduling the eMBB PDSCH. The downlink scheduling instruction for scheduling the eMBB PDSCH can be carried in downlink control information (Downlink Control Information, DCI) of a physical layer. The DCI will indicate a resource identification of the eMBB PDSCH resource, so that the time domain resource position of the eMBB PDSCH resource can be determined according to the resource identification. At the same time, the downlink scheduling instruction for scheduling the eMBB PDSCH also carries an offset (K1) information field and a PUCCH resource indicator (PUCCH Resource Indicator, PRI). The PUCCH resource indicator indicates a time domain resource set of the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK, and the K1 information field indicates a slot quantity of an interval between between the eMBB PDSCH resource and the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK. Therefore, the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK is determined from the PUCCH resource indicated by the PRI based on the K1, and then the first time domain resource position can be determined.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In response to semi-persistent scheduling of the eMBB PDSCH, the first time domain resource position is determined according to configuration information of the semi-persistent scheduling eMBB PDSCH resource and an activation indication carried by activation DCI.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">For example, the configuration information of the eMBB PDSCH resource is delivered by the base station through high level signaling (for example, Radio Resource Control, RCC). The configuration information may include a period of semi-persistent scheduling of the eMBB PDSCH resource. The period of semi-persistent scheduling may have a default start moment. For example, the default start moment of the period of semi-persistent scheduling is a first symbol contained in a slot. The activation DCI may carry an offset of an activation semi-persistent scheduling period, and thus a start moment when the semi-persistent scheduling period is activated can be known according to the offset relative to the default start moment. For another example, the activation DCI may also carry occupation duration of the eMBB PDSCH resource. The first time domain resource position can be determined by combining a relationship among PUCCH resources carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK corresponding to the semi-persistent scheduling eMBB PDSCH resource.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the eMBB HARQ-ACK is feedback information of eMBB service data transmitted on the eMBB PDSCH resource.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Similarly, the eMBB PUSCH resource also has two manners, namely, dynamic scheduling and configured grant scheduling.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">For example, in response to the dynamic scheduling of the eMBB PUSCH resource, the second time domain resource position is determined according to an uplink scheduling instruction for scheduling the eMBB PUSCH.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The uplink scheduling instruction may be carried in the DCI, and the DCI may directly indicate the eMBB PUSCH resource. Therefore, the second time domain resource position can be easily and quickly determined according to the uplink scheduling instruction.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In response to the configured grant scheduling of the eMBB PUSCH resource, the second time domain resource position is determined according to configured grant scheduling information.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The configured grant scheduling information is scheduling information generated by performing the configured grant scheduling of the eMBB PUSCH resource. The configured grant scheduling of the eMBB PUSCH resource may include:</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">a first semi-persistent scheduling manner of the eMBB PUSCH resource; and</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">a second semi-persistent scheduling manner of the eMBB PUSCH resource.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the first semi-persistent scheduling manner, the configured grant scheduling information is delivered by the base station through the high level signaling, and the configured grant scheduling information includes all scheduling information of the eMBB PUSCH resource, for example, a semi-persistent period of the eMBB PUSCH resource, an offset of the semi-persistent period, and a resource length of the eMBB PUSCH resource.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In the second semi-persistent scheduling manner, an initial configuration of the eMBB PUSCH resource is performed according to the configured grant scheduling information delivered by the base station through the high level signaling, and then the eMBB PUS CH resource is jointly scheduled by combining with the activation DCI delivered by the physical layer. For example, the initial configuration defines the semi-persistent period of the eMBB PUSCH resource. At this time, the activation DCI may carry the offset of the semi-persistent period and the resource length of the eMBB PUSCH resource.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Manners for determining the first time domain resource position and the second time domain resource position are given above, and the specific implementation is not limited to these manners.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">In some embodiments, the method as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> further includes:</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">S<b>104</b>: a third time domain resource position of the PUCCH resource carrying the URLLC HARQ-ACK is determined;</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">S<b>105</b>: it is determined whether there is an overlap between the PUCCH resource carrying the URLLC HARQ-ACK and the PUCCH resource carrying the eMBB HARQ-ACK in the time domain based on the first time domain resource position and the third time domain resource position; and</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">S<b>106</b>: it is determined whether there is an overlap between the PUCCH resource carrying the URLLC HARQ-ACK and the eMBB PUSCH resource in the time domain based on the second time domain resource position and the third time domain resource position.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Considering information types, for example, both the URLLC HARQ-ACK and the eMBB HARQ-ACK belong to control information, while the eMBB service data belongs to service information. At the same time, considering a difference of service types, the delay requirement of the URLLC service is higher than that of the eMBB. A transmission priority of the URLLC HARQ-ACK, the eMBB HARQ-ACK and the eMBB service data transmitted by the eMBB PUSCH resource is that the transmission priority of the URLLC HARQ-ACK is higher than that of the eMBB HARQ-ACK, and the transmission priority of the eMBB HARQ-ACK is higher than that of the eMBB service data.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">After the first time domain resource position and the second time domain resource position are determined, it can be determined whether there is an overlapping relationship among the above three resources in the time domain by comparison.
