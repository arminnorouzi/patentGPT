The tailgate is provided to open or close an opening formed at a rear portion of a vehicle. The tailgate is typically hinged to the main vehicle body, for example, along its upper end, such that it can swing open and close. Examples of tailgates include a rear door tailgate or a truck lid tailgate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The tailgate may support one or more other vehicle components, such as a rear glass window and one or more light assemblies (e.g., a supplemental brake light, a puddle light). The tailgate may also be adjacent to body cavities into which rear lamp units are inserted. These parts and other parts may add to the cost and complexity of assembling a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Light assemblies in vehicles, in particular, comprise a large number of separate components. For example, a typical vehicle may have several different types of lights, including, for example, parking lights, turn indicator lights, brake lights, and the like. Each of these lights may be made from many parts. These parts add to the cost and complexity of assembling a vehicle. Accordingly, as recognized in U.S. Pat. No. 7,048,423 (&#x201c;the '423 Patent&#x201d;), it desirable to have a lighting assembly with fewer parts. The '423 Patent discloses an integrated light assembly including a plurality of lamps <b>210</b>, <b>216</b> enclosed in a housing <b>202</b>, which may serve as a lens for the lamps, and mounted on a substrate <b>204</b>. Because the lamps <b>210</b>, <b>216</b> share a common substrate and lens, the additional cost of having a separate lamp assembly is eliminated. This structure disclosed in the '423 Patent, however, has many drawbacks. For one, because multiple lamps are mounted together in a single housing without sidewalls or reflectors for directing the angle of their light, the structure does not account for haziness issues. Moreover, if two lights of varying color are mounted in the housing, the structure disclosed in the '423 Patent does not have a way of preventing color overlap. These drawbacks may limit the use of such a light assembly in a vehicle under state and federal regulations governing vehicle lighting requirements. Thus, while the '423 Patent discloses an integrated part for a vehicle, its application may be limited.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Inhomogeneities such as seams and openings between separate vehicle components may also add to the cost of assembling, sealing and/or insulating an interior of the vehicle and/or its components. Moreover such seams and openings may cause aerodynamic inefficiencies and disturb the vehicle's overall aesthetical appearance. Additional components may also be required to connect separate vehicle components to one another, which may add to the overall weight of a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Many vehicles also have opaque regions around edges of their windows in order to conceal rubber seals, wires and/or adhesives. For example, a vehicle may have window may include an outer fritted region or a region having a dot pattern. These opaque regions are typically formed of a thin layer of adhesive film. Over time, however, the adhesive behind this thin layer of film may wear away and the film may detach from the surface of a window, thereby deteriorating the component's overall aesthetic appeal and/or exposing concealed components.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure aims to solve these problems and other problems in the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with the purpose(s) of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, this disclosure, in one aspect, relates to vehicle components, including tailgates, and to surfaces of a plastic glazing of a tailgate including textures and/or patterns.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As will be apparent from the present disclosure, problems and/or objectives for improvement with respect to a tailgate including plastic glazing, as described herein, may include providing a tailgate that integrates one or more other components of a vehicle, thereby reducing a total number of components of a vehicle and reducing the complexity and cost of assembling a vehicle.

The one-piece monolithic structure can be fabricated in one piece using an injection molding process. Vehicles of a hatchback or van configuration typically include an access opening at their rear and a tailgate that selectively opens and closes the access opening. The tailgate may be mounted on the main body of the vehicle using a hinged connection. As such, the tailgate may operate like a hinged flap, which swings open and close along the hinged connection. The tailgate is typically operated manually but may also be operated electronically using a power actuator.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The tailgate may support one or more other vehicle components such as a rear window, a logo or marking, a light assembly or unit, a license plate holder, etc. These components are usually attached to the tailgate using screws or other connectors or an adhesive. In its closed position, the tailgate may also be adjacent to one or more cavities in the body of the vehicle for receiving a rear lamp unit or other light unit.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In order to reduce the number of separate components of a vehicle, systems and methods disclosed herein may provide an integrated tailgate assembly including and/or integrating one or more other vehicle components. For example, systems and methods disclosed herein may provide a tailgate having a plastic glazing including a rear window. The plastic glazing of the tailgate may be constructed of a thermoplastic polymer including a portion that is clear as the rear window. In other systems and methods disclosed herein, additional vehicle components may also be included in the plastic glazing. Such components may include, for example, a colored translucent portion for a rear light unit; an additional translucent portion for a courtesy light, a license plate light, or other light unit; a cavity and fixation unit (e.g., a threaded hole, a hook or clip) for supporting a light unit; a cavity and fixation unit for supporting a license plate; a textured and/or raised region for a logo or other marking; a spoiler or other aerodynamic feature; an opening that serves as a ventilation opening; and the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Systems and methods disclosed herein may also provide a tailgate that reduces a number of inhomogeneities, seams, and other disruptions, interruptions, and gaps along a surface of a vehicle, thereby increasing an aesthetic appearance of the vehicle and increasing aerodynamic performance. Systems and methods disclosed herein further may provide a tailgate that conceals one or more other features of a vehicle, such as, for example, a light unit, thereby increasing an aesthetic appearance of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Systems and methods disclosed herein may also provide a method of manufacturing a tailgate or, specifically, a plastic glazing of a tailgate. Such systems and methods may provide a method of producing a plastic glazing using multi-shot injection molding techniques. For example, in certain aspects of the disclosure, a plastic glazing of a tailgate may be formed via a three-shot injection molding process. In a first shot, a clear thermoplastic polymer may be injected to form a shell or outline of the plastic glazing. In a second shot, a colored thermoplastic polymer may be injected to form one or more colored regions in the plastic glazing. For example, a red thermoplastic polymer may be injected to form a red translucent region to serve as the lens for a rear light of a vehicle. In an additional shot, a non-transparent thermoplastic may be injected to form a blackout region (e.g., opaque or substantially opaque region) of the plastic glazing. The blackout region may form a border around a rear window.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Systems and methods disclosed herein may also provide a plastic glazing of a tailgate having a textured surface or a pattern. The textured surface or pattern may be disposed on a window or adjacent to a window formed in the plastic glazing. The window may be formed by a clear translucent portion of the plastic glazing. The textured surface or pattern may conceal one or more other vehicle components, such as, for example, electric wiring. The textured surface or pattern may also conceal any adhesive of fixation mechanisms used to attach the plastic glazing to a housing unit or other component of the tailgate. In certain aspects, the textured surface or pattern may be provided on an interior surface of a portion of the plastic glazing near the edges of the window. In certain aspects, the textured surface or pattern may be formed by a non-transparent thermoplastic polymer forming a blackout region on or adjacent to the window. In other aspects, the textured surface or pattern may be formed by a translucent thermoplastic polymer that forms the window. In still other aspect, the textured surface or pattern may be formed by a film disposed on a thermoplastic layer of the plastic glazing.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an exemplary plastic glazing <b>100</b> of a tailgate of a vehicle is depicted. The plastic glazing <b>100</b> may be a one-piece monolithic structure formed of one or more thermoplastic polymers. Examples of suitable thermoplastic polymers include: polycarbonate, polyester carbonate, poly methyl methacrylate, and the like. According to a preferred aspect of the disclosure, the plastic glazing <b>100</b> may be formed of a polycarbonate. The plastic glazing <b>100</b> can have an outer surface that is seamless, i.e., lacking any visual openings, junctions, disruptions, interruptions, gaps, or the like.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The plastic glazing <b>100</b> has a first colored portion <b>102</b> that functions as a portion of a right tail lamp of the vehicle, and a second colored portion <b>104</b> that functions as a portion of a left tail lamp of the vehicle. In particular, the colored portions <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> can function as lenses of the tail lamps of the vehicle. The plastic glazing <b>100</b> also has a third portion <b>106</b> for an additional light unit such as, for example, an axillary brake light or a courtesy light. The plastic glazing <b>100</b> also includes a clear translucent portion <b>108</b> that functions as a rear window of the vehicle, and a colored non-transparent portion <b>110</b>. The colored non-transparent portion may be strategically placed to hide one or more structures positioned behind the plastic glazing <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a housing unit <b>200</b> of a tailgate is depicted. The housing unit <b>200</b> may be formed of a fiber-reinforced polymer. According to a preferred aspect of the disclosure, the housing unit <b>200</b> may be formed of a long-glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene such as, for example, SABIC&#xae; STAMAX&#x2122; plastic. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the housing unit <b>200</b> comprises one or more cavities for receiving a light unit.

The light units <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> can be fixed directly onto the housing unit <b>200</b> via access doors and/or using mechanical fasteners (e.g., screw, bolt, and the like). The cavities <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> can prevent light from the light units from bleeding outside of a confined space. As such, additional cavities (not depicted) may be formed next to the cavities <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> for holding additional light units, and the cavities would prevent the light generated by one light unit from bleeding into a space reserved for another light unit.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The light units <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> may be a single type of light unit. For example, the light units <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> can be brake light units. Alternatively, the light units <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> may comprise more than one kind of light unit. For example, the light units <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> can be brake light units, and the light unit <b>206</b> can be a courtesy light unit.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The plastic glazing <b>100</b> may be secured to the housing unit <b>200</b> such that the light units <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> are disposed between the plastic glazing <b>100</b> and the housing unit <b>200</b>. In particular, the plastic glazing <b>100</b> may be secured to the housing unit <b>200</b> such that the light units <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> are disposed behind the portions <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> (depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The light unit <b>202</b> may be disposed behind the first colored portion <b>102</b>, the light unit <b>204</b> may be disposed behind the second colored portion <b>104</b>, and the light unit <b>206</b> may be disposed behind the third portion <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Light emitted from the light units <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> through the portions <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> of the plastic glazing <b>100</b> may be emitted as a colored light in accordance with certain international standards governing vehicle lighting such as, for example, ECE Regulation No. 48 and SAE Standard J578.

Moreover, the dark component <b>322</b> and the colored component <b>324</b> would not create any inhomogeneities or raised portions on a surface of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0057">A first portion of the clear translucent component <b>320</b> that does not overlap the dark component <b>322</b> and the colored component <b>324</b> in the longitudinal direction (i.e., a direction along the line B-B) may form the translucent portion <b>308</b> that functions as the rear window of the vehicle. The colored component <b>324</b> and a second portion of the clear translucent component <b>320</b> that overlaps the colored component <b>324</b> in the longitudinal direction may form the colored portion <b>304</b> that functions as a lens of a tail lamp unit. And the dark component <b>322</b> and additional portions of the clear translucent component <b>320</b> that overlap the dark component <b>322</b> in the longitudinal direction may form the non-transparent portion <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0058">The plastic glazing <b>300</b> may be manufactured or produced using an injection molding technique. In particular, the plastic glazing <b>300</b> may be produced using a three-shot injection molding technique. The three-shot injection molding technique may use a mold cavity that can be altered between different volumes. The mold cavity may be an example of a molding apparatus. The mold cavity may be set to a first volume for receiving a first shot of material. The first shot of material may form the translucent component <b>320</b>. Accordingly, the mold cavity may be set to a volume corresponding to that of the translucent component <b>320</b>. A first material may be injected into the mold cavity to form the translucent component <b>320</b>. The first material may be a clear, translucent thermoplastic polymer such as, for example, a clear polycarbonate. After the first shot has been injected, the mold cavity may be changed from its first volume into a second volume.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0059">The next shot of material may form the colored component <b>324</b>. Accordingly, the mold cavity can be set to a volume corresponding to that of the colored component <b>324</b>. A second material may be injected into the mold cavity to form the colored component <b>324</b>. The second material may be a similar type of material as the first material so that heat released by the second material along the edge of the first material may melt and fuse (i.e., combine) the colored component <b>324</b> to the clear translucent component <b>320</b>. As such, if the first material is a clear polycarbonate, the second material may be a colored polycarbonate, such as, for example, a red polycarbonate. After the second shot has been injected, the mold cavity can be changed from its second volume to a third volume. The third and final shot of material may form the dark component <b>322</b>. Accordingly, the mold cavity can be set to a volume corresponding to that of the dark component <b>322</b>. Such may involve taking into account the portion of the cavity already filled by the first and second shots. A third material may be injected into the mold cavity to form the dark component <b>322</b>. The third material also may be a similar type of material as the first and second materials such that heat released by the third material along the end of the first and second materials may melt and fuse the other components to the dark component <b>322</b>. After the third shot, the entire molded assembly may be left to cool.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0060">According to certain aspects of the disclosure, the order of the second shot and the third shot can be changed. Thus, instead of injecting the second material to form the colored component <b>324</b> in the second shot, the third material for forming the dark component <b>322</b> can be injected during the second shot. In such aspects, the mold cavity can be adjusted first to a volume corresponding to the dark component <b>322</b> and then to a volume corresponding to the colored component <b>324</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>11</b></figref> present alternative embodiments of a region labeled A (depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of the second exemplary plastic glazing <b>300</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> show a first embodiment where the section <b>312</b> has a textured surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref> show a second embodiment where the section <b>312</b> has a pattern. And <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>11</b></figref> show a third embodiment where the section <b>312</b> has an inverted frit pattern. Each of these embodiments will be discussed in turn below.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0062">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the section <b>312</b> of the plastic glazing <b>300</b> has a textured surface. The textured surface is disposed next to the translucent portion <b>308</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the section <b>312</b> along line C-C depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the section <b>312</b> may be formed of a translucent component <b>400</b>. The translucent component <b>400</b> can correspond to the translucent component <b>320</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In other words, the translucent component <b>400</b> may be a separate region of the same translucent component <b>320</b>. The translucent component <b>400</b> may have a textured surface having a plurality of raised structures <b>402</b>. In an aspect of the disclosure, the raised structures may be microstructures.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0063">The plurality of raised structures <b>402</b> may be disposed on a side of the translucent component <b>400</b> towards an interior of the vehicle. As such, the plurality of raised structures <b>402</b> would not be subject to environmental factors on the outside of the vehicle. The plurality of raised structures <b>402</b> may reduce a degree of transparency of the translucent component <b>400</b> due to their influence on the passage of light through the translucent component <b>400</b>. In particular, the plurality of raised structures <b>402</b> can scatter and/or diffuse light, thereby reducing the visibility of items disposed on either side of the translucent component <b>400</b> from the other side. By reducing the transparency of the translucent component <b>400</b>, the plurality of raised structures <b>402</b> can help to conceal a vehicle component located behind the section <b>312</b>. Such may include, for example, a housing unit of the tailgate, adhesives or other fixation mechanisms used to attach the plastic glazing to the housing unit, wires around an edge of a rear window of a vehicle, and the like.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0064">Because the plurality of raised structures <b>402</b> of the textured surface reduces the transparency of the translucent component <b>400</b>, it may not be necessary to have a dark component, such as, for example, the dark component <b>322</b> described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, to black out the section <b>312</b> of the plastic glazing <b>300</b>. As described above, a dark component (e.g., the dark component <b>322</b>) that is placed behind a translucent component (e.g., the translucent component <b>320</b>) may also serve to conceal one or more vehicle component and/or fixation mechanisms behind a region of the plastic tailgate. The addition of the dark component, however, may add to the weight of a vehicle. Moreover, the dark component may completely eliminate the passage of light through the translucent component <b>400</b> into the interior of the vehicle, thereby creating a darker environment within the vehicle. Such can be avoided through the use of a textured surface, such as the textured surface depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> having the plurality of raised structures <b>402</b>. The textured surface would be formed on an existing component (i.e., the translucent component <b>400</b>), and therefore would not add to the overall weight of the vehicle. The textured surface can also be adjusted to allow an optimal degree of light through into the interior of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0065">The plurality of raised structures <b>402</b> may be formed when the translucent component <b>400</b> is molded using an injection molding technique. As described above, the translucent component <b>320</b> may be formed using an injection molding technique, whereby a first cavity is configured to receive a shot of clear translucent material. Similar to the translucent component <b>320</b>, the translucent component <b>400</b> may be formed using a mold cavity that is configured to receive a shot of clear translucent material. The clear translucent material may be, for example, a clear polycarbonate resin. The mold cavity may comprise a surface having a plurality of indentations that is configured to form the plurality of raised structures <b>402</b>. Thus, when the clear translucent material is injected into the mold cavity, the resulting translucent component (i.e., the translucent component <b>400</b>) would have a surface having the plurality of raised structures <b>402</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0066">While the textured surface depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> is shown to have a plurality of lines or ridges, one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that other types of textures, including textures formed of dots and other types of structures can also be used.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0067">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, an alternative embodiment of the section <b>312</b> is depicted. The section <b>312</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> has a pattern. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts a cross-sectional view of the section <b>312</b> including the pattern. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the section <b>312</b> may comprise a translucent component <b>502</b> and a patterned film <b>506</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0068">The translucent component <b>502</b> may correspond to the translucent component <b>320</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> (i.e., be a separate region of the same translucent component <b>320</b>). The patterned film <b>506</b> comprises the pattern, which is visible through the translucent component <b>502</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). The patterned film <b>506</b> can be disposed behind the translucent component <b>502</b> towards an interior of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0069">Similar to the textured surface described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the pattern of the patterned film <b>506</b> may also conceal a vehicle component located behind the section <b>312</b>. Such may include, for example, a housing unit of the tailgate, adhesives or other fixation mechanisms used to attach the plastic glazing to the housing unit, wires around an edge of a rear window of a vehicle, and the like. The patterned film may include translucent and non-transparent portions. The patterned film may allow for the inclusion of complex patterns that may not be easily injection molded using a single-colored component such as, for example, a dark component (e.g., the dark component <b>322</b>). The patterned film may also remove the need for a dark component (e.g., the dark component <b>322</b>), which may reduce an overall weight of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0070">The section <b>312</b> may be formed as part of an injection molding process for forming the plastic glazing <b>300</b>, similar to the one described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The specific type of injection molding process may be referred to as film insert molding, also known as in-mold decoration. Each of the translucent component <b>502</b> and the patterned film <b>506</b> may be a polycarbonate resin or other thermoplastic polymer. In a preferred aspect, both components are formed using the same thermoplastic polymer to enable optimal bonding between the separate components.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0071">The pattern on the patterned film <b>506</b> may be ink printed onto a first surface. The ink printed onto the first surface of the patterned film <b>506</b> may comprise a polymer resin such as, for example, a polycarbonate resin. The ink may be applied onto the first surface of the patterned film <b>506</b> via screen printing, although other method of printing known to those skill in the art are also acceptable, such as but not limited to mask/spray in-jet, and pad or tampon printing. Once the ink is printed, drying should be thorough to ensure that any retained solvent is removed from the print. Residual or retained solvent may cause problems at a later stage with cracking/crazing of the polycarbonate itself due to solvent damage. The inks may be thermally cured by being exposed to an elevated temperature for a period of time. For example, a printed ink can be substantially cured upon exposure to about 90-125&#xb0; C. for about 20-60 minutes. The thickness of the cured ink print is typically about 4 micrometers to 20 micrometers, with between about 8 micrometers to 18 micrometers being preferred.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0072">After the ink pattern has been applied to the patterned film <b>506</b>, the patterned film <b>506</b> may be trimmed to a desired shape. For example, the patterned film <b>506</b> may be trimmed such that it conforms to an area corresponding to the section <b>312</b>. In a preferred aspect of the disclosure, the thickness of the patterned film <b>506</b> is approximately 0.05 to 2 millimeters. The small thickness allows the patterned film <b>506</b> to be shaped prior to being bonded to one or more other components (e.g., the translucent component <b>502</b>).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0073">The patterned film <b>506</b> can be placed into a first mold cavity for receiving a material for forming the translucent component <b>502</b>. Since the section <b>312</b> does not cover an entire surface of the translucent component <b>320</b> (of which a region is the translucent component <b>502</b>), the patterned film <b>506</b> may only cover a portion of the first mold cavity. The patterned film <b>506</b> may be placed into the mold cavity such that the printed ink pattern is disposed towards a wall of the cavity. Through such placement, the ink pattern may be shielded from the heat of the shot of material forming the translucent component <b>502</b>. The patterned film <b>506</b> may be held to the wall of the cavity by vacuum or any other means known to those skilled in the art of film insert molding.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0074">When the shot of material for forming the translucent component <b>502</b> is injected into the mold cavity, it would bond with a second surface of the patterned film <b>506</b> that does not have the ink pattern. In a preferred aspect where the translucent component <b>502</b> and the patterned film <b>506</b> are both the same type of thermoplastic polymer, the heat from the shot of material forming the translucent component <b>502</b> may melt the film layer, thereby causing the two layers to bond together when they cool. The first mold cavity can be adjusted to a second mold cavity (i.e., the volume of the mold cavity may be changed from a first volume to a second volume).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0075">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, another alternative embodiment of the section <b>312</b> is depicted. The section <b>312</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> has a halftone pattern, such as, for example, an inverted frit or dot pattern. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts a cross-sectional view of the section <b>312</b> including the halftone pattern. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the section <b>312</b> comprises a translucent component <b>602</b> and a dark component <b>604</b>. The translucent component <b>602</b> may correspond to the translucent component <b>320</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> (i.e., be a separate region of the same translucent component <b>320</b>). The dark component <b>604</b> may correspond to the dark component <b>322</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> (i.e., be a separate region of the same dark component <b>322</b>).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0076">The dark component <b>604</b> may be formed in the shape of the halftone pattern. The dark component <b>604</b> can be disposed behind the translucent component <b>602</b> toward an interior of the vehicle. The dark component <b>604</b> can be bonded to the translucent component <b>602</b> in an injection molding process. Such a bonding process may comprise a polymerization where a molecules of the first material and molecules of the second material react together to form polymer chains.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0077">As described above, a multi-shot injection technique may be used to form the plastic glazing <b>300</b>. In a first shot, a clear translucent material may be injected into a mold cavity having a first volume to form the translucent component. After the clear translucent component is formed, the mold cavity may be adjusted to a second volume and so on and so forth for receiving additional shots of material. In a second shot (or a third shot), a black or other colored opaque material may be injected to the mold cavity such that it binds with the clear translucent material. The two materials may bind together through melt bonding. That is, heat from the injected opaque material may melt a surface of the already set clear translucent material such that a bond is formed between the two materials when they cool down. With respect to the translucent component <b>602</b> and the dark component <b>604</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the same procedure can be used. The shape of the dark component <b>604</b> (or the section <b>312</b>) may be formed by using a mold cavity that has a volume that is accordingly shaped.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0078">The inverted frit pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> may be formed using a single continuous section of the dark component <b>604</b>. In contrast, a traditional frit pattern, which includes a number of separate dot formations, would require a plurality of separate injection points. The inverted frit pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, while achieving a similar purpose as the traditional frit pattern, removes the need for having multiple injection points.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0079">While the halftone pattern depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an inverted dot pattern, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that other halftone patterns, both inverted and non-inverted, can be used. Such a pattern may also be designed such that it allows the formation of a single connected region of blackout (e.g., the dark component <b>604</b>).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0080">According to certain aspects of the disclosure, the tailgate assembles disclosed herein may also include additional layers on top of the thermoplastic polymer layers. For example, a protective layer such as a weathering layer may be added to a surface of the plastic glazing. An example of such a layer is depicted as item <b>606</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, where such a layer is applied to an interior surface of the plastic glazing. In alternative aspects, such a layer may be applied to both the interior and exterior surface of the plastic glazing, or to only the exterior surface of the plastic glazing. The layer preferably comprises either a polyurethane coating or a combination of an acrylic primer and a silicone hard-coat. Alternatively, other coating systems may be used. An example of such an acrylic primer includes Exatec&#xae; SHP 9X, which is commercially available from Exatec, LLC (Wixom, Mich.) and distributed by General Electric Silicones (Waterford, N.Y.). In one preferred embodiment, the primer is coated on the plastic glazing of the tailgate, air dried, and then thermally cured between about 80&#xb0; C. and 130&#xb0; C. for between about 20 to 80 minutes and more preferably at about 120&#xb0; C. for about 60 minutes. A silicone hard-coat is then applied over the primer layer and is air dried before curing at preferably between about 80&#xb0; C. and 130&#xb0; C. for between about 20 to 80 minutes and more preferably at about 100&#xb0; C. for about 30 minutes. A preferred silicone hard-coat used in the present invention is available from Exatec, LLC and distributed by General Electric Silicones as Exatec&#xae; SHX.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0081">As another example, an abrasion resistance layer can also be applied to a surface of the plastic tailgate or even to another protective layer, such as the weathering layer described above. Specific examples of possible inorganic coatings comprising the abrasion resistant layer include, but are not limited to, aluminum oxide, barium fluoride, boron nitride, hafnium oxide, lanthanum fluoride, magnesium fluoride, magnesium oxide, scandium oxide, silicon monoxide, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxy-nitride, silicon oxy-carbide, silicon carbide, hydrogenated silicon oxy-carbide, tantalum oxide, titanium oxide, tin oxide, indium tin oxide, yttrium oxide, zinc oxide, zinc selenide, zinc sulfide, zirconium oxide, zirconium titanate, or glass, and mixtures or blends thereof. The abrasion resistant layer may be applied by any technique known to those skilled in the art. These techniques include deposition from reactive species, such as those employed in vacuum-assisted deposition processes, and atmospheric coating processes, such as those used to apply sol-gel coatings to substrates.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0082">As another example, an additional layer for adding more support to the thermoplastic polymer layers may also be added to an interior surface of the plastic glazing. This additional layer may be formed of a plastic, a metal, or other material for increasing the structural strength of the tailgate.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0083">It will be appreciated that the present disclosure may include any one and up to all of the following examples.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0084">Example 1: A plastic glazing of a tailgate of a vehicle, the plastic glazing comprising: a first translucent component, wherein a portion of the first translucent component forms a rear window of the vehicle;
