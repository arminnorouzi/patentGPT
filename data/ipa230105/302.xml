A representative example of the robot for home use is a cleaning robot. The cleaning robot is a mobile robot capable of automatically cleaning a cleaning space by traveling on a certain region by itself and sucking foreign substances such as dust accumulated on a floor, or wiping the floor with a rotary mop while moving by using the rotary mop. In addition, it is possible to clean a floor by damp-wiping the floor by supplying water to the rotary mop.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, when the water supplied to the rotary mop is not properly adjusted, there is a problem in that a floor, which is a cleaning target, cannot be cleaned appropriately, as if excessive water remains on the floor or the floor is wiped with a dry mop. Korean Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 1020040052094 discloses a cleaning robot capable of cleaning with water that includes a mop roller equipped with a mop cloth on its outer circumference to wipe off the steam sprayed on the floor with dust. The cleaning robot sprays steam onto the surface of a cleaning floor for wet cleaning, and includes a mop cloth to wipe off the sprayed steam and dust. In addition, Korean Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 20140146702 discloses a robot cleaner and a control method for determining whether water can be accommodated inside the robot cleaner capable of wet cleaning.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, at present, it is disclosed that the cleaning is stopped depending on the state of a water tank by detecting the state of the water tank of the wet mop cleaner and transmitting the detection information to a main module. However, a wet mop cleaner for which scheduled cleaning is set has to proceed with cleaning at a scheduled time, but if the cleaning cannot be proceeded with depending on the state of the water tank, a scheduling error occurs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, in some cases, it is required to proceed with cleaning with a dry mop.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To this end, wet mop cleaners that are commercially available in recent years are capable of selectively changing a wet mop mode or a dry mop mode according to the selection of a user. However, the wet mop cleaner has a disadvantage in that the user has to proceed with cleaning by manually changing the modes according to the floor condition at that point of time.</p><heading
