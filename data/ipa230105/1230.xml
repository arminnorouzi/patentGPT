To date, the medical industry does not use germicidal and bactericidal visible light or ultraviolet light during surgical procedures to manage surgical site infections. However, a limited application of ultraviolet light for bactericidal controls are practiced in dental medicine with small and focused emitting handheld equipment for sterilization of root canal and dental implants. The present technology uses a novel application of multiple frequencies, wavelength bandwidths of ultraviolet and visible light during surgical and medical procedures. In 2017, a group from Loyola University reported that in the United States annually, surgical site infections range between 160,000 and 300,000 at a cost of $3.5 to $10 Billion. These costs are related to additional time and care provided to the patients as hospital times are extended to treat surgical site infections. In addition to the high cost and the emotional and physical setbacks that patients suffer from acquiring a surgical site infection, it is documented that about 8,200 Americans die each year from infections caused during surgery. This pervasive problem is addressed herein with programmable lights and electromagnet radiation methods using an apparatus to kill bacteria, viruses, and pathogens in real time during surgical procedures. Various ultraviolet radiations contain wavelengths that can be carcinogenic with over exposure. In the present technology, health risks of over exposures are managed through timed or cycled radiation to administer energy levels within a safe and effective time frame and light frequency range. When electromagnet radiation is managed both for energy levels and exposure times, the use of electromagnet radiation, along with some visible light wavelengths, can kill bacteria viruses and pathogens and be safe of human exposure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition to the surgical light systems light providing illumination and bactericidal benefits, the present technology is designed to use man-made ultraviolet radiation with a wavelength between 300 and 310 nm, at a safe dose rate and scheduled protocol, such that the patient's skin will synthesize vitamin D and D3 to further promote biologic healing at the surgical site.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In 2013, Buonanno, et al. reported 207-nanometer ultraviolet light as a bactericidal tool for surgical site infections. The research indicated that the 207-nanometer ultraviolet light is both safe and beneficial for humans during surgical procedures. Their conclusions were that the 207-nanometer ultraviolet light could be safe and cost effective for surgical site infection management.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Recent work by Yamono et al. (2020) indicates that direct and repetitive illumination from 222-nm ultraviolet radiation C (UVC), which is a powerful sterilizer, does not cause skin cancer in an animal model. The research also suggests that 222-nm UVC is safe for human eyes and skin. The ultraviolet radiation of 222 nanometers has similar antimicrobial effects compared with radiation of 254 nanometers that is known to have human health risks and is considered to be carcinogenic.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Visible light is used in the present technology and provides both illumination and bactericidal effects. Blue light in the spectral range of 407 to 470 nanometers (frequency (749-599 terahertz) is known to kill various pathogens. Other visible light wavelength bandwidths in the 488 to 514 nanometer (frequencies 614-583 terahertz range also kills various bacteria and higher bandwidths around 630 or 780 nanometers (frequencies 475-384 terahertz) are also utilized to kill certain bacteria, viruses and pathogens during application in the medical and dental practice. Each wavelength in both the ultraviolet range and the visible light range are combined into a lighting and radiation system that is programmed to be safe for human use and provide bactericidal functions.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additional ultraviolet and visible lights are known to kill airborne microbial diseases.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">While the above-described devices fulfill their respective, particular objectives and requirements, the aforementioned devices or systems do not describe a medical lighting apparatus, system, method and controls that utilize a 200 to 222 nanometer wavelength as one of many ultraviolet wavelengths integrated into a programmable lighting system for managing or killing surface and airborne pathogens or diseases in medical use during surgery or dental procedures.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A need exists for a new and novel medical lighting apparatus, system, method and controls that can be used for managing or killing surface and airborne pathogens or diseases in medical use during surgery or dental procedures. In this regard, the present technology substantially fulfills this need. In this respect, the medical lighting apparatus, system, method and controls according to the present technology substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art with the use of a fully integrated lighting and pathogen destruction electromagnet radiation system. In doing so provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of managing or killing surface and airborne pathogens or diseases in medical use during surgery or dental procedures.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of pathogen killing light systems, the present technology provides a novel medical lighting apparatus, system, method and controls, and overcomes one or more of the mentioned disadvantages and drawbacks of the prior art. As such, the general purpose of the present technology, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new and novel medical lighting apparatus, system, method and controls and method which has all the advantages of the prior art mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a medical lighting apparatus, system, method and controls which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by the prior art, either alone or in any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to one aspect of the present technology, there can be provided an electromagnetic radiation system for providing bactericidal, germicidal, antimicrobial and/or pathogen killing effects to a target site of a patient using electromagnetic radiation and visible light sources during a time period associated with surgical or medical procedures. The electromagnetic radiation system can include a plurality of first electromagnetic radiation sources, a second electromagnetic radiation source, a third light source and a computer system. The first electromagnetic radiation sources can be configured to radiate a first electromagnetic radiation at a first electromagnetic radiation frequency selected from the group consisting of 1.489-1.350 petahertz (PHz) and 999-967 terahertz (THz). The second electromagnetic radiation source can be configured to radiate a second electromagnetic radiation at a second electromagnetic radiation frequency selected from the group consisting of 749-637 THz, 614-583 THz and 475-384 THz that have pathogen destruction capabilities at engineered and administered energy dose levels. The third light source can be configured to radiate visible light at a wavelength, bandwidth or frequency different than of the first electromagnetic radiation and the second electromagnetic radiation. The third light source can be configured for illumination and high visibility providing a surgeon and medical staff optimal vision while performing a surgical or medical procedure. The computer system can be operable communication with the first electromagnetic radiation sources, the second electromagnetic radiation source and the third light source. The computer system can be configured or configurable to control any one of or any combination of the first electromagnetic radiation source, the second electromagnetic radiation source and the third light source. The first and second electromagnetic radiation frequencies can be configured or configurable to deliver human safe electromagnetic radiation at an energy level and a dose time to the target site on a patient that is effective in destroying harmful pathogens in real time as the surgery or medical procedure is in progress and thereby reducing or eliminating surgical or postoperative infections. The energy level of the first electromagnetic radiation and the second electromagnetic radiation can be at a predetermined power level in watts or milliwatts or microwatts multiplied by the dose time in seconds, which yields an effective electromagnetic radiation dose, which is the energy level in joules, millijoules or microjoules. The effective electromagnetic radiation dose can be configured or configurable for delivery to each square centimeter of the target site on the patient, and electromagnetic radiation doses are scheduled for and delivered to the target site one or multiple times during the surgery or medical procedure. The first electromagnetic radiation sources in the frequency range of 1.489-1.350 PHz can be activated and configured at the power level of one milliwatts and the dose time of 10.0 seconds that results in a dose of 10 millijoules that is delivered to the target site one or multiple times during the surgical or medical procedure to achieve human safe pathogen destruction and to not damage or kill human cells. The 1.489-1.350 PHz electromagnetic radiation at the energy level of 10 millijoules can be configured to destroy and kill fragile microorganisms that are 10 to 100 times smaller than human cells, and wherein the first and second electromagnetic radiation are configured to not penetrate, affect, damage or kill the human cells because of the size of the human cells are one to two magnitudes larger than the microorganisms.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another aspect of the present technology, there can be provided a method of using an electromagnetic radiation system for providing bactericidal, germicidal, antimicrobial and/or pathogen killing effects to a target site of a patient or animal care. The method can include the steps of providing an electromagnetic radiation system deployable using an attachable device selected from the group consisting of a ceiling or wall mounted light and electromagnetic radiation system with an articulable arm, a floor stand, and a mobile base. The electromagnetic radiation system can use electromagnetic radiation and visible light sources during a time period associated with surgical or medical procedures. The electromagnetic radiation system can include a third light source configured to radiate visible light at a wavelength, bandwidth or frequency for illumination and high visibility which provides the surgeon and medical staff optimal vision while performing a surgical or medical procedure. The electromagnetic radiation frequency can be 1.489-1.350 petahertz (PHz). An overhead surgical lighting fixture where the lighting and electromagnetic radiation system can be mounted on the articulating arm allows for a distance to be adjusted variable distances above the target site and depending on a surgeon's lighting preferences the third light source is adjustable by the surgeon or medical staff several times during the surgical or medical procedure. A laser mounted can be in a center of the lighting and electromagnetic radiation system and can be configured to transmit on a middle of the target site. The laser can simultaneously measure a distance to the target site, where an inverse square law of light can be used to calculate and subsequently make automated adjustments to the electromagnetic radiation power based on the distance between the electromagnetic radiation source and the target site to deliver a human safe pathogen destroying dose of selected electromatic radiation. The electromagnetic radiation system can be programmed or programmable to make power changes in microwatts or milliwatts based on the distance measured by the laser so that the same electromagnetic radiation dose in microjoules or millijoules is delivered during each scheduled pathogen destruction electromagnetic radiation when the distance varies, and where every the distance between the lighting and electromagnetic radiation system and the target site receives the same electromagnetic radiation dose during the delivered one or multiple times during the surgical or medical procedure duration for the pathogen destruction doses to the target site in real time. The system engineering and computer programming can be configured or configurable to make automatic adjustments in the lighting and electromagnetic radiation system that results in killing and destroying pathogens while the doses of electromagnetic radiation are harmless to patients and medical providers.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A method of using an electromagnetic radiation system configured to radiate a third light source at a wavelength, bandwidth or frequency for illumination and high visibility which provides the surgeon and medical staff optimal vision while performing a surgical or medical procedure and an electromagnetic radiation frequency being a plurality of electromagnetic radiation frequency of 1.489-1.350 PHz sources. The lighting and electromagnetic system can be ceiling or wall mounted with an articulating or on a floor stand that is mobile, where both the ceiling or wall mounted system and the floor stand system can provide height and spatial adjustment capabilities.

However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present technology may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from these specific details.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Frequencies at a designed and employed energy level in both ultraviolet and visible light have germicidal and bactericidal benefits for medical applications. The present technology is novel because it provides multiple frequencies. wavelengths or bandwidths of ultraviolet and visible light for illumination and pathogen killing electromagnetic radiation are all part of the integrated lighting system that are used during a medical procedure or surgery. The apparatus is designed for use as a safe bactericidal system using electromagnetic radiation in selected frequencies on a programmed scheduled energy and timed dose that uses a method and apparatus for optimal health benefits. Furthermore, it reduces the risk of surgical site infection for the patient. The multiple electromagnetic radiation frequencies and bandwidths are controlled separately through computer programming to provide safe and effective timed dose of the specific electromagnetic radiation with selected frequencies at a programmed or set energy level. The control programming may be cycled on and off over a time period to optimize the health benefits and minimize harmful effects of radiation. The present technology has the capacity for use in real time during a surgical or wound care procedure to reduce surgical site infections by using several spectrums of visible and ultraviolet light and their associated frequency ranges to kill pathogens and microorganisms.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In addition to use during surgical or emergency medical procedures, the apparatus and methods have an equal value for patient care in postoperative patient care. The combined use of the invention during real time surgical procedures and during follow-up care has potential to reduce surgical and wound infections. Surgical site infections prolong the patient's hospital stay on an average of over nine days which substantially increases the cost of patient care.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The present technology may also include the health benefits related to pre-vitamin D synthesis from ultraviolet radiation. The present technology is designed to promote healing by using the medium wavelength ultraviolet radiation as a growth stimulus for cells, tissues, and bones in animals, specifically, humans. The invention uses a combination of light emitting diodes (LED) and specialized gas vapor bulbs as a medical tool and treatment to produce a wavelength of the radiation is within the ultraviolet range of 300 to 310 nanometers. This radiation range is equivalent to the ultraviolet-B sunlight and is responsible for production of vitamin D in the human skin. Vitamin D is vital to life and has been associated with many health benefits.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Light skinned humans adsorb ultraviolet-B sunlight at a rate approximately five times faster than dark skinned humans. Skin color is a factor in treatment when using 300 to 310 nanometers ultraviolet radiations that is generated by specialized lighting equipment and bulbs. This frequency range of 999 to 967 THz at the correct dose will not damage or kill cells as the energy level and time of exposure is programmed and controlled to be safe and healthy.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The apparatus, methods and controls that are used in surgical lighting also provide real time safe bactericidal advantages over lighting that only provides illumination. The present technology is novel over surgical lighting by providing multiple wavelengths or multiple bandwidths of visible light for constant illumination of the surgical field as well as programmable electromagnetic radiation at human safe energy levels to deliver focused and managed doses of bactericidal radiation during a medical or surgical procedure and postoperative patient care. The surgical and patient care lighting system operates with exposure levels that are harmless to humans and lethal to harmful pathogens that cause infection and retard healing. The programmable light and electromagnetic radiation doses, i.e. energy level and time of exposure, are delivered on a scheduled basis, typically three or more short dose exposures of 1.448 PHz frequency for a surgical procedure or for entirely harmless pathogen killing electromagnetic radiation, that would be delivered to the target area on a scheduled dose, or blue light in the spectral range of 749 to 637 THz that can have scheduled doses or can remain on safely throughout the surgical procedure. The dose to kill bacteria, viruses, microbes, or parasites may range from less than a second and, typically, up to several seconds which is delivered pre-, intra- and post-operatively. This safe bactericidal practice uses electromagnetic radiation on a scheduled energy and timed dose in a method and apparatus for optimal health benefits and reduction or potential elimination of surgical site infection for the patient. The electromagnetic radiation frequencies that are used during the medical procedure and the dose of the electromagnetic radiation are managed to be harmless to the patient and lethal to bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The delivery of the pathogen killing lighting is achieved by focusing the bean of radiation through a fused silica lens. These lenses will need to meet the specifications and objectives of a pathogen killing overhead surgical light system. The specific fused silica lenses that are commercially available may not meet the special design criteria for use in the present technology. However, the technology to build these lenses exists and commercial lens companies can be contracted for specialty lens production. The design specifications for the surgical lighting system will be based on delivery of electromagnetic radiation as a selected dose to the target area surgical site from an overhead or portable lighting equipment. For example if the overhead lighting system is 180 centimeters above the patient's surgical site, the focusing lens may be employed to project 20 millijoules over a ten second period of electromagnetic radiation with frequencies 1.489-1.350 PHz, and 999-967 Hz in an area of a circle that is 20 centimeters (an area of 314 square centimeters). The energy level of the electromagnetic radiation is engineered, scheduled and programmed to meet the pathogen killing objectives and be entirely harmless to the patient, surgeon and medical staff.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Buonanno et al. (2013) previously reported 207 nanometer ultraviolet light as a bactericidal tool for surgical site infections. The research indicated that the 207-nanometers ultraviolet light (electromagnetic radiations with a frequency of 1.448 PHz) is both safe and beneficial for humans during surgical procedures.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Buonanno et al. (2017) published a follow-up study that presented the used ultraviolet C light in the range of 200 to 222-nanometers. The researchers selected the UVC light because of its limited penetration distance into biological samples and are basically lethal effect on several bacteria but do not damage cells or tissue. The 200 to 222-nanometer UVC wavelength has a similar cidal effect on pathogens to a 254-nanometer wavelength UVC light. UVC light with 254-nanometers is known to kill around 60 pathogens with does from a fraction of a second to just over nine minutes, however the 254-nanometer light is not safe for human exposure and is therefore typically used in bactericidal application that are enclosed and not available for human exposure, such as enclosed heating and air-condition systems.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The wavelength of the visible or ultraviolet light, such as 200 nanometers, is a dimensional description of the peak to peak sinusoidal wavelength that is emitted by solar energy or manmade equipment. The photon energy (eV, aJ) is an additional criteria used for electrical engineering system for a given visible or ultraviolet light. An electron-volt (symbol eV) is the amount of kinetic energy gained by a single electron accelerating from rest through an electric potential difference of one volt in vacuum, and aJ is an energy expression where one attojoule=10<sup>&#x2212;18 </sup>joules.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">For example, ultraviolet C light with wavelengths between 100 and 208 nanometers has photon energy of 4.43 to 12.4 electron volt (eV): 0.701 tp 1.987 aJ. In addition, the visible and ultraviolet light has a frequency that utilizes the energy through vibration at a certain cycle, such as 200 to 222 nanometer ultraviolet radiation has a frequency between 1.489 and 1.350 PHz. These are significant criteria when calculating the pathogen destruction engineering and design for a surgical or medical procedures light system. With respect the biological criteria and the biomedical and biomedical-engineering design of the pathogen killing visible and ultraviolet surgical and medical procedures lighting system utilizes the relative size difference of a human cell that is typically 10 microns. In contrast harmful pathogens such as bacteria are typically less than one micron and viruses are in the size range around 100 nanometers. So human cells, that need to be protected and preserved are in general 10 to 100 time larger and unaffected by the design dose of selected electromagnetic radiation light that kills the harmful pathogens that are targeted by the lighting system in the present invention. In conclusion, the frequency vibration and the energy applied by the selected electromagnetic radiation with frequencies 1.489-1.350 PHz and/or 999-967 THz in the ultraviolet spectrum and with frequencies 749-637 THz, 614-583 THz, and 475-384 THz in the visible light spectrum for pathogen destruction kills the pathogens are harmless to human cells that are typically one or more magnitudes larger than pathogens. Hence, electrical, mechanical, and biomedical engineering as applied to the apparatus, systems, methods, and computer controls affords the present invention novel status. By knowing the targeted pathogen population and destruction criteria, the lighting system design and manufacturing, as used in a surgical or medical procedures setting, can safely achieve scheduled pathogen destruction with doses of effective energy and time periods while preserving healthy human cells and optimum patient health. The present invention, in a non-obvious manner, employs multiple disciplines of engineering, science, and design to invent a novel integrated surgical and medical procedure lighting system that is effective for pathogen destruction and safe for human use to reduce or eliminate surgical site infections.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The specific task of using a dose or doses of the electromagnetic radiation is to kill and destroy a selected set of pathogens that can cause infection and are harmful to humans. As a non-limiting example, a human safe dose of 749 to 637 THz electromagnetic radiation will kill at least 26 known pathogens such as gram-positive <i>Streptococcus thermophiles </i>and methicillin resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(MRSA). Electromagnetic radiation with frequencies 1.489-1.350 PHz will kill and destroy MRSA and an additional 47 other pathogens with a dose of 10 millijoules or less. These low doses are significant for patient and medical staff safety and wellbeing. The lighting and electromagnetic radiation system for pathogen destruction is engineered, designed, and used to be safe for human use through scheduled low doses.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The 1.489-1.350 PHz electromagnetic radiation typically will not penetrate deeper than one (1.0) to three (3.0) microns into the surface of a cell wall, rendering the electromagnetic radiation safe for human cells that are generally 10 to 25 microns in diameter and any penetration beyond the outer perimeter of the cytoplasm of typical human cell will be extremely attenuated before reaching the human cell nucleus. In contrast the 1.0 to 3.0-micron penetration of the 1.489-1.350 PHz electromagnetic radiation enters and destroys pathogens and microbes that are typically 0.1 to 1.0 microns in diameter and located on or near the cell surface, whereby the present invention electromagnetic radiation fully penetrates the pathogens or microbe and destroys them.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The total dose for an electromagnetic radiation is the combination of all single dose when multiple doses are used. For example, if the scheduled dose of a certain electromagnetic radiation frequency is ten seconds at one milliwatt per second, then will result in a dose of 10 millijoules of the certain electromagnetic radiation. When using a 10 millijoule dose and there are 15 doses of a certain electromagnetic radiation used during the surgical or medical procedure, then the total dose of the certain electromagnetic radiation frequency will be 150 millijoules.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The present technology provides a practical description of how and why the present technology works. The conceptual design of the overhead surgical lighting fixture where the lighting and electromagnetic radiation system varies between 1 and 2 meters above the target site will include multiple elements of the present technology as described herein. Depending on the surgeon's lighting preferences the light might be adjusted several times during a medical or surgical procedure. In a non-limiting example, the target site can be a circle 20 centimeters in diameter and the present technology delivers multiple 10 millijoule doses over the term of the surgery. The light emitting diodes (LEDs) and other electromagnetic radiation sources that transmits the 1.489-1.350 PHz can be equipped with power adjustment capabilities (i.e., dimmer switch). Prior to energizing a scheduled delivery of a pathogen destruction dose of electromagnetic radiation the laser in the center of the overhead the lighting and electromagnetic radiation system will project a beam on the target site so that the surgeon or medical staff can ensure that the laser is transmitting on the middle of the target site and the laser will simultaneously measure the distance to the target site.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The computer can be pre-programmed to adjust the fused silica lenses that will be equipped with an iris type auto adjustment feature to maintain the 20-centimeter diameter projection. In this non-limiting scenario, the 1.489-1.350 PHz electromagnetic radiation is always delivering to a 20-centimeter diameter projection. The electromagnetic radiation dose is automatically adjusted by the computer to deliver the power over the dose time such that when the distance varies, every distance between the lighting and electromagnetic radiation system and the target site receives proper scheduled dose of one or multiple times during surgical or medical procedure duration. It can therefor be appreciated that the present technology is configured and useful in delivering safe and effective pathogen destruction doses to the patient target site in real time even upon movement of the lighting and electromagnetic radiation system.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">If the system is not adjusted for the distance between the light and electromagnetic radiation transmission, then the laser distance measure will report the same distance as the previous measurement and no change would be needed to adjust the power supply to the system. Now if the surgeon wants a 30-centimeter diameter projection then the computer would need to auto adjust the fused silica iris lens or lenses beam angle will modified to project electromatic radiation to the new diameter of the target site projection. Then the system will auto-calculate the new power amount to achieve the needed dose.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Alternatively, the time exposure could be lengthened or shortened to achieve the needed dose. The optical engineering deployed that is used the present technology can rely on the inverse square of light law to ensure power adjustment are designed to deliver a constant electromagnetic radiation as the distance between the electromagnetic radiation source when varied between one and two meters or if the size of the target size is modified. The computer programming can be set by the surgeon or medical staff to manage the human safe pathogen destruction in real time as a surgery or medical procedure is in progress.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The above conceptual design is containing multiple features of the present technology. However, the complexity of the system in this illustration shows all the engineering and design of the integrated system. Simpler system applications that do not use all the features will provide Far Ultraviolet C radiation that is safely used to eliminate or reduce surgical site infections. An integrated visible lighting system that includes far ultraviolet radiation doses that are safe for human cell exposure and patient and medical practitioner because of the designed and engineered and computer programmed for pathogen destruction at low doses.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The present technology provides illumination for high visibility, which provides the surgeon and medical staff optimal vision while performing a surgical or medical procedure. Included in the present technology is the use electromagnetic radiation frequency of 1.489-1.350 PHz and other frequencies that are all pre-engineered and computer programmed for each electromagnetic radiation event during a surgical or medical procedure. The present technology will efficiently and safely keep each dose and all multiple doses substantially low and safe for human exposure while effectively killing and destroying pathogens, where the doses of electromagnetic radiation are harmless to patients and medical providers.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In a non-limiting example, it can be appreciated that the distance measurement between the lighting and electromagnetic radiation system and the target site could be omitted through engineering and programming. Also, the power adjustments and the time adjustments can be held constant during the use of the present technology. When simplifying the system for ease of use the dosing is still held at a very low radiation level, such that each dose and all doses combine remains safe for human exposure. An integrated visible lighting system that includes far ultraviolet radiation doses that are safe for human cell exposure and patient and medical practitioner because of the designed and engineered and computer programmed for pathogen destruction at low doses.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The lighting and electromagnetic radiation system will efficiently and safely keep each dose and all multiple doses substantially low and safe for human exposure while effectively killing and destroying pathogens. One of the novel aspects of the present technology is using certain electromagnetic radiation frequencies at doses that are safe for human exposures by employing engineering and computer programming to achieve real time pathogen destruction at the lowest single dose or multiple doses over the entire surgical medical procedure.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The present technology uses light for illumination in combination with programmable electromagnetic radiation frequencies that provide scheduled doses of the various frequencies both for energy levels and timed exposure for safe use and concurrent health benefits. Considerations for individual patients based on their skin coloration and tone can be programmed into the lighting and radiation system to safe exposure levels at an optimum dose. The Fitzpatrick skin table that uses six categories for color from 1 very light skin to 6 very dark skin may be used when programming the lighting and radiation equipment to ensure safety for all persons exposed to the equipment light and radiation. A motion detector in the lighting system will turn off all wavelengths that could be harmful to humans or animals.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The visible light that is used in the present technology provides both illumination and bactericidal benefits. Blue light in the spectral range of 407 to 470-nanometers with a frequency range of 749 to 637 THz is known to kill at least 26 known pathogens such as gram-positive <i>Streptococcus thermophiles </i>and methicillin resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(MRSA), which relates to a cost of 2.3 to 4.2 billion dollars per year as hospital expenses for the MRSA infection management.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Ultraviolet light at 207-nanometer (frequency 1.448 PHz) will be safe and cost effective as a supplemental tool for surgical site infection prevention, in addition to per-operative antibiotic use. The 207-nanometer wavelength is one of the ultraviolet wavelengths that is utilized it the present invention's programmable lighting system for medical use during surgery or dental practice to manage surgical site infection with the use of germicidal, bactericidal, and virus control of harmful microbes. The present technology uses light for illumination in combination with programmable electromagnetic radiation frequencies at selected energy levels to provide scheduled doses of the pathogen killing radiation with energy levels and timed exposure for safe use with multiple healthy benefits.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Selected electromagnetic radiation as used as used in the present invention during intra-operative and post-operative care can kill bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and yeast in relatively short periods of time, typically measured in seconds. The electromagnetic radiation frequencies, energy level, and time of exposure are assessed to be effective in destruction of harmful agents, while also being managed to be harmless to patient. Microorganisms quickly absorb ultraviolet-C radiation which destroys the microbe's DNA, typically in time periods that are insignificant to human health. Some microbes are killed in less than one second, while other forms of bacteria, protozoa and viruses can take up to several minutes to kill depending on the frequency and dose of electromagnetic radiation. The present technology's primary function and purpose is the care, health, and wellbeing of each patient. As such, apparatus, methods, and electronic controls used in the invention limit adverse effects to a patient by limiting the dose of visible and ultraviolet light radiation along with a factor of safety to ensure no harmful impact to a patient's tissues or organs that benefit from the death and destruction of harmful pathogens.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The use of the spectrum of radiation of visible and ultraviolet light as generated by the sun available for use in the present invention lighting system that is managed by the computer-controlled method, apparatus, and system to provide safe and effective health benefits for humans and other applications. The method, apparatus, and system may include use without human exposure for bactericidal, germicidal, virus and pathogen destruction in vacant rooms as a pre-operative sterilization method. A motion detection sensor will allow the system to shut off or reduce the light and radiation for safe and beneficial human exposures of the various wavelengths.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The present technology is intended for focused application of selected electromagnetic radiation frequencies for use within surgical fields as a bactericidal and germicidal system that reduces or eliminates surgical site infections. The lighting system may also provide ultraviolet A light in controlled doses for the synthesis of pre-vitamin D in human skin for optimal health.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Referring now to the drawings, and particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, an embodiment of the medical lighting apparatus, system, method and controls of the present technology is shown and generally designated by the reference numeral <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, a new and novel medical lighting and electromagnetic radiation apparatus, system, method and controls <b>10</b> of the present technology for managing or killing airborne pathogens or diseases in medical use during surgery or dental procedures is illustrated and will be described.

Every light in the fixture can be programmed to project a light source for a surgical site or medical procedures illumination, for human safe pathogen killing visible light, and/or for human safe pathogen killing electromagnetic radiation. The first electromagnetic radiation sources have selected frequencies of 1.489-1.350 PHz, and frequencies 999-967 THz.

Using an extra 2.5 seconds of time, i.e. 15 seconds rather than 12.5 seconds, ensures complete pathogen destruction at the surgical site, while still being safe for human use because the radiation frequency range of 1.498 and 1.350 PHz is known to be harmless for human use in low doses. The total electromagnetic radiation frequency range of 1.498 and 1.350 PHz will be 800 microwatts multiplied by 15 seconds, which provides an engineered factor of safety of about 1.2 and will deliver 12,000 microjoules or 12.0 millijoules per square centimeter of pathogen killing radiation.

Patients benefit from the use of an electromagnetic radiation frequency of 1.350 PHz which kills MRSA and a myriad of other harmful pathogens efficiently.
