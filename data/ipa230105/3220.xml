Such a scroll compressor may obtain a relatively high compression ratio as compared with other types of compressors while smoothly connecting suction, compression, and discharge strokes of refrigerant, thereby obtaining stable torque. Therefore, the scroll compressor is widely used for compressing refrigerant in an air conditioner or the like. Recently, a high-efficiency scroll compressor having a lower eccentric load and an operation speed at 180 Hz or higher has been introduced.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The behavior characteristics of the scroll compressor may be determined by the shape of a fixed wrap and an orbiting wrap. The fixed wrap and the orbiting wrap may have any shape, but usually have a form of an involute curve that can be easily processed. The involute curve denotes a curve corresponding to a trajectory drawn by an end of thread when the thread wound around a base circle having an arbitrary radius is released. When the involute curve is used, a thickness of the wrap is constant and a capacity change rate may be also constant, and therefore, a number of turns of the wrap should be increased to obtain a high compression ratio, but in this case, it has a drawback in which a size of the compressor also increases.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, the orbiting scroll is typically formed on one lateral surface of a circular disk-shaped end plate and the orbiting wrap, and a boss portion is formed on a rear surface that is not formed with the orbiting wrap and connected to a rotation shaft for orbitally driving the orbiting scroll. Such a shape may form an orbiting wrap over a substantially overall area of the end plate, thereby decreasing a diameter of the end plate portion for obtaining the same compression ratio. On the contrary, an action point to which a repulsive force of refrigerant is applied and an action point to which a reaction force for cancelling out the repulsive force is applied are separated from each other in a vertical direction, thereby causing a problem of increasing vibration or noise while the behavior of the orbiting scroll becomes unstable during the operation process.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of this, there is known a so-called axial through scroll compressor in which a point where the rotating shaft and the orbiting scroll are combined overlap with the orbiting wrap in a radial direction. In such an axial through scroll compressor, an action point of a repulsive force of refrigerant and an action point of the reaction force may act on the same point, thereby greatly reducing a problem of the inclination of the orbiting scroll.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, according to the above-described axial through scroll compressor, a bypass hole may be formed in the middle of the compression chamber similarly to a typical scroll compressor to discharge a part of refrigerant to be compressed in advance. Through this, it may be possible to prevent over compression that may occur due to excessive inflow of liquid refrigerant and oil, in advance thereby enhancing compression efficiency as well as securing reliability.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the above-described axial through scroll compressor in the related art, a discharge port may be formed at a position eccentric from the center of the orbiting scroll, thereby causing a difference in flow rate of refrigerant while compression gradients (volume reduction gradients) of both compression chambers become different from each other. In other words, as a compression chamber (hereinafter, referred to as a second compression chamber or a B pocket) having a shorter compression path length between both compression chambers may have a relatively steep compression gradient as compared to a compression chamber (hereinafter, referred to as a first compression chamber or a A pocket) having a longer compression path length, a speed of refrigerant in the second compression chamber may become higher than the speed of refrigerant in the first compression chamber. Accordingly, over compression may occur in the second compression chamber as compared to the first compression chamber, thereby reducing the overall efficiency of the compressor.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, according to a shaft-through scroll compressor in the related art, bypass holes belonging to both compression chambers may be formed to have the same cross-sectional area at the same rotation angle position, and therefore, a difference in compression gradient with respect to both compression chambers cannot be solved. As a result, over-compression loss may occur in a compression chamber having a larger compression gradient (i.e., second compression chamber) as described above, thereby causing a problem of reducing the overall compression efficiency of the entire compressor.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a scroll compressor capable of minimizing over-compression loss in a compression chamber having a large compression gradient when compression gradients (or volume reduction gradients) of both compression chambers are different from each other.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the present disclosure is to provide a scroll compressor capable of reducing a compression gradient difference between both compression chambers when compression gradients (or volume reduction slopes) of both compression chambers are different from each other.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to achieve the foregoing objectives of the present disclosure, there is provided a scroll compressor in which an overall cross-sectional area of second discharge bypass holes formed in a compression chamber having a larger compression gradient or having a larger volume reduction gradient of the compression chamber is formed to be larger than that of first discharge bypass holes formed in a compression chamber having a smaller compression gradient or having a smaller volume reduction gradient of the compression chamber.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Here, an interval of the second discharge bypass holes may be formed to be smaller than that of the first discharge bypass holes within a rotation angle range of up to 180 degrees from an inner end portion of a fixed wrap among wraps forming the compression chambers.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, a number of the second discharge bypass holes may be formed to be larger than that of the first discharge bypass holes within a rotation angle range of up to 180 degrees from an inner end portion of a fixed wrap among wraps forming the compression chambers.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, in order to achieve the foregoing objectives of the present disclosure, there is provided a scroll compressor in which a discharge port is provided, and a pair of two compression chambers continuously moving toward the discharge port

larger compression gradient between the both compression chambers are defined as a first compression chamber and a second compression chamber, respectively, and bypass portions belonging to the first compression chamber and bypass portions belonging to the second compression chamber are defined as first bypass portions and second bypass portions, respectively, bypass portions closest to the discharge port, among the second bypass portions, have a narrowest interval.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Here, an overall cross-sectional area of the first bypass portion and an overall cross-sectional area of the second bypass portion may be formed to be the same as each other.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, the first bypass portion and the second bypass portion may be

As a result, a thickness of the second wrap around the arc compression surface <b>335</b><i>b </i>may be increased to ensure durability, and the compression path may be lengthened to increase a compression ratio of the second compression chamber (V<b>2</b>) to that extent.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In addition, a protrusion portion <b>328</b> protruded to the side of an outer circumferential portion of the rotating shaft coupling portion <b>333</b> may be formed adjacent to an inner end portion (suction end or starting end) of the first wrap <b>323</b> corresponding to the rotation shaft coupling portion <b>333</b>, the protrusion portion <b>328</b> may be formed with a contact portion <b>328</b><i>a </i>protruded from the protrusion portion and engaged with the concave portion <b>335</b>.
