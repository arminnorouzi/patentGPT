Non-magnified optics are optics with unity magnification (1.0&#xd7;). In this regard, while using a non-magnified optic, it appears as though the user is viewing a target with the naked eye. Some non-magnified optics include opto-electronic components, having the capability to reflect or impose a reticle from a light-emitting diode, a hologram, or one or more lasers onto a lens inside the optic. Reticles may include a pattern of lines and/or markings, and in most cases enable user target acquisition.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Non-magnified optics are deficient in some respects. For example, a non-magnified image is perfect for shooting with both eyes open, but the lack of magnification built within hinders performance at larger distances. Operation of conventional non-magnified optics with visible (VIS) spectral band capabilities only hinders performance in poor light, rain, fog, and snow. Reticle patterns used in non-magnified optics such as a red dot sight reflected or projected into an optic may be rather poorly defined, may partially or even completely obstruct some smaller targets at larger distances, and both the reticle's perceived size and level of coherent noise, such as red speckle, depend on source power settings. Reticle patterns are also very limited, typically a red dot or red dot plus ring, and are not interchangeable within the same optic.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional flip-in telescopic magnifiers, used in succession with a non-magnified optic, magnify a scene, improving performance at larger distances, though they also magnify the reticle size. This further reduces aiming precision, a key reason why flip-in telescopic magnifiers are limited in magnification by typically 3&#xd7;. Unlike non-magnified sights, flip-in telescopic magnifiers have a small exit pupil, a restricted eyebox, and restricted eye relief. Flip-in telescopic magnifiers require optomechanical reticle adjustment and internal zeroing mechanisms or internal calibration. In general, the optical axis on which a telescopic magnifier lies may not be parallel to a collimated beam providing the reticle pattern on the non-magnified optic, yielding off-center reticle patterns. Flip-in telescopic magnifiers require optical image inverters such as a prism cluster, typically a Schmidt-Pechan prism, and require flip-in-and-out operation. In all, flip-in telescopic magnifiers require complex mechanics, a need for a field-of-view (FOV) margin, a time margin to flip-in-and-out, and oversized optics, thus increasing costs, size, and weight.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE TECHNOLOGY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In at least one aspect, the application describes a digital booster for an optical system, capable of acquiring an image frame from a non-magnified optic. When the non-magnified optic position is not parallel to a collimated beam providing a reticle on the non-magnified optic, a digital booster can locate the reticle projected by the non-magnified optic and center the reticle on a digital display. This is completed by an internal processor which selects of sub-frame of the non-magnified optic image frame and centers the reticle thereon.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An example digital booster for an optical system includes an image acquisition unit.

The application includes exemplary devices, systems, and methods for a digital booster to be used with a non-magnified optic.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a block diagram including a digital booster <b>100</b> used in conjunction with a non-magnified optic <b>102</b>. In some implementations, the digital booster <b>100</b> and components therein may be disposed between the non-magnified optic <b>102</b> and a user, such that the digital booster <b>100</b> receives light from the non-magnified optic <b>102</b> along the optical axis <b>104</b>. In other implementations, the digital booster <b>100</b> may be disposed between the non-magnified optic <b>102</b> and the target <b>118</b> along the optical axis <b>104</b> such that light from the target is processed by the digital booster <b>100</b> and received thereafter by the non-magnified optic <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The non-magnified optic <b>102</b> may include several implementations of a sight providing 1&#xd7; magnification. The non-magnified optic <b>102</b> may include a reticle, such as an aiming reticle, which may be turned on or off. For example, non-magnified optic <b>102</b> may include a red-dot sight. In some implementations, the non-magnified optic <b>102</b> may include a collimator to collimate light beams emanating from a light source such as a light emitting diode (LED). The collimator reflects light beams to collimate them as collimated light beams. In operation, light beams from the LED pass through a front surface of a glass element within the non-magnified optic <b>102</b> and reach a middle surface of the glass element. A dichroic reflective coating of the middle surface reflects light beams from the LED to form collimated light beams. This is because the dichroic reflection coating on the middle surface reflects a narrow spectral band of light matching that of LED light beams to form the collimated light beams. The collimated light beams reflect from the middle surface back through the front surface of the front surface of the glass element. Any other light including a wavelength different than the LED passes through collimator with little attenuation. As a result, a user will see a reticle at infinity and a target scene with minimal distortion and attenuation.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, the non-magnified optic <b>102</b> may include a reflex sight. In some implementations, the non-magnified optic <b>102</b> may utilize an illuminated reticle and a lens that collimates every point of the reticle to project the reticle pattern to a target plane.

The spotting scope <b>702</b> may acquire an image of a target and project an image of the target together with an imposed reticle at an exit pupil <b>704</b>. The digital booster <b>100</b> may approximately coincide with the exit pupil <b>704</b> of the spotting scope <b>702</b>. A smartphone <b>706</b> may be disposed adjacent to the digital booster <b>100</b>, the smartphone <b>706</b> may include the digital booster <b>100</b> itself, or the digital booster <b>100</b> may serve as an application on the smartphone <b>702</b>. The smartphone <b>702</b> may include software enabling the digital booster <b>100</b> as an adapter for example. Since the diagonal of a typical smartphone <b>702</b> screen is larger than a microdisplay, a flat-field eyepiece is not necessitated by the current implementation.

Refractors offer very high contrast and clarity of celestial imagery and are perfect for astrophotography. They also double down as powerful terrestrial telescopes but introduce image inversion problems. High performance refractors do not include inversion optics because of image degradation produced by multiple reflections in the prisms employed therein. Frequently a single flip-in fold mirror (&#x201c;star diagonal&#x201d;) is included within refractors but they erect the image in a vertical direction only. So, the image in such a case is not upside down anymore, but the image is still reversed in the left and right directions.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Digital booster <b>100</b> may be employed with a refractor in several different implementations including astronomical refractive telescopes <b>900</b><i>a </i>and <b>900</b><i>b</i>. The electronic image inversion in digital booster <b>100</b> may be disabled when digital booster <b>100</b> is adapted to function with astronomical refractive telescope <b>900</b><i>a</i>. The digital booster <b>100</b> may then invert the incoming, (already inverted) image. Double inversion would produce an erect image. By employing the digital booster <b>100</b>, there is no need for a prismatic inverter (erector) anymore.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The electronic image inversion in digital booster <b>100</b> may be programmed by a user to disable the electronic reversion of an incoming image in a horizontal direction only when digital booster <b>100</b> is adapted to function with astronomical refractive telescope <b>900</b><i>b</i>. Similar to the implementation of astronomical refractive telescope <b>900</b><i>a</i>, double reversion would produce correct horizontal orientation of the final image. In both implementations, the erect image will be observed when using the digital booster <b>100</b>, plus the convenience of a largely unrestricted eyebox.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows an implementation of the digital booster <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> adapted to function with a microscope <b>1000</b>. The digital booster <b>100</b> provides an unrestricted eyebox for convenient viewing, providing effort-free viewing of microscope imagery, which is especially important when required observation time is lengthy.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows an implementation of the digital booster <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> adapted to function with a theodolite <b>1100</b>. Theodolites are aiming telescopes configured for very precise metrology of angles. Riflescopes are also aiming telescopes, but less precise than theodolites. Because of high magnification, conventional theodolites have extremely small exit pupils (&#x3c;2 mm), small eye relief, and a very restricted eyebox. When aligned with the exit pupil of the theodolite <b>1100</b>, digital booster <b>100</b> offers a virtually unrestricted eyebox and eye relief, so visual ergonomics is greatly improved.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows an implementation of the digital booster <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> adapted to function with a firearm <b>1200</b>. The digital booster <b>100</b> retains the aiming direction of the nonmagnified sight and provides, due to an unrestricted eyebox, effort-free viewing of magnified target imagery, which is especially useful for long-range shooting.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Many conventional eyepieces have a large apparent field-of-view; short eye relief, i.e., the distance between the last lens of the eyepiece and the exit pupil; and a small diameter exit pupil. For example, a conventional optical theodolite has an exit pupil diameter of about 2 mm or even less. Other examples of instruments having short, restricted eye relief (less than 15 mm) and tight, restricted eyeboxes, include conventional metrological microscopes, biomedical microscopes, spotting scopes for wildlife observation, and spotting scopes for astronomy. Tight eyeboxes yield poor visual ergonomics. In this regard, users may get tired easily, especially when the eye must be engaged for a longer time. The subject technology circumvents these issues.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The subject technology provides an electronic aiming reticle, which may be selected or preprogrammed by a user, on-the-fly zeroing of the digital booster with respect to a non-magnified optic, unrestricted eye relief with a large eye box, enhanced vision in poor light and weather, and additional perturbed reticle generation when rangefinder and ballistic data are known. The subject technology may embody compact and lightweight implementations due to elimination of prism clusters, internal zeroing mechanisms, and through the use of miniature field programmable arrays, micro-displays, eyepieces, and optical zooms. Image acquisition units described herein also accommodate a variety of non-magnified optics and magnifications/FOVs not available with conventional magnifiers.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The subject technology provides non-magnified or magnified electronic images of a target to a user without the necessity to mechanically flip a booster along the optical axis. This is because a properly designed optical zoom in the image acquisition unit will provide both nonmagnified and magnified imagery as needed by the user. This enables fast and easy transition from shooting with both eyes open at short distance to large range shooting.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Elements, equations, or steps of different implementations described may be combined to form other implementations not specifically set forth previously. Elements, equations, or steps may be left out of the digital booster or processes described previously without adversely affecting their operation or the operation of the digital booster in general.
