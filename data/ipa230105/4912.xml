However, the working paradigm is shifting. Today, many workers can perform their job remotely and many employees are now working in a location that is remote from their employer's place of business. This shift will likely have many consequences, one of which is that employers may have some accountability for the remote work environments.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, there was a time when factory conditions were ignored. Employers were not liable or responsible for working conditions of their places or business or the factories they may have used. Today, however, owners often bear some responsibility for the working conditions of their employees or the working conditions of their vendor's employees.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">With a continued shift to remote working, it is possible that owners or employers may become somewhat responsible for remote working conditions. For example, some workers may not be given any option other than to work from home. In this and other scenarios, it is likely that the employer may bear at least some responsibility for the working conditions of these employees. As a result, there is a need to understand the conditions of those working environments.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to describe the manner in which at least some of the advantages and features of the invention may be obtained, a more particular description of embodiments of the invention will be rendered by reference to specific embodiments thereof which are illustrated in the appended drawings.

More particularly, at least some embodiments of the invention relate to systems, hardware, software, computer-readable media, and methods for assessing remote environments, which includes, by way of example only, performing monitoring operations, assessment operations, data confidence fabric operations, environment grading operations, environment marketplace operations, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Generally, a data confidence fabric (DCF) is a computing system or environment that allows the trustworthiness of data to be determined. A DCF provides a flexible and automated understanding of data originators or sources of data. A DCF can account for variations in the data being ingested into the DCF. A DCF may be associated with a ledger that allows interactions with data to be recorded immutably. Ledgers facilitate tracking data lineage, performing audits, and the like. Further the ledger (or other recording) can store information about the data itself and the various trust insertion technologies that may have interacted with or on the data. A DCF can provide information to track how data moves within the DCF, who or what touches the data, when the data is touched, and the like. All of these factors allow a score (a confidence score or a trustworthiness score) to be associated with the data. The confidence score allows an application or entity to trust or value the data according to the score. For example, data with a high trust or confidence score may be relied on more than data with a relatively lower trust or confidence score.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Data ingested into the DCF can be associated with various attributes such as BIOS information, secure boot information, authentication and authorization information, immutable storage, IP address, and the like. This information may contribute to the overall score. Data that is generated on a non-secure device may receive a lower score than data generated on a device that booted securely. The confidence score can be increased when the attributes include information about provenance and/or the manner in which authentication or authorization was performed.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of the invention may also allow users to review how the scores were generated. Some part of the confidence score, for example, may be generated in fact while other parts may be based on an inference. When the data is ready for consumption, the data will have a score that allows a decision maker to understand its trustworthiness with regard to the activity for which the data is being used. For example, decision maker or application consuming data in the context of a remote working environment may require data with confidence scores that are higher than data used to turn a light on or off.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In general, a DCF annotates and scores data that is ingested into and that flows within the DCF. Embodiments of the invention relate to DCFs in the context of remote environments. A DCF can capture or collect data related to the conditions or characteristics of a remote environment. The captured or collected data can be annotated and used in assessing remote environment environments or conditions and in performing other operations.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The ability to assess remote working conditions or remote environment conditions allows decisions to be made that benefit the worker and that validate that a company is encouraging and/or providing quality working environments. By storing annotations or metadata in a ledger, the efforts to improve working conditions can be recorded.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is generally understood that working conditions have an impact on work quality and work quantity. Embodiments of the invention offer organizations the ability to collect environment data, correlate the environment data with the source, correlate the source with an asset, and ultimately associate remote worker or device conditions with the collected data.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Embodiments of the invention can ensure that remote working environments meet minimum standards (e.g., health standards or other regulations or other best practices). This can transparently allow an organization to demonstrate that they are actively engaged in improving working conditions, regardless of location. Further, this allows an organization to attract/retain talent, improve diversity, and the like.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Embodiments of the invention allow an entity skilled in environmental conditions, working conditions, and the like to improve their ability to evaluate remote working environments using scored data. Further, the DCF allows third parties to leverage data related to remote environments and to rely on the data, which has been scored by the DCF.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Embodiments of the invention allow an organization to avoid or remediate situations with workers in unsatisfactory conditions. This can improve the reputation of the organization. Further, embodiments of the invention allow the remote working conditions to be audited and prove that conditions are acknowledged and that steps are taken to improve the conditions.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one example, a DCF is a system or collection of hardware (computers, servers, routers, network interface cards, storage including immutable storage and/or other hardware) that is provisioned (e.g., with software, services) to score or rank data that may be ingested into the DCF. The DCF is configured to route the data such that the data ingested into the DCF can be made available to applications, which applications may also be part of the DCF. As the data is routed or pathed, confidence or trust scores are added to the data by the various nodes involved in the flow of the data in the DCF. The routed data is ultimately associated with a confidence score that can be leveraged by applications that use the data.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As data is routed in the DCF, the nodes may perform trust insertion or execute trust insertion technologies. Trust insertion includes, by way of example and not limitation, contributing a confidence or trust score to the data (e.g., by annotating a package including the data with a score or other information about the added score), performing a trust insertion technology on the data (e.g., authentication, data provenance, signatures, secure enclave computing, etc.), or the like or combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">More specifically, a data confidence fabric, by way of example only, may relate to an architecture and set of services that allow data to be ingested into a system for use by applications. The DCF adds trust or confidence scores to the data as the data flows through the DCF. Combining all of the confidence scores added by the nodes or the trust insertion technologies allows the ingested data to have an overall confidence or trust score that provides a view into the trustworthiness of the data to an application or for other use.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The data scored or ranked in the DCF may be stored in various locations, such as a data lake, in a datacenter, a distributed ledger, a cloud data storage service, or the like or combination thereof. The data scored or ranked in the DCF system can be made available to one or more applications or other clients or users.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Confidence scores allow an application to explore or exploit the data for potential analysis or consumption. The score or rank of the data allows an application to understand or account for the trustworthiness of the data. For example, the confidence score of the data may have a significant impact on whether the data is actually used by the application. An application may require a minimum confidence score or have other requirements related to the confidence score.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A DCF is able to give or associate data with scores from individual trust insertion technologies that can be combined in multiple ways to determine a final score or rank that relates to the trustworthiness of the data. The scores provided from a hardware perspective can be maintained separately from confidence scores from a software perspective. The scores can also be combined into an overall score.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a data confidence fabric (DCF <b>100</b>). The DCF <b>100</b> includes varies computing and hardware components, connections, and environments. The DCF <b>100</b> is configured to add confidence scores to data flowing in the DCF <b>100</b>. The DCF <b>100</b> may include or be associated with trust insertion technologies such as, but not limited to, ledgers, immutable storage, semantic validation, authentication, data provenance, TPM (Trusted Platform Modules), signatures, or the like or combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this example, a source <b>102</b> may generate data that is provided to or ingested into the DCF <b>100</b>. In this example, the source <b>102</b> may represent a source of environment data that is relevant to assessing or monitoring a remote working environment. The source <b>102</b> may include sensors (e.g., air quality sensors, temperature sensors, pollutant sensors), websites, databases, wearable devices (e.g., smart watches), computing devices, cameras, microphones, furniture, or the like or combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Data generated by or collected from the source <b>102</b> may be ingested via a gateway <b>104</b>. A gateway <b>104</b> may be a device capable of connecting with the source <b>102</b> and may be connected to a network such as the Internet. The data may then be routed to an edge server <b>106</b> and then to the cloud <b>108</b>, where the data may be stored and made available to an application <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As the data is routed or ingested into the DCF, the various components may add trust scores. The trust scores may be added or generated as metadata using a DCF engine <b>120</b>. The DCF engine <b>120</b> may be distributed within the DCF <b>100</b> and operate on different devices or servers. Further, some of the trust insertion technologies may be specific to a device. The DCF engine <b>120</b> may provide application programming interfaces such that trust scores can be added to data in transit, such that data and/or metadata can be committed to a ledger, perform routing in the DCF <b>100</b>, and the like or combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the DCF <b>100</b>, data (or a data stream) arriving at the gateway <b>104</b> or transmitted from the gateway is associated with metadata <b>114</b>, which includes trust scores for a secure boot, authentication, and device signature validation. More specifically, the gateway <b>104</b> may annotate three operations in this example as illustrated by the annotations or metadata <b>114</b>. The gateway <b>104</b> may successfully validate the signature coming from the source <b>102</b>. The gateway <b>104</b> may annotate that a TPM chip was used by the source <b>102</b> to confirm that the BIOS, firmware, or OS on the source <b>102</b> (or on the gateway <b>104</b>) was not tampered with during boot. The gateway <b>104</b> may run authentication/authorization software to protect the data stream from unwanted inspection. The method of scoring may vary. In one example, success may receive a 1.0 and failure may receive a 0.0 for any given trust insertion technology. The overall score or rank may be generated in different manners including addition, weighted addition, multiplication, weighted multiplication, or the like or combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">At the edge server, additional scores for provenance and immutable storage have been added as illustrated by the metadata <b>116</b>. The metadata <b>118</b> may represent that the data has been stored in immutable storage and is registered in a ledger <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The ledger <b>112</b> may store the metadata associated with the data generated by the source <b>102</b>. Use of the data by the application <b>110</b> may also be reflected in the ledger <b>112</b>. The data is thus associated with a confidence score that is based, at least in part, on the trust insertion technologies applied as the data was ingested. The application <b>110</b> can then trust the data based on the confidence score. In addition, the ledger <b>112</b> allows for auditing operations. In the context of monitoring a remote environment, this may allow conditions to be tracked and audited over time, demonstrate efforts to improve the remote environment, monitor employee compliance with best practices, and the like.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The DCF <b>100</b> can thus capture data created within devices or access data from websites or databases and give a confidence score to the data. This allows information or data regarding a remote work environment to be captured or collected and allows the data to be associated with the remote work environments. This will allow third parties to make judgments about the conditions that a worker (or device) is currently experiencing. Further, by associating the data captured from the end device with the physical environment or assets in the physical environment, remote workforce and device conditions can be measured or assessed and data suppliers can also be scored.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Embodiments of the invention allow environment experts to assess data collected and ingested into a DCF (or other system) for various reasons or standards such as health standards, best practice standards, air quality standards, or the like. Embodiments of the invention allow organizations to avoid or improve unsatisfactory working standards, perform audits regarding remote working environments, prove that the organization is actively engaged in providing safe or satisfactory working environments, or the like.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">By way of example, the score may further include metadata reflecting that an asset is associated with a sensor that collects air quality data. The metadata may reflect that an asset is associated with a sensor or source that collects physiological data. In some examples, the confidence score may be based on a detailed analysis or based on groupings on different sensor variables. For example, the analysis may performed such that the metadata reflects additional characteristics of the environment such as inhalable particles under 150 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>3 </sup>based on a 24-hour average, Internet connection above 100 MBS on a 24-hour average, satisfactory physiological measurements based on a personal average, and the like.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> discloses aspects of monitoring an environment using a DCF. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an environment <b>200</b> that may be associated with at least one asset such as asset <b>204</b>. The environment <b>200</b> may be associated with multiple assets, represented by assets <b>204</b>, <b>208</b>, and <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this example, the asset <b>204</b> is associated with a source <b>202</b>. This association between the asset <b>204</b> and the source <b>202</b> may be automated, manual, predictive, or the like. The source <b>206</b> is associated with the asset <b>208</b> by being attached to or logically attached to the asset <b>208</b>. For example, some sensors may attach to the asset <b>208</b> via a wireless connection or a wired connection. The source <b>210</b> is built-into or part of the asset <b>212</b>. The sources <b>202</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>210</b>, which are examples of the source <b>102</b>, can be software sources or hardware sources.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The assets <b>204</b>, <b>208</b>, and <b>212</b> may be devices, users, locations, rooms, buildings, or other environments. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, embodiments of the invention allow sources to be correlated with assets. Thus, asset correlation <b>212</b> may include storage for storing or for correlating data from the sources <b>202</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>210</b>, which are ingested into a DCF, with the corresponding assets <b>204</b>, <b>208</b>, and <b>212</b>. Correlating the data in asset correlation <b>212</b> may allow rules to be implemented. When a rule is broken, for example, a trigger may be performed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The data received from the sources <b>202</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>210</b>, once ingested into the DCF, can be analyzed by third parties or applications to rate and/or rank the conditions in which the asset-related data was generated. The ratings and rankings can be automated, manual, predictive, or the like or combination thereof. The ratings and/or rankings may then inform, increase or decrease rank, trust, or other understanding of the data associated with the sources (e.g., the sensors).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The data generated by or collected from the sources <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, and <b>210</b> may be categorized into different types including, but not limited to, physical environment data, support environment data, and external environment data. The physical environment data may represent physical aspects of the location of the remote environment <b>200</b> (or asset). These physical environment sources may include sensors or other sources that generate data measuring, by way of example only, connectivity, air quality, noise levels, temperature, humidity, heart rate, posture, down time, and the like. In addition to sensors that may, for example, be in the vicinity of the environment <b>200</b>, data such as air quality may be obtained from other companies that may offer ambient environment measurements (e.g., Google Earth Outreach). This may allow information to be collected to determine whether internal readings of the environment <b>200</b> are in line with readings that are external to the environment <b>200</b>. Different sources or sensors may measure the same or similar aspect or characteristic of or related to the environment <b>200</b>. This may allow for more objective measurements and allow the measurements to be performed or determined with regard to local standards.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The support environment data may relate to various regulations (e.g., Occupational Safety and Health Administration or OSHA). The support environment data may relate to information describing whether a worker has the tools and processes to perform their job. This may be measured using software that monitors performance or through other mechanisms that match expected hardware and software access against detected capabilities of the asset.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The support environment data may include objective data and subjective data. Objective data may include things that can be objectively measured. For example, whether a worker has a laptop or computer suitable for their job requirements or has sufficient connectivity can be determined. The qualities or capabilities of the worker's equipment and connectivity can be objectively measured via software.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The support environment data may also be subjective. Subjective support environment data may relate to how a worker or employee feels about their job or environment. By way of example, subjective support environment data may be collected via surveys. Subjective support environment data may also be collected from sources such as employer evaluation websites (e.g., glassdoor.com), which are not employer owned or controlled, where employees may be able to express themselves more freely than in an employer provided survey. Information determined from subjective support environment data may help an employer understand how their employees feel and give insight to employee satisfaction or other characteristics. For example, this may allow a user's satisfaction with their working environment to be evaluated. Information from employer evaluation websites may be categorized, analyzed, ranked, or the like.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The external environment data may include objective measurements or data. The external environment data may relate to more than the specific or immediate environment <b>200</b> of the worker and may encompass the neighborhood surrounding the environment <b>200</b>. Air quality, noise quality, open spaces, infrastructure, and the like can be objectively measured. This category of data can place the personal environment <b>200</b> of the worker in perspective of the larger environment or neighborhood. This category of data may also be used to deploy resources for the improvement of working conditions based on detected or measured conditions.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The external environment data may also be subjective. Time-boxed events (e.g., protests, weather, earthquake) and longer events (pandemic, power outage, government problems) can impact a remote working environment and the external environment data can be used in different ways. Data from the sensors can be collected periodically, repeatedly, on demand, contractually, or the like. This data can be evaluated, ranked, processed, analyzed and the like. Rules may be applied to the data.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Data generated by or collected from the sources <b>202</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>210</b> (which can be hardware sources and/or software sources and may include sensors of various types) are ingested into a DCF and metadata (confidence scores, trust technology, routing) of the data and/or the collected data itself is stored in a ledger <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The confidence score associated with data can be generated as the data is ingested into the DCF. Thus, the confidence scores other metadata and/or the data may be stored in a ledger <b>210</b>. The data may be stored elsewhere in the cloud, such as in immutable storage while the metadata is stored in the ledger.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, a scoring paradigm may account for the presence of sensor or source data. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example of metadata that may be associated with data from a source or sensor. The metadata <b>300</b>, in this example, scores a 1 for success and a 0 for failure. Thus, the gateway determined that the device signature of the asset was valid, that the asset used a TPM chip to confirm a secure boot, that the asset is running authentication software to protect the data stream, that the asset is associated with an active sensor that collects air quality data and that the asset is associated with an active sensor that collects physiological data.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Using further analysis (e.g., third party or application analysis), the metadata can be augmented to reflect more detailed analysis that may be related to additional variables. The variables could be an individual asset, a group of assets or other groupings. Thus, the metadata may reflect, using this type of analysis, whether the environment has inhalable particles below a threshold overtime, an Internet connection providing a certain speed over time, satisfactory physiological measurements based on a personal average, or the like.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The asset correlation <b>212</b> allows a trusted pairing to be created and allows communication to be automated. For example, an administrator may associate a source or sensor to an asset in the asset correlation <b>212</b>. The assets and/or sources send data to specified locations in the DCF and create entries in the ledger <b>210</b>. When accessed, a score may be returned with the data.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Environment grading <b>214</b> may also be performed. Grades can be generated for environments based on the data ingested into the DCF and based on the confidence scores. The gradings may also be returned to the DCF and included in the ledger <b>210</b>. This data may be used to influence trust or confidence scores.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, the sources providing information about the environment can be accessed and graded based on the data and/or the score. This allows various aspects of a working environment to be graded. By way of example only and not limitation, air quality, temperature, humidity, noise, light, device characteristics, connection speeds, software access, user and user related characteristics (temp, posture, work breaks, productivity) can be graded based on the values and based on their confidence scores. These characteristics can be graded individually and/or collectively. This gives insight into the working environment.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, the temperature of an environment may be graded on a pass/fail basis. This grade can be applied to a single measurement, or to an average temperature based on multiple samples. Further, the grading may account for other environmental conditions, such as outdoor temperature or the like.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The data can be used, by way of example, for business processes, data marketplaces, and monitoring <b>216</b>. Business processes may include monitoring the working conditions of their employees or their vendor's employees such that conditions can be improved where needed, work can be redirected or reassigned based on current conditions, and the like. When substandard conditions are detected, actions may be triggered such as an inquiry to the employee, testing the sources, or the like.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A marketplace may allow data to be bought or sold. More specifically, a particular organization may sell a device (e.g., computers) to many organizations. Because computers have embedded sensors and can communicate with other sources, the organization is positioned to collect data from multiple sources in multiple environments. This allows the organization to provide a monitoring service to the entity that uses or purchases the organization's products.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">More specifically, data collected by sources or assets in a DCF can be used to generate a certified fair trade data marketplace. For example, a computer manufacturer can use the sensors in their devices to collect environment information. These devices may also interface with other sensors (e.g., room sensors, worn sensors). This data can be collected and monitored. This service allows employers to ensure that all workers associated with the generated data are working in conditions that meet a standard set by an organization.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Employers can request that employees comply with remote workplace best practices and allow remote sources, such as cameras, to measure their compliance. This allows an employer to ensure that its employees take breaks, stretch, stand, or the like. The employee's posture and other characteristics can be measured. High confidence scores indicate that an employee is complying with best practices. These scores can be used to reward employees or to encourage best practices and also allow a company to respond to workplace violations and/or quickly detect workplace violations. The ledger can indicate the conditions of the remote environment over time and allow for auditing. An organization's reputation for providing good working environments and for responding to problems can be enhanced and verified.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another example, the data ingested into the DCF can be used to create correlations between working conditions and output. This may allow resources to be directed or redirected as needed to improve conditions in working environments and thus improve output in terms of quantity and/or quality.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In another example, rules may be generated or formed that, when satisfied trigger events or notifications. Using the asset correlation <b>212</b>, for example, rules may be set or formed such that a notification is generated when air quality is below a threshold for some period of time or when noise level exceeds a threshold for some period of time. The rules may be based on discrete data (e.g., a one-time event), based on time series data, based on averaged or time-series data, or the like.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example of a method for environment assessment. The method <b>400</b> represents a process from the ingestion of data to the use of data. However, embodiments of the invention may focus on specific aspects of the method. For example, embodiments of the invention may relate to operations including, but not limited to, assessing a remote environment, monitoring a remote environment, grading data generated in or relevant to remote environments, applying rules to scored data, scoring environmental data, marketing data related to remote environments, and the like or combination thereof. Some of the methods may relate to operations that use data ingested into and scored by a DCF.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the method <b>400</b>, data is ingested <b>402</b> into a DCF. This may include receiving or collected data from sources. In the context of a remote working environment, the sources may include sensors related to the environment such as air quality sensors, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, noise sensors, cameras, microphones, or the like. Software sensors may measure connectivity, device capability, software availability, or the like. As previously stated, the data from the sources may be physical environment data, supporting environment data, and/or external environment data. These types of data, by way of example only, can all be ingested <b>402</b> into a DCF.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The data ingested into the DCF is scored <b>404</b>. In other words, a trust or confidence score may be attached to the data and the data is ingested. This is often reflected in data annotations or metadata that is stored or recorded <b>406</b> in a ledger.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, operations are performed <b>408</b> using the data and the scores <b>408</b>. The operations performed may be application dependent. In one example, the ingested data may be graded by a grading application. Grading the data may include grading the data individually (per source), grading the data collectively (e.g., per environment, per group of sources or group of similar sources), or the like. Data can be graded, by way of example, as pass/fail. If measured inhalants in ppm is below a threshold, for example, this aspect of the environment may pass. An environment may be suitable when a percentage of the individual characteristics are suitable.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The operations may include a rules application. The rules application may be operate to generate an alert or other action when a rule is satisfied. For example, if two sources measure below corresponding threshold values, an action may be triggered. The action may depend on the specific condition. Certain characteristics (e.g., carbon monoxide above threshold), may trigger a more urgent action than other characteristics (e.g., temperature above normal).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The operations may include allocating resources. In this example, multiple remote environments may be monitored. If one remote environment experiences an event, such as an earthquake, work may be moved to another environment. In addition, resources associated with improving working environments can be directed based on detected conditions.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In another example, the operations performed may include marketplace operations. This allows an entity to sell or provide remote working condition assessments or events to an organization. These assessments may be based on data collected from devices manufactured or sold by the entity. For example, multiple different organizations may use computing devices from an entity. The entity may operate a marketplace by collecting remote environment data via these computing devices. This allows the entity to assess the environments related to each independent organization, allows best practices to be developed based on how each organization interacts with their own remote working environments.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The operations may include monitoring remote working environments for compliance with associated standards. Deviations from a standard can be flagged, for example.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The process of ingesting data may be performed repeatedly, continually, on command, or the like. Data may be ingested as data streams, discrete samples, or the like. This data and the metadata can be stored, and this allows a history to be generated. This facilitates audits, best practice analysis, and the like.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">When a DCF captures ambient environment data and generates annotations and scores for that data, the corresponding environments or assets can also be scored. This allows data acquisition decisions to include worker conditions, which benefits the worker and validates that an entity is encouraging and/or providing high quality working conditions.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Embodiments of the invention, such as the examples disclosed herein, may be beneficial in a variety of respects. For example, and as will be apparent from the present disclosure, one or more embodiments of the invention may provide one or more advantageous and unexpected effects, in any combination, some examples of which are set forth below. It should be noted that such effects are neither intended, nor should be construed, to limit the scope of the claimed invention in any way.

Nor should any such embodiments be construed to implement, or be limited to implementation of, any particular technical effect(s) or solution(s). Finally, it is not required that any embodiment implement any of the advantageous and unexpected effects disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The following is a discussion of aspects of example operating environments for various embodiments of the invention. This discussion is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, or the applicability of the embodiments, in any way.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In general, embodiments of the invention may be implemented in connection with systems, software, and components, that individually and/or collectively implement, and/or cause the implementation of, environment related operations. Such operations may include, but are not limited to, monitoring operations, assessment operations, rules-based operations, grading operations, compliance operations, and the like. More generally, the scope of the invention embraces any operating environment in which the disclosed concepts may be useful.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">New and/or modified data collected and/or generated in connection with some embodiments, may be stored in a data protection environment that may take the form of a public or private cloud storage environment, an on-premises storage environment, and hybrid storage environments that include public and private elements. Any of these example storage environments, may be partly, or completely, virtualized. The storage environment may comprise, or consist of, a datacenter which is operable to service read, write, delete, backup, restore, and/or cloning, operations initiated by one or more clients or other elements of the operating environment. Where a backup comprises groups of data with different respective characteristics, that data may be allocated, and stored, to different respective targets in the storage environment, where the targets each correspond to a data group having one or more particular characteristics.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Example cloud computing environments, which may or may not be public, include storage environments that may provide data protection functionality for one or more clients. Another example of a cloud computing environment is one in which processing, data protection, and other, services may be performed on behalf of one or more clients. Some example cloud computing environments in connection with which embodiments of the invention may be employed include, but are not limited to, Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, Dell EMC Cloud Storage Services, and Google Cloud. More generally however, the scope of the invention is not limited to employment of any particular type or implementation of cloud computing environment.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In addition to the cloud environment, the operating environment may also include one or more clients that are capable of collecting, modifying, and creating, data. As such, a particular client may employ, or otherwise be associated with, one or more instances of each of one or more applications that perform such operations with respect to data. Such clients may comprise physical machines, or virtual machines (VM)</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Particularly, devices in the operating environment may take the form of software, physical machines, or VMs, or any combination of these, though no particular device implementation or configuration is required for any embodiment. Similarly, data protection system components such as databases, storage servers, storage volumes (LUNs), storage disks, replication services, backup servers, restore servers, backup clients, and restore clients, for example, may likewise take the form of software, physical machines or virtual machines (VM), though no particular component implementation is required for any embodiment. Where VMs are employed, a hypervisor or other virtual machine monitor (VMM) may be employed to create and control the VMs. The term VM embraces, but is not limited to, any virtualization, emulation, or other representation, of one or more computing system elements, such as computing system hardware. A VM may be based on one or more computer architectures, and provides the functionality of a physical computer. A VM implementation may comprise, or at least involve the use of, hardware and/or software. An image of a VM may take the form of a .VMX file and one or more .VMDK files (VM hard disks) for example. Containers may also be employed.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As used herein, the term &#x2018;data&#x2019; is intended to be broad in scope. Thus, that term embraces, by way of example and not limitation, data segments such as may be produced by data stream segmentation processes, data chunks, data blocks, atomic data, emails, objects of any type, files of any type including media files, word processing files, spreadsheet files, and database files, as well as contacts, directories, sub-directories, volumes, and any group of one or more of the foregoing. Data may also include sensor data, website or database information, or the like.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Any of the disclosed processes, operations, methods, and/or any portion of any of these, may be performed in response to, as a result of, and/or, based upon, the performance of any preceding process(es), methods, and/or, operations. Correspondingly, performance of one or more processes, for example, may be a predicate or trigger to subsequent performance of one or more additional processes, operations, and/or methods. Thus, for example, the various processes that may make up a method may be linked together or otherwise associated with each other by way of relations such as the examples just noted.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Following are some further example embodiments of the invention.
