A MTR may contain hexagonal a-phase crystallites aligned, mostly, in the same or close crystallographic orientations in a region far greater than a typical a grain size. The presence of MTRs may reduce service life of various components. For example, the existence of MTR was linked to dwell fatigue susceptibility, which may cause early failure in titanium-based jet engine components. Typical methods for MTR characterization are destructive to the component. Commonly used ultrasonic nondestructive inspections are primarily dedicated to detection of internal cracks. In such an inspection, amplitude of backscattered ultrasonic signals from an over-sized MTR may exceed the rejection threshold set for cracks and potentially cause false rejection of the component.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A method is disclosed herein. The method may comprise: scanning a plurality of actual microtexture regions (MTRs) of a component with an ultrasonic transducer; selecting a reference point of each actual MTR in the plurality of actual MTRs; compiling a spatial correlation coefficient data for each actual MTR in the plurality of actual MTRs relative to the reference point of each actual MTR; calculating at least one of a threshold width of spatial correlation coefficient and a threshold spatial correlation coefficient slope for characterizing a future potential MTR as being a future actual MTR or a future crack or defect; and calculating at least one of a second threshold width of spatial correlation coefficient and an elongation direction for characterizing the future actual MTR as being a future rejectable MTR or a future acceptable MTR.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In various embodiments, compiling spatial correlation coefficient data is compiled in the elongation direction of each actual MTR, with a maximum cross-section area, in the plurality of actual MTRs. The scanning may be performed in a tank filled with a fluid, and wherein the component is disposed in the tank. The spatial correlation coefficient data may be calculated based on a spatial correlation coefficient equation. The at least one of the threshold width of spatial correlation coefficient and the threshold spatial correlation coefficient slope may be determined based on a normal distribution of the plurality of actual MTRs. The reference point may be based on a maximum amplitude of a transducer for each actual MTR. The method may further comprise calculating the threshold width of spatial correlation coefficient and the threshold spatial correlation coefficient slope.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method is disclosed herein. The method may comprise: scanning a component with an ultrasonic transducer with a shear wave beam at a depth of a potential microtexture region (MTR), the potential MTR including an area of interest; rotating the component about an axis, the axis extending through the area of interest; scanning the component at a plurality of angles between 0 and 360 degrees in a plane defined by the axis; determining an elongation direction of the potential MTR; analyzing a spatial correlation coefficient profile along the elongation direction of the potential MTR relative to the area of interest; characterizing the potential MTR as an actual MTR or a defect; characterizing the actual MTR as a rejectable MTR or an acceptable MTR when the potential MTR is characterized as the actual MTR.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In various embodiments, analyzing the spatial correlation coefficient profile may further comprises comparing a width of spatial correlation coefficient of the area of interest with a threshold width of spatial correlation coefficient for the potential MTR to be characterized as the actual MTR, wherein the threshold width of spatial correlation coefficient may be tied with a maximum amplitude of ultrasonic backscattered signals acquired from the area of interest.

Analyzing the spatial correlation coefficient profile may further comprise comparing a spatial correlation coefficient slope from the area of interest with a threshold spatial correlation coefficient slope for the potential MTR to be characterized as the actual MTR, wherein the threshold spatial correlation coefficient slope may be tied with a maximum amplitude of ultrasonic backscattered signals acquired from the area of interest. The potential MTR may be characterized as the actual MTR when the spatial correlation coefficient slope is less than the threshold spatial correlation coefficient slope, and the potential MTR is characterized as the defect when the spatial correlation coefficient slope is greater than the threshold spatial correlation coefficient slope. Analyzing an actual MTR may further comprise comparing a width of spatial correlation coefficient of the area of interest with a second threshold width of spatial correlation coefficient for the actual MTR to be characterized as the acceptable MTR when the elongation direction is deemed a high risk direction, wherein the actual MTR is characterized as the acceptable MTR when the width of spatial correlation coefficient is less than the second threshold width of spatial correlation coefficient, and wherein the actual MTR is characterized as the rejectable MTR when the width of spatial correlation coefficient is greater than the second threshold width of spatial correlation coefficient.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method is disclosed herein.

In various embodiments, a second ultrasonic characterization scheme is based on spatial correlation analysis of a single potential MTR as disclosed herein. The spatial correlation analysis may be used as a follow-up to a common ultrasonic crack detection process to distinguish over-sized MTRs from cracks and thus reduce the chance of false rejection. In various embodiments, the spatial correlation analysis may be used to investigate the nature of any individual potential MTR of interest. For example, it could follow the zone-screening process and target any high amplitude (&#x2018;hot&#x2019;) spots of interest within a specific zone. A decision on whether the potential MTR is a true MTR could be made.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Ultrasonic waves propagating in polycrystalline metals create backscattered noise due to variations of physical properties in microstructures. Microstructure is a fine structure of material. The strength of backscattered noise is related to wavelength, beam properties, and microstructure properties, etc. In case of titanium forgings, typical grain sizes may be around 10 microns, while MTR sizes could be in order of a few hundreds to a few thousands microns. For an ultrasonic transducer with a center frequency of 15 MHz, its wavelength is about 400 &#x3bc;m in a longitudinal mode and is about 200 &#x3bc;m in a transverse wave mode, respectively. As these wavelengths are far greater than the grain sizes but in comparable with MTR sizes, it is expected that MTRs are far more significant contributors to backscattered noise than typical grains under this working frequency. The selection of ultrasonic working frequency is dependent on MTR sizes of interest, geometry, material properties, and so on. The strength of backscattered noise is also significantly influenced by the angle between the orientation of a microstructural feature and the propagating direction of ultrasonic waves. For instance, an ellipsoidal reflector generates least amount of backscattered noise when its elongation direction is parallel with the wave propagation direction. In contrast, a same sized ellipsoidal reflector could generate far greater amount of backscattered noise when its elongation direction is normal to the wave propagation direction, in which the maximum cross-section face is normal to the wave propagation direction. Consequently, it is ideal to choose the incidence angle of ultrasonic waves to be normal to the grain flow line direction as well as the maximum cross-section face of the region of interests. The normal direction of the grain flow line direction (i.e. the elongation direction) is coincidence with the normal direction of the maximum cross-section face when the reflector is axisymmetric with respect to the elongation direction. The amplitude of ultrasonic backscattered signals is also related to the degree of acoustic impedance mismatch between the reflector and its surrounding materials. In case of a crack, high acoustic impedance mismatch exist between air and the base metal. In case of a MTR, relative low acoustic impedance mismatch between oriented crystallites within the MTR and more randomly oriented crystallites nearby. As a result, amplitude of reflection ultrasonic backscattered signals from a MTR could be weaker and/or lack of a clear boundary in comparison to those of a crack of similar size, orientation, etc. For a component of complex geometry, it is often wise to segment the region of interests based on its primary grain flow line orientation and select the corresponding incident angles and gating parameters for each individual region. Generally, efforts shall be made to control relevant factors in the inspection process to increase comparability among regions of interests. It is expected that sensitivity of MTR evaluation increases when more relevant factors are controlled. For example, more sensitive comparisons may be achieved among areas with same or close geometric features, same flow line orientations and inspected with same ultrasonic beam properties.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a typical amplitude C-scan image, a peak amplitude is recorded at each scanning position, whereas the peak amplitude corresponding to the maximum (peak) value of backscattered noise within a pre-defined (time) gate recorded at the associated scanning position. As a whole, a C-scan image is a two-dimensional matrix of peak amplitudes of backscattered noises. Consequently, a number of statistical indicators can be derived from a C-scan image, either treated as a one-dimensional sequence, or a two-dimensional matrix. Some statistical estimators may be derived from the corresponding spatial frequency spectrum, which is a two-dimensional Fourier transform of the original image.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with various embodiments, a system <b>100</b> of MTR characterization of a component <b>130</b> is illustrated, in accordance with various embodiments.

The baseline sample and the low noise sample are same component fabricated with different heat treatment processes, respectively. Consequently, the low noise sample has lower MTR content as compared to that of the baseline sample. A &#x201c;C-Scan,&#x201d; as referred to herein, is data collected from an ultrasonic inspection that is plotted on a top view of the component surface under test.

For example, all peak amplitudes greater than the sum of the mean peak amplitude and two times of the standard deviation may be selected. The first 5-10 peak factors may be removed from the sample as potential outliers. Any number of outliers may be removed from the sample and be within the scope of this disclosure. The peak factor for a sample/region may be plotted vs. the sample index. For example, each amplitude in the sample/region may correspond to a respective peak factor. In various embodiments, in plotting the peak factor as a function of the sample index, two samples/regions may be compared to characterize MTR content. A lower peak factor may correspond to lower microtexture levels and/or greater service life of the sample and/or component, in combination with knowledge of other critical factors related to service life. For example, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the peak factor vs. the number of peaks is plotted for the baseline sample (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), and the low noise sample (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), respectively.

For example, when the range is from the 10<sup>th </sup>largest peak to the 100<sup>th </sup>largest peak, the number of peaks is plotted from 0.10 to 1.00. From the plot shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, an average peak factor can be calculated over the range R<b>1</b>.

A C-scan amplitude image may be transformed to frequency domain utilizing a two-dimensional Fourier transform. Generally, most power in the frequency domain locates within the baseband, which is the band close to the zero frequency. The bandwidth of the baseband contains useful information of how backscattered noises are distributed spatially. Herein, a bandwidth is not limited to the common definition of a 6 dB width, but may be a 10 dB width, a 20 dB width, or like. Moreover, a bandwidth is defined as the longest width of the baseband, as a two-dimensional baseband may not be axis-symmetric, or its elongation direction may not aligned with either axis of the domain. Consequently, a baseband bandwidth defined with a first width (e.g., 20 dB width) of the sample may be plotted vs. a baseband bandwidth defined with a second width (e.g., 6 dB width) of the sample (i.e., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>).
