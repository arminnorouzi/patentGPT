Commercialization of LIB technology began in the early 1990s, and in the intervening decades, the energy density of LIB-based devices continues to increase step-wise by about 160 watt-hour per kilogram (Wh/kg) each year. Today LIB technology allows for more storage of energy per kilogram than all other rechargeable battery technologies including nickel-cadmium batteries (NiCd), lead acid, and nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The basic structure of most LIB cells includes an anode, a cathode, and electrolyte material disposed therebetween. One significant area of research and improvement in LIB technology remains at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Formation of a LIB cell includes introduction of a passivation layer on the electrodes, and in particular, at the interface between the anode and electrolyte material. The passivation layer gets formed when the alkali anode metal gets immersed in a battery electrolyte, or when a negative potential is applied to a carbon or to an inert electrode immersed in the electrolyte, with the resulting layer formed as a solid electrolyte, commonly referred to as a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The resulting SEI layer limits further reduction of electrolyte, and thus, electrochemically stabilizes the LIB cell. Each charge-discharge cycle of a LIB cell results in a gradual thickening of the SEI layer and irreversible capacity loss. This is due to SEI formation and growth that consumes active lithium and electrolyte materials, and ultimately reduces charge capacity, increases battery resistance, and reduces power density.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Time and temperature factor significantly in the continued growth of SEI layers, with higher temperatures generally increasing growth rates. Current approaches to forming LIB batteries include forming a relatively thin SEI layer of a few nanometers to maximize LIB cell lifespans. The SEI layer remains a significant challenge in improving LIB cell performance, and in particular, LIB cell performance in a wide-range of operating temperatures.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">These and other features advantages will be better understood by reading the following detailed description, taken together with the drawings wherein:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The drawings included herewith are for illustrating various examples of articles, methods, and apparatuses of the teaching of the present specification and are not intended to limit the scope of what is taught in any way.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example LIB cell with an SEI layer formed between an anode carbon and electrolyte material.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a system for determining an SEI layer thickness for a LIB cell to achieve a target self-discharge amount when operating in a predetermined temperature/temperature range, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example process by which the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> determines an SEI layer thickness value for a LIB cell, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an example process for forming a LIB cell with an SEI layer having an overall thickness substantially equal to a determined layer thickness value determined by the example process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an example process for verifying a LIB cell formed by the example process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> includes a formed SEI layer with a thickness substantially equal to the determined layer thickness value.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an example battery thermal management system in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Continued improvement of LIB cell performance depends at least in part on SEI layer chemistries and formation processes that maintain energy storage density, limit self-discharge, and allow for continuous operation in a wide-range of less-than-ideal operating temperatures.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the basic structure of a LIB cell <b>100</b> for reference. As shown, the LIB cell <b>100</b> includes an anode current collector <b>102</b>, an anode carbon <b>106</b>, an SEI layer <b>108</b>, electrolyte material <b>110</b>, a separator <b>114</b>, a cathode metal <b>112</b>, and a cathode current collector <b>104</b>. The components of the LIB cell <b>100</b> stack/sandwich together within a battery housing (not shown). The anode current collector <b>102</b> can comprise, for instance, copper (Cu) or other suitable material. Likewise, the cathode current collector <b>104</b> can comprise a metal such as aluminum (Al) or other suitable material. The cathode metal <b>112</b> comprises, for instance, lithium metal oxide.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Existing approaches to produce LIB cells, such as LIB cell <b>100</b>, prioritize maximizing lifespan (e.g., shelf-storage life, charge-discharge cycles) by formation of an SEI layer <b>108</b> that is one or two nanometers thick (herein after referred to as &#x201c;thin&#x201d; SEI layers). However, this &#x201c;one size fits all&#x201d; approach operates on the presumption that ambient operating temperatures remain within an ideal range (e.g., 15-35 degrees Celsius (C)).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, exposure of LIB cells having such &#x201c;thin&#x201d; SEI layers to ambient temperatures in excess of, for instance, 35&#xb0; C., significantly impacts LIB performance characteristics such as self-discharge. The self-discharge of all battery chemistries increases at higher temperatures, and the rate typically doubles with every 10&#xb0; C. (18&#xb0; F.). Self-discharge refers to the amount of charge lost in a battery cell when uncoupled from load, which is to say in an open-circuit condition. Measurement of self-discharge generally includes charging a battery cell to full and performing an initial measurement of the open-circuit voltage. A subsequent measurement of the open-circuit voltage gets taken after a predetermined amount of time. The delta between the initial and subsequent measurement of open-circuit voltage indicates a lowered state of charge (SoC). Lower SoC translates to lower stored energy, i.e., stored amp-hours, and thus allows for the amount of self-discharge to be determined.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the context of LIB cells, the amount/rate of discharge depends on multiple factors including, for instance, cell material/chemistry, SoC of the cell, temperature of the cell, and capacity of the cell. For instance, differences in potential between anode and cathode of a LIB cell caused by unwanted chemical reactions can result in so-called corrosive current. Temperature increases within a battery cell result in increased chemical reactions, and consequently, increased self-discharge amounts through such corrosive current. For example, a LIB battery cell operating at an ambient temperature of 20&#xb0; C. self-discharges about 5 percent over a four (4) week period, while the same LIB battery cell operating at an ambient temperature of 60&#xb0; C. self-discharges about 20% over a four (4) week period.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In recognition of these factors, battery thermal management systems (BTMS) get implemented within systems/devices that utilize LIB cells. Such BTMS systems are noted as important by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), who stipulate, among other things, that LIB cells should be kept within 15-35&#xb0; C. BTMSs generally include active components such as a micro pump and heat-exchanger to maintain nominal operating temperatures. However, BTMSs can introduce significant load on battery cells. For many applications and scenarios, BTMSs introduce load that effectively reduces power density.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Thus, applications that utilize LIB technology face a paradox in that relatively high-ambient temperatures cause battery performance losses, and regulating ambient temperatures to avoid such performance loss introduces load on the battery cells that constructively lowers power density.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Thus, in general, the present disclosure is directed to forming LIB cells with structure and chemistry that allows for operating in relatively high ambient temperature environments, e.g., up to and exceeding 60&#xb0; C., while significantly reducing self-discharge amounts, e.g., relative to other SEI LIB cells formed with the aforementioned &#x201c;thin&#x201d; SEI layers. For example, one non-limiting embodiment of the present disclosure enables a self-discharge amount for a LIB cell of 10% or less over a four (4) week period of time when operating at an ambient temperature of 60&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In more detail, the present disclosure has identified that corrosion current for a LIB cell is inversely proportional to the thickness of the SEI layer. Accordingly, a method of forming a LIB cell is disclosed herein that includes determining a thickness value for an SEI layer to limit self-discharge when operating at a predetermined ambient temperature. Thus, LIB cell formation includes material composition, e.g., via one or more SEI precursors, that results in formation of an SEI layer that includes a thickness substantially equal to the determined thickness.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Aspects of the present disclosure thus include forming SEI layers with a predetermined thickness that allows a battery cell to operate at a specific ambient temperature, or temperature range, and limit self-discharge when operating in that range. LIB cells formed in accordance with the present disclosure therefore include relatively thicker SEI layers than other approaches, which consequently reduces LIB cell lifespan. However, LIB cells formed consistent with the present disclosure advantageously maintain nominal power density over a longer period of time, and in a manner that is temperature resilient. Applications such as EVs may therefore eliminate or otherwise reduce BTMS loads and consequently extend overall driving range on a single charge.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one specific example embodiment, a BTMS is disclosed herein that utilizes one or more LIB cells with a formed SEI layer that limits self-discharge at a target ambient temperature, e.g., by determining and achieving a target layer thickness for a formed SEI layer as disclosed herein. In this embodiment, the reduction in self-discharge current gets advantageously used to maintain the one or more LIB cells at the target ambient temperature. For example, a LIB cell formed consistent with the present disclosure results in a self-discharge amount of 10% or less, and preferably 4% or less, over four (4) weeks when operating at 60&#xb0; C. The BTMS may be configured to preferably consume about 6% or less of stored charge over the same period. The BTMS may utilize this relatively small amount of current to reject heat in excess of the 60&#xb0; C. target. Thus, the total amount of power consumed by the BTMS and self-discharge over a four (4) week period remains preferably at or under 10%. Importantly, this enables use of LIB cells in high-temperature environments, e.g., operating in ambient temperatures at or above 35&#xb0; C., without the loss of energy density and battery performance degradation that would otherwise occur.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Another aspect of the present disclosure is generally directed towards utilizing boron nitride nanosheets (BNNs) to increase thermal communication between battery cells. BNNs are ideally suited for use with LIB cells, although BNNs may be utilized in a wide-range of battery types and chemistries and are not necessarily limited to LIB cells. BNNs between battery cells increase passive heat transfer and homogenize temperature distribution and transfer to a heating plate/heat exchanger. Accordingly, and in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure, the above-discussed BTMS system may further include one or more BBN layers disposed/coated on associated battery cells to achieve increased thermal communication and homogenous temperature distribution, thus further reducing the load of the BTMS.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The term substantially, as generally referred to herein, refers to a degree of precision within acceptable tolerance that accounts for and reflects minor real-world variation due to material composition, material defects, and/or limitations/peculiarities in manufacturing processes.

The layered structure of hexagonal boron nitride enables crystalline sheets to be exfoliated and isolated down to potentially a single atomic thickness. Further processing enables the exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride sheets to be formed into nanocomposites. Accordingly, the BNN <b>604</b> is well suited for use within battery cells as the same requires little, if any, increase in battery cell housing footprint.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">The first and second battery packages <b>606</b>, <b>608</b> therefore couple together to form a thermal communication path therethrough. The first and second battery packages <b>606</b>, <b>608</b> may then thermally couple to a cold-side <b>613</b> of cooling plate <b>612</b>, with the cooling plate <b>612</b> being configured to draw generated heat from the first and second battery packages <b>606</b>, <b>608</b> via the formed thermal communication path. The BNNS <b>604</b> disposed along the formed thermal communication path, in in particular at an interface formed between the first and second battery cells <b>607</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>607</b>-<b>2</b>, significantly increases passive heat transfer to the cooling plate <b>612</b>. Thus, the BNNS <b>604</b> achieves heat transfer, e.g., up to 420 W/mK, which is an order of 40 times greater than existing commercially available thermal interface materials, e.g., which have a thermal conductivity of about 10 W/mK.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">In an embodiment, one or more BNN layers/coatings may be disposed on or within the battery packages <b>606</b>, <b>608</b> to increase passive heat transfer. For example, the heatsink mating surface <b>620</b> can include a BNN layer/coating consistent with the present disclosure disposed thereon. Alternatively, or in addition, BNN layer/coatings may be applied to one or more of inner the surfaces of the first/second plates that define the cavities of the first and second battery packages, to the mounting surface <b>621</b> that forms an interface between the first and second battery packages <b>606</b>, <b>608</b>, and/or to the surfaces defining the first, second and/or third battery cells <b>607</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>607</b>-<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">Continuing on, the temperature control arrangement <b>610</b> includes a heatsink in the form of cooling plate <b>612</b>, a heat exchange controller <b>602</b>, a heat exchange device <b>614</b>, and a pump <b>616</b>. The heat exchange controller <b>602</b> outputs an electrical drive signal to the heat exchanger <b>614</b>. A thermistor (not shown) or other temperature measurement device may be thermally coupled to the first and/or second battery packages <b>606</b>, <b>608</b> (and preferably within the cavity of the first and/or second battery packages) to provide a feedback loop to the heat exchange controller <b>602</b>. The heat exchange controller <b>602</b> can then output the driving signal to the heat exchanger <b>614</b> to reject heat above a target temperature based on the feedback loop to control the ambient temperature within the first and second battery packages <b>606</b>, <b>608</b>. The heat exchange device <b>614</b> can comprise a radiator, for instance, through which water or other liquid gets pumped through by pump <b>616</b>. Other types of heat exchange approaches are within the scope of this disclosure such as using air-cooling.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">The cooling plate <b>612</b> includes a cold-side surface <b>613</b> for thermally coupling to the first and second battery packages <b>606</b>, <b>608</b>. A hot-side surface <b>615</b> is disposed opposite the cold-side surface <b>613</b>. In operation, the temperature control arrangement <b>610</b> draws heat from the first and second battery packages <b>606</b>, <b>608</b> away from the hot-side surface <b>615</b> along the aforementioned thermal communication path formed between the first and second battery packages <b>606</b>, <b>608</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">In an embodiment, the first, second and third battery cells <b>607</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>607</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>607</b>-<b>3</b> are formed consistent with the present disclosure and include SEI layer thicknesses that enable nominal battery performance when operating at a target ambient temperature or ambient temperature range. For example, each of the first, second and third battery cells <b>607</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>607</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>607</b>-<b>3</b> can include a formed SEI layer with a thickness that maintains self-discharge at or below a predefined amount, e.g., 6% over four (4) weeks, when operating the target ambient temperature or temperature range. Preferably, the first, second and third battery cells <b>607</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>607</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>607</b>-<b>3</b> have an SEI layer thickness that enables a self-discharge amount of 3-4% over four (4) weeks.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">In this scenario, the BTMS system <b>600</b> may be configured to reject heat above, for instance, 60 degrees Celsius. Thus, the BTMS system <b>600</b> consumes a relatively small amount of power via an operating current drawn from the first, second and/or third battery cells <b>607</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>607</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>607</b>-<b>3</b>, and preferably, less than 6% of charge over a four (4) week period. The sum of the self-discharge amount and the load by the BTMS system <b>600</b> thus equals a virtual self-discharge amount of 10% or less. Therefore, the BTMS system <b>600</b> provides a hybrid active-passive thermal management scheme that allows for continuous operation within relatively high ambient temperatures that would otherwise significantly degrade existing LIB cells and/or limit effective energy density (e.g., by necessitating increased load on batteries by the BTMS system <b>600</b>). To this end, the BTMS system <b>600</b> may also be referred to as a LIB BTMS control system <b>600</b> or simply a LIB temperature control system.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">In accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure a method for forming a lithium ion battery (LIB) cell that limits self-discharge to a target self-discharge amount over a period of time T when operating within a predetermined ambient temperature is disclosed.
