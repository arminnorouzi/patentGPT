To this end, use is conventionally made of sensors which have to be fastened to the body of the patient. One possibility for measuring the heartbeat is a capacitive ECG, in which an ECG signal is picked up in a purely capacitive manner and without any direct contact between patient and sensor, in particular through clothing of the patient. In order to achieve a good signal quality of the heartbeat signal, the measured signal must preferably have a high amplitude. This can be achieved by means of a high capacitance between patient and sensor. The capacitance can be directly influenced by the size of the coupling area between sensor and patient. The greater the coupling area, the greater the capacitance that is achieved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to suppress interference in measured signals, provision is customarily made for protective measures in the form of a e.g. a ground connection of the voltage measuring system or a reference electrode (neutral driven electrode: NDE).

This increases the preparation effort involved in a capacitive ECG measurement, since the various sensor elements have to be arranged or held in a desired position at the patient.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to this, use is customarily made of capacitive ECG arrangements which are integrated in a layered manner in conductive textiles, the conductivity being achieved by means of a vapor deposition process using conductive particles, for example. The reference electrode is often embodied as a separate sensor element in this case. The use of textiles in a sensor element also makes the cleaning process more difficult.

Further particularly advantageous embodiments and developments of the present invention are specified in the dependent claims and in the following description, wherein individual features of different exemplary embodiments or variants can also be combined to form further exemplary embodiments or variants.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Example embodiments of the present invention relate to an integrated differential voltage measuring system for measuring bioelectrical signals of a patient. The inventive differential voltage measuring system captures bioelectrical signals from e.g. a human or animal patient. For this purpose, it has a number of measuring lines or useful-signal paths. In the form of individual cables, for example, these connect electrodes that are placed on the patient for the purpose of capturing signals to further components of the voltage measuring system, i.e. in particular to an electronics module which is used to evaluate and/or represent the captured bioelectrical signals, in particular heartbeat signals.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The differential voltage measuring system can be designed in particular as an electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG) or electromyogram (EMG).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The differential voltage measuring system has at least two signal measuring circuits, each corresponding to a useful-signal path and each comprising a sensor electrode. The voltage measuring system can comprise precisely two but also more than two signal measuring circuits.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The signal measuring circuits each have, in addition to the sensor electrode, a measuring amplifier circuit and a sensor line between the measuring amplifier circuit and the sensor electrode. In embodiments of the present invention, the sensor lines are used to transfer the bioelectrical measured signals captured by the sensor electrode to the respective measuring amplifier circuit. The measuring amplifier circuit preferably comprises an operational amplifier, which can be designed as a back-coupled device. This means that the negative input of the operational amplifier, also referred to as an inverting input, is coupled to the output of the operational amplifier, thereby generating a high virtual input impedance at the positive input.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The voltage measuring system further comprises a reference measuring circuit comprising a reference electrode. The reference electrode and the associated reference measuring circuit are used to achieve a potential equalization between the patient and the ECG measuring device. In embodiments of the present invention, the reference measuring circuit likewise comprises a signal line and an operational amplifier.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The sensor electrodes and the reference electrode are each designed as planar electrodes and have a film-type structure. In other words, they are significantly smaller in one spatial dimension than in the two other spatial dimensions. The electrodes can have any desired shape. In particular, the sensor electrodes can have a base area which is round, rectangular or e.g. elliptical. The sensor electrodes and the reference electrode can be composed of the following materials or comprise at least one of said materials: metallic sheets or films, textiles which are rendered conductive by means of vapor deposition or by other methods, or other conductive materials such as carbon or materials with carbon admixture.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The sensor electrodes and the reference electrode are constructed in a layered manner in particular. Both forms of electrode have at least one electrically conductive layer. The conductive layers preferably have a maximum surface resistance of 100 kOhm. The conductive layer is oriented towards the electrode covering or in the direction of the patient.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In embodiments, any of the sensor electrodes can comprise further layers, e.g. for the purpose of passive shielding of strong electromagnetic interference, or for active shielding by providing a high input impedance. The reference electrode can likewise comprise further shielding layers. All further layers are arranged on that side of the electrically conductive layer which faces away from the patient.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The sensor electrodes and the reference electrode are inventively arranged adjacent to or interposed with each other, extending on the same plane. They have a defined distance from each other. In this case, the reference electrode is so designed as to surround the sensor electrodes at least partially.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The sensor electrodes have a respective diameter or side length in the range from 3 cm to 6 cm, preferably 4 cm to 5 cm, in the case of a circular or rectangular embodiment. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the sensor electrodes have the same basic shape, but can also have different shapes.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The reference electrode has a diameter or maximum side length in the range between 15 cm and 30 cm, preferably between 18 cm and 25 cm.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The sensor line of a signal measuring circuit is used to transfer the measured signals captured by means of the sensor electrode to the measuring amplifier. The measuring amplifier circuit preferably comprises an operational amplifier, which can be designed as a back-coupled device. This means that the negative input of the operational amplifier, also referred to as an inverting input, is coupled to the output of the operational amplifier, thereby generating a high virtual input impedance at the positive input.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Sensor lines and signal line and further components of the signal measuring circuits and reference measuring circuit are inventively arranged outside the plane of the electrodes, preferably on that side of the electrode plane which faces away from the patient.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The inventive voltage measuring system is further characterized by a shared electrically conductive electrode covering, which superimposes at least a region that is formed by the base areas of the sensor electrodes and the reference electrode. The electrically conductive electrode covering is designed as a unitary part.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In other words, the shared electrode covering superimposes both the two sensor electrodes and the reference electrode. In embodiments, the electrode covering extends beyond the area that is formed by the base areas of sensor electrodes and reference electrode, and is itself therefore larger. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the electrode covering has a diameter or a side length respectively in the range from 15 cm to 30 cm, preferably between 20 cm and 35 cm.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to example embodiments of the present invention, the sensor electrodes, the reference electrode and the electrically conductive electrode covering or the inventive voltage measuring system are designed as an integral sensor element which is positioned against or on the patient for the purpose of an ECG measurement and is used for both the ECG signal capture and potential equalization.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is thereby possible to reduce the preparation effort involved in an ECG measurement since only one sensor element or fewer sensor elements have to be positioned against the patient.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Example embodiments of the present invention is based on the finding that in particular textiles with cotton content have a bulk resistance between 100 MOhm and 1000 MOhm in a dry state. Practice shows that following humidification by means of spray mist or sweat of the patient, the bulk resistance during an ECG measurement in the case of cotton and many other textiles typically falls below 10 MOhm, sometimes even to below 1 MOhm.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A structure comprising a purely capacitive ECG with the electrodes embedded in textile layers is therefore not considered to be suitable, since an ohmic connection would be suppressed in this case.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to example embodiments of the present invention, a differential voltage measuring system functions both with ohmically insulating layers and at the same time, using ohmically conductive layers, exploits the advantages of this electrical conductivity. The inventive differential voltage measuring system is therefore so designed as to also provide an ohmically conductive connection. The differential voltage measuring system is designed in a particularly advantageous manner to have a maximum bulk resistance of 10 MOhm in the dry state and a maximum bulk resistance of 1 MOhm when humidity is added.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">This and all of the following resistance details comply with the requirements of DIN EN 61340-2-3 (VDE 0300-2-3), Elektrostatik&#x2014;Teil 2-3: Pr&#xfc;fverfahren zur Bestimmung des Widerstandes and des spezifischen Widerstandes von festen Werkstoffen, die zur Vermeidung elektrostatischer Aufladung verwendet werden [Electrostatics&#x2014;Part 2-3: Test methods for the determination of the electrical resistance and resistivity of solid materials used to avoid electrostatic charge accumulation] (IEC 61340-2-3:2016).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a particularly advantageous manner, the present invention uses the electrical conductivity for both the sensor electrodes and for the interference suppression by means of a reference electrode.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The conductive design of the electrode covering, the sensor electrodes and the further electrodes means that, in addition to the capacitive coupling for capacitive measurement of an ECG signal, under suitable environmental conditions, an ohmic connection can develop between patient and electrodes. In this configuration, capacitive resistance and ohmic resistance are connected in parallel.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In embodiments of the differential voltage measuring system, the electrically conductive electrode covering has a layer thickness of less than 100 &#x3bc;m, preferably 50 &#x3bc;m. The thinner the electrode covering, the easier it is to shape and also to achieve a particularly low sensor element structure. Thicker embodiment variants are however also possible, e.g. in the range of a few millimeters.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In embodiments of the differential voltage measuring system, the electrically conductive electrode covering is composed of a synthetic material, e.g. a polyamide (PA), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyurethane (PU), polyolefin or polyvinyl chloride (PVC), from which it is particularly easy to manufacture and process the thin layers/films described above. In addition, in comparison with textiles, synthetic materials have particularly good cleaning properties due to their smooth, washable and disinfectable surface.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In order to achieve a desired electrical conductivity of the electrode covering, provision is made in embodiments of the differential voltage measuring system for the electrode covering or the material forming the electrode covering to be enriched with carbon particles. The particles can preferably be nanoparticles. The saturation level of the carbon admixture depends in this case on the desired conductivity and on the type of carbon particles. When selecting the carbon particles, it must be taken into particular consideration that a higher saturation level has a greater effect on the mechanical material properties. In particular, adequate conductivity can already be achieved with a very low saturation level of a few percent by volume as a result of using carbon nanotubes (CNT).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In further embodiments of the differential voltage measuring system, the electrically conductive electrode covering is made from a hygroscopic material. In addition to certain synthetic materials, textiles such as e.g. cotton also have this property. Hygroscopic materials are characterized by a capacity to absorb and store water. They are capable of binding humidity, thereby allowing humidity-dependent adaptation of the electrical conductivity or in particular bulk resistance. The electrode covering is preferably designed to reduce the bulk resistance below 1 MOhm by introducing liquid, e.g. sweat or water. This value corresponds to an electrical conductivity that is achieved by ECG devices with an ohmic connection using textiles that comprise cotton or a less conductive base material with conductive additives. It is thus possible by means of the differential voltage measuring system to obtain a high-quality ECG signal by means of an ohmic connection.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In particularly preferred embodiments, the conductive electrode covering is made from a hygroscopic synthetic material. This combines the adaptability of the conductivity with the resilience and the effective processing properties of the synthetic materials.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In embodiments of the present invention, the electrically conductive electrode covering is so designed as to have a surface resistance greater than 500 MOhm and a bulk resistance of less than 100 MOhm. These values for the surface resistance and the bulk resistance are advantageous limit values, in order to achieve the advantages of the ohmic connection as described above by virtue of the low bulk resistance and, by virtue of the high surface resistance, to avoid unwanted enlargement of the sensor area and contact with other elements. The resistance values relate to dry environmental conditions without any humidity entering the material of the electrode covering.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In embodiments of the present invention, the base area size of the reference electrode is a multiple of the base area size of a sensor electrode. The base area of the reference electrode can therefore be two times or many times the size of the base area of a sensor electrode. It preferably covers the region between the sensor electrodes completely (or essentially completely/extensively), in order to produce a high capacitance at the same time as a low ohmic resistance when the sensor element that is formed by the differential voltage measuring system is positioned against the patient, who is then covered extensively by the various electrodes.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In order to keep the overall size of the inventive differential voltage measuring system within limits, in embodiments of the present invention, the reference electrode is so shaped as to surround the sensor electrodes over an angular range of at least 180&#xb0; in each case. With a rectangular design of the sensor electrodes, this means that the reference electrode surrounds the sensor electrode on at least two adjacent sides. The reference electrode can therefore extend at least partially between, alongside or beyond the sensor electrodes. Therefore the regions between the sensor electrodes are advantageously used for the potential equalization that is obtained by means of the reference electrode.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In embodiments, the reference electrode also has a distance from each of the sensor electrodes such that the impedance between reference electrode and sensor electrode is greater than 100 MOhm in each case. This impedance value is achieved at a distance between 0.5 cm and 1.5 cm, in particular 1 cm.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In a particularly advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the differential voltage measuring system also comprises a grounding circuit comprising a grounding electrode, whose base area is superimposed by the electrically conductive electrode covering. This arrangement corresponds to a further degree of integration for the differential voltage measuring system, in which the grounding circuit is now also integrated, again making use of the positive effects of the conductive electrode covering for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The grounding electrode is likewise designed as a planar electrode having a layer-type or film-type structure and is likewise arranged on the same plane as the sensor electrodes and reference electrode. The grounding electrode is likewise advantageously sized and is arranged in a space-saving manner between, alongside or beyond sensor electrodes and/or the reference electrode and/or surrounds these at least partially. The grounding electrode also has an electrically conductive layer which is oriented towards the patient and a maximum surface resistance of 100 kOhm. Further shielding layers can be provided on that side which faces away from the patient.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The differential voltage measuring system is intended to be designed in such a way that an impedance value of at least 1 GOhm, preferably at least 10 GOhm, is achieved between grounding electrode and each of the sensor electrodes. This impedance value is achieved by selecting the distance between grounding electrode and each sensor electrode between <b>1</b>.<b>5</b> cm and 2.5 cm, preferably 2 cm.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Requirements are fundamentally stricter for the distance between grounding electrode and sensor electrode than between reference electrode and sensor electrode. In the case of lower impedance values, the danger would arise that electrical interference in the measured ECG signal would be increased further by the grounding electrode. In cases where only low electrical interference is to be expected, and where standards allow, it is also possible to reduce the impedance by decreasing the distance.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The differential voltage measuring system is further intended to be designed in such a way that an impedance value of at least 200 MOhm, preferably at least 2 GOhm, is achieved between grounding electrode and reference electrode. This impedance value is achieved by selecting the distance between grounding electrode and reference electrode between 0.5 cm and 1.5 cm, preferably 1 cm.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the figures, an ECG measuring system <b>1</b> is used in each case as an exemplary differential voltage measuring system <b>1</b>, in order to measure bioelectrical signals S(k), namely ECG signals S(k) in this case.

Patient P and sensor electrodes <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> are in close physical proximity to each other. More precisely stated, the sensor element la comprising the sensor electrodes <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> is placed on or against the patient P.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The sensor element la in the present embodiment has an approximately trapezoid basic shape with rounded corners.

The sensor electrodes <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> here have a square basic shape with a side length of 5 cm. The sensor electrodes <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> are placed towards the corners of the sensor element la at a distance of 4 cm to 5 cm from the edge.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The structure of a signal measuring circuit <b>30</b> is explained in greater detail below. Patient P can be provided with a material garment C, for example. The sensor element la is mechanically stabilized by a supporting structure <b>22</b>, e.g. a hard shell-like housing of synthetic material with a compressible stabilizing filler material such as a PU foam, for example. Both of the sensor electrodes <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and the two other sensor electrodes are superimposed by the shared electrode covering <b>3</b><i>a</i>. The electrode covering <b>3</b><i>a </i>is designed as an electrically conductive cover layer. The sensor electrodes <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> likewise comprise an electrically conductive layer. The electrode covering <b>3</b><i>a </i>does not provide complete ohmic insulation of the sensor electrodes <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> from the patient P. In this respect, the electrode covering <b>3</b><i>a </i>functions as an ohmic resistance which is connected in parallel with the capacitive resistance between patient P and sensor electrode <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>. The sensor electrodes <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> can be capacitively coupled to the patient P in any case. With suitable patient clothing and/or a corresponding environmental temperature or environmental (air) humidity, the electrode covering <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the conductive layer of the sensor electrodes <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> also allow an ohmic connection between patient P and sensor electrodes <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>. The capacitive coupling of the ECG signal into the sensor electrodes <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> is not impaired by the sensor covering <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">This Arrangement Offers the Following Advantages:</heading><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As a result of the parallel connection of capacitive and ohmic resistance by means of the electrically conductive electrode covering <b>3</b><i>a</i>, significantly lower impedances form in comparison with a purely capacitive coupling. This results in an improved ECG signal quality, which is comparable with regular ohmically coupled ECG devices using adhesive electrodes or wrist terminals.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">This allows the development of the full characteristic of the classic ECG signal shape including all individual segments and without the suppression of low-frequency components such as the T wave, for example.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Since the electrode covering <b>3</b><i>a </i>extends over a maximum area of the sensor element la, an electrostatic discharge (ESD) is possible over the whole area, resulting in lower signal interference.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The shared all-embracing electrode covering <b>3</b><i>a </i>is easy to manufacture and the structure of the corresponding sensor element <b>1</b><i>a </i>is likewise simple. The electrode covering <b>3</b><i>a</i>, particularly when designed as a film of synthetic material, allows a smooth and hygienic surface with good cleaning properties.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">If the patient is wearing a textile garment with a bulk resistance of less than 10 GOhm, e.g. a cotton or any other woven material which has been exposed to minimal vapor deposition or sweat, a discharge of electrostatic charges of the patient P occurs via the electrode covering <b>3</b><i>a</i>, resulting in faster signal initialization.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The sensor electrode <b>3</b>, a sensor line <b>6</b><i>a </i>which runs from the sensor electrode <b>3</b> to an operational amplifier <b>27</b>, and the measuring circuit <b>30</b> which comprises the operational amplifier <b>27</b> are surrounded by a so-called active guard <b>25</b> and preferably also a shield S. The operational amplifier <b>27</b> is designed as a back-coupled device. This means that the negative input <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the operational amplifier <b>27</b> is coupled to the output <b>28</b> of the operational amplifier <b>27</b>. In this way, a high virtual impedance is achieved at the positive input <b>27</b><i>b </i>for the operational amplifier <b>27</b>. This means that as a result of adapting the voltage between the output <b>28</b> and the positive input <b>27</b><i>b</i>, barely any current flows between the sensor <b>3</b> and the active guard <b>25</b>. Furthermore, the positive input <b>27</b><i>b </i>of the operational amplifier <b>27</b> is maintained at an electrical bias voltage with the aid of a resistor <b>26</b> which is connected to the measuring device frame (measuring ground). The positive input can therefore be set to a desired measuring potential. It is thereby possible to suppress DC components, in particular during a primarily capacitive coupling.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The signal measuring circuit <b>30</b> is also connected to the ground E via a further grounding layer ES.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Shield S is likewise connected to the device frame via connection point <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Active guard <b>25</b>, shield S and grounding layer ES each surround the sensor electrodes <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> in order to provide an effective shield.

In particular, active guard <b>25</b>, shield S and grounding layer ES, as well as the sensor line <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the operational amplifier <b>27</b>, are arranged on that side of the sensor electrodes <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> which faces away from the patient P.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">A further planar electrode is also provided as a grounding electrode <b>6</b> in the sensor element la shown here, for the purpose of at least capacitive but also ohmic coupling of the patient P to the ground potential E, and is in effect integrated in the sensor element <b>1</b><i>a</i>. The grounding electrode <b>6</b> here has a square basic shape and likewise has a side length of 5 cm. The distance from the sensor electrodes is 4 cm here. Impedance values significantly higher than 200 MOhm can be achieved at this distance.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">A further planar electrode, which is designed as a reference electrode <b>5</b>, together with its associated measuring circuit <b>36</b> is used in the sensor element la for potential discharge, e.g. as a so-called driven neutral electrode (DNE). The reference electrode <b>5</b> has a basic shape which is adapted to the arrangement and shape of the other electrodes and essentially occupies all of the regions between the other electrodes, a distance of at least 1 cm from the other electrodes being provided.

Unless specifically stated otherwise, or as is apparent from the discussion, terms such as &#x201c;processing&#x201d; or &#x201c;computing&#x201d; or &#x201c;calculating&#x201d; or &#x201c;determining&#x201d; of &#x201c;displaying&#x201d; or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device/hardware, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical, electronic quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In this application, including the definitions below, the term &#x2018;module&#x2019;, &#x2018;interface&#x2019; or the term &#x2018;controller&#x2019; may be replaced with the term &#x2018;circuit.&#x2019; The term &#x2018;module&#x2019; may refer to, be part of, or include processor hardware (shared, dedicated, or group) that executes code and memory hardware (shared, dedicated, or group) that stores code executed by the processor hardware.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The module or interface may include one or more interface circuits. In some examples, the interface circuits may include wired or wireless interfaces that are connected to a local area network (LAN), the Internet, a wide area network (WAN), or combinations thereof. The functionality of any given module of the present disclosure may be distributed among multiple modules that are connected via interface circuits. For example, multiple modules may allow load balancing. In a further example, a server (also known as remote, or cloud) module may accomplish some functionality on behalf of a client module.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Software may include a computer program, program code, instructions, or some combination thereof, for independently or collectively instructing or configuring a hardware device to operate as desired. The computer program and/or program code may include program or computer-readable instructions, software components, software modules, data files, data structures, and/or the like, capable of being implemented by one or more hardware devices, such as one or more of the hardware devices mentioned above. Examples of program code include both machine code produced by a compiler and higher level program code that is executed using an interpreter.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">For example, when a hardware device is a computer processing device (e.g., a processor, Central Processing Unit (CPU), a controller, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), a digital signal processor, a microcomputer, a microprocessor, etc.), the computer processing device may be configured to carry out program code by performing arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations, according to the program code. Once the program code is loaded into a computer processing device, the computer processing device may be programmed to perform the program code, thereby transforming the computer processing device into a special purpose computer processing device. In a more specific example, when the program code is loaded into a processor, the processor becomes programmed to perform the program code and operations corresponding thereto, thereby transforming the processor into a special purpose processor.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Software and/or data may be embodied permanently or temporarily in any type of machine, component, physical or virtual equipment, or computer storage medium or device, capable of providing instructions or data to, or being interpreted by, a hardware device. The software also may be distributed over network coupled computer systems so that the software is stored and executed in a distributed fashion. In particular, for example, software and data may be stored by one or more computer readable recording mediums, including the tangible or non-transitory computer-readable storage media discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Even further, any of the disclosed methods may be embodied in the form of a program or software. The program or software may be stored on a non-transitory computer readable medium and is adapted to perform any one of the aforementioned methods when run on a computer device (a device including a processor). Thus, the non-transitory, tangible computer readable medium, is adapted to store information and is adapted to interact with a data processing facility or computer device to execute the program of any of the above mentioned embodiments and/or to perform the method of any of the above mentioned embodiments.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Example embodiments may be described with reference to acts and symbolic representations of operations (e.g., in the form of flow charts, flow diagrams, data flow diagrams, structure diagrams, block diagrams, etc.) that may be implemented in conjunction with units and/or devices discussed in more detail below. Although discussed in a particularly manner, a function or operation specified in a specific block may be performed differently from the flow specified in a flowchart, flow diagram, etc. For example, functions or operations illustrated as being performed serially in two consecutive blocks may actually be performed simultaneously, or in some cases be performed in reverse order.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">According to one or more example embodiments, computer processing devices may be described as including various functional units that perform various operations and/or functions to increase the clarity of the description. However, computer processing devices are not intended to be limited to these functional units. For example, in one or more example embodiments, the various operations and/or functions of the functional units may be performed by other ones of the functional units. Further, the computer processing devices may perform the operations and/or functions of the various functional units without sub-dividing the operations and/or functions of the computer processing units into these various functional units.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Units and/or devices according to one or more example embodiments may also include one or more storage devices (i.e., storage means). The one or more storage devices may be tangible or non-transitory computer-readable storage media, such as random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), a permanent mass storage device (such as a disk drive), solid state (e.g., NAND flash) device, and/or any other like data storage mechanism capable of storing and recording data. The one or more storage devices may be configured to store computer programs, program code, instructions, or some combination thereof, for one or more operating systems and/or for implementing the example embodiments described herein. The computer programs, program code, instructions, or some combination thereof, may also be loaded from a separate computer readable storage medium into the one or more storage devices and/or one or more computer processing devices using a drive mechanism. Such separate computer readable storage medium may include a Universal Serial Bus (USB) flash drive, a memory stick, a Blu-ray/DVD/CD-ROM drive, a memory card, and/or other like computer readable storage media. The computer programs, program code, instructions, or some combination thereof, may be loaded into the one or more storage devices and/or the one or more computer processing devices from a remote data storage device via a network interface, rather than via a local computer readable storage medium. Additionally, the computer programs, program code, instructions, or some combination thereof, may be loaded into the one or more storage devices and/or the one or more processors from a remote computing system that is configured to transfer and/or distribute the computer programs, program code, instructions, or some combination thereof, over a network. The remote computing system may transfer and/or distribute the computer programs, program code, instructions, or some combination thereof, via a wired interface, an air interface, and/or any other like medium.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The one or more hardware devices, the one or more storage devices, and/or the computer programs, program code, instructions, or some combination thereof, may be specially designed and constructed for the purposes of the example embodiments, or they may be known devices that are altered and/or modified for the purposes of example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">A hardware device, such as a computer processing device, may run an operating system (OS) and one or more software applications that run on the OS. The computer processing device also may access, store, manipulate, process, and create data in response to execution of the software. For simplicity, one or more example embodiments may be exemplified as a computer processing device or processor; however, one skilled in the art will appreciate that a hardware device may include multiple processing elements or processors and multiple types of processing elements or processors. For example, a hardware device may include multiple processors or a processor and a controller. In addition, other processing configurations are possible, such as parallel processors.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The computer programs include processor-executable instructions that are stored on at least one non-transitory computer-readable medium (memory). The computer programs may also include or rely on stored data. The computer programs may encompass a basic input/output system (BIOS) that interacts with hardware of the special purpose computer, device drivers that interact with particular devices of the special purpose computer, one or more operating systems, user applications, background services, background applications, etc. As such, the one or more processors may be configured to execute the processor executable instructions.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The computer programs may include: (i) descriptive text to be parsed, such as HTML (hypertext markup language) or XML (extensible markup language), (ii) assembly code, (iii) object code generated from source code by a compiler, (iv) source code for execution by an interpreter, (v) source code for compilation and execution by a just-in-time compiler, etc. As examples only, source code may be written using syntax from languages including C, C++, C#, Objective-C, Haskell, Go, SQL, R, Lisp, Java&#xae;, Fortran, Perl, Pascal, Curl, OCaml, Javascript&#xae;, HTML<b>5</b>, Ada, ASP (active server pages), PHP, Scala, Eiffel, Smalltalk, Erlang, Ruby, Flash&#xae;, Visual Basic&#xae;, Lua, and Python&#xae;.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Further, at least one example embodiment relates to the non-transitory computer-readable storage medium including electronically readable control information (processor executable instructions) stored thereon, configured in such that when the storage medium is used in a controller of a device, at least one embodiment of the method may be carried out.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">The computer readable medium or storage medium may be a built-in medium installed inside a computer device main body or a removable medium arranged so that it can be separated from the computer device main body. The term computer-readable medium, as used herein, does not encompass transitory electrical or electromagnetic signals propagating through a medium (such as on a carrier wave); the term computer-readable medium is therefore considered tangible and non-transitory. Non-limiting examples of the non-transitory computer-readable medium include, but are not limited to, rewriteable non-volatile memory devices (including, for example flash memory devices, erasable programmable read-only memory devices, or a mask read-only memory devices); volatile memory devices (including, for example static random access memory devices or a dynamic random access memory devices); magnetic storage media (including, for example an analog or digital magnetic tape or a hard disk drive); and optical storage media (including, for example a CD, a DVD, or a Blu-ray Disc). Examples of the media with a built-in rewriteable non-volatile memory, include but are not limited to memory cards; and media with a built-in ROM, including but not limited to ROM cassettes; etc. Furthermore, various information regarding stored images, for example, property information, may be stored in any other form, or it may be provided in other ways.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The term code, as used above, may include software, firmware, and/or microcode, and may refer to programs, routines, functions, classes, data structures, and/or objects.
