The operation follower unit <b>7</b> is located to have its magnetic poles positioned in the front-rear direction, for example, the north pole positioned frontward and the south pole positioned rearward. The north pole and the south pole of the operation follower unit <b>7</b> are opposite to the north pole and the south pole of the adjacent first magnet <b>40</b>, which causes the north pole of the operation follower unit <b>7</b> frontward in the operation follower unit <b>7</b> to face the south pole of the first magnet <b>40</b> rearward in the first magnet <b>40</b>, and the south pole of the operation follower unit <b>7</b> rearward in the operation follower unit <b>7</b> to face the north pole of the first magnet <b>40</b> rearward in the first magnet <b>40</b>.

The switch follower unit <b>8</b> is a magnetic body formed from a plastic magnetic material and is magnetic. The switch follower unit <b>8</b> forms the capacitor as a dielectric. The switch follower unit <b>8</b> is located to cause the switch follower unit <b>8</b> and the second magnet <b>51</b> to attract each other.

The operation follower unit <b>7</b> and the first magnet <b>40</b> thus overlap each other as viewed from the viewpoint in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. The operation follower unit <b>7</b> at the front end of its movable range is spaced from the electrodes <b>900</b> in the lower chamber <b>92</b>.
