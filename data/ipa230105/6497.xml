For example, a charge dissipating assembly, which serves as a neutralizing device, is arranged between a shaft and a housing of a motor and contacts a radially outer surface of the shaft to ground a shaft voltage.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, if foreign matter adheres to the neutralizing device, the efficiency of eliminating the static electricity of the shaft by the neutralizing device may decrease. For example, in an in-vehicle drive device, a lubricating oil, a refrigerant for cooling a motor, and the like may adhere to a neutralizing device. At this time, there is a possibility that it becomes difficult to maintain good electrical conduction between a shaft and a housing due to a decrease in conductivity of the neutralizing device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An exemplary motor of the present invention includes a shaft, a rotor, a stator, a bearing, a housing, a first neutralizing device, and a seal member. The shaft includes a first shaft axially extending along a rotation axis. The rotor is fixed to the shaft and is rotatable about the rotation axis. The stator radially faces the rotor with a gap interposed therebetween. The bearing rotatably supports the shaft. The housing accommodates the rotor, the stator, and the bearing. The shaft further includes a second shaft. The second shaft extends to one axial side from the first shaft. The housing includes a bearing holder and a neutralizing device holder. The bearing holder has an opening through which the first shaft is inserted, and holds the bearing. The neutralizing device holder holds the first neutralizing device and covers at least a part of the opening. The neutralizing device holder includes a seal holder. The seal holder is arranged radially outward of the second shaft and holds the seal member. The first neutralizing device electrically connects the second shaft and the neutralizing device holder.

The power transmission device <b>3</b> transmits the power of the motor <b>1</b> to a drive shaft Ds. According to the configuration of the drive device <b>100</b> to be described hereinafter, it is possible to favorably maintain electrical connection between a shaft <b>2</b> and a housing <b>4</b> of the motor <b>1</b>. Therefore, electric corrosion caused by a current generated by potential fluctuations occurring in the shaft <b>2</b> of the motor <b>1</b> can be stably suppressed or prevented.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The motor <b>1</b> is a DC brushless motor. The motor <b>1</b> is a drive source of the drive device <b>100</b>, and is driven by power from an inverter (not illustrated).

The shaft <b>2</b> is rotatably supported by the housing <b>4</b> via bearings <b>4211</b>, <b>4221</b>, <b>431</b>, and <b>4611</b> to be described later. In the present preferred embodiment, each of the bearings <b>4211</b>, <b>4221</b>, <b>431</b>, and <b>4611</b> is a ball bearing. However, types of the bearings <b>4211</b>, <b>4221</b>, <b>431</b>, and <b>4611</b> are not limited to this example. For example, at most three of these may be other than the ball bearing (e.g., sliding bearings or the like).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The shaft <b>2</b> includes the first shaft <b>21</b>, a second shaft <b>22</b>, the first shaft through-hole <b>201</b>, and second shaft through-holes <b>202</b>.

When the first shaft <b>21</b> is dividable, the divided first shafts <b>21</b> are connected by spline fitting, for example. Alternatively, the divided first shafts <b>21</b> may be connected by screw coupling using a male screw and a female screw, or may be joined by a fixing method such as press-fitting or welding.

The plate portion <b>441</b> is attached to the end portion on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the bearing holder <b>43</b>. The plate portion <b>441</b> forms a space <b>403</b> together with the bearing holder <b>43</b>. A part of the shaft <b>2</b> (for example, the end portion on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the first shaft <b>21</b>), the rotation detector <b>6</b>, and the like are arranged in the space <b>403</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The plate portion <b>441</b> has an opening <b>4411</b> and a holder recess <b>4412</b>.

At least a part of the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> is accommodated in the holder recess <b>4412</b>. Since at least a part of the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> is arranged in the holder recess <b>4412</b> arranged on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the neutralizing device holder <b>44</b>, the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> can be arranged on the other axial side D<b>2</b>. Therefore, the axial size of the motor <b>1</b> can be reduced, and the motor <b>1</b> and the drive device <b>100</b> can be further downsized.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Note that the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> is separated from an inner surface of the holder recess <b>4412</b> facing radially inward in the present preferred embodiment as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and the like.

Then, the contact area between the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> and the neutralizing device holder <b>44</b> can be further increased. Therefore, the electrical conductivity between the both can be improved. In addition, the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> can also be fitted and fixed between the shaft <b>2</b> and the inner surface of the holder recess <b>4412</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The seal holder <b>442</b> is arranged radially outward of the second shaft <b>22</b> and holds the seal member <b>443</b>.

Then, the neutralizing device holder <b>44</b> can be brought closer to the end portion on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the first shaft <b>21</b>. Therefore, the axial sizes of the motor <b>1</b> and the drive device <b>100</b> can be reduced. In addition, the fluid F needs to flow between the first shaft <b>21</b> and the seal holder <b>442</b> before entering between the second shaft <b>22</b> and the seal holder <b>442</b>. That is, the flow distance of the fluid F can be made longer, and thus, the fluid F is less likely to be applied to the first neutralizing device <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In addition, preferably, the peripheral wall <b>215</b> is arranged radially outward of the seal holder <b>442</b>. At this time, the seal holder <b>442</b> faces the peripheral wall <b>215</b> in the radial direction and faces the end portion on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the shaft tubular portion <b>211</b> in the axial direction.

In the present preferred embodiment, each of the first protruding portion <b>4421</b> and the second protruding portion <b>4422</b> has a tubular shape extending in the axial direction. A radially outer surface of the second protruding portion <b>4422</b> is arranged radially inward of a radially outer surface of the first protruding portion <b>4421</b>. At least an end portion on the other axial side D<b>2</b> of the second protruding portion <b>4422</b> is inserted through the end portion on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the first shaft <b>21</b>. That is, the second protruding portion <b>4422</b> is arranged radially inward of the end portion on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the first shaft <b>21</b>. The end portion on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the first shaft <b>21</b> axially faces the first protruding portion <b>4421</b> and radially faces the second protruding portion <b>4422</b>. Then, a path from the inside of the first shaft <b>21</b> to the outside of the shaft <b>2</b> between the seal holder <b>442</b> and the first shaft <b>21</b> can be made longer. Therefore, for example, even if the fluid F leaks from the second shaft through-hole <b>202</b> arranged in the shaft lid <b>214</b>, this fluid F can hardly leak to the outside of the shaft <b>2</b> through the above-described path.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">However, the above-described example does not exclude a configuration in which the seal holder <b>442</b> does not include the second protruding portion <b>4422</b>.

In this case, the first protruding portion <b>4421</b> is arranged radially inward of the end portion on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the first shaft <b>21</b>.

The motor <b>1</b> includes the seal member <b>443</b>. The seal member <b>443</b> seals a gap between the second shaft <b>22</b> and the seal holder <b>442</b>, and is arranged on the other axial side D<b>2</b> with respect to the first neutralizing device <b>7</b>. Then, the seal member <b>443</b> that seals the gap between the second shaft <b>22</b> and the seal holder <b>442</b> makes it difficult for the fluid, which lubricates and cools the stator <b>12</b>, the bearing <b>431</b>, and the like, to be applied to the first neutralizing device <b>7</b>. For example, the atomized fluid F may leak to the space <b>403</b> on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the bearing holder <b>43</b> through the opening <b>432</b> of the bearing holder <b>43</b> from a gap between an inner ring and an outer ring of the ball bearing <b>431</b> or between the bearing <b>431</b> and the second shaft <b>22</b>, and enter the gap between the second shaft <b>22</b> and the seal holder <b>442</b>. The seal member <b>443</b> can suppress or prevent the flow of this fluid F by sealing the gap between the second shaft <b>22</b> and the seal holder <b>442</b>. That is, the fluid F hardly flows to the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the seal member <b>443</b>. In addition, for example, the fluid F hardly leaks to the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the neutralizing device holder <b>44</b>. Therefore, it is possible to suppress or prevent the fluid F from being applied to the first neutralizing device <b>7</b>. Therefore, the motor <b>1</b> and the drive device <b>100</b> can favorably maintain the electrical connection between the second shaft <b>22</b> and the housing <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">As the seal member <b>443</b>, for example, a slinger can be used.

The first cover portion <b>451</b> includes a plate <b>4511</b>. In other words, the cover member <b>45</b> includes the plate <b>4511</b>. The plate <b>4511</b> expands in a direction intersecting the rotation axis J<b>1</b>. The second cover portion <b>452</b> is arranged radially outward of the first cover portion <b>451</b> on the other axial side D<b>2</b>.

That is, the through-hole <b>454</b> may be arranged in at least one of the neutralizing device holder <b>44</b> and the cover member <b>45</b>. Then, the space between the neutralizing device holder <b>44</b> and the cover member <b>45</b> can communicate with the outside of the space through the through-hole <b>454</b>. For this reason, it is possible to prevent a change in internal pressure of the space caused by a temperature change or the like and to eliminate a pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the space. For example, it is possible to prevent generation of a pressure difference between the one axial side D<b>1</b> and the other axial side D<b>2</b> with respect to the seal member <b>443</b>, and thus, it is possible to prevent the fluid F from entering the space between the neutralizing device holder <b>44</b> and the cover member <b>45</b> due to pressure reduction.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In addition, the cover member <b>45</b> further includes a filter <b>455</b>.

Then, it is unnecessary to secure a space for arranging the filter <b>455</b> on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the plate <b>4511</b>.

Specifically, the holding member <b>73</b> holds an end portion of the conductive member <b>71</b> on the elastic member <b>72</b> side so as to be movable in a direction in which the holding member <b>73</b> extends. In addition, the holding member <b>73</b> holds the elastic member <b>72</b> so as to be stretchable in the direction in which the holding member <b>73</b> extends.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The fixing member <b>74</b> fixes the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> to the housing <b>4</b>. In the present preferred embodiment, the fixing member <b>74</b> fixes the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> to the neutralizing device holder <b>44</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, for example). However, the present invention is not limited to this example, and the fixing member <b>74</b> may fix the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> to the cover member <b>45</b>. That is, the fixing member <b>74</b> can fix the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> to at least one of the neutralizing device holder <b>44</b> and the cover member <b>45</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In addition, the fixing member <b>74</b> has conductivity and is electrically connected to the conductive member <b>71</b>. When the fixing member <b>74</b> is fixed to the neutralizing device holder <b>44</b> or the cover member <b>45</b> having conductivity, the conductive member <b>71</b> is electrically connected to the housing <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In the present preferred embodiment, (the conductive member <b>71</b> of) the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> contacts a partial region in the circumferential direction of the radially outer surface of the second shaft as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. However, the present invention is not limited to this example, and (the conductive member <b>71</b> of) the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> may contact the entire region in the circumferential direction of the radially outer surface of the second shaft <b>22</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>. That is, it is sufficient for (the conductive member <b>71</b> of) the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> to contact at least a partial region in the circumferential direction of the radially outer surface of the second shaft <b>22</b>. Since the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> contacts at least a partial region in the circumferential direction of the radially outer surface of the second shaft <b>22</b> having a smaller outer diameter than the first shaft <b>21</b>, it is possible to further reduce the sliding area of the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> with respect to the second shaft <b>22</b> per rotation of the shaft <b>2</b>. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the wear debris generated at the contact portion between the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> and the shaft <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Next, a first modification to a third modification of the preferred embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> to <b>11</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an enlarged configuration example of main parts of the drive device <b>100</b> according to the first modification. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an enlarged configuration example of main parts of the drive device <b>100</b> according to the second modification. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an enlarged configuration example of main parts of the drive device <b>100</b> according to the third modification.

The second neutralizing device <b>8</b> electrically connects the first shaft <b>21</b> and the housing <b>4</b>. Then, the current generated by potential fluctuations occurring in the shaft <b>2</b> can be discharged to the housing <b>4</b> through the second neutralizing device <b>8</b>. Therefore, the efficiency of eliminating the static electricity of the shaft <b>2</b> can be further improved.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The second neutralizing device <b>8</b> is fixed to the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the bearing holder <b>43</b>. The second neutralizing device <b>8</b> is arranged on the other axial side D<b>2</b> with respect to the end portion on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the first shaft <b>21</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the second neutralizing device <b>8</b> contacts a partial region in the circumferential direction of the radially outer surface of the first shaft <b>21</b>. However, the present invention is not limited to this example, and the second neutralizing device <b>8</b> may contact the entire region in the circumferential direction of the radially outer surface of the first shaft <b>21</b>. Then, it is unnecessary to secure a space for arranging the second neutralizing device <b>8</b> on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the first shaft <b>21</b>. Therefore, it is possible to suppress the increase in the axial sizes of the motor <b>1</b> and the drive device <b>100</b>. This contributes to downsizing of the motor <b>1</b> and the drive device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The configuration of the second neutralizing device <b>8</b> is the same as that of the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> in the present preferred embodiment, but is not limited to this example, and may be different from that of the first neutralizing device <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Next, the second modification will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.

In addition, the same components as those in the above-described preferred embodiment and first modification are denoted by the same reference signs, and the description thereof may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In the second modification, a seal holder <b>442</b><i>a </i>is a recess arranged on the other axial side D<b>2</b> of the neutralizing device holder <b>44</b>, and is recessed to the one axial side. In addition, the seal holder <b>442</b><i>a </i>is separated from the end portion on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the first shaft <b>21</b> to the one axial side D<b>1</b>. The seal member <b>443</b> is arranged on an inner surface of the seal holder <b>442</b><i>a </i>facing radially inward.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">For this reason, the first shaft <b>21</b> does not include the peripheral wall <b>215</b>, and the end portion on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the shaft tubular portion <b>211</b> is the end portion on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the first shaft <b>21</b>. In addition, the shaft lid <b>214</b> is arranged at the end portion on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the first shaft <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">According to the second modification, it is possible to further narrow an interval in the axial direction between the end portion on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the first shaft <b>21</b> and the neutralizing device holder <b>44</b>. Therefore, the axial sizes of the motor <b>1</b> and the drive device <b>100</b> can be reduced more.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Next, the third modification will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.

For this reason, the end portion on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the second shaft <b>22</b> can be arranged on the other axial side D<b>2</b> of the plate portion <b>441</b>. In addition, the opening <b>4411</b> and the holder recess <b>4412</b> are not necessarily arranged in the plate portion <b>441</b> of the neutralizing device holder <b>44</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. In addition, the cover member <b>45</b> can also be omitted since the opening <b>4411</b> is omitted. Then, the number of components of the housing <b>4</b> can be reduced, and the neutralizing device holder <b>44</b> can have a simpler configuration. In addition, the arrangement of members on the one axial side D<b>1</b> of the neutralizing device holder <b>44</b> can be omitted, and thus, the axial sizes of the motor <b>1</b> and the drive device <b>100</b> can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In addition, the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> is a conductive bearing lubricated by a lubricant <b>75</b> having a higher electrical conductivity than the fluid F in the third modification. In the present preferred embodiment, conductive grease is used as the lubricant <b>75</b>. In the conductive grease, a conductive material such as copper powder or carbon powder is added to a lubricating oil such as grease. In the first neutralizing device <b>7</b>, the second shaft <b>22</b> and the neutralizing device holder <b>44</b> can be electrically connected by the lubricant <b>75</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> is a ball bearing lubricated with the lubricant <b>75</b>. An inner ring of the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> is fixed to the radially outer surface of the second shaft <b>22</b>, and an outer ring of the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> is fixed to the radially inner surface of the seal holder <b>442</b>. In this case, the inner ring and the outer ring of the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> are electrically connected by the lubricant <b>75</b>, and thus, the second shaft <b>22</b> is electrically connected to the seal holder <b>442</b> of the neutralizing device holder <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In addition, the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> is arranged to be coaxial with the bearing <b>431</b>. For example, the both have an annular shape centered on the same axis (that is, the rotation axis J<b>1</b>). Then, the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> can rotatably support the shaft <b>2</b> more stably together with the bearing <b>431</b>.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Note that the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> does not exclude a configuration in which the first neutralizing device <b>7</b> is not a conductive bearing.
