portable electrocardiographic device and an electrocardiographic measurement system including the portable electrocardiographic device that allow electrocardiographic waveform measurement in daily life.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Portable electrocardiographic measurement devices (hereinafter also referred to as &#x201c;portable electrocardiographic devices&#x201d;) have been proposed that allow immediate electrocardiographic waveform measurement upon occurrence of abnormalities such as chest pain and palpitation in daily life. When symptoms such as palpitation occur at home, outside the home, or the like, physician or the like can detect a heart disease at an early timing and perform appropriate treatment based on data on the electrocardiographic waveform measured by the electrocardiographic device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, for such portable electrocardiographic devices, there is an international agreement on methods of recording electrocardiographic waveforms (lead systems and lead types), and a lead system that uses a plurality of lead systems is widely used. This lead system based on the international agreement includes six types of limb leads and six types of chest leads, and electrocardiographic waveforms are detected and recorded using appropriate lead systems.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Among these, for a lead system known as lead I in which a contact unit including a positive electrode is pressed against the left hand of the subject and a lead system known as lead V4 in which the contact unit including the positive electrode is pressed against the left chest of the subject, a technology of displaying a measurement result such as an electrocardiographic waveform on the display unit in an easy-to-see manner is known (e.g., see Patent Document 1). More specifically, this technology displays the measurement result in the lateral direction on the display unit when measurement is performed with lead I, and displays the measurement result in the vertical direction on the display unit when measurement is performed in lead V4.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Document 1: JP 2005-000468 A</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in the conventional technology described above, when detecting and analyzing electrocardiographic waveforms, what lead system is used to obtain such electrocardiographic waveform is not distinguished, and thus electrocardiographic measurement data cannot be correctly analyzed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the problems described above, an object of the present invention is to provide a technology by which, when detecting and analyzing electrocardiographic waveforms, what lead system is used to obtain such electrocardiographic waveform can be more reliably distinguished, and that improves the accuracy of electrocardiographic measurement.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To solve the problems described above, an aspect of the present invention is a portable electrocardiographic device including an electrode unit configured to be brought into contact with a predetermined location of a subject's body and detect an electrocardiographic waveform, a setting unit configured to set lead system used in detection of the electrocardiographic waveform, among a plurality of types of lead systems, and a storage unit configured to store the electrocardiographic waveform detected at the electrode unit and the lead system set through the setting unit in association with each other.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This allows the inconvenience of the impossibility to determine which lead system among a plurality of types of lead systems is used to detect the electrocardiographic waveform to be suppressed. Furthermore, since the detected electrocardiographic waveform and the lead system used at the time of detection are stored in association with each other, accurate and efficient diagnoses of heart diseases can be facilitated.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, in an aspect of the present invention, the setting unit may include a display unit configured to perform display related to the plurality of types of lead systems and a selection unit by which a user selects a lead system to be set, among the plurality of types of lead systems displayed at the display unit.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">This allows the user to set the lead system used at the time of electrocardiographic waveform detection in the simple method of selecting, among a plurality of types of lead systems displayed at the display unit, an appropriate lead system by the selection unit. Here, the user refers to a person who operates the portable electrocardiographic device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, in an aspect of the present invention, the display unit may be light-emitting units each associated with a corresponding lead system of the plurality of types of lead systems, and the selection unit may be a unit used to select which of the light-emitting units each associated with a corresponding lead system of the plurality of types of lead systems is caused to emit light.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">This allows the lead system to be set in an easy operation of selecting which light-emitting unit is caused to emit light, and the operability of the device can be improved. Examples of this include, for example, a case in which indications of a plurality of types of lead systems displayed at the device main body, and light-emitting units each disposed in the vicinity of corresponding indications are provided, and the user selects which of the light-emitting units each disposed in the vicinity of corresponding indications is caused to emit light. Also included is a case in which a light-emitting unit is provided at the device main body, the light-emitting unit can emit light as light-emitting units of colors, each of the colors corresponding to each of a plurality of lead systems, and the user selects, for the light-emitting unit, what color to cause the light-emitting unit to emit light.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, in an aspect of the present invention, setting content set through the setting unit may be stored unless predetermined release processing is performed. This allows the lead system used in electrocardiographic waveform detection to be set by the physician, for example, and allows the subject only to perform electrocardiographic waveform detection without being conscious of the lead system setting. As a result, variations in the use of the portable electrocardiographic device can be increased.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, an aspect of the present invention may further include an analysis unit configured to analyze the electrocardiographic waveform detected by the electrode unit in accordance with the lead system set through the setting unit, and an analysis result of the electrocardiographic waveform analyzed by the analysis unit may be stored in the storage unit in association with the electrocardiographic waveform and the lead system. This causes the detected electrocardiographic waveform, the lead system used at the time of detection, and the analysis result of the analyzed electrocardiographic waveform to be stored in association with one another. Thus, accurate and efficient diagnoses of heart diseases can be facilitated.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, an aspect of the present invention may be an electrocardiographic measurement system including a portable electrocardiographic device provided with an electrode unit configured to be brought into contact with a predetermined location of a subject's body and detect an electrocardiographic waveform, and a portable terminal provided communicably with the portable electrocardiographic device, wherein the electrocardiographic measurement system further includes a setting unit provided at the portable terminal and configured to set lead system used in detection of the electrocardiographic waveform, among a plurality of types of lead systems, and a storage unit configured to store the electrocardiographic waveform detected at the electrode unit and the lead system set through the setting unit in association with each other.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Furthermore, in the electrocardiographic measurement system described above, the setting unit may include a display unit configured to cause the portable terminal to display the plurality of types of lead systems, and a selection unit by which a user selects a lead system to be set, among the plurality of types of lead systems displayed at the display unit in the portable terminal. This allows the lead system used in electrocardiographic waveform detection to be set using a high-performance display unit and a selection unit of the portable terminal, and the operability and efficiency at the time of setting the lead system can be improved.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Here, the user refers to a person who operates the electrocardiographic measurement system.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, the electrocardiographic measurement system described above may further include an explanatory display unit configured to cause the portable terminal to display information for explaining a lead system selectable by the selection unit. This allows the optimal lead system to be more reliably set when setting the lead system used in electrocardiographic waveform detection.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, in the electrocardiographic measurement system described above, setting content set through the setting unit may be stored unless predetermined release processing is performed.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, the electrocardiographic measurement system described above may further include an analysis unit configured to analyze the electrocardiographic waveform detected by the electrode unit in accordance with the lead system set through the setting unit, and an analysis result of the electrocardiographic waveform analyzed by the analysis unit may be stored in the storage unit in association with the electrocardiographic waveform and the lead system.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Furthermore, an aspect of the present invention may be a non-transitory recording medium having recorded therein a program configured to cause the setting unit according to any of the aspects described above to operate.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Note that in the present invention, the unit to solve the problems described above can be used in combination as long as such combination is practicable.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the present invention, when detecting and analyzing electrocardiographic waveforms, what lead systems are used to obtain the electrocardiographic waveforms can be more reliably distinguished, and the accuracy of electrocardiographic measurement can be improved.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0010" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Various embodiments are disclosed, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings in which corresponding reference symbols indicate corresponding parts, in which:</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(A)</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(F)</figref> are each a view illustrating an external appearance of a portable electrocardiographic device according to the present embodiment;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a functional block diagram of the portable electrocardiographic device according to the present embodiment;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a functional block diagram of a smartphone according to the present embodiment;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating procedures for electrocardiographic measurement processing of the portable electrocardiographic device according to the present embodiment;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an electrocardiographic waveform and identifying parameters;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>(A)</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>(L)</figref> are each a diagram illustrating an example of an electrocardiographic waveform for each of the lead types;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating measurement sites for chest leads;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a portion of a flowchart illustrating procedures for electrocardiographic measurement processing in which the portable electrocardiographic device and the smartphone according to the present embodiment cooperate with each other;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a portion of a flowchart illustrating procedures for electrocardiographic measurement processing in which the portable electrocardiographic device and the smartphone according to the present embodiment cooperate with each other; and,</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>(A)</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>(B)</figref> are each a view illustrating a display example of the smartphone according to the present embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0011" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Embodiments of the present invention will be specifically described below with reference to the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Hereinafter, an example of the embodiments of the present invention will be described.
