accompanying drawings. The embodiments described below are exemplary, and the light sources and the methods of manufacturing the light sources according to the present disclosure are not limited to those described below. For example, the numerical values, shapes, materials, manufacturing steps, and the sequence of the steps described in the embodiments described below are merely examples, and are modifiable in various ways to the extent that such a modification does not cause technical inconsistencies. Each of the embodiments described below is merely exemplary, and various combinations can be made to the extent that such a combination does not cause technical inconsistencies.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The sizes, shapes, and the like of the constituent elements shown in the drawings might be exaggerated for clarity of explanation, and might not reflect the sizes and shapes of, and the relative sizes among the constituent elements in an actual light source. Illustration of certain elements might be omitted in a drawing or only a cut end surface might be used as a cross-sectional view so as not to make the drawing excessively complex. In the present specification, moreover, the terms such as &#x201c;cover&#x201d; and &#x201c;covering&#x201d; are not limited to describe cases in which a certain member is directly in contact with another member, and are also used to describe cases in which a certain member indirectly covers another, for example, via another member unless otherwise specifically stated.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the description below, the constituent elements having practically the same functions are denoted by common reference numerals for which explanation might be omitted. In the description below, terms indicating specific directions or positions (e.g., &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower.&#x201d; &#x201c;right,&#x201d; &#x201c;left&#x201d; and other terms including or related to these) might be used. These terms, however, are merely used in order to make the relative directions or positions in the drawings being referenced more easily understood. As long as the relationship between relative directions or positions indicated with the terms such as &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower.&#x201d; or the like is the same as those in a referenced drawing, the layout of the elements in other drawings, or actual products and manufacturing equipment outside of the present disclosure, does not have to be the same as those shown in the referenced drawing. In the present disclosure, being &#x201c;parallel&#x201d; includes cases where two straight lines, sides, planes, or the like, form an angle in the range of 0&#xb0; to about &#xb1;5&#xb0; unless otherwise specifically stated. In the present disclosure, being &#x201c;perpendicular&#x201d; or &#x201c;orthogonal&#x201d; includes cases where two straight lines, sides, planes, or the like form an angle in the range of from 90&#xb0; to about &#xb1;5&#xb0; unless otherwise specifically stated. Furthermore, the positional relationships of constituent elements expressed with the term &#x201c;upper&#x201d; include cases in which a constituent element is in contact with another, as well as cases in which a constituent element is positioned above another without being in contact.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Numerical value ranges might be expressed using an n-dash or the word &#x201c;to&#x201d;. For example, &#x201c;1 mm-5 mm&#x201d; or &#x201c;1 mm to 5 mm&#x201d; means that the value can be 1 mm or larger, but 5 mm at most. In other words, the numerical value range expressed by using an n-dash or the word &#x201c;to&#x201d; includes the numerical values before and after the n-dash or the word &#x201c;to&#x201d; unless otherwise explicitly stated.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The drawings referenced below include arrows indicating the x, y, and z axes that are orthogonal to one another. The x direction along the x axis represents a predetermined direction in the plane where the light emission units of the light source according to each embodiment are arranged, i.e., the light emission unit arrangement plane, the direction along the y axis is the direction orthogonal to the x direction in the light emission unit arrangement plane, and the z direction along the z axis is the direction orthogonal to the arrangement plane. The x direction pointed by the arrow represents the +x direction, and the direction opposite the +x direction represents the &#x2212;x direction. The y direction pointed by the arrow represents the +y direction, and the direction opposite the +y direction represents the &#x2212;y direction. The z direction pointed by the arrow represents the +z direction, and the direction opposite the +z direction represents the &#x2212;z direction. In each embodiment, the light source, as an example, outputs light in the +z direction. This, however, is not intended to restrict the orientation of the light source or the light source device in use, and the light source and the light source device can be oriented in any way.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Structure of Light Source <b>101</b></heading><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic perspective view of a light source <b>101</b> according to a first embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> are schematic top and bottom views of the light source <b>101</b>.

In the light source <b>101</b>, the light exiting the light emission surfaces <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the light emitting elements <b>20</b> passes through the wavelength conversion members <b>30</b>, the first light diffusing member <b>40</b>, the light transmitting member <b>50</b>, and the second light diffusing member <b>60</b> before exiting the light source. At this time, the wavelength of at least a portion of the light from the light emitting elements <b>20</b> is converted by the wavelength conversion members <b>30</b>. The light externally output includes the light which has exited the light emitting elements <b>20</b> and the wavelength-converted light. For example, in the case in which the light emitting elements <b>20</b> emit blue light and the wavelength conversion members <b>30</b> contain at least a yellow-emitting phosphor, the light source <b>101</b> emits white light resulting from mixing the blue light and the yellow light.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0091">The light source <b>101</b> structured as above has good emission characteristics during partial irradiation. Specifically, the wavelength conversion members <b>30</b> are larger than the light emission surfaces <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the light emitting elements <b>20</b> in a top view, so that the light source can emit white light through larger areas than the light emission surfaces <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the light emitting elements <b>20</b>. This increases the proportions of the emission regions in the upper surface <b>101</b><i>a </i>which can reduce the size of a non-emission region E<b>1</b> between two adjacent emission regions. Accordingly, when two adjacent light emission units <b>10</b> are lit, the generation of a low luminance region between the two can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0092">As described above, because the wavelength conversion members <b>30</b> are larger than the light emission surfaces <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the light emitting element <b>20</b>, the wavelength conversion member <b>30</b> in each light emission unit <b>10</b> is closely located to the wavelength conversion members <b>30</b> in adjacent light emission units <b>10</b>. This allows the light exiting a lateral surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>of a wavelength conversion member <b>30</b><i>c </i>indicated by the arrow E<b>2</b> to readily enter the lateral surface <b>30</b><i>c </i>of an adjacent wavelength conversion member <b>30</b>. The light shielding member <b>70</b> which covers the lateral surfaces of the wavelength conversion members <b>30</b> can limit the propagation of light between such adjacent wavelength conversion members <b>30</b>, thereby reducing the leakage of light along the boundary between a lit light emission unit <b>10</b> and an unlit light emission unit <b>10</b> as well as reducing the pseudo lighting of the adjacent light emission unit <b>10</b> caused by such leakage.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0093">The color of the light exiting outward from the optical axis of a light emitting element <b>20</b> indicated by the arrow E<b>3</b> tends to shift towards yellow because the distance of travel through the wavelength conversion member <b>30</b> is relatively long. Such a shift in the color towards yellow tends to occur along the periphery of the emission region in a lit light emission unit <b>10</b>. Disposing a first light diffusing member <b>40</b> on the wavelength conversion members <b>30</b> can reduce such a shift in the color towards yellow along the periphery of an emission region (yellow ring), thereby reducing emission color non-uniformity within the emission region. Furthermore, disposing a light shielding member <b>70</b> in the grooves <b>40</b><i>g </i>of the first light diffusing member <b>40</b> can hinder such color-shifted light from laterally spreading.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0094">The light transmitting member <b>50</b> is a light guide that parallels the XY plane, the arrangement directions of the light emission units <b>10</b>, and can laterally propagate the outgoing light from the light emitting element <b>20</b> in a lit light emission unit <b>10</b> that becomes incident on the light transmitting member <b>50</b> as indicated by the arrow E<b>4</b>.

As a comparative example, the luminance and the chromaticity of a light source which did not have a second light diffusing member, a light transmitting member, and grooves <b>40</b><i>g </i>in the first light diffusing member were measured.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref> shows the luminance distribution of the light source of the example, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref> shows the luminance distribution of the light source of the comparative example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref> shows the chromaticity distribution of the light source of the example, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref> shows the chromaticity distribution of the light source of the comparative example. In order to evaluate the luminance and the chromaticity in the region between two lit light emission units, and in the region between a lit light emission unit and an unlit light emission unit, the nine light emission units in the center were not lit while the surrounding 54 light emission units were lit in both of the light source <b>101</b> of the example and the light source of the comparative example.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0130">In the light source <b>101</b> of the example, the distance between two adjacent wavelength conversion members <b>30</b> was 50 &#x3bc;m, whereas in the light source of the comparative example, the distance between two adjacent wavelength conversion members <b>30</b> was 25 &#x3bc;m.

In contrast, in the comparative example, there are regions in which the x and y values are high between the lit light emission units. In other words, it is understood that, in the example, there is almost no chromaticity deviation even in the regions between the lit light emission units, whereas in the comparative example, the chromaticity is shifted towards yellow in the regions between the lit light emission units.

In other words, in the light source <b>101</b> of the example, the luminance difference (contrast) is improved between the emission region and the non-emission region as a result of the reduced leakage of light into the non-emission region.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0134">As described above, according to this example, a light source having excellent emission characteristics during partial irradiation, such as reduced dark lines or chromaticity deviations in the regions between the emission regions and the non-emission regions, can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0135">A light source and a light source device according to the present invention can be used as a light emitting device in a wide range of uses and purposes, such as a camera flash, automotive headlight, illumination, and the like.
