In another embodiment, the substrate includes pores with a mean pore diameter that is less than about 250 &#x3bc;m, and the ceramic material on the substrate partially or completely fills the pores of the substrate, thereby reducing the mean pore diameter or eliminating the pores of the substrate, respectively. In some embodiments, the substrate has an air permeability of about 0.1 cubic feet per minute (CFM) to about 100 CFM, according to ASTM D737, prior to deposit of the ceramic material on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the ceramic material is primarily crystalline. In some embodiments, the ceramic material includes a metal oxide, a hydrate of a metal oxide, a metal hydroxide, and/or a hydrate of a metal hydroxide. In some embodiments, the ceramic material includes a metal hydroxide, and at least a portion of the metal hydroxide comprises layered double hydroxide.

For example, the ceramic material may include one or more of zinc, aluminum, manganese, magnesium, cerium, copper, gadolinium, tungsten, tin, zinc, lead, and cobalt. In certain embodiments, the ceramic material includes: a mixture of zinc and aluminum oxides and/or hydroxides; a mixture of manganese and magnesium oxides and/or hydroxides; manganese oxide and/or hydroxide; aluminum oxide and/or hydroxide; a mixed metal manganese oxide and/or hydroxide; a mixture of magnesium and aluminum oxides and/or hydroxides; magnesium oxide and/or hydroxide; a mixture of magnesium, cerium, and aluminum oxides and/or hydroxides; a mixture of zinc, praseodymium, and aluminum oxides and/or hydroxides; a mixture of cobalt and aluminum oxides and/or hydroxides; a mixture of manganese and aluminum oxides and/or hydroxides; a mixture of cerium and aluminum oxides and/or hydroxides; a mixture of copper and aluminum oxides and/or hydroxides; a mixture of zinc and aluminum oxides and/or hydroxides; a mixture of Zn-aluminates; a mixture comprising one or more phases comprising Zn, Al and oxygen; zinc oxide and/or hydroxide; or a hydrate of any of the above compounds or mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the ceramic material includes a thickness up to about 25 &#x3bc;m, such as a thickness of about 0.2 &#x3bc;m to about 25 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the ceramic material comprises porosity of about 5% to about 80%, such as greater than about 10%, or about 30% to about 95%.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the porous substrate comprises or consists of a woven material, a knitted material, a nonwoven fabric or textile, or paper.

In some embodiments, a functional layer (e.g., top coat) material imparts one or more functional property that is of greater magnitude than the same functional property imparted by an identical top coat material deposited directly on an identical textile surface that does not comprise the ceramic material. For example, the ceramic material and the functional layer material may synergistically impart one or more functional property that is of greater magnitude than the same functional property imparted by either the ceramic material or the functional layer material deposited independently on an identical textile surface.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the functional layer imparts a hydrophobic property. For example, the functional layer that imparts a hydrophobic property to the composition may include a fluoropolymer, an elastomer, a plastic, or a molecule with a head group and a tail group, for example, wherein the head group includes a silane group, a phosphonate group, a phosphonic acid group, a carboxylic acid group, a vinyl group, an alcohol group, a hydroxide group, a thiolate group, and/or a thiol group, and wherein the tail group includes a hydrocarbon group, a fluorocarbon group, a vinyl group, a phenyl group, an epoxide group, an acrylic group, an acrylate group, a hydroxyl group, a carboxylic acid group, a thiol group, and/or a quaternary ammonium group.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the ceramic material on the substrate is a partially filled porous structure.
