This approach can have the advantage of enabling a TEMPO-containing surface to be used, reset and reused in the process of NO<sub>2 </sub>scrubbing. In some embodiments, an NO deliver device can reverse the flow of air within an inspiratory gas delivery lumen so that gas flow is away from the patient while simultaneously applying sufficient electrical potential for the TEMPO molecules to release NO<sub>2</sub>. In some embodiments, NO<sub>2 </sub>molecules released from the TEMPO molecules, analogs thereof or derivatives thereof, are directed through a carbon filter where they are sequestered. In other embodiments, NO<sub>2 </sub>molecules are directed towards a source of vacuum.

In one embodiment, the system can simultaneously and independently deliver NO to the patient through one set of lumens while cleaning out the NO<sub>2 </sub>from another set of lumens. In some embodiments, a NO delivery system can simultaneously apply an electrical potential to one or more specific lumens and not to another one or more specific lumens.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0094">This ability to regulate the redox reactivity of nitroxide/oxoammonium reactions with other compounds appears to be directly applicable to regenerating the TEMPO as described herein.

One side is exposed to the NOx-laden gas stream, and the other is attached to a tube or other structure that provides structural support for the substrate material that may include conductive polymers. In some embodiments, a gel material that expresses chromic changes in response to the ionic changes in NO<sub>2-</sub>sequestering molecules (e.g. TEMPO) caused bias voltage change can be included in the substrate material. In some embodiments, the electrochromic material is a gel placed between the structural tube or other device and the conducting polymer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). In some embodiments, the electrochromic gel can respond with color change representative to the compounds used in the gel and applied voltage. Non limiting examples of electrochromic materials are: 1) tungsten trioxide, a material used in automatic tinting windows, 2) polyaniline polymers such as poly(2,5-dimethoxyaniline) (PDMA), 3) polythiophene polymers such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) or poly(3-methylthiophene) (P3MT)), 4) Viologens (carbon-based salts such as 4,4&#x2032;-bipyridine), 5) conjugated conducting polymers (thiophene, pyrrole, furan, carbazole, azulene, indole, aniline, polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT)), 6) metal coordination complexes (2,2&#x2032;-bipyridine, phthalocyanines, lutetium bis(phthalocyanine), 7) Prussian Blue (C<sub>18</sub>Fe<sub>7</sub>N<sub>18</sub>), 8) metal cyanometallates, 9) polymer gel electrolyte containing perchlorate ions. In some embodiments, the required voltage for electrochromic polymers can be from 0 to 14 V DC. In some embodiments, electrical potential applied is in the 1.4 to 2.6V DC range.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0097">In some embodiments, the purpose of the gel is to provide a color that can be used as an indicator of the electrical bias (also referred herein as electronic bias) associated with a conducting polymer. A change in polymer bias voltage can change the gel color. This is analogous to &#x201c;mood rings&#x201d; that change color with temperature. In some embodiments, gel color can be indicative that the bias voltage is present. This could be an indication of the battery charge status, external power status, or overall device status.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0098">In some embodiments, bias voltage is used as a regulator for how reactive the TEMPO is with a gas stream. Equation 2 shows that nitrite salts have different reactivity than the nitroxide radical. Nitrate salts build up over time as TEMPO reacts with NO<sub>2</sub>. The bias voltage can have the ability to influence the reactive surfaces on the TEMPO and therefore increase or decrease its ability to react with NO<sub>2 </sub>in a way that is similar to but different than the reaction shown in equation 2. The voltage affects the number of available electrons and influences the TEMPO reactivity.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0099">The color change can be valuable because it is indicative of the bias voltage value and the state of the TEMPO's reactivity with the NOx in a gas stream. In the case of an inspiratory air conduit, the bias voltage applied to the electrochromic lining can varied to indicate level of TEMPO reactivity based on the amount of NO<sub>2 </sub>adsorbed. In other embodiments, the electrical charge causing the lining color change could be actively applied by the NO device as an indication of remaining life of the NO<sub>2 </sub>adsorptive surface. In some embodiments, the monomer/polymers used as a point of attachment for TEMPO etc. provided herein are impervious to the gel and therefore the conducting monomer/polymer also acts as a barrier to prevent interaction between the gel and the TEMPO/oxoammonium molecules exposed to the gas stream with NOx (NO/NO<sub>2</sub>).</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Resonance Imaging</heading><p id="p-0107" num="0100">Nitroxide radicals exhibit paramagnetism, due to the single electron spin of a free electron. This feature enables nitroxide radicals to be detected by common imaging techniques including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As nitroxide radical-containing materials are incorporated into products, this ability to be imaged is retained. During manufacturing, imaging can be utilized as a quality step to inspect a product against requirements. For example, the presence/absence of a coating or thickness of a coating can be assessed in this way. For imaging purposes, nitroxide radicals can be present on the inner lumen of a tube or within the tube wall.

In contrast polymers that conduct electricity do so because they share a characteristic called molecular conjugation. A conjugated polymer has a system of connected p-orbitals across an intervening sigma bond and delocalized electrons interface by extending past the sigma bond. The pi electrons do not belong to a single bond or atom but rather to a group of atoms. Compounds with this characteristic can be cyclic, linear or mixed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> provides examples of conjugated polymers.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0102">According to aspects of the present disclosure, the conjugated monomers/polymers used for NO<sub>2 </sub>scrubbing combine the conductivity of traditional inorganic materials with many of the desirable properties of organic plastics including mechanical flexibility and low production costs. In some embodiments, the monomers/polymers can have an aromatic structure. Such monomers/polymers typically have excellent chemical, thermal, and oxidative stability. In many cases the monomers/polymers provided herein are practically insoluble in all common solvents due to the low hydrogen content. This solubility feature provides the required chemical isolation between the gel and the gas phase treatment on the other side of the conductive monomers/polymers</p><p id="p-0110" num="0103">In some embodiments, Indium Tin Oxides (ITO) films can be applied to the gas-contacting surfaces of the NO conduits of an NO delivery device prior to TEMPO attachment.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0104">In some embodiments, the conductive monomers/polymers do not comprise ITO. It should be appreciated that one of the most important advantages the use of a conductive monomers/polymers has over ITO material as the conductive medium is the method of fabrication. The conductive monomers/polymers used in this process are fabricated using ambient or moderate temperature aqueous chemical dispersion rather than the high vacuum and high temperature process required for the fabrication of ITO materials. The use of dispersion for production provides the opportunity to fine tune the characteristics of the substrate material in which the NO<sub>2</sub>-sequestering molecule (e.g. TEMPO) is contained.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0105">In some embodiments, the TEMPO substrate material is an electrically conductive polymer with discrete domains for a NO<sub>2</sub>-sequestering molecule. In some embodiments, these domains consist of pores in the substrate material. Control of the particle size and domain size and its dispersion throughout the surface as well as the geometry provide multiple means to control the level of availability of NO<sub>2</sub>-sequestering molecules to NO<sub>2 </sub>molecules passing by. This control is typically done as part of the design and manufacturing processes. In some embodiments, however, active control of domain size can be done through electrical properties of the materials to vary the pore size and affect the level of interaction between NO<sub>2 </sub>containing gas and NO<sub>2 </sub>sequestering molecules.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0106">It should be appreciated that the pore size selection can be tailored to the size of the molecules that will be interacting with the NO<sub>2</sub>-sequestering molecules, such as TEMPO, TEMPA, PROXYL compounds, analogs thereof, derivatives thereof or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the pore size can be big enough to allow easy access but not much larger than &#x201c;accommodating&#x201d; because excessive pore size reduces surface area. The charge or partial charge on molecules can also play a role in pore size. For example, a highly porous surface coated with NO<sub>2</sub>-sequestering molecules (e.g. TEMPO molecules) could contain a majority of NO<sub>2</sub>-sequestering molecules deep within the pores of the substrate molecular surface, thereby limiting the NO<sub>2</sub>-adsorption capabilities of the surface. Contrastingly, a surface with small pore size would have less surface area overall, but more TEMPO molecules in contact with the NO<sub>2</sub>-containing gas. Aspects such as surface area, particle size, particle count, lumen size, pore size, pore count and cannula construction are interdependent variables that can lead to multiple functional permutations by one skilled in the art. Furthermore, mixing and gas flow state (turbulence vs. laminar) contribute to the level of interaction between NO<sub>2</sub>-containing gas and NO<sub>2</sub>-sequestering materials. In some embodiments, the surface finish within a gas flow lumen can be intentionally rough to disturb the gas flow and promote turbulence and mixing. In some embodiments, the lumens are textured. In some embodiments, mixing elements can be included within the gas flow path to promote mixing and turbulence.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0107">Substrate surfaces can have a variety of topologies. This can affect the efficacy of a NO<sub>2 </sub>scrubber if NO<sub>2</sub>-sequestering molecules (e.g. TEMPO, TEMPA or PROXYL molecules) are located at the bottom of pores/valleys where there is less exposure to gas to react with. In the carbon substrate example, by changing the reaction environment with the nitric acid, the surface of the carbon can be tailored and shaped to obtain a desired pore size, analogous to etching of the surface. By choosing the optimal pore size and distribution, NO<sub>2-</sub>sequestering molecules will be located at the surface, rather than at the bottom of the pores for increased NO<sub>2 </sub>scavenging. In some embodiments, the average pore size can be about 30 nm. In some embodiments, pore size can be from 20 to 40 nm, from 30 to 35 nm, from 20 to 35 nm, from 30 to 40 nm, from 25 nm to 30 nm etc. . . . .</p><p id="p-0115" num="0108">Optimal adsorption can be determined empirically by varying temperature, pH and exposure time of the nitric acid and carbon to vary the pore sizes.

In some embodiments, the substrate surface can be conditioned by using a specific reaction environment, and thereby tailor the points on the carbon substrate that reactions will occur.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0110">In some embodiments, the substrate material can include carbon in a pure form such as graphite, nanotubes, Bucky balls and the like. Nanotubes and Bucky balls provide a more flexible substrate.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0111">The conductive polymers do not have the high structural capabilities seen in many non-conducting polymers. This limitation requires that conductive monomers/polymers be adhered to another polymer with increased mechanical properties. In some embodiments, conductive polymers and other components of the substrate material are made into a sleeve that is protected by a structural tube. In other embodiments, conductive polymers and other components of the substrate material are deposited as a coating on the lining of a structural tube that conveys an inspiratory gas to a patient. NO<sub>2</sub>-sequestering molecules (e.g. TEMPO molecules etc.) are attached or integrated into the substrate material in process specific sequences. In one embodiment, a polymer material is compounded with a NO<sub>2</sub>-sequestering material and extruded into a tube. In another embodiment, a NO<sub>2</sub>-sequestering material is compounded with another material, applied as a coating on a surface and activated with a secondary reaction (for example acid flush). In another embodiment, the process comprises the steps of: flushing a tube with a primer material to increase surface energy, flushing with a liquid including NO<sub>2</sub>-sequestering material, and curing to adhere, stabilize and/or activate the inner lining of the tube. Curing steps can include UV light exposure, heat exposure, time, catalyst flush, a pH-specific flush or any combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0112">When a bias voltage is applied to the conducting polymer portion of the substrate material, the orientation of surface electrons of the conductive layer of the substrate material is changed which in-turn affect the reactivity of the TEMPO molecule.
