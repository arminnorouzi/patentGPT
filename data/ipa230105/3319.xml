DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Now referring primarily to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>2</b>B</figref>, which illustrate a method of using a particular embodiment of the inventive split coupler (<b>1</b>) including a first semi-cylindrical member (<b>2</b>), a second semi-cylindrical member (<b>3</b>), and an interlocking assembly (<b>4</b>) configured to interlock (or connect together) the first and second semi-cylindrical members (<b>2</b>)(<b>3</b>) to form a substantially cylindrical split coupler (<b>1</b>) having a coupler inner surface (<b>5</b>) which defines a throughbore (<b>6</b>). Further, the split coupler (<b>1</b>) can include spiral threads (<b>7</b>) coupled to the coupler inner surface (<b>5</b>). Moreover, the split coupler (<b>1</b>) can include a flange (<b>8</b>) inwardly extending from the coupler inner surface (<b>5</b>).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Now referring primarily to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the instant split coupler (<b>1</b>) may be especially useful to replace a broken connector (<b>9</b>) connecting emplaced conduits (<b>10</b>) or pipes.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Now referring primarily to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, a conventional connector (<b>11</b>) may be configured as a continuously annular cylinder. Consequently, to dispose such a connector (<b>11</b>) about an emplaced conduit (<b>10</b>), for example to replace a broken connector (<b>9</b>), the emplaced conduit (<b>10</b>) may have to be cut (<b>10</b><i>a</i>) to allow axial receipt of the conduit (<b>10</b>) within the connector (<b>11</b>) to correspondingly dispose the connector (<b>11</b>) about the conduit (<b>10</b>) (as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). Subsequently, the cut conduit (<b>10</b>) must be repaired (<b>10</b><i>b</i>) (as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>), whereby not only may it be challenging to properly repair the cut conduit (<b>10</b>), but also the repaired conduit (<b>10</b>) may be inferior relative to the original, uncut conduit (<b>10</b>).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Conversely, as opposed to a continuously annular cylinder, the instant split coupler (<b>1</b>) is divided longitudinally (the term &#x201c;longitudinal&#x201d; and derivatives thereof can refer to the direction of the longitudinal axis of the conduit (<b>10</b>) about which the split coupler (<b>1</b>) is intended to dispose and correspondingly, the direction of the pass-through axis of the split coupler (<b>1</b>)). Following, to replace a broken connector (<b>9</b>), the first and second semi-cylindrical members (<b>2</b>)(<b>3</b>) can be radially disposed about the emplaced conduit (<b>10</b>) to receive the conduit (<b>10</b>) therebetween. Next, the first and second semi-cylindrical members (<b>2</b>)(<b>3</b>) can be axially aligned (for example, by relative sliding) and connected to one another (or interlocked) to dispose the split coupler (<b>1</b>) about the emplaced conduit (<b>10</b>) (as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). Subsequently, the split coupler (<b>1</b>) can then been rotated about the conduit (<b>10</b>) to couple an end, such as a flanged end (<b>12</b>), of the emplaced conduit (<b>10</b>), to an end, such as a threaded end (<b>13</b>), of another adjacent, axially-aligned conduit (<b>10</b>). Upon coupling via the instant split coupler (<b>1</b>), the two conduits (<b>10</b>) can be securely connected or united and thus, precluded from relative separation. Of course, this method advantageously does not require an emplaced conduit (<b>10</b>) to be cut to dispose the split coupler (<b>1</b>) thereabout.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Herein, reference may be made to the term axial, whereby axial can mean along the direction of the longitudinal axis of the conduit (<b>10</b>) about which the split coupler (<b>1</b>) is intended to dispose, and/or the direction of the pass-through axis of the split coupler (<b>1</b>), and/or along the direction of the Y axis as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A through <b>5</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Now referring primarily to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A through <b>13</b>B</figref>, the longitudinally divided split coupler (<b>1</b>) includes first and second semi-cylindrical members (<b>2</b>)(<b>3</b>) which are separate or discrete or independent from one another. Each semi-cylindrical member (<b>2</b>)(<b>3</b>) includes an arcuate inner surface extending between opposing first and second terminal edges.
