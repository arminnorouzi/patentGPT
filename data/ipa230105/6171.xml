For example, because the organic encapsulation layer has reverse wavelength dispersion characteristics, the organic encapsulation layer may act as a retarder.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0102">In an embodiment, the organic encapsulation layer <b>520</b> of the encapsulation layer <b>500</b> may delay the phase of light passing through the organic encapsulation layer <b>520</b> by &#x3bb;/4 (by a quarter wavelength) to circularly polarize the light. For example, when the linear polarization layer <b>600</b> linearly polarizes light by 90&#xb0;, external light is circularly polarized by 135&#xb0; while passing through the linear polarization layer <b>600</b> and passing through the organic encapsulation layer <b>520</b> from the upper portion to the lower portion of the organic encapsulation layer <b>520</b> in a 90&#xb0; linearly polarized state. In addition, the 135&#xb0; circularly polarized light may be reflected from the upper surfaces of the underlying layers (e.g., the first electrode <b>310</b>, the second electrode <b>330</b>, etc.) and may be circularly polarized by 180&#xb0; while passing through the encapsulation layer <b>520</b> again from the lower portion to the upper portion of the organic encapsulation layer <b>520</b>. Because the 180&#xb0; circularly polarized light does not pass through (or substantially does not pass through) the linear polarization layer <b>600</b> and is blocked or reduced by the linear polarization layer <b>600</b>, reflection to the outside of external light incident into the display apparatus <b>1</b> may be prevented or reduced.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0103">The organic encapsulation layer <b>520</b> of the encapsulation layer <b>500</b> may include a reactive mesogen.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0104">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the linear polarization layer <b>600</b> serves to linearly polarize light passing through the linear polarization layer <b>600</b> into light in the same direction as a polarization axis. For example, the linear polarization layer <b>600</b> may linearly polarize the incident light incident from above the linear polarization layer <b>600</b> when the incident light passes through the linear polarization layer <b>600</b>. In some embodiments, the linear polarization layer <b>600</b> may block (or reduce an intensity of) light in a direction different from the polarization axis of the reflected light directed toward the outside when the incident light is reflected from the inside of the display apparatus <b>1</b> to the outside.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0105">The linear polarization layer <b>600</b> may include a smectic liquid crystal compound and a dichroic dye compound. For example, the linear polarization layer <b>600</b> may be a guest-host type or kind in which a smectic liquid crystal compound is a host and a dichroic dye compound is a guest. The smectic liquid crystal compound serving as the host may include a material having a high order parameter, and the dichroic dye compound serving as the guest may be aligned in a set or specific direction according to the alignment of the host. Therefore, the linear polarization layer <b>600</b> may be configured to linearly polarize light passing through the linear polarization layer <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0106">In an embodiment, the smectic liquid crystal compound included in the linear polarization layer <b>600</b> may have a smectic A phase and/or a smectic B phase.

However, a material having the smectic B phase is relatively limited and it is difficult to induce alignment. In this regard, the display apparatus <b>1</b> according to an embodiment includes the interference layer <b>400</b> that absorbs or extinguishes at least a portion of the incident light. Therefore, even when the smectic liquid crystal compound includes the smectic A phase, the performance of reducing the reflectance of external light when the smectic liquid crystal compound includes the smectic B phase may be equivalent or better.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0108">The smectic liquid crystal compound included in the linear polarization layer <b>600</b> is a linear compound and may include a material having functional groups at both ends of a molecular structure thereof.
