For example, the regulation station device sends a control command for controlling the portable station device to the control station device, and the control station device sends a control command to the portable station device via a control channel of a communication satellite. Since the portable station device is operated by the schedule reservation information installed in the regulation station device, in order to change the operation of the portable station device, it is necessary for an operator to make an operation reservation for the portable station using an HMI (Human Machine Interface) connected to the regulation station device (see, for example, NPL 1).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Non Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">[NPL 1] Akira Matsushita et al., &#x201c;Infrastructure satellite communication system applied to disaster countermeasure services&#x201d;, NTT Technology Journal 2005.9</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the prior art, in order to connect a channel between portable station devices via a communication satellite, it is necessary to manage the schedule of the regulation station device.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in the satellite communication system <b>100</b>, one of N (N is a positive integer) portable station devices is used as a master station device <b>101</b>, and the other portable station devices are used as slave station devices <b>102</b>(slave station device <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>) to slave station device <b>102</b>(N&#x2212;1)). The master station device <b>101</b> connects a channel to any one of the slave station devices <b>102</b> via a communication satellite <b>103</b>. The communication satellite <b>103</b> has the master station device <b>101</b> and the plurality of slave station devices <b>102</b> in its communication area. For example, a signal transmitted from the communication satellite <b>103</b> can be received by the master station device <b>101</b> and the plurality of slave station devices <b>102</b>. Here, in the following description, when common description is given for the slave station device <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>) to the slave station device <b>102</b>(N&#x2212;1), the (number) at the end of the reference sign is omitted and they will be described as the slave station device <b>102</b>. When indicating a specific slave station device <b>102</b>, it is described as, for example, the slave station device <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>). The same applies to portable station devices <b>901</b> of a comparative example described later.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the master station device <b>101</b> transmits a control signal (CSCO (Common Signaling Channel Outband) signal) to the slave station device <b>102</b> (transmission of first control signal). The CSCO signal is transmitted by a time division multiplexing (TDM) method. The slave station device <b>102</b> receives the CSCO signal from the master station device <b>101</b>, establishes synchronization, and transmits a control signal (CSCI (Common Signaling Channel Inband) signal) indicating that synchronization has been established to the master station device <b>101</b> (transmission of second control signal). The CSCI signal is transmitted by a burst method.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Upon receiving the CSCI signal from the slave station device <b>102</b>, the master station device <b>101</b> determines that the slave station device <b>102</b> is in a communicable state, and notifies the operator of the master station device <b>101</b> on a display panel <b>210</b> or the like described later. Here, the master station device <b>101</b> constantly transmits a CSCO signal for the slave station device <b>102</b> to establish synchronization, and receives CSCI signals from a plurality of slave station devices <b>102</b> that have established synchronization. When the CSCI signal, which is a burst signal, is received from the plurality of slave station devices <b>102</b> at the same time, the master station device <b>101</b> may not be able to recognize the CSCI signal, but since the master station device <b>101</b> constantly transmits the CSCO signal, the master station device <b>101</b> can normally recognize the CSCI signal transmitted again from the slave station device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In this way, the master station device <b>101</b> can grasp the communicable slave station device <b>102</b> and notify the master station operator on the display panel <b>210</b> or the like. Then, when the master station operator selects a desired slave station device <b>102</b> to communicate with from the communicable slave station devices <b>102</b> and instructs the start of transmission, the master station device <b>101</b> can transmit a CSCO signal instructing to start transmission to the desired slave station device <b>102</b> (transmission of third control signal) and communicate with the desired slave station device <b>102</b>. The third control signal is transmitted not only to the desired slave station device <b>102</b> but also to the master station device <b>101</b> itself (subject device) by loopback at the communication satellite <b>103</b>. Here, both the master station device <b>101</b> and the slave station device <b>102</b> are similar portable station devices, and when they receive a CSCO signal instructing to start transmission, they operate to start transmitting the communication signal on the communication channel. Therefore, the master station device <b>101</b> can perform an operation of starting the transmission of the communication signal on the communication channel in the same manner as the slave station device <b>102</b> by receiving the CSCO signal transmitted by itself by the satellite's loopback. Due to this, it is not necessary to install the processing and functions dedicated to the master station device <b>101</b>, the configurations and functions of the master station device <b>101</b> and the slave station device <b>102</b> can be shared, and any one of the plurality of portable station devices can be operated as the master station device <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As described above, in the satellite communication system <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, the base station device, the control station device, the regulation station device, and the like do not participate in the communication between the master station device <b>101</b> and the slave station device <b>102</b>, and the master station device <b>101</b> and the slave station device <b>102</b> can independently connect a channel and perform communication.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the control signal and the communication signal transmitted and received by the master station device <b>101</b> and the slave station device <b>102</b> use channels having different frequency bands, and each channel is frequency-division-multiplexed (FDM).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a state in which the control signals and communication signals transmitted and received by the master station device <b>101</b> and the slave station device <b>102</b> are frequency-division-multiplexed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the horizontal axis represents the frequency f. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a communication channel <b>151</b> for transmitting a communication signal from the master station device <b>101</b> to the slave station device <b>102</b>, a communication channel <b>152</b> for transmitting a communication signal from the slave station device <b>102</b> to the master station device <b>101</b>, a control channel <b>153</b> for transmitting the CSCO signal from the master station device <b>101</b> to the slave station device <b>102</b>, a control channel <b>154</b> for transmitting the CSCI signal from the slave station device <b>102</b> to the master station device <b>101</b> are frequency-division-multiplexed. Due to this, when a communication signal is transmitted and received to and from the slave station device <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>) (during communication), the master station device <b>101</b> can transmit a CSCO signal to another slave station device <b>102</b> and receive a CSCI signal from another slave station device <b>102</b>. Since the CSCO signal transmitted by the master station device <b>101</b> is relayed by the communication satellite <b>103</b> and transmitted into the communication area again, the CSCO signal transmitted by the master station device <b>101</b> is received by not only the slave station device <b>102</b> but also the master station device <b>101</b> itself.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Here, a satellite communication system <b>900</b> of a comparative example will be described so that the features of the satellite communication system <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment can be easily understood.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a configuration example of the satellite communication system <b>900</b> of the comparative example. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the satellite communication system <b>900</b> of the comparative example forms a communication channel between abase station device <b>903</b> and N portable station devices <b>901</b> (portable station device <b>901</b>(<b>1</b>) to portable station device <b>901</b>(N)) via a communication satellite <b>902</b> and transmits and receives a communication signal. The portable station device <b>901</b> forms a control channel with the control station device <b>904</b> via the communication satellite <b>902</b>, and transmits and receives a control signal. The base station device <b>903</b> and the control station device <b>904</b> are connected to a regulation station device <b>906</b> via a network <b>905</b>, and an operator manages and controls the operation of the satellite communication system <b>900</b> using an HMI <b>907</b>. For example, when the operator makes an operation reservation for the schedule for the portable station device <b>901</b> to communicate with the regulation station device <b>906</b>, the schedule reservation information is held in the regulation station device <b>906</b>, and the regulation station device <b>906</b> instructs the control station device <b>904</b> to control the portable station device <b>901</b> on the basis of the schedule reservation information. The control station device <b>904</b> transmits a CSCO signal to the portable station device <b>901</b> by the TDM method to establish synchronization and control transmission, and conversely, receives a CSCI signal from the portable station device <b>901</b> by the burst method to acquire information on the portable station device <b>901</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described above, in the satellite communication system <b>900</b> of the comparative example, the regulation station device <b>906</b>, the control station device <b>904</b>, and the like manages and controls the operation of the portable station device <b>901</b>.
