In general, the depth of field changes depending on an F number, the moving body feeling changes depending on a shutter speed, and the granular feeling changes depending on imaging sensitivity. With the use of a transmittance control element, such as a variable ND filter, it is possible to control exposure without changing the F number, the shutter speed, and the imaging sensitivity during imaging. With this, it is possible to continuously image a natural video even though brightness is changed.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Note that a movable range of the transmittance control element is limited. For this reason, in starting imaging of a video, in a case where the transmittance control element is set close to an upper limit value or a lower limit value of the movable range, exposure may not be controlled only with the transmittance control element during imaging. On the other hand, in a case where the transmittance control element is forcibly set to a median value of the movable range, a video cannot be imaged under exposure conditions (F number, shutter speed, and imaging sensitivity) desired by a user.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the present embodiment, there is provided an imaging apparatus capable of continuously imaging a natural video even though brightness is changed, while maintaining the exposure conditions set by the user as much as possible.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">[Apparatus Configuration]</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram showing the schematic configuration of the imaging apparatus.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an imaging apparatus <b>1</b> of the present embodiment primarily comprises an imaging lens <b>10</b>, an imaging element <b>20</b>, an imaging element drive unit <b>22</b>, an analog signal processing unit <b>24</b>, an analog to digital converter (ADC) <b>26</b>, a main storage unit <b>28</b>, a digital signal processing unit <b>30</b>, an auxiliary storage unit <b>32</b>, a display unit <b>34</b>, an operation unit <b>36</b>, a system control unit <b>40</b>, and the like.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The imaging lens <b>10</b> primarily comprises a lens <b>11</b>, a stop <b>12</b>, a variable ND filter <b>13</b>, a lens drive unit <b>14</b>, a stop drive unit <b>15</b>, an ND filter drive unit <b>16</b>, and the like.

In regard to the margins &#x3b1; and &#x3b2;, the margin &#x3b1; that is added to the darkening side (&#x2212;side) and the margin &#x3b2; that is added to the brightening side (+side) are separately prepared.

Accordingly, in this case, the estimated exposure fluctuation range S is set to a range of 11 to 16. For example, in a case where the estimated exposure change amount A is 0 to 2 (Amin=0, Amax=2), the margin &#x3b1; on the darkening side is 2, and the margin &#x3b2; on the brightening side is 3. Accordingly, in this case, the estimated exposure fluctuation range S is set to a range of 2 to 5. In a case where the estimated exposure change amount A strides over ranges determined in a table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, a margin that is set larger is given with priority. For example, in a case where the estimated exposure change amount A is 6 to 7, while the margin &#x3b1; on the darkening side can take a value of 3 to 4, and the margin &#x3b2; on the brightening side can take a value of 3 to 4, a value that is set larger is given with priority. Accordingly, in this case, the margin &#x3b1; on the darkening side is 4, and the margin &#x3b2; on the brightening side is 4. In a case where the estimated exposure fluctuation range after the margin is added exceeds an upper limit or a lower limit of the exposure amount, the estimated exposure fluctuation range is set to the upper limit or the lower limit. For example, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, in a case where the estimated exposure fluctuation range exceeds 16 EV or &#x2212;4 EV, the estimated exposure fluctuation range is set to 16 EV or &#x2212;4 EV.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In this way, the predetermined margins are added to the estimated exposure change amount obtained from the measurement result to calculate the estimated exposure fluctuation range, whereby it is possible to more appropriately set the estimated exposure fluctuation range.

For example, a method of determining a scene from information regarding the exposure amount obtained by photometry can be employed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a diagram showing an example of a relationship between an exposure amount and a scene. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, some scenes (imaging scene information) can be specified from the exposure amount. According to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, for example, in a case where a range of an exposure amount of each divided region is 13 EV to 15 EV, determination can be made that an imaging scene is fine weather. Accordingly, in this case, the margins a and &#x3b2; prepared for the imaging scene of fine weather are added to the estimated exposure change amount, and the estimated exposure fluctuation range is set. As a specification method of specifying an imaging scene, other known techniques can be employed.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In a case where the user specifies a scene, for example, a method in which selectable imaging scenes are displayed on the display unit <b>34</b> in a list, and the user selects an imaging scene using the operation unit <b>36</b> can be employed.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">(2) Setting Method <b>2</b> of Margins</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Optimum margins are set using a history of past imaging of the user. That is, optimum margins &#x3b1; and&#x3b2; are set from a past imaging tendency of the user. In this case, for every imaging of a video, the fluctuation width of the exposure amount is measured, and information regarding the measured fluctuation width is recorded. In regard to the fluctuation width, both a fluctuation width in a darkening direction and a fluctuation width in a brightening direction are measured and recorded. In calculating the estimated exposure fluctuation range, the margin &#x3b1; on the darkening side and the margin <b>0</b> of the brightening side are set based on the recorded fluctuation widths. For example, an average value of the recorded fluctuation widths is set as a margin. Alternatively, a maximum value of the recorded fluctuation widths is set as a margin. The present processing is executed by the system control unit <b>40</b>. Information regarding the fluctuation widths is recorded in, for example, the auxiliary storage unit <b>32</b> configured with an internal memory.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">(3) Setting Method <b>3</b> of Margins</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Margins are set manually. In a case where a fluctuation width of an exposure amount that is supposed in a case where a video is imaged is known in advance, the margins a and &#x3b2; can be set using information regarding the fluctuation width of the exposure amount. For example, in a case where a place (scene) where imaging is performed is decided, or the like, the supposed fluctuation width of the exposure amount is known to some extent in advance. For example, in a case of imaging outdoors only, since sudden darkening does not occur, it is supposed that the fluctuation width is small. On the other hand, in a case of imaging at a live place, a wedding hall, or the like, since a scene where brightness is suddenly changed is supposed, it is supposed that the fluctuation width is large.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">In a case of the present example, for example, a setting screen of margins is displayed on the display unit <b>34</b>, and the margins &#x3b1; and&#x3b2; are set manually using the operation unit <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">(4) Setting Method <b>4</b> of Margins</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">A fluctuation width of an exposure amount is measured to set optimum margins.
