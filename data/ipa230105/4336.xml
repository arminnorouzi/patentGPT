discloses an image forming system that prints an image using easily and safely an image forming apparatus installed in a rental office as a destination of a user.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As ways of working in companies become versatile, the chance of telework in a rental office or shared office increases in addition to the traditional style of going to work in offices in office buildings.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The use of an information processing apparatus carried to a telework office may be contemplated as a printing method of an image forming apparatus installed in the telework office. In the printing method, if a user performs authentication using an authentication function of the information processing apparatus when a job is issued, an identification (ID) unique to the information processing apparatus is issued as authentication information. The unique ID is linked to the job and then transmitted to a server and jobs are thus accumulated on the server.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the printing method described above, when the user authenticates the image forming apparatus using the authentication function of the information processing apparatus, a unique ID is transmitted to the image forming apparatus. The image forming apparatus transmits the unique ID from the information processing apparatus to the server. The server searches for a job having an ID matching the ID from the image forming apparatus and transmits the found job to the image forming apparatus. The image forming apparatus prints the job transmitted from the server.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the printing method, however, the image forming apparatus performs all jobs having the matched ID. If there are multiple jobs having the matched ID, the server transmits all the jobs.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Aspects of non-limiting embodiments of the present disclosure relate to causing an image forming apparatus to receive a job selected by a user out of jobs corresponding to authentication information if the image forming apparatus receives the jobs from a server using the authentication information transmitted from an information processing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Aspects of certain non-limiting embodiments of the present disclosure address the above advantages and/or other advantages not described above.
