according to an embodiment. The time point acquisition system <b>10</b> is a system that derives the number of railway vehicles included in a railway train <b>6</b> based on time-series data including a physical quantity at a predetermined observation point on a bridge <b>5</b> on which the railway train <b>6</b> formed with one or more railway vehicles moves. The railway train <b>6</b> is an example of a formation moving object. Each of the railway vehicles included in the railway train <b>6</b> is an example of a moving object. The bridge <b>5</b> is an example of a structure on which the moving object moves. Each railway vehicle of the railway train <b>6</b> moves on the bridge <b>5</b> via wheels provided on an axle. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the time point acquisition system <b>10</b> includes a measurement device <b>1</b>, at least one sensor device <b>2</b> provided in a superstructure <b>7</b> of the bridge <b>5</b>, and a server device <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The measurement device <b>1</b> calculates a displacement (a displacement in a vertical direction) of deflection of the superstructure <b>7</b> caused by traveling of the railway train <b>6</b> based on acceleration data which is a physical quantity output from each sensor device <b>2</b>. The measurement device <b>1</b> is installed on, for example, a bridge abutment <b>8</b><i>b</i>. The measurement device <b>1</b> and the server device <b>3</b> can communicate with each other via, for example, a wireless network of a mobile phone and a communication network <b>4</b> such as the Internet. The measurement device <b>1</b> transmits information on the displacement of the superstructure <b>7</b> caused by the traveling of the railway train <b>6</b> to the server device <b>3</b>. The server device <b>3</b> derives the number of railway vehicles formed in the railway train <b>6</b> based on the transmitted displacement data.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the present embodiment, the bridge <b>5</b> is a railroad bridge, and is, for example, a steel bridge, a girder bridge, or an RC bridge. The RC is an abbreviation for reinforced-concrete. In the present embodiment, the bridge <b>5</b> is a structure to which Bridge Weigh In Motion (BWIM) is applicable. The BWIM is a technology in which a bridge is regarded as a &#x201c;scale&#x201d;, deformation of the bridge is measured, and thereby a weight and the number of axles of a moving object passing through the bridge is measured. The bridge, which enables analysis of the weight of the moving object traveling on the bridge, based on a response such as deformation or strain of the bridge, is considered to be a structure to which BWIM is applicable. Therefore, the BWIM system, which applies a physical process between an action on the bridge and the response, enables the measurement of the weight of the moving object that travels on the bridge. The weight of the moving object is measured by measuring a correlation coefficient between the displacement and a load in advance, and using the correlation coefficient to derive the load of the moving object passing through from the measurement result of the displacement of the bridge when the moving object passes through.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The bridge <b>5</b> includes the superstructure <b>7</b> that is a portion where the moving object moves, and a substructure <b>8</b> that supports the superstructure <b>7</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the superstructure <b>7</b> taken along a line A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the superstructure <b>7</b> includes a bridge floor <b>7</b><i>a</i>, a support <b>7</b><i>b</i>, rails <b>7</b><i>c</i>, ties <b>7</b><i>d</i>, and a ballast <b>7</b><i>e</i>, and the bridge floor <b>7</b><i>a </i>includes a floor plate F, a main girder G, a cross girder which is not shown. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the substructure <b>8</b> includes bridge piers <b>8</b><i>a </i>and the bridge abutments <b>8</b><i>b</i>. The superstructure <b>7</b> is a structure across the bridge abutment <b>8</b><i>b </i>and the bridge pier <b>8</b><i>a </i>adjacent to each other, two adjacent bridge abutments <b>8</b><i>b</i>, or two adjacent bridge piers <b>8</b><i>a</i>. Hereinafter, the bridge abutment <b>8</b><i>b </i>and the bridge pier <b>8</b><i>a </i>are collectively referred to as a support portion. In the present embodiment, a support that is a set of support portions and a portion of the bridge girder of the superstructure <b>7</b> across the set of support portions are collectively referred to as one bridge girder. That is, a simple beam-like structure in which both ends are supported by two support portions is defined as one bridge girder. Therefore, the bridge <b>5</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes two bridge girders. Hereinafter, each bridge girder included in the bridge <b>5</b> is referred to as a unit bridge girder.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The measurement device <b>1</b> and the sensor device <b>2</b> are coupled to each other, for example, in a wired or wireless manner, and communicate with one another via a communication network such as a controller area network (CAN). The sensor device <b>2</b> is used to measure a predetermined physical quantity used to derive a displacement (deflection) at an observation point set on the superstructure <b>7</b>. In the present embodiment, the predetermined physical quantity is an acceleration. In the present embodiment, the sensor device <b>2</b> is installed at the observation point. The sensor device <b>2</b> includes an acceleration sensor such as a quartz acceleration sensor or a micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) acceleration sensor. In the present embodiment, the sensor device <b>2</b> outputs the acceleration data for deriving the displacement of the superstructure <b>7</b> due to the movement of the railway train <b>6</b> which is a moving object at the observation point, but the sensor device <b>2</b> may naturally output a physical quantity other than the acceleration. The sensor device <b>2</b> may output data directly indicating the displacement or may output data indirectly indicating the displacement. In any case, it is sufficient that the time-series data of the displacement of the structure can be acquired based on the physical quantity output from the sensor device <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the present embodiment, the sensor device <b>2</b> is installed at a central portion of the superstructure <b>7</b> in a longitudinal direction, specifically, at a central portion of the main girder G in the longitudinal direction. The sensor device <b>2</b> is not limited to being installed at the central portion of the superstructure <b>7</b> as long as the sensor device <b>2</b> can detect an acceleration for calculating the displacement of the superstructure <b>7</b>. When the sensor device <b>2</b> is provided on the floor plate F of the superstructure <b>7</b>, the sensor device <b>2</b> may be damaged due to traveling of the railway train <b>6</b>, and the measurement accuracy may be influenced by local deformation of the bridge floor <b>7</b><i>a</i>, so that in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the sensor device <b>2</b> is provided at the main girder G of the superstructure <b>7</b>. The floor plate F, the main girders G, and the like of the superstructure <b>7</b> are deflected in a vertical direction due to a load of the railway train <b>6</b> traveling on the superstructure <b>7</b>. Each sensor device <b>2</b> measures an acceleration of the deflection of the floor plate F or the main girder G caused by the load of the railway train <b>6</b> traveling on the superstructure <b>7</b>.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">(1-2) Deflection Model</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Here, a model of deflection of a bridge when a railway train moves on one unit bridge girder will be described.

That is, with the function of the time point acquisition unit <b>303</b>, the control unit <b>300</b> performs the high-pass filter processing on the time-series data on which the low-pass filter processing was performed, inverts a sign, compares the sum of the time-series data before the sign is inverted and the time-series data after the sign is inverted with a predetermined threshold, specifies two pieces of time-series data between which the threshold is, and performs processing of acquiring the data k from one of the two pieces of time-series data on the entry time point and the exit time point to obtain the values of the two pieces of k. Then, the control unit <b>300</b> acquires the entry time point and the exit time point from these values of k.

When the time-series data u<sub>lp</sub>(k) is used for a calculation of the high-pass filter processing, the moving average interval may be subjected to the moving average in a cycle that is a natural number multiple of the basic cycle.

Then, the control unit <b>300</b> acquires a time change T<sub>std</sub>(k) of the deflection amount by executing a calculation for acquiring Equation (32) based on each set of observation information and the environmental information. The control unit <b>300</b> associates the time change in the deflection amount with each threshold. If the time change T<sub>std</sub>(k) of the deflection amount acquired in this way matches the time-series data U(k), it can be said that the threshold is appropriate.

For example, if it is assumed that the linear function obtained by multiplying the time change T<sub>std</sub>(k) of the deflection amount by the coefficient c<sub>1 </sub>and adding a constant term c<sub>0 </sub>is substantially equal to U(k), it is possible to match the scales of the time change T<sub>std</sub>(k) of the deflection amount and the time-series data U(k). The coefficient c<sub>1 </sub>and the constant term c<sub>0 </sub>can be calculated by a least squares method or the like. As a result, U(k) and T<sub>std</sub>(k)&#xb7;c<sub>1</sub>+c<sub>0 </sub>are adjusted so as to have the most match. Here, the time change in the deflection amount after the adjustment is referred to as T<sub>EOstd</sub>(k).</p><p id="p-0214" num="0164">Since this adjustment is determined based on a value in an interval from the entry time point t<sub>i </sub>to the exit time point t<sub>o</sub>, the time change T<sub>std</sub>(k) of the deflection amount at a time point before the entry time point t<sub>i </sub>and at a time point after the exit time point t<sub>o </sub>may be regarded as another function. For example, at the time point before the entry time point t<sub>i </sub>and the time point after the exit time point t<sub>o</sub>, the constant term c<sub>0 </sub>is regarded as 0. In this case, the constant term c<sub>0 </sub>may be changed according to an interval or a condition such that the deflection amount continues at the entry time point t<sub>i </sub>and the exit time point t<sub>o</sub>.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0165">In any case, according to the above processing, it is expected that the maximum value and the minimum value substantially match each other in both the time change T<sub>EOstd</sub>(k) of the deflection amount after adjustment and the time-series data U(k), and that the time change T<sub>EOstd</sub>(k) and the time-series data U(k) substantially overlap each other. The control unit <b>300</b> associates the time change in the deflection amount after the adjustment with each of the thresholds. Then, based on the temporarily set thresholds, the control unit <b>300</b> compares the time difference between the time change T<sub>EOstd</sub>(k) of the deflection amount after the adjustment and the time-series data U(k), and acquires the threshold when the time difference is minimized, that is, when the time change T<sub>EOstd</sub>(k) and the time-series data U(k) match most.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0166"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> is a partially enlarged view showing the time change T<sub>EOstd</sub>(k) of the deflection amount after the adjustment and the time-series data U(k) by a dotted line and a solid line, respectively.

The control unit <b>300</b> acquires the time difference dT at a predetermined determination level Lv. That is, the control unit <b>300</b> acquires the time point at which the time change T<sub>EOstd</sub>(k) of the deflection amount after the adjustment and the time-series data U(k) become the predetermined determination level Lv, and acquires the difference between both time points as the time difference dT. The determination level Lv is a value determined in advance as a level at which a time difference may occur between the time change T<sub>EOstd</sub>(k) of the deflection amount and the time-series data U(k), and is a level determined from a range in which the deflection amount is less than 0 and greater than the minimum value. That is, the determination level Lv is set in advance so as to change from a state in which the deflection amount is equal to or greater than the determination level to a state in which the deflection amount is equal to or less than the determination level, and so as to change from a state in which the deflection amount is equal to or less than the determination level to a state in which the deflection amount is equal to or greater than the determination level. Since the time change T<sub>EOstd</sub>(k) of the deflection amount and the time-series data U(k) are discrete data on a time axis, the deflection amount and the time-series data U(k) are not necessarily the same as the determination level Lv, but when there is no data identical to the determination level Lv, a time point at which a value is closest to the determination level Lv may be specified, and the time difference dT may be acquired. The time difference dT is obtained for the time change T<sub>EOstd</sub>(k) obtained from each of the plurality of thresholds C<sub>1L</sub>, C<sub>2L</sub>, and C<sub>3L</sub>. The acquired time difference dT is a time difference of the entry time point, and is referred to as a time difference dTi.

Therefore, according to the present embodiment, the high-pass filter processing can be performed without impairing the vibration component that is included in the observed time-series data u(k) and that is induced by the railway vehicle and a harmonic of the vibration component. As a result, in the time-series data u<sub>hp</sub>(k) after the high-pass filter processing, it is possible to analyze a waveform of a state including the vibration component due to the passage of the railway vehicle, and it is possible to increase the possibility that the entry time point t<sub>i </sub>and the exit time point t<sub>o </sub>can be accurately acquired.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="1">(4) Other Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0238" num="0187">The above embodiments are examples for carrying out the present disclosure, and various other embodiments can be adopted. The method of acquiring the entry time point of the railway train entering into the structure and the exit time point of the railway train exiting from the structure from the displacement at the observation point as in the above embodiment can also be realized as an invention of a program or an invention of a method.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0188">Further, a configuration in which the function of the server device <b>3</b> is implemented by a plurality of devices may be adopted. In addition, the functions of the server device <b>3</b> may be implemented in another device. For example, the functions of the data acquisition unit <b>301</b>, the removal unit <b>302</b>, the time point acquisition unit <b>303</b>, and the number acquisition unit <b>304</b> may be implemented by the measurement device <b>1</b>. Further, the above embodiments are examples, and an embodiment in which a part of the configuration is omitted or another configuration is added may be adopted.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0189">In the above embodiment, the time point acquisition system <b>10</b> acquires the time points at which the railway train formed with the railway vehicles, which are one or more moving objects, enters the unit bridge girder serving as the structure and exits from the unit bridge girder. The formation moving object may be a moving object formed with one or more moving objects, and the number of moving objects may be one or more. Therefore, the time point acquisition system <b>10</b> may acquire an entry time point and an exit time point of a formation moving object other than the railway train. For example, the time point acquisition system <b>10</b> may acquire an entry time point and an exit time point of a formation truck in which one or more trucks are coupled. The time point acquisition system <b>10</b> may acquire an entry time point and an exit time point of a vehicle included in a trailer in which one or more vehicles are coupled.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0190">The observation point may be at any position as long as the response of the structure can be observed, and is not limited to a center position of the structure. The physical quantity may be a response caused by the movement of the formation moving object on the structure, and when the structure is influenced by the movement of the formation moving object or a weight of the formation moving object, the change is a response when the structure is changed as compared with a case where the structure is not influenced. Therefore, the structure is not limited to the unit bridge girder, and the response is not limited to an acceleration of the structure. For example, the time point acquisition system <b>10</b> may acquire an entry time point and an exit time point of a formation moving object that moves on a structure different from a bridge, such as a concrete base that supports a railroad track. In the above embodiment, the number of sensor devices <b>2</b> included in the time point acquisition system <b>10</b> is two, but the number may be one or three or more.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0191">In the above embodiment, the control unit <b>300</b> acquires, as the time-series data u(k), the data of displacement (deflection) measured from the acceleration detected via the acceleration sensor <b>210</b>. However, the control unit <b>300</b> may acquire, as u(k), displacement data of the unit bridge girder derived from a physical quantity detected via a sensor such as an impact sensor, a pressure-sensitive sensor, a strain gauge, an image measuring device, a load cell, or a displacement gauge. For example, the control unit <b>300</b> may detect the displacement of the observation point and acquire the detected displacement data by the image measuring device capturing an image of a predetermined object in a cycle, the predetermined object being disposed at the observation point of the bridge <b>5</b>. The physical quantity is obtained by actually measuring a change occurring at the observation point of the structure, and may be used for specifying a value to be observed with respect to the formation moving object. Therefore, the physical quantity may be various quantities, and the control unit <b>300</b> may acquire data of a physical quantity different from the displacement of the unit bridge girder as u(k). For example, the control unit <b>300</b> may acquire, as u(k), an acceleration, a speed, a stress, and the like at the observation point of the bridge <b>5</b>. Further, the control unit <b>300</b> may acquire, as u(k), the number of pixels corresponding to the displacement amount of the predetermined object disposed at the observation point of the bridge <b>5</b> in the image captured via the image measuring device. In addition, the control unit <b>300</b> may acquire data of a plurality of types of physical quantities (for example, displacement, stress, and the like) generated at the observation point as a response caused by the movement of the railway train <b>6</b> on the unit bridge girder.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0192">The vibration component included in the time-series data is a response other than the response caused by the entry of the formation moving object entering into the structure and the exit of the formation moving object exiting from the structure. Therefore, when the formation moving object is constituted by a plurality of moving objects, the vibration component corresponds to a vibration component or the like generated in the structure by the moving object, which is between the foremost moving object and the rearmost moving object, moving on the structure and exiting from the structure. The method for removing the vibration component is not limited to the above-described low-pass filter processing, and various methods may be adopted. For example, processing in which a displacement corresponding to any k is regarded as a statistical value (a minimum value, a maximum value, or a median value) of a specific range including this k may be performed. A low-pass filter circuit may be included in the circuit that acquires the time-series data u(k), and various other configurations may be adopted.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0193">The entry time point is a time point at which the formation moving object enters the structure. Therefore, typically, the entry time point is a time point at which a contact point (wheel) between the foremost moving object of the formation moving object and the structure reaches the structure, but the entry time point may be another definition, for example, a time point at which a tip of the formation moving object reaches the structure from the outside of the structure, or the like. The same applies to the exit time point. The exit time point may be a time point at which a contact point (wheel) between the rearmost moving object of the formation moving object and the structure moves from the structure to the outside of the structure, or the like.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0194">Further, in the above embodiment, the control unit <b>300</b> specifies the peak corresponding to the lowest frequency, except for the side lobe generated due to the influence of the window function used in the FFT, from the result of the FFT on the time-series data u(k) acquired by the function of the data acquisition unit <b>301</b>, and obtains the specified peak as the fundamental frequency F<sub>f</sub>. However, in consideration of an influence of a noise generated in the result of the FFT on u(k), the control unit <b>300</b> may obtain the fundamental frequency F<sub>f</sub>. For example, the control unit <b>300</b> may specify a peak equal to or greater than a predetermined threshold corresponding to the lowest frequency, except for the side lobe generated due to the influence of the window function used in the FFT, from the result of the FFT on u(k), and obtain the specified peak as the fundamental frequency F<sub>f</sub>. The time-series data may be data acquired at a data rate of twice or more the frequency of vibration assumed to occur in the structure due to the movement of the formation moving object.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0195">Further, the present disclosure can also be applied as a program executed by a computer or a method. In addition, the program and method as described above may be implemented as a single device or may be implemented by using components included in a plurality of devices, and includes various aspects. In addition, it is possible to appropriately change the configuration such that a part of the configuration is software and a part of the configuration is hardware. Further, the present disclosure is also applicable to a recording medium of a program. As a matter of course, the recording medium of the program may be a magnetic recording medium, a semiconductor memory, or the like, and any recording medium to be developed in the future can be considered in the same manner.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230003611A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img
