For example, a power steering device disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 6283737 is configured as follows. Specifically, the power steering device includes: at least two redundant steering torque sensors, at least two redundant steering angle sensors, and at least two redundant motor rotational position sensors, where, in a normal state, steering assist control is performed based on a steering torque detection signal from one of the at least two steering torque sensors, a steering angle detection signal from one of the at least two steering angle sensors, and a motor rotational position detection signal from one of the at least two motor rotational position sensors. Redundant monitoring is performed between the at least two steering torque sensors, between the at least two steering angle sensors, and between the at least two motor rotational position sensors, and upon detection of an abnormality in any sensor output signal during the redundant monitoring, the abnormal signal is switched to an alternative signal.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent No. 6283737</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Sensors used in electric power steering devices have increasingly been required to be redundant from the safety perspective.
