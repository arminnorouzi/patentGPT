A welder, for instance, may frequently need to weld two metal workpieces together at specific angles, such as 90-degrees or 45-degrees. However, a single welder cannot simultaneously hold two or more workpieces himself, align the workpieces to a specific angle, and ensure that the alignment does not change during the welding process.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional tools for aligning workpieces, such as carpentry or speed squares, suffer from numerous limitations that reduce or negate their utility. For example, while a speed square may provide a 90-degree angle, a speed square is substantially planar itself and does not provide flat planar edges on which to properly align workpieces. Further, a speed square lacks the ability to hold workpieces, and both the speed square and the workpiece must be manually held to ensure that an alignment does not change. Due to these limitations, a user of a speed square is often subjected to a time-consuming iterative process of aligning two workpieces with the speed square, removing the speed square, attaching the workpieces to one another, realigning the workpieces with the speed square, adjusting the attachment between the workpieces, and so on.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further, forming an angle with a conventional tool requires direct placement of the tool in a joint forming the angle. For example, a user attempting to join two workpieces to form a 90-degree angle must place a conventional tool at the point of joinder and directly flush with the workpieces. Such a placement of a tool directly obstructs the ability to operate upon a workpiece at the point of joinder. This is particularly troublesome when the operation involves welding, where the welding implements themselves must occupy an amount of space proximate to the workpieces. Additionally, the point of joinder between workpieces does not always correspond to the intersection of the planes to which the workpieces are aligned. For example, two workpieces may be aligned at an angle of 90-degrees with respect to one another, but attached via a third workpiece that forms a chamfered corner. In scenarios such as these where there is not a single point of joinder corresponding to a desired angle, conventional tools utterly fail and cannot accurately align workpieces.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, conventional tools and techniques lack the ability to quickly and accurately align workpieces in various scenarios, lack the ability to ensure that the alignment does not change during an operation upon a workpiece, and obstruct access to the point of joinder of workpieces.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Workpiece tools and techniques are described. The tools and techniques are usable to ensure consistent and durable alignment of various workpieces while providing access for performing attachment techniques thereon, which is not possible using conventional tools and techniques.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A workpiece tool, for instance, may include alignment surfaces that are joined to one another and oriented at corresponding specific angles. The workpiece tool includes accessibility cutouts and access spaces that provide a user simultaneous access to points around a joint formed by objects aligned with the alignment surfaces. In this way, the workpiece tool provides accessibility that allows a user to operate upon a workpiece, e.g., as by joining aligned objects together, without interfering or obstructing access to the objects.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, the workpiece tool is configured to allow objects to be held or removably affixed to an alignment surface. Holding objects with the workpiece tool ensures that the alignment of objects with an alignment surface does not change during an operation upon a workpiece. The ability to hold objects is enhanced by the inclusion of cutouts that provide increased access to interior surfaces of the workpiece tool, such as to increase the area available for use of clamps or other fastening devices.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An adjustable tool is also described that includes a tool body and a slidable member that is slidable relative to the tool body.

Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Many conventional alignment tools are substantially planar, i.e. flat, and do not provide sufficient surfaces on which to align objects. Further, conventional alignment tools tend to obstruct user access to the objects being aligned, particularly around points of joinder. Additionally, conventional alignment tools lack the ability to hold objects to ensure that the objects are not unintentionally moved. Thus, many conventional alignment tools have been found to be unable to adequately align objects during operation upon a workpiece.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Accordingly, workpiece tools and techniques are described. In one example, a workpiece tool includes multiple side panels that include alignment surfaces that may be utilized to align and/or hold objects. The workpiece tool includes at least one cutout adjacent an alignment surface. The cutout increases the exposed and accessible area of the corresponding alignment surface, thus providing an increased area upon the alignment surface that may be utilized to clamp or otherwise fasten a workpiece to the tool. Further, a single side panel may provide multiple alignment surfaces, for instance an inner alignment surface and an outer alignment surface. By providing an inner alignment surface that is parallel to an outer alignment surface of the same side panel, clamps or other fasteners may be utilized to ensure that alignment and positioning of objects will not be unintentionally altered.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In another example, the workpiece tool includes alignment surfaces that are joined to one another and oriented at corresponding specific angles. Accessibility cutouts and access spaces are provided adjacent the alignment surfaces to provide a user simultaneous access to points around a joint formed by objects aligned with the alignment surfaces. In this way, the workpiece tool provides accessibility that allows a user to operate upon a workpiece, e.g., as by joining aligned objects together, without interfering or obstructing access to the objects.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the following discussion, example workpiece tools are described that may employ the techniques described herein. Example scenarios are then described in which the example workpiece tools are utilized to align and/or hold example workpieces. Performance of the example scenarios is not limited to the example workpiece tools, and the example workpiece tools are not limited to performance of the example scenarios.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Workpiece Tools</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>7</b></figref> depict various example workpiece tools that are operable to employ techniques described herein.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a workpiece tool <b>100</b> (shown from two different perspectives) that is operable to employ techniques described herein. The workpiece tool <b>100</b> includes side panels <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b>. The side panels <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b> each have an interior surface and an exterior surface. For example, the side panel <b>102</b> has interior surface <b>102</b><i>a </i>and exterior surface <b>102</b><i>b</i>. Likewise, the side panel <b>104</b> has interior surface <b>104</b><i>a </i>and exterior surface <b>104</b><i>b</i>, and the side panel <b>106</b> has interior surface <b>106</b><i>a </i>and exterior surface <b>106</b><i>b</i>. The side panels <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b> are each connected by their respective interior surface to a diaphragm <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The side panels <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b> of the workpiece tool <b>100</b> provide flat surfaces, e.g., the respective interior and exterior surfaces, for aligning, clamping, fastening, holding, or measuring materials or workpieces, and so forth. The side panels <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b> are joined to one another to form respective angles A, B, and C. In the illustrated and described implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, side panel <b>102</b> and the side panel <b>104</b> form an angle A of 45-degrees, the side panel <b>102</b> and the side panel <b>106</b> form an angle of 45-degrees, side panel <b>104</b> and the side panel <b>106</b> form an angle B of 90-degrees, and side panel <b>106</b> and side panel <b>102</b> form an angle C of 45-degrees. Accordingly, workpieces aligned with (e.g., clamped to) adjacent side panels of the workpiece tool <b>100</b> will become aligned, one to another, at corresponding specific angles.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The side panels <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b> each have a respective width, illustrated as &#x201c;W&#x201d; in the rightmost illustration. The width W is sufficiently large to provide an area upon which nearly any workpiece can become easily aligned with the respective side panel. As an example, the area provided by a side panel is large enough to ensure that a cylindrical workpiece will always contact the side panel at a point of tangency. In some implementations, the side panels have a width W ranging from about 1.5&#x2033; to about 3&#x2033;, and lengths ranging from about 8&#x2033; to about 17&#x2033;. Other dimensions can, of course, be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The diaphragm <b>108</b> is a structural support that connects the various side panels and holds angular alignments among the various side panels. In implementations, the diaphragm <b>108</b> is connected to at least a part of each respective interior surface of the side panels <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>. The region generally bounded by the interior surfaces of the side panels <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> may be considered an interior region of the workpiece tool <b>100</b>, and thus the diaphragm <b>108</b> is disposed within the interior region. In some implementations, the diaphragm is centered with respect to the width of the side panels as described further with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In other implementations, the diaphragm is aligned to an edge of the side panels with respect to their width as described further with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The diaphragm <b>108</b> includes a plurality of cutouts <b>110</b>. Each of the cutouts <b>110</b> is partially bounded by one of the side panels <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, or <b>106</b>. The cutouts <b>110</b> are pass-through openings for fasteners or clamps, and increase the accessibility to and exposed area of the interior surfaces of the respective side panel. In this way, a clamp or fastener may easily be attached to or access portions of the interior surface along the full width of the respective side panel, without interference from the diaphragm <b>108</b>. In some implementations, the cutouts have a width ranging from about 1&#x2033; to about 2&#x2033; and lengths ranging from about 2&#x2033; to about 3&#x2033;. The size and shape of each respective cutout may be referred to by its footprint, e.g., a two-dimensional region as seen from a viewpoint perpendicular to the diaphragm <b>216</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some implementations, the workpiece tool <b>100</b> includes at least one weld relief <b>112</b> at the joinder of two side panels. The weld relief <b>112</b> is an external cutout that prevents the exterior surfaces of the respective side panels from reaching a point of intersection. The weld relief <b>112</b> allows the workpiece tool <b>100</b> to be aligned with workpieces despite the presence of deposited weld materials. For example, two workpieces that have been welded to form an acute angle may include a welding bead inside of the acute angle. In such an example, the welding bead obstructs conventional tools from becoming properly aligned with the workpieces, while the workpiece tool <b>100</b> with the weld relief <b>112</b> is capable of becoming flush with both workpieces and achieving proper alignment.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Further, in some implementations the workpiece tool <b>100</b> includes at least one tapped hole <b>114</b>. The tapped hole <b>114</b> allows various attachments to be removably affixed to the workpiece tool <b>100</b>, as described in greater detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>. In some implementations, the tapped hole <b>114</b> is a &#xbc;&#x2033;-<b>20</b> tapped hole. As illustrated, the tapped hole <b>114</b> is parallel to the width of one or more side panels. In some implementations, the workpiece tool <b>100</b> includes additional holes, such as holes through a side panel that may be utilized to fasten the workpiece tool <b>100</b> to a modular welding table. For example, the workpiece tool <b>100</b> may include &#x215d;&#x2033; through-holes in the side panels for the purpose of alignment with &#x215d;&#x2033; holes in a modular welding table.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In implementations, the workpiece tool <b>100</b> is a made from a metal such as steel, iron, or aluminum, however any suitable substance may be utilized such as various metals, woods, plastics, and so forth. In implementations, the workpiece tool <b>100</b> is a single solid object created from CNC machining, however any suitable formation technique may be utilized such as 3D printing a single solid object, or by attaching multiple objects together such as by gluing, welding, fastening with screws, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a workpiece tool <b>200</b> (shown from two different perspectives) that is operable to employ techniques described herein.

Each of the side panels <b>202</b>-<b>214</b> have an interior surface and an exterior surface. For example, the side panel <b>202</b> has interior surface <b>202</b><i>a </i>and exterior surface <b>202</b><i>b</i>. Likewise, the side panel <b>204</b> has interior surface <b>204</b><i>a </i>and exterior surface <b>204</b><i>b</i>, the side panel <b>206</b> has interior surface <b>206</b><i>a </i>and exterior surface <b>206</b><i>b</i>, the side panel <b>208</b> has interior surface <b>208</b><i>a </i>and exterior surface <b>208</b><i>b</i>, the side panel <b>210</b> has interior surface <b>210</b><i>a </i>and exterior surface <b>210</b><i>b</i>, the side panel <b>212</b> has interior surface <b>212</b><i>a </i>and exterior surface <b>212</b><i>b</i>, and the side panel <b>214</b> has interior surface <b>214</b><i>a </i>and exterior surface <b>214</b><i>b</i>. The side panels <b>202</b>-<b>208</b> are each connected by their respective interior surface to a diaphragm <b>216</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The side panels <b>202</b>-<b>214</b> of the workpiece tool <b>200</b> provide flat surfaces, e.g., the respective interior and exterior surfaces, for aligning, clamping, fastening, holding, or measuring materials or workpieces, and so forth. Each of the side panels <b>202</b>-<b>214</b> is joined to at least one other of the side panels <b>202</b>-<b>214</b> to form respective angles A, B, C, D, E, and F. In the illustrated and described implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the side panel <b>202</b> and the side panel <b>204</b> form an angle A of 135-degrees, the side panel <b>204</b> and the side panel <b>206</b> form an angle B of 135-degrees, the side panel <b>206</b> and the side panel <b>208</b> form an angle C of 45-degrees, the side panel <b>210</b> and the side panel <b>212</b> form and angle D of 45-degrees, the side panel <b>212</b> and the side panel <b>214</b> form an angle E of 135-degrees, and the side panel <b>214</b> and the side panel <b>202</b> form an angle F of 135-degrees. In such implementations, the side panel <b>202</b> is at a right angle with respect to the side panel <b>206</b> and the side panel <b>212</b>, the side panel <b>204</b> is at a right angle with respect to the side panel <b>210</b> and the side panel <b>214</b>, and the side panel <b>214</b> is at a right angle with respect to the side panel <b>204</b> and the side panel <b>208</b>.

The workpiece tool <b>400</b> may be, for example, the workpiece tool <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Planes <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> extend into and out of the page upon which <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> appears, and are aligned with two side panels of the workpiece tool <b>400</b>.

The area generally bounded by the plane <b>402</b>, the plane <b>404</b>, and the side panel <b>204</b> corresponds to an access space <b>408</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The access space <b>408</b> provides accessibility for joining workpieces that are located proximate to the planes <b>402</b> and/or <b>404</b>, or to workpieces located within the access space <b>408</b> itself. For example, if substantially straight workpieces are aligned with the side panels <b>202</b> and <b>206</b>, respectively, they are also aligned with the planes <b>402</b> and <b>404</b>, respectively, and may form a joint at the point <b>406</b>. In such an example, a user has unobstructed access to the access space <b>408</b>. By virtue of the access space <b>408</b>, the user may operate upon the workpiece at any portion of the joint formed at the point <b>406</b>, including on portions of the joint that are only accessible via the access space <b>408</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The workpiece tool <b>400</b> includes a plurality of access spaces, however for visual clarity only a single access space <b>408</b> is expressly depicted. The access spaces may vary in size and/or shape. In implementations, there is an access space adjacent to each of the side panels <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>212</b>, and <b>214</b>. For instance, an access space adjacent to side panel <b>202</b> is generally bounded by the side panel <b>202</b> and by planes aligned with the side panels <b>204</b> and <b>214</b>. In the illustrated and described implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the access space adjacent to side panel <b>202</b> is smaller than the access space <b>408</b> that is adjacent to side panel <b>204</b>. As another example, an access space adjacent to the side panel <b>206</b> is generally bounded by the side panel <b>206</b>, a plane aligned with the side panel <b>204</b>, and a plane aligned with the weld reliefs <b>220</b>. In the illustrated and described implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the access space adjacent to side panel <b>206</b> is smaller than the access space <b>408</b> that is adjacent to side panel <b>204</b>. In this way, the workpiece tool <b>400</b> provides various access spaces of differing shapes and sizes. The access spaces may be utilized not only for direct access to the region, but may also be utilized to align objects despite obstructions proximate to the access space. For instance, the objects forming a joint near the point <b>406</b> may include a welding bead other protrusion that extends into the access space <b>408</b>. The access space <b>408</b> allows the objects to be aligned with the side panels <b>202</b> and <b>206</b> despite the protrusion, whereas a conventional tool would be unable to align the objects.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a workpiece tool <b>500</b> that is operable to employ techniques described herein.

In the illustrated and described implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the reference plane, the first plane <b>502</b>, and the second plane <b>504</b> are orthogonal planes, and thus the diaphragm <b>216</b>, the side panel <b>208</b>, and the side panel <b>210</b> are orthogonal to one another.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The workpiece tool <b>500</b> further includes a master cutout <b>224</b>.

The workpiece tool <b>600</b> includes side panels <b>602</b> and <b>604</b>. The side panels <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> each have an interior surface and an exterior surface. For example, the side panel <b>602</b> has interior surface <b>602</b><i>a </i>and exterior surface <b>602</b><i>b</i>. Likewise, the side panel <b>604</b> has interior surface <b>604</b><i>a </i>and exterior surface <b>604</b><i>b</i>. The side panel <b>602</b> is connected by the interior surface <b>602</b><i>a </i>to a diaphragm <b>606</b>, and the side panel <b>604</b> is connected by the interior surface <b>604</b><i>a </i>to a diaphragm <b>608</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The side panels <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> of the workpiece tool <b>600</b> provide flat surfaces, e.g., the respective interior and exterior surfaces, for aligning, clamping, fastening, holding, or measuring materials or workpieces, and so forth. The side panels <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> form an angle A in relation to one another. The angle A is not a fixed angle, and in the illustrated and described implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the angle A can be varied up to about 100-degrees. The side panel <b>602</b> and the side panel <b>604</b> do not contact one another, and the angle A may be conceptualized based on planes aligned with the side panel <b>602</b> and the side panel <b>604</b>. In the illustrated and described implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the side panel <b>602</b> is aligned with a plane <b>610</b> and the side panel <b>604</b> is aligned with a plane <b>612</b>. The planes <b>610</b> and <b>612</b> are depicted as dotted lines and extend into and out of the page upon which <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> appears, and continue infinitely as indicated by arrows at the ends of the depicted lines. The planes <b>610</b> and <b>612</b> intersect at a point <b>614</b>, which is consider as a point forming the angle A.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Accordingly, workpieces aligned with (e.g., clamped to) the side panels <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> will become aligned, one to another, at a specific yet variable angle A. The side panels <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> each have a respective width, illustrated as &#x201c;W&#x201d; in the rightmost illustration. The width W is sufficiently large to provide an area upon which nearly any workpiece can become easily aligned with the respective side panel. As an example, the area provided by a side panel is large enough to ensure that a cylindrical workpiece will always contact the side panel at a point of tangency. In some implementations, the side panels have a width W ranging from about 1.5&#x2033; to about 3&#x2033;, and lengths ranging from about 6&#x2033; to about 12&#x2033;. Other dimensions can, of course, be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The diaphragms <b>606</b> and <b>608</b> are structural supports that connect the side panels <b>602</b> and <b>604</b>. The diaphragm <b>606</b> and the diaphragm <b>608</b> are connected via a hinge <b>616</b>. The hinge <b>616</b> is offset a distance from the point <b>614</b>, which allows the angle A to be varied without obstructing access to objects located at point <b>614</b>. The diaphragms <b>606</b> and <b>608</b> may freely pivot around the hinge <b>616</b>, subject to a hinge constraint <b>618</b>. In implementations, the hinge constraint <b>618</b> is received within a corresponding slot <b>620</b>. Motion of the workpiece tool <b>600</b> around the hinge is described in greater detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The hinge constraint <b>618</b> may be any mechanism that is capable of locking the hinge in place, thereby fixing the side panels at a specific angle. For example, in some implementations the hinge constraint <b>618</b> includes a nut and bolt placed through a slot <b>620</b> in each of the diaphragms <b>606</b> and <b>608</b>, capable of squeezing the diaphragms <b>606</b> and <b>608</b> together when the nut is tightened. In other implementations, the hinge constraint <b>618</b> may be included as a part of the hinge <b>616</b> itself. When the hinge constraint <b>618</b> is activated to lock the hinge in place, the side panels <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> are held at a particular angular alignment. In some implementations, the workpiece tool <b>600</b> may include markings or indicators that designate the angle created by a current position of the hinge <b>616</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The diaphragms <b>606</b> and <b>608</b> are generally centered with respect to the width of the side panels. However, due to the split diaphragm of the workpiece tool <b>600</b>, the diaphragms <b>606</b> and <b>608</b> occupy parallel adjacent planes and may cause a sideways displacement with respect to the width of the side panels. In some implementations, one or both of the diaphragms <b>606</b> and <b>608</b> are offset from center to compensate for this displacement and to maintain alignment of the side panels <b>602</b> and <b>604</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The diaphragms <b>606</b> and/or <b>608</b> may each include a plurality of cutouts <b>622</b>. Each of the cutouts <b>622</b> is partially bounded by one of the side panels <b>602</b> or <b>604</b>. The cutouts <b>622</b> are pass-through openings for fasteners or clamps, and increase the accessibility to and exposed area of the interior surface of each respective side panel. In this way, a clamp or fastener may easily be attached to or access portions of the interior surface along the full width of the respective side panel, without interference from the respective one of diaphragms <b>606</b> or <b>608</b>. In some implementations, the cutouts have a width ranging from about 1&#x2033; to about 2&#x2033; and lengths ranging from about 2&#x2033; to about 3&#x2033;. The size and shape of each respective cutout may be referred to by its footprint, e.g., a two-dimensional region as seen from a viewpoint perpendicular to the diaphragm <b>216</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The workpiece tool <b>600</b> further includes a master cutout <b>624</b>. The master cutout <b>624</b> is partially bounded by the diaphragms <b>606</b> and <b>608</b>, and is generally unbounded by the side panels <b>602</b> and <b>604</b>. The master cutout <b>624</b> is an opening that provides accessibility for joining workpieces displaced within or proximate to the master cutout <b>624</b>, as described in greater detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In implementations, the workpiece tool <b>600</b> is a made from a metal such as steel, iron, or aluminum, however any suitable substance may be utilized such as various metals, woods, plastics, and so forth. In implementations, each component including a side panel and a diaphragm (e.g. the side panel <b>602</b> and the diaphragm <b>606</b>, or the side panel <b>604</b> and the diaphragm <b>608</b>) is a single solid object created from CNC machining, however any suitable formation technique may be utilized such as 3D printing a single solid object, or by attaching multiple objects together such as by gluing, welding, fastening with screws, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts the workpiece tool <b>600</b>, depicted with solid lines in a first state <b>700</b>. As the diaphragm <b>606</b> rotates about the hinge <b>616</b>, the angle formed by the side panels changes. The diaphragm <b>606</b> may be rotated to alter the alignment of the side panels with respect to one another. Dashed lines depicting a second state <b>702</b> illustrate the diaphragm <b>606</b> having been rotated to increase the interior angle formed by the side panels. Since the hinge <b>616</b> is an offset hinge that is not located proximate either of the planes forming the angle, the side panels are parallel with a fixed displacement when the angle is 0-degrees. When the diaphragm <b>606</b> is rotated beyond 0-degrees, the angle is formed on the opposite side of the workpiece tool <b>600</b>, as depicted by dashed lines in a third state <b>704</b>. Thus, the workpiece tool <b>600</b> is capable of forming angles on the left side of the device (e.g., states <b>700</b> and <b>702</b>) such that the intersection of planes of the side panels occurs at a point located to the left of the hinge, and is also capable of forming angles on the right side of the device (e.g., state <b>704</b>) such that the intersection of planes of the side panels occurs at a point located to the right of the hinge. In some implementations, the workpiece tool <b>600</b> can form an interior angle that varies anywhere from about 100-degrees on the left side to about 100-degrees on the right side.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts an example scenario in which a workpiece tool <b>800</b> is modified to include various attachments <b>802</b>.

In this scenario, the attachments <b>802</b> are depicted as flat tabs. By attaching the tabs to the workpiece tool <b>800</b>, additional contact areas are created that provide additional or alternative planes with which to align workpieces. As an example, the workpiece tool <b>800</b> may be placed on a flat surface, forming a 90-degree angle between the flat surface and a side panel of the workpiece tool <b>800</b>.

The attachments <b>902</b> may, for instance, be affixed to the workpiece tool <b>900</b> by inserting a screw through the attachments <b>902</b> and into tapped holes located in the workpiece tool <b>900</b>. In this scenario, the attachments <b>902</b> are depicted as blocks with a &#x2018;V&#x2019; shaped notch. The notch in this example is centered with respect to the width of the side panels of the workpiece tool <b>900</b>, such that flat surfaces extend in equal but opposite directions from a central deepest point of the notch. By adding the blocks to the workpiece tool <b>900</b>, additional contact areas (e.g., contact areas <b>904</b>) are created that provide additional or alternative planes with which to align workpieces. For example, a cylindrical workpiece may be placed into the notches of one or more blocks, becoming aligned with the central point of the notch. In such an example, the addition of the attachments <b>902</b> allows a cylindrical workpiece (a shape that is generally difficult to align using conventional tools) to be quickly and easily aligned not only with the plane of a side panel of the workpiece tool <b>900</b>, but also with the plane of a diaphragm of the workpiece tool <b>900</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts an example scenario in which a workpiece tool <b>1000</b> is utilized to align two workpieces <b>1002</b> and <b>1004</b>.
