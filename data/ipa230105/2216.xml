RDL substrates can comprise one or more conductive redistribution layers and one or more dielectric layers that (a) can be formed layer by layer over an electronic device to which the RDL substrate is to be electrically coupled, or (b) can be formed layer by layer over a carrier that can be entirely removed or at least partially removed after the electronic device and the RDL substrate are coupled together. RDL substrates can be manufactured layer by layer as a wafer-level substrate on a round wafer in a wafer-level process, and/or as a panel-level substrate on a rectangular or square panel carrier in a panel-level process. RDL substrates can be formed in an additive buildup process that can include one or more dielectric layers alternatingly stacked with one or more conductive layers that define respective conductive redistribution patterns or traces configured to collectively (a) fan-out electrical traces outside the footprint of the electronic device, and/or (b) fan-in electrical traces within the footprint of the electronic device. The conductive patterns can be formed using a plating process such as, for example, an electroplating process or an electroless plating process. The conductive patterns can comprise an electrically conductive material such as, for example, copper or other plateable metal. The locations of the conductive patterns can be made using a photo-patterning process such as, for example, a photolithography process and a photoresist material to form a photolithographic mask. The dielectric layers of the RDL substrate can be patterned with a photo-patterning process, which can include a photolithographic mask through which light is exposed to photo-pattern desired features such as vias in the dielectric layers. Thus, the dielectric layers can be made from photo-definable organic dielectric materials such as, for example, polyimide (PI), benzocyclobutene (BCB), or polybenzoxazole (PBO). Such dielectric materials can be spun-on or otherwise coated in liquid form, rather than attached as a pre-formed film. To permit proper formation of desired photo-defined features, such photo-definable dielectric materials can omit structural reinforcers or can be filler-free, without strands, weaves, or other particles, that could interfere with the light from the photo-patterning process. In some examples, such filler-free characteristics of filler-free dielectric materials can permit a reduction of the thickness of the resulting dielectric layer. Although the photo-definable dielectric materials described above can be organic materials, in other examples the dielectric materials of the RDL substrates can comprise one or more inorganic dielectric layers. Some examples of inorganic dielectric layer(s) can comprise silicon nitride (Si3N4), silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), and/or SiON. The inorganic dielectric layer(s) can be formed by growing the inorganic dielectric layers using an oxidation or nitridization process instead using photo-defined organic dielectric materials. Such inorganic dielectric layers can be filler-fee, without strands, weaves, or other dissimilar inorganic particles. In some examples, the RDL substrates can omit a permanent core structure or carrier such as, for example, a dielectric material comprising bismaleimide triazine (BT) or FR4 and these types of RDL substrates can be referred to as a coreless substrate. Substrates in other examples of this disclosure can also comprise an RDL substrate.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In other examples, substrate <b>210</b> can be a pre-formed substrate. The pre-formed substrate can be manufactured prior to attachment to an electronic device and can comprise dielectric layers between respective conductive layers. The conductive layers can comprise copper and can be formed using an electroplating process. The dielectric layers can be relatively thicker non-photo-definable layers that can be attached as a pre-formed film rather than as a liquid and can include a resin with fillers such as strands, weaves, and/or other inorganic particles for rigidity and/or structural support. Since the dielectric layers are non-photo-definable, features such as vias or openings can be formed by using a drill or laser. In some examples, the dielectric layers can comprise a prepreg material or Ajinomoto Buildup Film (ABF). The pre-formed substrate can include a permanent core structure or carrier such as, for example, a dielectric material comprising bismaleimide triazine (BT) or FR4, and dielectric and conductive layers can be formed on the permanent core structure. In other examples, the pre-formed substrate can be a coreless substrate which omits the permanent core structure, and the dielectric and conductive layers can be formed on a sacrificial carrier that is removed after formation of the dielectric and conductive layers and before attachment to the electronic device. The pre-formed substrate can referred to as a printed circuit board (PCB) or a laminate substrate. Such pre-formed substrate can be formed through a semi-additive or modified-semi-additive process.
