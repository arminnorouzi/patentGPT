Note that the disclosure is mere an example, and it is a matter of course that any alteration that is easily made by a person skilled in the art while keeping a gist of the present invention is included in the range of the present invention. In addition, the drawings schematically illustrate a width, a thickness, a shape, and the like of each portion as compared to actual aspects in order to make the description clearer, but the drawings are mere examples and do not limit the interpretation of the present invention. Further, the same or related reference characters are applied to the same elements as those described in relation to the foregoing drawings in the present specification and the respective drawings, and detailed descriptions thereof will be appropriately omitted in some cases.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the following embodiment, a liquid crystal display device having a liquid crystal layer which is an electro-optical layer will be described as an example of a display device. However, the technology described below can be applied to various modifications in addition to the liquid crystal display device. For example, in addition to the liquid crystal layer, any layer such as an organic light-emitting element layer, an inorganic light-emitting element layer including micro LEDs, a MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) shutter, an electrophoretic element layer, or the like may be applied as the electro-optical layer as long as it includes an element whose optical properties are changed by applying electric energy.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, the liquid crystal display device is roughly classified into the following two types according to the application direction of an electric field for changing the orientation of liquid crystal molecules of a liquid crystal layer. Namely, as a first classification, the so-called longitudinal electric field mode in which an electric field is applied in the thickness direction of the display device (or out-of-plane direction) can be presented. The longitudinal electric field mode includes, for example, a TN (Twisted Nematic) mode and a VA (Vertical Alignment) mode. Also, as a second classification, the so-called transverse electric field mode in which an electric field is applied in the planar direction of the display device (or in-plane direction) can be presented. The transverse electric field mode includes, for example, an IPS (In-Plane Switching) mode and an FFS (Fringe Field Switching) mode which is one of the IPS modes. The technology described below can be applied to both the longitudinal electric field mode and the transverse electric field mode, but a display device of the transverse electric field mode will be described as an example in the embodiment described below.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">&#x3c;Configuration of Display Device&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">First, a configuration of a display device will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a plan view of a display surface side showing an example of a display device according to an embodiment.
