More specifically, the present technology relates to substrate handling systems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Semiconductor processing systems often utilize cluster tools to integrate a number of process chambers together. This configuration may facilitate the performance of several sequential processing operations without removing the substrate from a controlled processing environment, or it may allow a similar process to be performed on multiple substrates at once in the varying chambers. These chambers may include, for example, degas chambers, pretreatment chambers, transfer chambers, chemical vapor deposition chambers, physical vapor deposition chambers, etch chambers, metrology chambers, and other chambers. The combination of chambers in a cluster tool, as well as the operating conditions and parameters under which these chambers are run, are selected to fabricate specific structures using particular process recipes and process flows.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cluster tools often process a number of substrates by continuously passing substrates through a series of chambers and process operations. The process recipes and sequences will typically be programmed into a microprocessor controller that will direct, control, and monitor the processing of each substrate through the cluster tool. Once an entire cassette of wafers has been successfully processed through the cluster tool, the cassette may be passed to yet another cluster tool or stand-alone tool, such as a chemical mechanical polisher, for further processing.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Robots are typically used to transfer the wafers through the various processing and holding chambers. The amount of time required for each process and handling operation has a direct impact on the throughput of substrates per unit of time. Substrate throughput in a cluster tool may be directly related to the speed of the substrate handling robot positioned in a transfer chamber. As processing chamber configurations are further developed, conventional wafer transfer systems may be inadequate.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, there is need for improved systems and methods that can be used to efficiently direct substrates within cluster tool environments. These and other needs are addressed by the present technology.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Exemplary substrate processing systems may include a transfer region housing defining a transfer region fluidly coupled with a plurality of processing regions.

Efficient movement of the substrate may reduce queue times and improve substrate throughput. To improve the number of substrates processed within a cluster tool, additional chambers may be incorporated onto the mainframe. Although transfer robots and processing chambers can be continually added by lengthening the tool, this may become space inefficient as the footprint of the cluster tool scales. Accordingly, the present technology may include cluster tools with an increased number of processing chambers within a defined footprint. To accommodate the limited footprint about transfer robots, the present technology may increase the number of processing chambers laterally outward from the robot. For example, some conventional cluster tools may include one or two processing chambers positioned about sections of a centrally located transfer robot to maximize the number of chambers radially about the robot. The present technology may expand on this concept by incorporating additional chambers laterally outward as another row or group of chambers. For example, the present technology may be applied with cluster tools including three, four, five, six, or more processing chambers accessible at each of one or more robot access positions.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">However, as additional process locations are added, accessing these locations from a central robot may no longer be feasible without additional transfer capabilities at each location. Some conventional technologies may include wafer carriers on which the substrates remain seated during transition. However, wafer carriers may contribute to thermal non-uniformity and particle contamination on substrates. The present technology overcomes these issues by incorporating a transfer section vertically aligned with processing chamber regions and a carousel or transfer apparatus that may operate in concert with a central robot to access additional wafer positions. The present technology may not use conventional wafer carriers in some embodiments, and may transfer specific wafers from one substrate support to a different substrate support within the transfer region. Although the remaining disclosure will routinely identify specific structures, such as four-position transfer regions, for which the present structures and methods may be employed, it will be readily understood that the systems and methods are equally applicable to any number of structures and devices that may benefit from the transfer capabilities explained. Accordingly, the technology should not be considered to be so limited as for use with any particular structures alone. Moreover, although an exemplary tool system will be described to provide foundation for the present technology, it is to be understood that the present technology can be incorporated with any number of semiconductor processing chambers and tools that may benefit from some or all of the operations and systems to be described.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a top plan view of one embodiment of a substrate processing tool or processing system <b>100</b> of deposition, etching, baking, and curing chambers according to some embodiments of the present technology. In the figure, a set of front-opening unified pods <b>102</b> supply substrates of a variety of sizes that are received within a factory interface <b>103</b> by robotic arms <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>and placed into a load lock or low pressure holding area <b>106</b> before being delivered to one of the substrate processing regions <b>108</b>, positioned in chamber systems or quad sections <b>109</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, which may each be a substrate processing system having a transfer region fluidly coupled with a plurality of processing regions <b>108</b>. Although a quad system is illustrated, it is to be understood that platforms incorporating standalone chambers, twin chambers, and other multiple chamber systems are equally encompassed by the present technology. A second robotic arm <b>110</b> housed in a transfer chamber <b>112</b> may be used to transport the substrate wafers from the holding area <b>106</b> to the quad sections <b>109</b> and back, and second robotic arm <b>110</b> may be housed in a transfer chamber with which each of the quad sections or processing systems may be connected. Each substrate processing region <b>108</b> can be outfitted to perform a number of substrate processing operations including any number of deposition processes including cyclical layer deposition, atomic layer deposition, chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, as well as etch, pre-clean, anneal, plasma processing, degas, orientation, and other substrate processes.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each quad section <b>109</b> may include a transfer region that may receive substrates from, and deliver substrates to, second robotic arm <b>110</b>. The transfer region of the chamber system may be aligned with the transfer chamber having the second robotic arm <b>110</b>. In some embodiments the transfer region may be laterally accessible to the robot. In subsequent operations, components of the transfer sections may vertically translate the substrates into the overlying processing regions <b>108</b>. Similarly, the transfer regions may also be operable to rotate substrates between positions within each transfer region. The substrate processing regions <b>108</b> may include any number of system components for depositing, annealing, curing and/or etching a material film on the substrate or wafer. In one configuration, two sets of the processing regions, such as the processing regions in quad section <b>109</b><i>a </i>and <b>109</b><i>b</i>, may be used to deposit material on the substrate, and the third set of processing chambers, such as the processing chambers or regions in quad section <b>109</b><i>c</i>, may be used to cure, anneal, or treat the deposited films. In another configuration, all three sets of chambers, such as all twelve chambers illustrated, may be configured to both deposit and/or cure a film on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As illustrated in the figure, second robotic arm <b>110</b> may include two arms for delivering and/or retrieving multiple substrates simultaneously. For example, each quad section <b>109</b> may include two accesses <b>107</b> along a surface of a housing of the transfer region, which may be laterally aligned with the second robotic arm. The accesses may be defined along a surface adjacent the transfer chamber <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, such as illustrated, the first access may be aligned with a first substrate support of the plurality of substrate supports of a quad section. Additionally, the second access may be aligned with a second substrate support of the plurality of substrate supports of the quad section. The first substrate support may be adjacent to the second substrate support, and the two substrate supports may define a first row of substrate supports in some embodiments. As shown in the illustrated configuration, a second row of substrate supports may be positioned behind the first row of substrate supports laterally outward from the transfer chamber <b>112</b>. The two arms of the second robotic arm <b>110</b> may be spaced to allow the two arms to simultaneously enter a quad section or chamber system to deliver or retrieve one or two substrates to substrate supports within the transfer region.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Any one or more of the transfer regions described may be incorporated with additional chambers separated from the fabrication system shown in different embodiments. It will be appreciated that additional configurations of deposition, etching, annealing, and curing chambers for material films are contemplated by processing system <b>100</b>. Additionally, any number of other processing systems may be utilized with the present technology, which may incorporate transfer systems for performing any of the specific operations, such as the substrate movement. In some embodiments, processing systems that may provide access to multiple processing chamber regions while maintaining a vacuum environment in various sections, such as the noted holding and transfer areas, may allow operations to be performed in multiple chambers while maintaining a particular vacuum environment between discrete processes.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows a schematic cross-sectional elevation view of one embodiment of an exemplary processing tool, such as through a chamber system, according to some embodiments of the present technology. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> may illustrate a cross-sectional view through any two adjacent processing regions <b>108</b> in any quad section <b>109</b>, such as illustrated through like A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. The elevation view may illustrate the configuration or fluid coupling of one or more processing regions <b>108</b> with a transfer region <b>120</b>. For example, a continuous transfer region <b>120</b> may be defined by a transfer region housing <b>125</b>. The housing may define an open interior volume in which a number of substrate supports <b>130</b> may be disposed. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, exemplary processing systems may include four or more, including a plurality of substrate supports <b>130</b> distributed within the housing about the transfer region. The substrate supports may be pedestals as illustrated, although a number of other configurations may also be used. In some embodiments the pedestals may be vertically translatable between the transfer region <b>120</b> and the processing regions overlying the transfer region. The substrate supports may be vertically translatable along a central axis of the substrate support along a path between a first position and a second position within the chamber system. Accordingly, in some embodiments each substrate support <b>130</b> may be axially aligned with an overlying processing region <b>108</b> defined by one or more chamber components.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The open transfer region may afford the ability of a transfer apparatus <b>135</b>, such as a carousel, to engage and move substrates, such as rotationally, between the various substrate supports. The transfer apparatus <b>135</b> may be rotatable about a central axis. This may allow substrates to be positioned for processing within any of the processing regions <b>108</b> within the processing system. The transfer apparatus <b>135</b> may include one or more end effectors that may engage substrates from above, below, or may engage exterior edges of the substrates for movement about the substrate supports. The transfer apparatus may receive substrates from a transfer chamber robot, such as robot <b>110</b> described previously. The transfer apparatus may then rotate substrates to alternate substrate supports to facilitate delivery of additional substrates.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Once positioned and awaiting processing, the transfer apparatus may position the end effectors or arms between substrate supports, which may allow the substrate supports to be raised past the transfer apparatus <b>135</b> and deliver the substrates into the processing regions <b>108</b>, which may be vertically offset from the transfer region. For example, and as illustrated, substrate support <b>130</b><i>a </i>may deliver a substrate into processing region <b>108</b><i>a</i>, while substrate support <b>130</b><i>b </i>may deliver a substrate into processing region <b>108</b><i>b</i>. This may occur with the other two substrate supports and processing regions, as well as with additional substrate supports and processing regions in embodiments for which additional processing regions are included. In this configuration, the substrate supports may at least partially define a processing region <b>108</b> from below when operationally engaged for processing substrates, such as in the second position, and the processing regions may be axially aligned with an associated substrate support. The processing regions may be defined from above by a faceplate <b>140</b>, as well as other lid stack components. In some embodiments, each processing region may have individual lid stack components, although in some embodiments components may accommodate multiple processing regions <b>108</b>. Based on this configuration, in some embodiments each processing region <b>108</b> may be fluidly coupled with the transfer region, while being fluidly isolated from above from each other processing region within the chamber system or quad section.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments the faceplate <b>140</b> may operate as an electrode of the system for producing a local plasma within the processing region <b>108</b>. As illustrated, each processing region may utilize or incorporate a separate faceplate. For example, faceplate <b>140</b><i>a </i>may be included to define from above processing region <b>108</b><i>a</i>, and faceplate <b>140</b><i>b </i>may be included to define from above processing region <b>108</b><i>b</i>. In some embodiments the substrate support may operate as the companion electrode for generating a capacitively-coupled plasma between the faceplate and the substrate support. A pumping liner <b>145</b> may at least partially define the processing region <b>108</b> radially, or laterally depending on the volume geometry. Again, separate pumping liners may be utilized for each processing region. For example, pumping liner <b>145</b><i>a </i>may at least partially radially define processing region <b>108</b><i>a</i>, and pumping liner <b>145</b><i>b </i>may at least partially radially define processing region <b>108</b><i>b</i>. A blocker plate <b>150</b> may be positioned between a lid <b>155</b> and the faceplate <b>140</b> in embodiments, and again separate blocker plates may be included to facilitate fluid distribution within each processing region. For example, blocker plate <b>150</b><i>a </i>may be included for distribution towards processing region <b>108</b><i>a</i>, and blocker plate <b>150</b><i>b </i>may be included for distribution towards processing region <b>108</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Lid <b>155</b> may be a separate component for each processing region, or may include one or more common aspects. In some embodiments, such as illustrated, lid <b>155</b> may be a single component defining multiple apertures <b>160</b> for fluid delivery to individual processing regions. For example, lid <b>155</b> may define a first aperture <b>160</b><i>a </i>for fluid delivery to processing region <b>108</b><i>a</i>, and lid <b>155</b> may define a second aperture <b>160</b><i>b </i>for fluid delivery to processing region <b>108</b><i>b</i>. Additional apertures may be defined for additional processing regions within each section when included. In some embodiments, each quad section <b>109</b>&#x2014;or multi-processing-region section that may accommodate more or less than four substrates, may include one or more remote plasma units <b>165</b> for delivering plasma effluents into the processing chamber. In some embodiments individual plasma units may be incorporated for each chamber processing region, although in some embodiments fewer remote plasma units may be used. For example, as illustrated a single remote plasma unit <b>165</b> may be used for multiple chambers, such as two, three, four, or more chambers up to all chambers for a particular quad section. Piping may extend from the remote plasma unit <b>165</b> to each aperture <b>160</b> for delivery of plasma effluents for processing or cleaning in embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As noted, processing system <b>100</b>, or more specifically quad sections or chamber systems incorporated with system <b>100</b> or other processing systems, may include transfer sections positioned below the processing chamber regions illustrated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic isometric view of a transfer section of an exemplary substrate processing system <b>200</b> according to some embodiments of the present technology. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may illustrate additional aspects or variations of aspects of the transfer region <b>120</b> described above, and may include any of the components or characteristics described. The system illustrated may include a transfer region housing <b>205</b> defining a transfer region in which a number of components may be included. The transfer region may additionally be at least partially defined from above by processing chambers or processing regions fluidly coupled with the transfer region, such as processing chamber regions illustrated in quad sections <b>109</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. A sidewall of the transfer region housing may define one or more access locations <b>207</b> through which substrates may be delivered and retrieved, such as by second robotic arm <b>110</b> as discussed above. Access locations <b>207</b> may be slit valves or other sealable access positions, which include doors or other sealing mechanisms to provide a hermetic environment within transfer region housing <b>205</b> in some embodiments. Although illustrated with two such access locations <b>207</b>, it is to be understood that in some embodiments only a single access location <b>207</b> may be included, as well as access locations on multiple sides of the transfer region housing. It is also to be understood that transfer section <b>200</b> may be sized to accommodate any substrate size, including 200 mm, 300 mm, 450 mm, or larger or smaller substrates, including substrates characterized by any number of geometries or shapes.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Within transfer region housing <b>205</b> may be a plurality of substrate supports <b>210</b> positioned about the transfer region volume. Although four substrate supports are illustrated, it is to be understood that any number of substrate supports are similarly encompassed by embodiments of the present technology. For example, greater than or about three, four, five, six, eight, or more substrate supports <b>210</b> may be accommodated in transfer regions according to embodiments of the present technology. Second robotic arm <b>110</b> may deliver a substrate to either or both of substrate supports <b>210</b><i>a </i>or <b>210</b><i>b </i>through the accesses <b>207</b>. Similarly, second robotic arm <b>110</b> may retrieve substrates from these locations. Lift pins <b>212</b> may protrude from the substrate supports <b>210</b>, and may allow the robot to access beneath the substrates. The lift pins may be fixed on the substrate supports, or at a location where the substrate supports may recess below, or the lift pins may additionally be raised or lowered through the substrate supports in some embodiments. Substrate supports <b>210</b> may be vertically translatable, and in some embodiments may extend up to processing chamber regions of the substrate processing systems, such as processing chamber regions <b>108</b>, positioned above the transfer region housing <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The transfer region housing <b>205</b> may provide access for alignment systems <b>215</b>, which may include an aligner that can extend through an aperture of the transfer region housing as illustrated and may operate in conjunction with a laser, camera, or other monitoring device protruding or transmitting through an adjacent aperture, and that may determine whether a substrate being translated is properly aligned. Transfer region housing <b>205</b> may also include a transfer apparatus <b>220</b> that may be operated in a number of ways to position substrates and move substrates between the various substrate supports. Although exemplary operations will be described below, in one example, transfer apparatus <b>220</b> may move substrates on substrate supports <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b </i>to substrate supports <b>210</b><i>c </i>and <b>210</b><i>d</i>, which may allow additional substrates to be delivered into the transfer chamber.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Transfer apparatus <b>220</b> may include a central hub <b>225</b> that may include one or more shafts extending into the transfer chamber. The transfer apparatus may additionally include an eccentric hub <b>230</b> extending at least partially through the central hub <b>225</b>. The eccentric hub may be radially offset from a central axis through the central hub, and may be independently rotatable from the central hub. These separate rotations, and offset of the eccentric hub <b>230</b>, may facilitate multiple aspects of translation including rotational and lateral as will be explained further below. Coupled with the eccentric hub <b>230</b> may be an end effector <b>235</b>. End effector <b>235</b> may include a plurality of arms <b>237</b> extending radially or laterally outward from the central or eccentric hub. Although illustrated with a central body from which the arms extend, the end effector may additionally include separate arms that are each coupled with the eccentric hub <b>230</b>. Any number of arms may be included in embodiments of the present technology. In some embodiments a number of arms <b>237</b> may be similar or equal to the number of substrate supports <b>210</b> included in the chamber. Hence, as illustrated, for four substrate supports, transfer apparatus <b>220</b> may include four arms extending from the end effector. The arms may be characterized by any number of shapes and profiles, such as straight profiles or arcuate profiles, as well as including any number of distal profiles including hooks, rings, forks, or other designs for supporting a substrate and/or providing access to a substrate.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The end effector <b>235</b> may additionally include a plurality of end pieces <b>240</b>, as will be described further below, and may be configured to support a substrate. The end pieces <b>240</b> may be coupled with arms of the plurality of arms <b>237</b>. Any number of end pieces may be included with each arm of the end effector, such as two, three, four, or more end pieces, and which may be positioned on or coupled with the arms to allow the arms of the end effector to swing below or above substrates without contacting them, and then seat a substrate for movement within the transfer region. The end pieces will be described in more detail below, and may be used to contact substrates during transfer or movement. The end pieces as well as the end effector may be made from or include a number of materials including conductive and/or insulative materials. The materials may be coated or plated in some embodiments to withstand contact with precursors or other chemicals that may pass into the transfer chamber from an overlying processing chamber.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Additionally, the materials may be provided or selected to withstand other environmental characteristics, such as temperature. In some embodiments, the substrate supports may be operable to heat a substrate disposed on the support. The substrate supports may be configured to increase a surface or substrate temperature to temperatures greater than or about 100&#xb0; C., greater than or about 200&#xb0; C., greater than or about 300&#xb0; C., greater than or about 400&#xb0; C., greater than or about 500&#xb0; C., greater than or about 600&#xb0; C., greater than or about 700&#xb0; C., greater than or about 800&#xb0; C., or higher. Any of these temperatures may be maintained during operations, and thus components of the transfer apparatus <b>220</b> may be exposed to any of these stated or encompassed temperatures. Consequently, in some embodiments any of the materials may be selected to accommodate these temperature regimes, and may include materials such as ceramics and metals that may be characterized by relatively low coefficients of thermal expansion, or other beneficial characteristics. Component couplings may also be adapted for operation in high temperature and/or corrosive environments. For example, where end effectors and end pieces are each ceramic, the coupling may include press fittings, snap fittings, or other fittings that may not include additional materials, such as bolts, which may expand and contract with temperature, and may cause cracking in the ceramics. In some embodiments the end pieces may be continuous with the end effectors, and may be monolithically formed with the end effectors. Any number of other materials may be utilized that may facilitate operation or resistance during operation, and are similarly encompassed by the present technology.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A floor of the transfer region housing <b>205</b> may additionally define a space <b>250</b> within which the end effector may be recessed when not in use. As illustrated, space <b>250</b> may be defined between substrate supports, and may be shaped to define a profile of the end effector <b>235</b> or components of the end effector. For example, recesses may be defined within the space to accept end pieces, which may extend below arms <b>237</b> of the end effector <b>235</b>. Additionally, space <b>250</b> may extend about alignment system <b>215</b> in some embodiments, which may allow the end effector <b>235</b> to be used to cover components of the alignment system in some embodiments, such as during substrate processing, which may protect the aligner and other alignment components from processing effluents within the processing system.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The transfer apparatus <b>220</b> may include a number of components and configurations that may facilitate the movement of the end effector and/or eccentric hub independently from the central hub as will be described further below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows a schematic cross-sectional view of an exemplary transfer apparatus <b>220</b> according to some embodiments of the present technology, although it is to be understood that any other configurations affording the independent rotational movement to be described are similarly encompassed by the present technology.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Central hub <b>225</b> may include a first shaft <b>310</b> and a second shaft <b>320</b>, which may be axially aligned with first shaft <b>310</b> in some embodiments. For example, first shaft <b>310</b> and second shaft <b>320</b> may be concentric about a central axis extending vertically through the central hub. In some embodiments first shaft <b>310</b> may extend through second shaft <b>320</b>, or aspects of second shaft <b>320</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, first shaft <b>310</b> and second shaft <b>320</b> may be coaxial, although the two shafts may be coupled with separate motor or drive systems. As illustrated, first shaft <b>310</b> may be coupled with a first drive system <b>312</b>, which may include a motor, and which may allow rotation about the central axis. This rotation may rotate linkages <b>330</b> in a first direction, or in a second direction opposite the first, the movement of which may rotate eccentric hub <b>230</b> in a first direction about a central axis through the eccentric hub, or in a second direction opposite the first. Similarly, second shaft <b>320</b> may be coupled with a second drive system <b>314</b>, which may independently allow rotation of central hub <b>225</b> in a first direction or a second direction about the central axis.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As will be described further below, eccentric hub <b>230</b> may be rotatable about the central axis of central hub <b>225</b>, which may be operated through controlled rotation of the first shaft and the second shaft to produce linear motion or substantially linear motion of the end effector <b>235</b>. In some embodiments a vertical translation drive <b>325</b> may be included, which may allow the transfer apparatus to be vertically translated along the central axis. This may facilitate lifting substrates from substrate supports or lift pins in some embodiments, although in some embodiments the lift pins and/or substrate supports may be used to raise and lower substrates, and transfer apparatus <b>220</b> may not include a vertical drive mechanism.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The eccentric hub may be disposed at least partially within the central hub <b>225</b>, and may extend through the central hub <b>225</b> housing to couple with end effector <b>235</b>, or may include an extension post or linkage to couple with end effector <b>235</b>. Eccentric hub <b>230</b> may be at least partially decoupled from central hub <b>225</b>, which may facilitate rotation of the eccentric hub independently from rotation of central hub <b>225</b>. The eccentric hub <b>230</b> may be coupled directly or indirectly with first shaft <b>310</b> of the central hub, and which may allow rotation of the eccentric hub <b>230</b> when first shaft <b>310</b> is rotated. Eccentric hub <b>230</b> may be positioned offset from the central axis of the central hub, and may be radially offset from the central axis. The eccentric hub may be characterized by a corresponding eccentric hub axis extending through the eccentric hub <b>230</b> and defining an axis of rotation for an the eccentric hub as well as the end effector in some embodiments. Additionally, end effector <b>235</b> may be centrally coupled with eccentric hub <b>230</b>, or a central axis of the end effector may be offset from a central axis through the eccentric hub. For example, end effector <b>235</b> may be axially aligned with a central axis of central hub <b>225</b>, or may be offset from each of the central hub and the eccentric hub. These offsets may affect an outer radius of a sweep path of the end effector in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As previously noted, eccentric hub <b>230</b> may not be directly coupled with central hub <b>225</b>, or may be rotatably coupled through the housing, which may facilitate independent rotation between the eccentric hub and the central hub, and which may produce multiple rotational aspects for the transfer apparatus <b>220</b>, which may cooperate to provide lateral movement in addition to rotational movement. First shaft <b>310</b> may extend within the central hub <b>225</b>, and may provide an amount of access for coupling linkages <b>330</b> about the first shaft. As shown, the linkages may couple the eccentric hub <b>230</b> with the first shaft <b>310</b> within the central hub housing. Consequently, when the first shaft <b>310</b> is rotated by first drive system <b>312</b>, the linkages coupling the shaft with the eccentric hub may cause the hub to similarly rotate about an eccentric axis offset radially from the central axis of the transfer apparatus or central hub as noted above. As the eccentric hub rotates with rotation of first shaft <b>310</b>, end effector <b>235</b> may also rotate in a direction corresponding to or associated with a direction of rotation of the first shaft <b>310</b> and/or eccentric hub <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B-<b>3</b>F</figref> show schematic top plan views of exemplary components of transfer apparatus <b>220</b> according to some embodiments of the present technology.

First shaft <b>310</b> may extend within central hub <b>225</b>, and may be coupled with eccentric hub <b>230</b> as previously described. Linkage <b>330</b><i>a </i>is illustrated in one embodiment in which one or more belt couplings may be used and may extend about eccentric hub <b>230</b> as well as first shaft <b>310</b> in a number of ways.

For example, first shaft <b>310</b> may define a number of gear teeth along a region extending within central hub <b>225</b>. The gear teeth may be interconnected with teeth of a linkage gear <b>330</b><i>b</i>, such as a pinion gear, which may be connected with or may extend about eccentric hub <b>230</b> of the transfer apparatus. Additional gears may also be incorporated in any number of configurations to facilitate rotation of the eccentric hub from rotation of the first shaft <b>310</b>.

First shaft <b>310</b> may be characterized by a half pulley at a distal end of the first shaft proximate the end effector <b>235</b>. The half pulley may be coupled with a half pulley <b>330</b><i>d </i>of the eccentric hub <b>230</b>.

Second shaft <b>320</b> may include an enlarged opening through which first shaft <b>310</b> may extend, and within which first shaft <b>310</b> may radially lean, which may provide linear extension of end effector <b>235</b>. By positioning flexible drive <b>456</b> along a length of first shaft <b>310</b>, the further away from the end effector at an opposite end of the first shaft may be located, the less distance flexible drive <b>456</b> may drive first shaft <b>310</b> to provide an increased linear translation of substrates in an eccentric fashion. For example, were flexible drive <b>456</b> located proximate end effector <b>235</b>, driving or bending first shaft <b>310</b> would only marginally translate the end effector, such as slightly more than a 1:1 ratio. However, when flexible drive <b>456</b> is located further from end effector <b>235</b> as shown, a relatively small offset bend may produce greater than or about two times the distance movement from the central axis of the end of first shaft <b>310</b> with which end effector <b>235</b> may be coupled, and may produce greater than or about three times the distance of movement, greater than or about four times the distance of movement, greater than or about five times the distance of movement, greater than or about six times the distance of movement, greater than or about seven times the distance of movement, greater than or about eight times the distance of movement, greater than or about nine times the distance of movement, greater than or about ten times the distance of movement, or more.

Accordingly, in some embodiments, arms <b>454</b> may maintain a substrate seated on or with end effector <b>235</b> substantially parallel to a surface of a substrate support, and may reduce or limit an amount of tilt during lateral adjustment of the substrate position.

The figure may show a configuration of the present technology subsequent initial operations of method <b>500</b>, which may include receiving a substrate at a first substrate support <b>610</b><i>a </i>at operation <b>505</b>, such as through an access with a robot from a transfer chamber as previously described. The robot may deliver one or two, or more, substrates into the transfer region housing <b>605</b> onto the substrate supports proximate the accesses or slit valves. Transfer apparatus <b>620</b> may rotate the substrate or substrates to the opposite substrate supports, and additional substrates may be delivered. It is to be understood that the same process can be performed with any number of substrates, including delivery of one substrate at a time into the processing chamber as illustrated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> may illustrate after a substrate has been positioned within the transfer chamber, and the transfer apparatus <b>620</b> may be positioned over substrate <b>601</b> to receive the substrate for transfer to a second substrate support.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">A transfer process may involve rotating the transfer apparatus in a number of ways. Method <b>500</b> may include engaging the substrates <b>601</b> at operation <b>510</b>. The engagement may occur simultaneously or individually until one or more substrates have been transferred from substrate supports <b>610</b>, including lift pins <b>612</b> of the substrate supports, to arms <b>637</b> of transfer apparatus <b>620</b>. Depending on the transfer apparatus having vertical movement capabilities or not, the engagement and movement may or may not include raising or lowering one or both of the substrates or the transfer apparatus. Once the substrates have been engaged by the transfer apparatus, a complete transfer of the substrate or substrates may be made between the substrate supports and the transfer apparatus. For example, in some embodiments the transfer apparatus may lift the substrates from the substrate supports or lift pins on which the substrates may be seated. This may be performed by vertically translating the transfer apparatus, for example. In some embodiments, the substrate supports may recess away from the substrate or substrates to complete the transfer.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The engagement of the substrate may occur as a passive engagement in some embodiments of the present technology, in which transfer apparatus <b>620</b> may provide a shelf on which substrate <b>601</b> may be seated. For example, and as noted previously, each arm <b>637</b> of an end effector <b>635</b> on transfer apparatus <b>620</b> may include a number of end pieces coupled with the end effector, and which may include one or more first end pieces <b>640</b>, and one or more second end pieces <b>642</b>. The end pieces may be positioned across from one another to maintain a distance across the arms <b>637</b> that are free of any extensions or end pieces, and which may facilitate a sweep of the arm across a substrate in either direction to position end pieces proximate the substrate, and facilitate a transfer of the substrate from the substrate support or lift pins to the transfer apparatus.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> shows an illustration of engagement as may be performed by the present technology. As illustrated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, an arm <b>637</b> of transfer apparatus <b>620</b> may sweep across a substrate <b>601</b> positioned on lift pins <b>612</b>. End pieces <b>640</b>, <b>642</b> may be aligned across the substrate to engage the substrate, which may then be lowered on the end pieces for transfer. Alternatively or concurrently, the end pieces <b>640</b>, <b>642</b> may be raised to engage the substrate and lift it from the substrate support or lift pins. Staggering of the lift pins as will be described below may be used to allow individual engagement and delivery of substrates when multiple substrates are being transferred in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown, a first end piece <b>640</b> may be coupled with the arm <b>637</b> at a distal end from the central hub, and which may be facing back towards the central hub. Additionally, one or more second end pieces <b>642</b> may be coupled with the arm <b>637</b> and may be facing away from the central hub, or towards the first end piece. The second end pieces <b>642</b> may be positioned along the arm a distance from the first end piece <b>640</b> greater than a diameter of a substrate to be engaged. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, a support surface is provided, on which the substrate may be seated. Each of the first end piece <b>640</b> and the second end piece <b>642</b> may define a recessed ledge including a shelf portion extending towards the substrate to be supported. First end piece <b>640</b> may define shelf <b>641</b> extending towards the associated second end piece <b>642</b>, and second end piece <b>642</b> may define shelf <b>643</b> extending towards the associated first end piece <b>640</b>. Together, the shelves may produce a wafer support surface about two or more exterior or radial edges of substrate <b>601</b>. Although in some embodiments the first end piece and the second end piece may be different components, or may extend for longer arcuate sections, the first end piece and the second end piece may extend vertically to a similar horizontal plane through the central axis of the central hub to produce a substantially planar surface for substrate support. Additionally, each of the end pieces may be characterized by an arcuate profile as illustrated, which may accommodate an arcuate edge of a substrate in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">After the transfer is complete to the transfer apparatus <b>620</b>, the substrates may be rotated between the substrate supports for further processing in different processing regions, or to deliver the substrates to substrate supports accessible by a transfer robot, such as second robotic arm <b>110</b> described above. Translation of the substrate or substrates may occur by causing one or more rotations of the first shaft and the second shaft, which may cause rotation of the arms and the housing as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Transfer apparatus <b>620</b> may facilitate both rotational translation of a substrate as well as substantially linear or lateral translation of a substrate by operating rotation of the central hub and eccentric hub in one or more ways. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>, the central hub <b>625</b> and eccentric hub <b>630</b> may be co-rotated in either direction at a fixed rotation ratio, which may rotate the end effector <b>635</b> and any engaged substrate. This may occur by rotating both the second shaft at operation <b>515</b> and the first shaft at operation <b>520</b> together in a fixed ratio of rotation, or by rotating the second shaft and locking the first shaft with the second shaft, which may also rotate the first shaft in the same direction as the second shaft, and may radially reposition the substrate <b>601</b> about a central axis within the transfer region of the chamber at operation <b>525</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Additionally, operations <b>515</b>-<b>525</b> may include lateral adjustments to the substrate to reposition the substrate to improve centering of the substrate on the substrate support. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>, when the first shaft with which eccentric hub <b>630</b> is coupled is further rotated, such as at a faster speed than the second shaft with which the central hub <b>625</b> is coupled, the eccentric hub may be rotated about the central axis of the central hub <b>625</b>, which may laterally adjust the position of the substrate <b>601</b>. The eccentric hub may be further rotated in the first direction or counter-rotated relative to the central hub in the second direction opposite a first direction of rotation of the central hub. When the rotation of the eccentric hub, which may be coupled with the end effector, is coordinated with a correctional rotation, such as a minor rotation relative to the rotation of the eccentric hub, a substantially linear translation of the substrate along a radius from the central axis of the central hub may be performed as illustrated. The linear translation, when used in conjunction with the rotational translation, may allow both movement between substrate supports for the multiple substrates, as well as centering of the substrate on the substrate supports. When staggered lift pins are incorporated with the system as described further below, each substrate may be individually centered prior to delivery on the substrate support.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As previously noted, substrate handling systems according to embodiments of the present technology may have monitoring and alignment systems, including an alignment hub <b>650</b> positioned between each pair of substrate supports, as illustrated in the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E</figref>, such as illustrated through line A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>. Additional access ports <b>652</b>, <b>654</b> may allow a camera or laser to impinge on the substrate to identify misalignment, which could be based on a notch or other identifier on the substrate. As illustrated in the figure, one or more recesses as previously described may be defined in a floor of the housing of the transfer region <b>605</b>. For example, recess <b>606</b> may be defined in the floor, which may accommodate a first end piece <b>640</b>. Accordingly, transfer apparatus <b>620</b> may be recessed over the alignment system and recessed within the transfer chamber housing, while the substrates are being processed, such as in overlying processing regions. In some embodiments, the alignment hub <b>650</b> may not fully recess within the transfer region housing, and thus each arm of the transfer apparatus may include an aperture through the arm and a cap or protrusion over the aperture, which may accommodate the alignment hub to limit or prevent contact between the components.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments an optional alignment operation may be performed on each of the substrates at optional operation <b>530</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>F</figref>, which may be a cross-sectional view take through line A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the substrate may be transferred to alignment hub <b>650</b>, which may be facilitated by a profile of arm <b>637</b> or end effector <b>635</b> as well as a vertical length of end pieces <b>640</b>, <b>642</b>. As illustrated, end pieces <b>640</b>, <b>642</b> may extend a vertical distance from the arm <b>637</b>, which may allow the substrate to be lifted between the shelf portions and the arm for alignment. Accordingly, the end effector may be maintained in position during an alignment operation. The alignment hub <b>650</b> may be raised to transfer the substrate, or the substrate may be lowered to the alignment hub <b>650</b> in different embodiments. Regardless, one or more of the aligners, depending on how many substrates are being translated, may receive the substrate, and support the substrate between the end pieces and the arms of the end effector. An alignment adjustment may be performed, and the transfer apparatus may re-engage the substrates.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Additionally, in some embodiments, the end effector may be laterally adjusted to perform a centering operation during the alignment. For example, once transferred to the alignment hub <b>650</b>, the transfer apparatus may be adjusted to accommodate an offset error. In some embodiments, the alignment hubs may be vertically offset from one another to accommodate singular drop-off and pick-up of the substrates for alignment and centering. Accordingly, in some embodiments the vertical distance between the shelfs of the end effector end pieces and the surface of the arm from which the end pieces extend, may accommodate the staggered height between a highest and lowest alignment hub position during alignment operations or transfers. This may accommodate any number of substrates, which may facilitate centering during pick-up of wafers in some embodiments, although centering may also be performed prior to delivery of each substrate in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">After the alignment operation, or otherwise if alignment is not performed, the transfer apparatus may continue to rotate the substrates towards a second substrate support to which the substrate is to be delivered. Once the substrate has been positioned over a second substrate support within the transfer region, the substrate may be delivered to the support or associated lift pins at operation <b>535</b> by reversing the engagement process previously performed. Once delivered, the transfer apparatus may disengage the substrate from the transfer apparatus. Again, the substrate may be lowered with the transfer apparatus, and/or the substrate support, or lift pins of the substrate support may engage the substrate to accept the substrate from the transfer apparatus. The end effector may then be rotated away from the substrates, which may then proceed with processing or transfer from the transfer region.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref> show schematic views of substrates being laterally translated with a transfer apparatus <b>700</b> according to some embodiments of the present technology.

Transfer apparatus <b>700</b> may illustrate any of the transfer apparatuses discussed elsewhere, and may include any of the components as discussed previously. Although transfer apparatus <b>700</b> is illustrated with a single substrate, it is to be understood that any number of substrates may be coupled with end effectors as previously described.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, a substrate <b>701</b> may be coupled with an end effector <b>735</b>, which may be joined with an eccentric hub <b>730</b>, operable in coordination with a central hub <b>725</b>. When central hub <b>725</b> and eccentric hub <b>730</b> are rotated in a fixed ratio of rotation, such as to maintain the location of the eccentric hub <b>730</b> relative to the central hub <b>725</b> with regard to the substrate <b>701</b>, the substrate <b>701</b> may rotate about a central axis of the central hub <b>725</b>, such as to be rotated about a transfer region as previously described.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">When the eccentric hub <b>730</b> is rotated at a faster, or also slower, rotational rate or ratio relative to the central hub <b>725</b>, eccentric hub <b>730</b> may rotate along the eccentric axis about the central axis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> shows a position where eccentric hub has been rotated to an opposite side of the central axis, which may produce a lateral translation of the substrate an amount that is equal to twice the distance of eccentric offset between a central axis of the eccentric hub and the central axis of the central hub. When a correctional amount of rotation by the central hub is performed during transition of the eccentric hub, a rotational location of the substrate <b>701</b> may be maintained, and any distance along this eccentric length may be accommodated linearly by reduced movement eccentrically.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a schematic cross-sectional elevation view of an exemplary transfer region of a substrate processing system <b>800</b> according to some embodiments of the present technology. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a staggered lift pin configuration as previously described, and as may be included in any of the transfer chambers or substrate handling systems previously described. For example, any of the lift pins described previously may include staggered height lift pins as illustrated. Substrate handling system <b>800</b> may include any of the components, configurations, and characteristics of any of the previously described embodiments, and similarly any previously described system may include the lift pin configuration illustrated. System <b>800</b> may include a plurality of substrates <b>801</b> individually positioned on sets of lift pins <b>805</b> within the chamber, which may also include a transfer apparatus <b>820</b>, which may include features of any of the transfer apparatuses previously described, including arms <b>835</b> extending from the transfer apparatus.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Lift pins <b>805</b> may be sets of pins that extend from substrate supports <b>810</b> to provide accessibility for delivering or retrieving a substrate <b>801</b>, and each set may include any number of pins to accommodate a substrate. As illustrated, lift pin sets <b>805</b> are staggered at four different heights, which may allow individual delivery and retrieval of substrates. For example, lift pins <b>805</b><i>a </i>may extend a first vertical length above a substrate support. Lift pins <b>805</b><i>b </i>may extend a second vertical length above substrate support <b>810</b><i>b </i>illustrated in the cross-section, and which may hide a substrate support from which lift pins <b>805</b><i>a </i>may extend, although the substrate supports may be in line. The second vertical length may be less than the first vertical length as shown.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Additionally, lift pins <b>805</b><i>c </i>may extend a third vertical length from substrate support <b>810</b><i>c</i>, and the third vertical length may be less than the second vertical length. Finally, lift pins <b>805</b><i>d </i>may extend a fourth vertical length from an associated substrate support, which may be hidden by and in line with substrate support <b>810</b><i>c</i>. The fourth vertical length may be less than the third vertical length. By staggering the heights of the lift pin sets, individual adjustments may be made to each substrate prior to delivery or retrieval of the substrates. For example, when disposed on the associated lift pins, substrate <b>801</b><i>a </i>may be accessible above substrate <b>801</b><i>b</i>, which may be accessible above substrate <b>801</b><i>c</i>, and which may be accessible above substrate <b>801</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The present technology includes substrate processing systems that may accommodate additional substrate supports that may not otherwise be accessible to centrally located transfer robots as previously described. By incorporating transfer apparatuses according to embodiments of the present technology, multiple substrate supports may be utilized and accessed during substrate processing. When transfer apparatuses include eccentric drives operating in conjunction with central rotational drives, lateral translation may be provided in addition to rotational translation. Additionally, when end effectors according to some embodiments of the present technology are utilized, the movements to engage, transfer, and disengage with substrates may all be performed along exterior edges of the substrates, which may facilitate avoiding lift pins along an interior of the substrate support.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the preceding description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous details have been set forth in order to provide an understanding of various embodiments of the present technology.
