The WSS features a wide frequency band and low dispersion, and supports a port irrespective of a wavelength. To be specific, any port of the WSS can transmit an optical signal of any wavelength and supports a higher dimension. The dimension refers to a maximum quantity of connection directions that the ROADM device can provide. Therefore, the WSS has become a mainstream technology of ROADM.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, the WSS is mainly implemented by using free space multiplexing/demultiplexing technologies based on a diffraction grating and optical switching technologies based on a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS), a liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS), a liquid crystal, and the like. Regardless of what optical switching technology is used, the WSS needs to use the diffraction grating for spatial multiplexing/demultiplexing. When a beam is incident to the diffraction grating, an incident angle exists in a dispersion direction of the grating, and an azimuth may also exist in a height direction of the beam. The azimuth causes an offset of a diffraction spectrum in the dispersion direction, and finally causes a system center wavelength offset. In the conventional technology, a combined lens is usually added to an optical path of a WSS to perform aberration compensation, so as to eliminate an offset of a diffraction spectrum.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, according to the method in the conventional technology, a quantity of lenses in the WSS is increased. Consequently, a structure of an optical path system is complex, a length of the optical path system is increased, and optical design freedom is reduced.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This application provides a wavelength selective switch, to compensate for an offset of a diffraction spectrum in the wavelength selective switch.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first aspect of this application provides a wavelength selective switch, including an optical fiber array, a multiplexing/demultiplexing component, and a transmission direction adjustment component. The optical fiber array includes a first optical fiber and at least one second optical fiber, and is configured to receive an optical input signal transmitted by a light source. The multiplexing/demultiplexing component is configured to split the optical input signal into a plurality of single-wavelength optical signals in space. The transmission direction adjustment component is configured to separately change transmission directions of the plurality of single-wavelength optical signals. The optical fiber array is further configured to output an optical output signal. The optical output signal is a signal obtained after the optical input signal is processed by an optical component in the wavelength selective switch.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Fiber cores of a plurality of optical fibers in the optical fiber array are distributed in a curve in a height direction of the wavelength selective switch. The first optical fiber is used as a reference. A fiber core of each of the at least one second optical fiber has a first offset relative to a fiber core of the first optical fiber in the height direction of the wavelength selective switch, and the first offset is used to compensate for a second offset of a diffraction spectrum generated when the plurality of single-wavelength optical signals obtained after the optical input signal is processed by the multiplexing/demultiplexing component arrive at the transmission direction adjustment component.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this manner, the fiber core of the second optical fiber in the optical fiber array offsets relative to a first port in the height direction, so that an offset of the diffraction spectrum can be compensated for.

The beam shaping and polarization splitting component is configured to collimate and shape the optical input signal, split a shaped beam into beams in orthogonal polarization states, and convert the beams in the orthogonal polarization states into two beams in a same polarization direction: a first beam and a second beam.
