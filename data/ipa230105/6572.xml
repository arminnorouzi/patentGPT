However, these bonding methods may be useful at a low power generation frequency of 10 Hz or less but mostly have a low adhesive strength of 1 N/mm to 2.5 N/mm. Thus, when an element vibrates at a high speed by an external source, a short circuit occurs, and foreign substances are introduced from the outside.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">That is, it is difficult to utilize these bonding methods in a power generation industry in which ultra-high reliability should be ensured in an environment which requires a power generation frequency of several hundred Hz, several hundred kHz, or several MHz or in environment which requires the power generation frequency to be low.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The present disclosure has been proposed to solve the above problems and proposes a physical guide structure for maintaining adhesion and preventing inflow of external foreign substances after an O<sub>2</sub>-based plasma process.
