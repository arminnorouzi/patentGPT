Extensive research efforts have been contributed to develop multifocal ophthalmic lenses (intraocular lenses or contact lenses) for correcting presbyopia. One of extensive research areas is the development of multifocal diffractive ophthalmic lenses. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,210,391, 4,338,005, 4,340,283, 4,637,697, 4,641,934, 4,642,112, 4,655,565, 4,830,481, 4,881,804, 4,881,805, 4,936,666, 4,995,714, 4,995,715, 5,054,905, 5,056,908, 5,076,684, 5,100,226, 5,104,212, 5,114,220, 5,116,111, 5,117,306, 5,120,120, 5,121,979, 5,121,980, 5,229,797, 5,748,282, 5,760,871, 5,982,543, 6,120,148, 6,364,483, 6,536,899, 6,951,391, 6,957,891, 7,025,456, 7,073,906, 7,093,938, 7,156,516, 7,188,949, 7,232,218, 7,891,810, 8,038,293, 8,128,222, 8,142,016, 8,382,281, 8,480,228, 8,556,416, 8,573,775, 8,678,583, 8,755,117, 9,033,494, 9,310,624, 9,320,594, 9,370,416, 10,197,815, 10,209,533, 10,426,599, 10,463,474, 10,524,899, 10,675,146, 10,725,320, 10,932,901, and 10,945,834. Currently, multifocal diffractive intraocular lenses are commercially available for correcting presbyopia.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, multifocal diffractive contact lenses are still not commercially available for correcting presbyopia (see, Perez-Prados, et al., &#x201c;Soft Multifocal Simultaneous Image Contact Lenses: Review&#x201d;, Clin. Exp. Optom. 2017, 100: 107-127) probably due to some issues uniquely associated with contact lenses. For example, the standard lens materials have a refractive index of about 1.42 or less, i.e., about 0.04 higher than the refractive index of tear film. With such a small difference in refractive index, a higher diffraction grating height needs to be created on one of the anterior and posterior surface of a contact lens. But, contact lenses require smooth anterior and posterior surfaces for wearing comfort. Such a diffraction grating likely causes discomfort to a patient.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is a need for multifocal diffractive contact lenses.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention, in one aspect, provides an embedded silicone hydrogel contact lens, comprising a silicone hydrogel bulk material and an insert embedded therein, wherein the insert is made of a crosslinked polymeric material having a first refractive index, wherein the silicone hydrogel bulk material has a second refractive index, wherein the first refractive index is at least 0.07 higher than the second refractive index, wherein the insert has a front curve surface, an opposite back curve surface and a diameter of less than 13.0 mm, wherein the insert is located in a central portion of the embedded hydrogel contact lens and comprises a diffractive structure disposed on one of the front and back curve surfaces for providing a diffractive power that contributes to the overall optical power of the contact lens, wherein the diffractive structure is buried inside the silicone hydrogel bulk material, wherein the embedded silicone hydrogel contact lens is not susceptible to delamination as demonstrated by being free of bubble when being inspected under microscopy at interfaces between the insert and the bulk material within the embedded hydrogel contact lens after being autoclaved in a packaging solution in a sealed package for about 45 minutes at 121&#xb0; C., wherein the packaging solution is a phosphate buffered saline having a pH of 7.1&#xb1;0.2.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect, the invention provides a method for producing an embedded silicone hydrogel contact lens having diffractive insert therein of the invention.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides the foregoing and other features, and the advantages of the invention will become further apparent from the following detailed description of the presently preferred embodiments, read in conjunction with the accompanying figures.

This invention is partly based on the discovery that such inserts having a relatively-high oxygen permeability and a relatively high refractive index (&#x3e;1.49) can be prepared from a polymerizable composition comprising at least about 50% by mole of one or more acrylic monomers and/or crosslinkers and at least one polymerizable component selected from the group consisting of a silicone-containing vinylic monomer, an aryl vinylic monomer, an aryl silicone-containing vinylic monomer, a polysiloxane vinylic crosslinker comprising siloxane units each having at least one aryl-containing substituent. With a relatively-high oxygen permeability, such inserts would have minimized adverse effects on the oxygen permeability of the contact lens and consequently on the ocular health. With a relatively-high refractive index, the diffractive structure, which is essentially a diffraction grating and disposed on one of the front and back curve surfaces of each inserts, can have a reduced diffraction grating height (e.g., &#x2264;5 &#x3bc;m). This invention is also partly based on the discovery that delamination-resistant embedded silicone hydrogel contact lens can be obtained by encapsulating completely or partially an insert comprising at least 50% by mole of repeating units of one or more acrylic monomers and/or crosslinker within a silicone hydrogel bulk material comprising repeating units of at least one silicone-containing vinylic crosslinker and/or monomer having H-bond donors.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0073">There are some potential unique features associated with a delamination-resistant, diffractive contact lens. First, the diffractive structure is fully embedded in a silicone hydrogel bulk material. By not in contact with cornea or any ocular surface, the wearing comfort can be increased while the risks of adverse event can be decreased. Further, the vision stability due to variation in tear film can be reduced. In addition, diffraction grating with a reduced grating height can be more easily manufactured, e.g., by cast molding.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0074">The present invention, in one aspect, provides an embedded silicone hydrogel contact lens, comprising a silicone hydrogel bulk material and an insert embedded therein, wherein the insert is made of a crosslinked polymeric material having a first refractive index, wherein the silicone hydrogel bulk material has a second refractive index, wherein the first refractive index is at least 0.07 (preferably at least 0.08, more preferably at least 0.09, even more preferably at least 0.10) higher than the second refractive index, wherein the insert has a front curve surface, an opposite back curve surface and a diameter of less than 13.0 mm, wherein the insert is located in a central portion of the embedded hydrogel contact lens and comprises a diffractive structure disposed on one of the front and back curve surfaces for providing a diffractive power that contributes to the overall optical power of the contact lens, wherein the diffractive structure is buried inside the silicone hydrogel bulk material, wherein the embedded silicone hydrogel contact lens is not susceptible to delamination as demonstrated by being free of bubble when being inspected under microscopy at interfaces between the insert and the silicone hydrogel bulk material within the embedded silicone hydrogel contact lens after being autoclaved in a packaging solution in a sealed package for about 45 minutes at 121&#xb0; C., wherein the packaging solution is a phosphate buffered saline having a pH of 7.1&#xb1;0.2.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0075">The inspection of an embedded silicone hydrogel contact lens under microscopy for delamination can be carried out according any method known to a person skilled in the art. Preferably, it is carried according to the procedures described in Example 1 of this application.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0076">In accordance with the invention, a diffractive structure is essentially a transmission diffraction grating. As known to a person skilled in the art, a transmission diffraction grating is typically comprised of a plurality of repetitive ridges and/or grooves regularly or periodically spaced and arranged in concentrically rings or zones&#x2014;annular zones (i.e., echelettes) at a respective surface of a lens (i.e., an insert in this application). The periodic spacing or pitch of the ridges and/or grooves substantially determines the points of destructive and constructive interference at the optical axis of the lens. The shape and height of the ridges and/or grooves control the amount of incident light that is provided at a point of constructive interference by diffraction. The points of constructive interference are generally called diffraction orders or focal points.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0077">The diffractive power is related to the properties of these zones, for instance their number, shape, size and position. Currently used echelettes may typically be defined by a primary zone, a secondary zone between the primary zone and a primary zone of an adjacent echelette, and an echelette geometry. The echelette geometry includes inner and outer diameters and a shaped or sloped profile. Secondary zones may describe the situation where the theoretical primary zone is a discontinuous function, leading to discrete steps in the profile height. Secondary zones may be introduced to solve the manufacturing issue of making sharp corner in a surface, and/or to reduce possible light scatter from sharp corners. The overall profile may be characterized by an echelette height or step height between adjacent echelettes. The relative radial spacing of the echelettes largely determine the power(s) of the lens and the step height of the secondary zones largely determines the light distribution between the different add powers.

The first female mold half and the male mold half are configured to receive each other such that an insert-molding cavity is formed between the first and second molding surfaces when being closed, whereas the second female mold half and the male mold half are configured to receive each other such that a lens-molding cavity is formed between the second and third molding surfaces when being closed. In production, an amount of an insert-forming composition is dosed on the central portion of the first molding surface of the female mold half and then mated and closed with the male mold half to form a first molding assembly. The insert-forming composition in the insert-molding cavity of the first molding assembly is cured (thermally or actinically) to form a molded insert. Then, the first molding assembly is separated into the first female mold half and the male mold half with the molded insert adhered onto the central area of the second molding surface. A lens-forming composition is dose into the second female mold half and then mated and closed with the male mold half with the molded insert adhered thereto to form a second molding assembly. The lens-forming composition in the lens-molding cavity of the second molding assembly is cured (thermally or actinically) to form an embedded SiHy contact lens with the partially-embedded insert that comprises the diffractive structure.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0174">The molded insert or embedded SiHy contact lenses can be subject to lens extraction with a liquid extraction medium to remove unpolymerized polymerizable components and formed and oligomers.
