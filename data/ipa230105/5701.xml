For example, in some embodiments, a charged particle microscope (CPM) support apparatus may include: first logic to identify a defective pixel region of a charged particle camera, wherein the charged particle camera cannot detect charged particle events in the defective pixel region; second logic to generate a first charged particle event indicator that identifies a first time and a first location of a first charged particle event outside the defective pixel region, wherein the first charged particle event is detected by the charged particle camera; third logic to generate a second charged particle event indicator that identifies a second time and a second location in the defective pixel region; and fourth logic to output data representative of the charged particle event indicators.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The CPM support embodiments disclosed herein may achieve improved performance relative to conventional approaches. In conventional microscopy systems, camera defects (e.g., pixel defects, area defects row and/or: defects, etc.) are masked in camera firmware by applying image interpolation at the defect pixels using neighboring pixel value information. However, such interpolations are typically performed after transforming the stream of charged particle positions into an image representation, and thus defect information must be provided to the (typically third-party) software that performs the decoding and subsequent reconstruction. Further, because such interpolation typically requires processing the charged particle data into an image in advance, no such interpolation could be performed on data that is still in the &#x201c;raw&#x201d; charged particle position form (e.g., electron event representation (EER) data).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The CPM support embodiments disclosed herein may mask defects in a charged particle camera by generating &#x201c;mask&#x201d; charged particle event indicators associated with defect pixel locations. Such a procedure may be implemented in the hardware of the charged particle camera itself, if desired, and allows the resulting data stream to be processed by third-party or other reconstruction software as if the data were defect-free. Various ones of the embodiments disclosed herein permit defect information to be provided separately to downstream software, when desired, and achieve improved reconstruction by mitigating the presence of defects (e.g., by reducing the likelihood that shift detection, multi-image alignment, or other processes will be undesirably influenced by defects). The embodiments disclosed herein thus provide improvements to CPM technology (e.g., improvements in the computer technology supporting such CPMs, among other improvements).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof wherein like numerals designate like parts throughout, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, embodiments that may be practiced.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;logic&#x201d; may include an apparatus that is to perform a set of operations associated with the logic. For example, any of the logic elements included in the CPM support module <b>1000</b> may be implemented by one or more computing devices programmed with instructions to cause one or more processing devices of the computing devices to perform the associated set of operations.

Different ones of the logic elements in a module may take the same form or may take different forms. For example, some logic in a module may be implemented by a programmed general-purpose processing device, while other logic in a module may be implemented by an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). In another example, different ones of the logic elements in a module may be associated with different sets of instructions executed by one or more processing devices. A module may not include all of the logic elements depicted in the associated drawing; for example, a module may include a subset of the logic elements depicted in the associated drawing when that module is to perform a subset of the operations discussed herein with reference to that module.

When a charged particle event is detected by a non-defective pixel <b>102</b>, the charged particle detection logic <b>1004</b> may receive information about this charged particle event from the charged particle sensor <b>1104</b> (e.g., via a fiber-optic cable or other communication link), and in response, the charged particle detection logic <b>1004</b> may generate a charged particle event indicator representative of this charged particle event. In particular, the charged particle event indicator may identify a time and a location of the charged particle event. In some embodiments, the time of a charged particle event indicator may be a frame interval N, representative of the associated charged particle event happening during the frame interval associated with the capture of the Nth frame of pixel array data; combining the frame number N with the frame rate may allow a time (e.g., in the unit of seconds) to be identified. In some embodiments, the location of a charged particle event indicator may reflect the particular pixel <b>102</b> (and/or sub-pixels, or other locations) at which the associated charged particle event was detected. Charged particle event indicators generated by the charged particle detection logic <b>1004</b> may include other charged particle event information in addition to time and location, as desired.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The defect masking logic <b>1006</b> may also be configured to generate charged particle event indicators, but these charged particle event indicators may not correspond to &#x201c;detected&#x201d; charged particle events detected by a charged particle camera <b>1102</b>. Instead, the defect masking logic <b>1006</b> may generate &#x201c;mask&#x201d; (or &#x201c;fake&#x201d;) charged particle event indicators associated with locations within one or more of the defective pixel regions <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The defect masking logic <b>1006</b> may generate the charged particle event indicators for a defective pixel <b>102</b> based on an estimate of the local charged particle radiation dose rate at the defective pixel <b>102</b>, and such an estimate may rely on the &#x201c;detected&#x201d; charged particle events occurring at non-defective pixels <b>102</b> of a charged particle camera <b>1102</b>. Thus, the defect masking logic <b>1006</b> may generate charged particle event indicators based on the charged particle events occurring at the non-defective pixels <b>102</b>.

For example, the defect masking logic <b>1006</b> may generate a &#x201c;mask&#x201d; charged particle event indicator whose location corresponds to a defective pixel <b>102</b> with a probability that increases with the number of neighboring (e.g., one or more spatially neighboring or otherwise proximate and/or temporally neighboring or otherwise proximate) non-defective pixels <b>102</b> that detected a charged particle event (e.g., within a single frame interval or other time). In one particular example, a defective pixel <b>102</b> X in a &#x201c;column defect&#x201d; defective pixel region <b>104</b> (like the defective pixel region <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) may have &#x201c;left-right&#x201d; neighboring pixels <b>102</b> A and B (such that the defective pixel <b>102</b> X is between neighboring pixel <b>102</b> A and neighboring pixel <b>102</b> B), and the defect masking logic <b>1006</b> may generate a charged particle event indicator corresponding to the defective pixel <b>102</b> X in a frame interval N with probability zero when no charged particle events are detected by pixels <b>102</b> A and B in the frame interval N, with probability 0.5 when a charged particle event is detected by pixel <b>102</b> A in the frame interval N but not by the pixel <b>102</b> B (and vice versa), and with probability 1 when a charged particle event is detected by both pixels <b>102</b> A and B in the frame interval N.
