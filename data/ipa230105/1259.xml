As a result, a counter force is applied on the rope <b>19</b>, and this prompts the user that attempts to pull the rope <b>19</b>, to apply a high degree of force in order to pull the rope <b>19</b>, thus strengthening muscles that are involved in the pulling of the rope <b>19</b>.

According to the embodiment in which the movement of the movable wheel <b>18</b> is controlled by a motor, a user can control the time, or speed, or both the time and speed, as well as the direction, in which the motor operates in order to control the movement of the movable wheel toward, or away from, the first fixed wheel <b>14</b> and the second fixed wheel <b>16</b>.

Therefore, according to one embodiment, the extended handle <b>185</b>-E is a screwed handle <b>185</b>-S.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">According to one embodiment, the handle is a screwed handle <b>185</b>-S, and the force applicator <b>10</b> further comprises a fixing element <b>122</b> attached to the base <b>12</b> and configured to fix the screwed handle <b>185</b>-S to the base <b>12</b>, and a nut <b>170</b> configured to screw on the screwed handle <b>185</b>-S. According to this embodiment, the screwed handle <b>185</b>-S is threaded, and the nut <b>170</b> is correspondingly threaded, thus allowing the nut <b>170</b> to screw onto the screwed handle <b>185</b>-S. In addition, according to another embodiment, the fixing element <b>122</b> is hollow and is configured to accommodate the screwed handle <b>185</b>-S in a hollow part of the fixing element <b>122</b>. Therefore, since the fixing element <b>122</b> is fixed to the base <b>12</b>, and accommodates the screwed handle <b>185</b>-S, the screwed handle <b>185</b>-S is fixed to the base <b>12</b>. As a result, turning of the nut <b>170</b>, while preventing the nut <b>170</b> from moving along the screwed handle <b>185</b>-S, causes the screwed handle <b>185</b>-S to rotate about a longitudinal axis of the screwed handle <b>185</b>-S and move in relation to the nut <b>170</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to one embodiment, the nut <b>170</b> is prevented from moving along the screwed handle <b>185</b>-S when turned about the screwed handle <b>185</b>-S by being blocked by the fixing element <b>122</b>. This embodiment is preferably applicable when the fixing element <b>122</b> is attached to an edge of the base, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. According to another embodiment, the force applicator <b>10</b> further comprises an elastic element <b>190</b>, placed between the nut <b>170</b> and the fixing element <b>122</b>. According to yet another embodiment, the elastic element <b>190</b> is a spring <b>190</b>. According to yet another embodiment, the elastic element <b>190</b> is placed between the nut <b>170</b> and an edge of the base <b>12</b>. According to still another embodiment, the elastic element <b>190</b> has a tube-like structure, and it is placed between the nut <b>170</b> and the fixing element <b>122</b> by inserting the screwed handle <b>185</b>-S into an inner space of the tube-like elastic element <b>190</b>.

In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the nut <b>170</b> was turned in a manner that caused the screwed handle <b>185</b>-S to move in direction <b>904</b>, and this caused the movable wheel <b>18</b> to move away from the first fixed wheel <b>14</b> and the second fixed wheel <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, hereinafter, shows the opposite position of the movable wheel <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, schematically illustrating, according to an exemplary embodiment, a front view of a fitness device comprising a force applicator, and a rope accommodated in the force applicator, while a movable wheel is moved toward a first fixed wheel and a second fixed wheel by using a screwed handle attached to a movable center of the movable wheel.

According to another embodiment, the elastic element <b>190</b> facilitates fine adjustment of the position of the movable wheel <b>18</b> in relation to the first fixed wheel <b>14</b> and the second fixed wheel <b>16</b>, when the movable wheel <b>18</b> is moved manually. Both these embodiments are translated to fine adjustment of the counter force applied on the rope <b>19</b>, which is advantageous per se.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">According to one embodiment, the elastic element <b>190</b> is configured to facilitate pushing of the rope <b>19</b> by the user, particularly when a counter force is applied on the rope <b>19</b> by the first fixed wheel <b>14</b>, the second fixed wheel <b>16</b> and the movable wheel <b>18</b>. This embodiment is important when a contour, or surface, of the rope <b>19</b> is rough, or not homogenous. In other words, there can be bulges in various sizes and shapes on the surface of the rope <b>19</b>. When the rope <b>19</b> is pressed between the movable wheel <b>18</b> and the first fixed wheel <b>14</b> and the second fixed wheel <b>16</b>, the rope <b>19</b> can be stuck between the wheels because of the bulges on the surface of the rope <b>19</b>. This is because the first fixed wheel <b>14</b> and the second fixed wheel <b>16</b>, are fixed to the base <b>12</b>, by nature. However, also when the movable wheel <b>18</b> is brought to a desired position, the movable wheel <b>18</b> is also fixed to the base <b>12</b>. However, when the elastic element <b>190</b> is part of the force applicator <b>10</b>, then, the elastic element <b>190</b> allows slight movement of the movable wheel <b>18</b> when a bulge on the surface of the rope <b>19</b> is encountered by the movable wheel <b>18</b>. Thus, in one hand, the elastic element <b>190</b> allows smooth path of the bulge between the first sixed wheel <b>14</b>, the second fixed wheel <b>16</b>, and the movable wheel <b>18</b> due to a slight movement of the movable wheel <b>18</b> facilitated by the elastic element <b>190</b>; while on the other hand, the elastic element <b>190</b> absorbs rotations of the movable wheel <b>18</b> due to the bulges on the surface of the rope <b>19</b>, when the rope <b>19</b> is pushed. In other words, the elastic element <b>190</b> serves as a shock absorber.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, schematically illustrating, according to an exemplary embodiment, a front view of a fitness device comprising a force applicator, and a closed circular rope, when a movable wheel is moved away from a first fixed wheel and a second fixed wheel.
