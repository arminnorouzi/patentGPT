Each of the conductor posts (<b>61</b>, <b>62</b>) may have any shape in a cross section and a surface orthogonal to the thickness direction of wiring substrate <b>100</b>. An external component (E<b>1</b>) is connected to the conductor posts <b>61</b>, and an external component (E<b>2</b>) is connected to the conductor posts <b>62</b>. That is, the component (E<b>1</b>) and the component (E<b>2</b>) are connected to the wiring substrate <b>100</b> when the wiring substrate <b>100</b> is used. Therefore, the wiring substrate <b>100</b> includes a component region (A<b>1</b>) (first component region), which is a region to be covered by the component (E<b>1</b>) when the wiring substrate <b>100</b> is used, and a component region (A<b>2</b>) (second component region), which is a region to be covered by the component (E<b>2</b>) when the wiring substrate <b>100</b> is used. The component (E<b>1</b>) connected to the conductor posts <b>61</b> is positioned in the component region (A<b>1</b>), and the component (E<b>2</b>) connected to the conductor posts <b>62</b> is positioned in the component region (A<b>2</b>).

Further, although not illustrated, each of the insulating layers may contain a core material (reinforcing material) formed of a glass fiber, an aramid fiber, or the like, and may contain an inorganic filler formed of fine particles of silica (SiO2), alumina, mullite, or the like.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The covering layer <b>41</b> is formed of any insulating material. For example, the covering layer <b>41</b> may be formed of the same epoxy resin or polyimide resin as the solder resist <b>42</b> and may function as a solder resist preventing a short circuit between the conductor posts. Or, the covering layer <b>41</b> may be formed of an epoxy resin, a BT resin, or a phenol resin used for interlayer insulating layers such as the insulating layer <b>21</b> and the insulating layer <b>22</b>. That is, the material of the covering layer <b>41</b> is not limited to a specific material as long as the covering layer <b>41</b> is insulating and can cover predetermined regions of the conductor layer <b>11</b> and the insulating layer <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The core part <b>51</b> and the clad part <b>52</b> of the optical waveguide <b>5</b> can be formed of an organic material, an inorganic material, or a mixed material such as an inorganic polymer containing an organic component and an inorganic component, the material having an appropriate refractive index. Examples of inorganic materials include quartz glass, silicon, and the like, and examples of organic materials include acrylic resins such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polyimide resins, polyamide resins, polyether resins, epoxy resins, and the like. Further, inorganic polymers such as polysilane may be used. The core part <b>51</b> and clad part <b>52</b> may be formed of materials different from each other, or may be formed of materials of the same type. However, for the core part <b>51</b>, a material having a higher refractive index than that used for the clad part <b>52</b> is used. Since total reflection of light incident on an interface between the core part <b>51</b> and the clad part <b>52</b> at an incident angle equal to or larger than a critical angle is possible, light incident on the core part <b>51</b> can efficiently propagate in the core part <b>51</b>. It is also possible that, after the core part <b>51</b> and the clad part <b>52</b> are formed using materials having the same refractive index, the refractive indices of the core part <b>51</b> and the clad part <b>52</b> are made different from each other by appropriate processing. For example, the refractive index of polysilane decreases when irradiated with ultraviolet rays.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The conductor layers (<b>11</b>, <b>12</b>) and the conductor layers <b>31</b>, the through-hole conductors <b>33</b>, the via conductors <b>20</b>, and the conductor posts (<b>61</b>, <b>62</b>) and conductor posts <b>63</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) (to be described later) can be formed using any metal such as copper or nickel. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, these conductors are simplified and are drawn as each having a one-layer structure.

Further, by electrolytic plating using the metal film <b>610</b> as a power feeding layer, a metal film formed of tin, a tin alloy, a gold alloy, or the like is formed as the connection layer <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">After that, the plating resist (R<b>1</b>) is removed, and the metal film <b>610</b> exposed by the removal of the plating resist (R<b>1</b>) is removed by quick etching or the like. Through the above processes, the conductor posts <b>611</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> can be formed. In the method for forming the conductor posts <b>611</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref>, since it is not necessary to remove a portion of the covering layer <b>41</b> in the thickness direction, it may be possible that it is easier than forming the conductor posts <b>61</b> and the covering layer <b>41</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The wiring substrate of the embodiment is not limited to those having the structures illustrated in the drawings and those having the structures, shapes, and materials exemplified herein. As described above, the wiring substrate of the embodiment can have any laminated structure. For example, the wiring substrate of the embodiment may be a coreless substrate that does not include a core substrate. The wiring substrate of the embodiment can include any number of conductor layers and any number of insulating layers. It is also possible that the optical connector (C) is not provided, and it is also possible that the conductor pads (<b>11</b><i>b</i>) and the conductor posts <b>62</b> for mounting the component (E<b>2</b>) are not formed, and therefore, it is also possible that the component region (A<b>2</b>) is not included.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2008-129385 describes an optical component mounting substrate on a surface of which an optical waveguide and an optical semiconductor element are mounted. The optical waveguide having a light receiving and emitting part on one end side and a light emitting part (or light receiving part) of the optical semiconductor element connected to a wiring pattern via a bump are optically coupled on the other end side of the optical waveguide. Light emitted by the optical semiconductor element is incident on a core part of the optical waveguide and propagates to the light receiving and emitting part, and, on the other hand, light incident on the light receiving and emitting part propagates through the core part and is incident on the optical semiconductor element from the other end side. The entire contents of this publication are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the substrate described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2008-129385, a clad layer of the optical waveguide is interposed between the core part on the other end side of the optical waveguide and the light emitting part (or the light receiving part) of the optical semiconductor element. That is, since a distance between the core part and the optical semiconductor element is large and, in addition, light propagates in any direction in the clad layer, it is thought that a high efficiency in optical coupling is unlikely to be obtained.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">A wiring substrate according to an embodiment of the present invention includes: an insulating layer that has a surface having a first conductor pad; a covering layer that partially covers the insulating layer; an optical waveguide that is provided on the surface and includes a core part that transmits light; a conductor post that is formed of plating metal on the first conductor pad and penetrates the covering layer; and a first component region that is a region to be covered by a component connected to the conductor post. The core part has a side surface along a first direction along the surface of the insulating layer. The side surface has, in the first component region, an exposed portion that faces the opposite direction with respect to the insulating layer and is exposed from the optical waveguide. A distance between the exposed portion and the surface of the insulating layer is larger than a thickness of the covering layer.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">According to an embodiment of the present invention, it may be possible that a coupling efficiency between the optical waveguide provided in the wiring substrate and a component optically coupled to the optical waveguide can be improved and connection reliability between the component and the wiring substrate can be improved.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings.
