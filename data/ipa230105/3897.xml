The subject matter discussed in the background of the invention section should not be assumed to be prior art merely as a result of its mention in the background of the invention section. Similarly, a problem mentioned in the background of the invention section or associated with the subject matter of the background of the invention section should not be assumed to have been previously recognized in the prior art. The subject matter in the background of the invention section merely represents different approaches, which in and of themselves may also be inventions.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is an essential part for obtaining accurate global positioning, and is widely used for vehicle localization purposes. In some cases, typical GNSS Extended Kalman Filters (EKF's) provide standard outlier algorithms to detect outliers in the GNSS pseudorange measurements. However, each of these standard algorithms may have its own deficiencies, as some of the standard algorithms may be inaccurate, and some other standard algorithms may be too complex and not efficient.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, a heretofore unaddressed need exists in the art to address the aforementioned deficiencies and inadequacies.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to a system and method for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) outlier detection and rejection, and application of the same. Specifically, the system and method utilizes an integration of multiple outlier algorithms in sequence, in which Doppler-pseudorange comparison and Random Sampling Consensus (RANSAC) and history-based checks are sequentially performed, where the RANSAC check takes the filtered output from the Doppler-pseudorange comparison as the input, thus reducing the number of subsets needed for computation in the RANSAC check.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect of the invention, a GNSS receiver for performing GNSS outlier detection and rejection is provided. In certain embodiments, the GNSS receiver includes a receiving device communicatively connected to a plurality of satellites in the GNSS, configured to receive GNSS signals from the satellites; and a computing device having a processor and a storage device storing computer executable instructions. The computer executable instructions, when executed on the processor, cause the processor to: process the GNSS signals received from the satellites to perform positioning; perform a Doppler-pseudorange comparison for each of the satellites in the GNSS to determine a status of each of the satellites as an outlier or undetermined; after performing the Doppler-pseudorange comparison, perform a Random Sampling Consensus (RANSAC) check for selected subsets of the satellites using results of the Doppler-pseudorange comparison as inputs to filter the satellites, and to determine the status of each of the selected subsets as the outlier or undetermined; after performing the RANSAC check, in response to determining the status of a specific satellite of the satellites as undetermined in the Doppler-pseudorange comparison or the RANSAC check, perform a history-based check for the specific satellite to determine the status of the specific satellite as the outlier or an inlier; and record, in a state table, the status of each of the satellites.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect of the present invention, a method for performing GNSS outlier detection and rejection includes: providing a GNSS receiver communicatively connected to a plurality of satellites in the GNSS, wherein the GNSS receiver is configured to receive GNSS signals from the satellites and process the GNSS signals to perform positioning; performing, by the GNSS receiver, a Doppler-pseudorange comparison for each of the satellites in the GNSS to determine a status of each of the satellites as an outlier or undetermined; after performing the Doppler-pseudorange comparison, performing, by the GNSS receiver, a Random Sampling Consensus (RANSAC) check for selected subsets of the satellites using results of the Doppler-pseudorange comparison as inputs to filter the satellites, and to determine the status of each of the selected subsets as the outlier or undetermined; after performing the RANSAC check, in response to determining the status of a specific satellite of the satellites as undetermined in the Doppler-pseudorange comparison or the RANSAC check, performing, by the GNSS receiver, a history-based check for the specific satellite to determine the status of the specific satellite as the outlier or an inlier; and recording, by the GNSS receiver in a state table, the status of each of the satellites.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Yet another aspect of the present invention relates to non-transitory tangible computer-readable medium storing computer executable instructions which, when executed by one or more processors on a GNSS receiver, cause the method as discussed to be performed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, for a designated satellite of the satellites, the Doppler-pseudorange comparison is performed by: performing a Doppler measurement based on the GNSS signals received from the designated satellite; calculating a pseudorange change rate for the designated satellite; and determining the status of the designated satellite by comparing the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate, wherein the status of the designated satellite is determined as the outlier when the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate are determined to be inconsistent with each other. In one embodiment, the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate are determined to be inconsistent when an error rate of the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate exceeds a threshold.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the RANSAC check is performed by: assigning a weight W<sub>i </sub>for each the satellites based on the results of the Doppler-pseudorange comparison; obtaining a probability distribution by normalizing the weights {W<sub>i</sub>} for all of the satellites; selecting the subsets from the satellites randomly based on the normalizing weights for the satellites; and determining, using RANSAC, the status of each of the selected subsets as the outlier or undetermined. In one embodiment, the weight W<sub>i </sub>for each the satellites is determined based on an error rate of the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the history-based check is performed by: determining a past time period for the history-based check; checking the state table for the specific satellite within the past time period to determine the recorded status of the specific satellite within the past time period; and determining the status of the specific satellite based on the recorded status of the specific satellite within the past time period, wherein the status of the specific satellite is determined as the outlier when any of the recorded status of the specific satellite within the past time period is the outlier, and the status of the specific satellite is determined as the inlier when none of the recorded status of the specific satellite within the past time period is the outlier. In one embodiment, the past time period is variable based on a location of the GNSS receiver.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the computer executable instructions, when executed on the processor, further cause the processor to, prior to performing the RANSAC check, perform a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) check for each of the satellites in the GNSS to determine the status of each of the satellites as the outlier or undetermined, wherein the RANSAC check uses both the results of the Doppler-pseudorange comparison and results of the SNR check as the inputs to filter the satellites.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Yet a further aspect of the invention relates to a vehicle having the GNSS receiver as described above.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">These and other aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the following drawings, although variations and modifications therein may be affected without departing from the spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the disclosure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The accompanying drawings illustrate one or more embodiments of the invention and, together with the written description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.

Certain terms that are used to describe the invention are discussed below, or elsewhere in the specification, to provide additional guidance to the practitioner regarding the description of the invention. For convenience, certain terms may be highlighted, for example using italics and/or quotation marks. The use of highlighting has no influence on the scope and meaning of a term; the scope and meaning of a term is the same, in the same context, whether or not it is highlighted. It will be appreciated that same thing can be said in more than one way. Consequently, alternative language and synonyms may be used for any one or more of the terms discussed herein, nor is any special significance to be placed upon whether or not a term is elaborated or discussed herein. Synonyms for certain terms are provided. A recital of one or more synonyms does not exclude the use of other synonyms. The use of examples anywhere in this specification including examples of any terms discussed herein is illustrative only, and in no way limits the scope and meaning of the invention or of any exemplified term. Likewise, the invention is not limited to various embodiments given in this specification.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">It will be understood that, as used in the description herein and throughout the claims that follow, the meaning of &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the&#x201d; includes plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

For example, standard algorithms using signal-to-noise ratios (SNR's) or Doopler-velocity rejections may be simple but relatively inaccurate. In comparison, Random Sampling Consensus (RANSAC) algorithms, while being more accurate, require significantly complex computation to obtain the result, and is thus not efficient.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">To address the aforementioned issues, certain aspects of the present invention relate to a system and method for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) outlier detection and rejection, which utilizes an integration of multiple outlier algorithms in sequence.

Specifically, Doppler measurements may be in the form of a function of the radial velocity between the rover (or the vehicle on which the GNSS receiver <b>200</b> is provided) and a corresponding one the satellites. Similarly, the pseudorange change rate also reflects the velocity between the rover and the corresponding satellite if we neglect the position changes of the satellites. Theoretically, the relationship between the theoretical Doppler observation (Dop) and the pseudorange change rate is:</p><p id="p-0051" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Dop=&#x394;Pr/&#x3bb;</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0052" num="0000">where &#x394;Pr is the pseudorange change rate, and &#x3bb; is the wavelength of the signals.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0050">Since the actual Doppler measurement may be different from the theoretical value of the Dop calculated by the above equation, it would be possible to use the comparison between the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate to determine whether the status of a satellite is an outlier or not. For example, by setting up a threshold of the error rate of the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate, it may be possible to determine whether the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate are consistent with each other or not. For example, in the case where the error rate of the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate exceeds the threshold, the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate are determined to be inconsistent with each other, and the status of the satellite is determined as the outlier. On the other hand, when the error rate of the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate does not exceed the threshold, the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate are determined to be consistent with each other, and the status of the satellite is undetermined, as it may go through additional RANSAC and/or history-based checks to determine whether the satellite is an inlier.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a flowchart of the Doppler-pseudorange comparison performed by the Doppler-pseudorange module <b>260</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> according to one embodiment of the invention.

Then, at the process <b>320</b>, a pseudorange change rate is calculated for the designated satellite. Once the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate are obtained, at the process <b>330</b>, the status of the designated satellite may be determined by comparing and calculating the error rate of the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate. At the process <b>340</b>, a determination as to whether the error rate of the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate exceeds the threshold is performed. If it is determined that the error rate of the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate exceeds the threshold, the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate are determined to be inconsistent with each other, and the status of the designated satellite is determined as an outlier. Thus, at the process <b>350</b>, the status of the designated satellite is recorded as an outlier. On the other hand, if it is determined that the error rate of the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate does not exceed the threshold, the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate are determined to be consistent with each other, and it is possible that the designated satellite may be an inlier.

Specifically, the RANSAC check is performed after the Doppler-pseudorange comparison, in which the results of the Doppler-pseudorange comparison as inputs for the RANSAC check to filter the satellites. Specifically, RANSAC is a computational power consuming process, and the most computationally intensive step in RANSAC is iterating through the multiple subsets. Due to the availability of computational resources, there is a need to restrict the number of subsets depending on the available resources. However, such restriction is a tradeoff with the performance, as additional subsets being selected may improve the performance for a given computational complexity of the RANSAC algorithm. Therefore, there must be some intelligent choice of the subsets from all of the satellites for the balance between the performance and efficiency of the RANSAC module <b>270</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">In certain embodiments, the Doppler-pseudorange comparison places a confidence on each of the pseudorange measurements for the satellites, as the results of the Doppler-pseudorange comparison (e.g., the error rate of the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate) is an indicative factor to the selection of the subsets. In one embodiment, depending on the consistency of the results of the Doppler-pseudorange comparison for each of the satellites, a weight W<sub>i </sub>may be assigned to the corresponding the pseudorange measurements &#x3c1;<sub>i </sub>for each of the satellites, where a larger weight indicates a higher confidence on the measurement. For example, for each satellite, the weight could be an inverse of the error rate between the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate. In this case, for the satellites being determined as the outliers in the Doppler-pseudorange comparison, the corresponding weight W will be relatively small, and for the satellites with their status being undetermined in the Doppler-pseudorange comparison, the corresponding weight W will be relatively large. In one embodiments, for N satellites, the weights can be further normalized to obtain a probability distribution {W<sub>i</sub>} over the pseudorange measurements, where N is a positive integer, and i=1, 2, . . . , N. In this case, the normalized weight may be {W<sub>1</sub>, W<sub>2</sub>, . . . , W<sub>N</sub>}. Then, in the subset selection step of RANSAC, the random subsets can be selected or sampled based on the probability mass function as defined by the weights above. For example, if the RANSAC algorithm allows selecting M subsets from the N satellites, where M is a positive integer not greater than N, the selection result would likely be the M most likely inlier sets based on the Doppler rejection metric. In other words, the application of the weights increases the likelihood of selecting the correct inlier subsets in the RANSAC checking process, and the number of subsets that need to be computed in the RANSAC checking process is reduced.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> shows a flowchart of the RANSAC check performed by the RANSAC module <b>270</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> according to one embodiment of the invention.

For example, for each satellite, the weight could be an inverse of the error rate between the Doppler measurement and the pseudorange change rate. Then, at the process <b>420</b>, a probability distribution can be obtained by normalizing the weights {W<sub>i</sub>} for all of the satellites. Once the probability distribution is obtained, at process <b>430</b>, the subsets may be selected from the satellites randomly based on the normalizing weights for the satellites. Thus, the selection result of the subsets would likely be the M most likely inlier sets based on the results of the Doppler-pseudorange comparison. Then, at the process <b>440</b>, RANSAC is performed on the selected subsets. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> shows a pipeline flowchart of RANSAC according to one embodiment of the invention, in which single difference update is used as the RANSAC algorithm for better handling of the reference satellite outlier rejection.

Specifically, the status of each of the satellites (i.e., as the outlier/inliner) in previous epoch are stored and recorded in the state table <b>290</b>. Thus, a past time period may be determined such that a final check on the quality of the GNSS observations may be performed using the history recorded status of the satellites/subsets passing the Doppler-pseudorange comparison and the RANSAC check within the past time period. This is to exploit the correlation of outliers across time induced by multipath given the nature of multipath. In one embodiment, the past time period is variable based on a location of the GNSS receiver. For example, when the GNSS receiver is located in an open area with clear sky and no nearby obstacles, the past time period may be shorter (e.g., 1-3 seconds). On the other hand, when the GNSS receiver is located in an area where obstacles exist, the past time period may be longer (e.g., 5-7 seconds). In an alternative embodiment, the past time period may be a fixed time period for all cases.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058">Once the past time period is determined, for a specific satellite among the satellites/subsets whose status remain undetermined in the Doppler-pseudorange comparison and/or the RANSAC check, the history-based module <b>280</b> may check the state table <b>290</b> for the specific satellite within the past time period to determine the recorded status of the specific satellite within the past time period, and determine the status of the specific satellite based on the recorded status of the specific satellite within the past time period. If any of the recorded status of the specific satellite within the past time period is the outlier, the status of the specific satellite is determined as the outlier. In other words, a satellite being marked as an outlier will be continuously rejected and maintain the status as the outlier for a period of time (which depends on the past time period). On the other hand, if none of the recorded status of the specific satellite within the past time period is the outlier, the history-based module <b>280</b> may determine the status of the specific satellite as the inlier.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a flowchart of the RANSAC check performed by the history-based module <b>280</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> according to one embodiment of the invention.
