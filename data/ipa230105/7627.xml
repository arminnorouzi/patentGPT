LTE successor systems (e.g., LTE Advanced (LTE-A), New Radio (NR, also called 5G)), a Device to Device (D2D) technology in which terminals communicate directly with each other without a base station is being discussed (e.g., Non-Patent Document 1).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">D2D reduces traffics between terminals and base stations and enables communication between terminals even when a base station is unable to perform communication in time of a disaster, etc. Although 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) refers to D2D as a &#x201c;sidelink&#x201d;, the more generic term D2D is used herein. However, in the description of the embodiment described below, sidelink is also used as needed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">D2D communication is broadly classified into: D2D discovery for discovering other terminals capable of communication; and D2D communication (D2D direct communication, D2D communication, direct communication between terminals, etc.) for performing direct communication between terminals. Hereinafter, when D2D communication, D2D discovery, etc. are not specifically distinguished, it is simply called D2D. A signal sent and received by D2D is called as a D2D signal. Various use cases of Vehicle to Everything (V2X) services in NR have been discussed (e.g., Non-Patent Document 2).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">RELATED ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Non-Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">Non-Patent Document 1: 3GPP TS 36.211 V15.7.0(2019-09)</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0006">Non-Patent Document 2: 3GPP TR 22.886 V15.1.0(2017-03)</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0007">For terminal-to-terminal direct communication in NR-V2X, the sidelink HARQ (Hybrid automatic repeat request) response is supported. The PSFCH (Physical Sidelink Feedback Channel) in which HARQ responses are sent and received, is located at a symbol different from PSCCH (Physical Sidelink Control Channel) or PSSCH (Physical Sidelink Shared Channel). Therefore, because PSFCH and PSCCH/PSSCH are not frequency multiplexed, resources that are located in a symbol in which PSFCH is located, and that are not used for HARQ response transmission and reception, remain unused, resulting in reduced resource utilization efficiency.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0008">The present invention has been made in view of the above points and is intended to improve the efficiency of the utilization of resources related to the HARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request) response for direct communication between terminals.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving Problems</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0009">According to the disclosed technology, there is provided a terminal including a controller configured to specify a resource in frequency domain that is included in a time domain range in which a first channel used for transmitting a response related to retransmission control is allocated and is not used for transmitting the first channel;
