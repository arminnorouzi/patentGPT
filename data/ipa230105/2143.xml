Actuation of the pushbutton releases a quantity of product from the aerosol container through the valve and pushbutton orifice.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">More recently aerosol spray devices have been modified to look and function more like trigger sprayers and such devices may include a trigger attached to or in operable communication with a manifold which is in turn connected to the valve stem of an aerosol container. While trigger actuation is a recognized improvement for aerosol sprayers, accidental and inadvertent actuation of the trigger during both shipment and use is an ongoing issue of concern.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to exemplary embodiments of the invention, an aerosol trigger-type sprayer device may include a unique and novel locking mechanism which will prevent actuation of the trigger when engaged.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some embodiments of the aerosol sprayer may generally comprise a base configured to be received in assembled relation with an aerosol container, a manifold configured to be received in assembled relation with a valve stem of the aerosol container, a trigger pivotably attached to the base and operably engaged with the manifold, a cap received with the base, a sliding nozzle received within the cap, and a trigger locking mechanism comprising interfitting locking formations on the nozzle and the trigger.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The nozzle may have an exit orifice at a distal end, an inlet at a proximal end and a discharge path extending therebetween. There is a manifold port in a bottom wall of the guide channel which receives a terminal end of the manifold tube which extends upwardly through the center of the base.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The nozzle is slidably received within the guide channel in the cap wherein the nozzle and the cap are configured and arranged for sliding movement of the nozzle between a retracted (locked for shipping and storage) position wherein the inlet is not aligned with the manifold port and an extended position (operable use) wherein the nozzle inlet is aligned with the manifold port.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Certain exemplary embodiments will now be described to provide an overall understanding of the principles of the structure, function, manufacture, and use of the device and methods disclosed herein. One or more examples of these embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Those skilled in the art will understand that the devices and methods specifically described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings are non-limiting exemplary embodiments and that the scope of the present invention is defined solely by the claims. The features illustrated or described in connection with one exemplary embodiment may be combined with the features of other embodiments. Such modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the present disclosure. Further, in the present disclosure, like-numbered components of the embodiments generally have similar features, and thus within a particular embodiment each feature of each like-numbered component is not necessarily fully elaborated upon. Additionally, to the extent that linear or circular dimensions are used in the description of the disclosed systems, devices, and methods, such dimensions are not intended to limit the types of shapes that can be used in conjunction with such systems, devices, and methods. A person skilled in the art will recognize that an equivalent to such linear and circular dimensions can easily be determined for any geometric shape. Further, to the extent that directional terms like top, bottom, up, or down are used, they are not intended to limit the systems, devices, and methods disclosed herein. A person skilled in the art will recognize that these terms are merely relative to the system and device being discussed and are not universal.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to some embodiments of the invention, an aerosol sprayer may generally comprise a base configured to be received in assembled relation with an aerosol container, a manifold configured to be received in assembled relation with a valve stem of the aerosol container, a trigger pivotably attached to the base and operably engaged with the manifold, a cap received with the base, a sliding nozzle received within the cap, and a trigger locking mechanism comprising interfitting locking formations on the nozzle and the trigger.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The nozzle may have an exit orifice at a distal end, an inlet at a proximal end and a discharge path extending therebetween. There is a manifold port in a bottom wall of the guide channel which receives a terminal end of the manifold tube which extends upwardly through the center of the base.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The nozzle is slidably received within the guide channel wherein the nozzle and the cap are configured and arranged for sliding movement of the nozzle between a retracted (locked for shipping and storage) position wherein the inlet is not aligned with the manifold port and an extended position (operable use) wherein the nozzle inlet is aligned with the manifold port. Some embodiments may include a manifold port gasket to seal the connection therebetween.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In operable use of the aerosol sprayer the locking mechanism is engaged and the trigger is inoperable when the nozzle is in the retracted position, and the locking mechanism is disengaged and the trigger is operable when the nozzle is in the extended position. Furthermore, when the nozzle in an extended position, the aerosol orifice or exit location is extended further away from the fingers or hand of an operator using the aerosol sprayer. Thus, any drips, residual collection of product, or errant spray from the aerosol sprayer is less likely to contact the user.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Aerosol sprayers according to various embodiments of the invention may be made from moldable resin or plastic materials or other desirable materials. For example, a base may be molded from any desired resin or plastic. Similarly, a trigger may be molded from any desired resin or plastic. The materials used to form components of an aerosol actuator according to embodiments of the invention may also include other properties and may be colored in different manners to produce different aesthetic looks. For example, a base may be molded with one color and a trigger molded in another color. Embodiments of the invention are not limited by the material used to make the components of an aerosol actuator.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Aerosol sprayers according to various embodiments of the invention may be attached to any type of container as desired. For example, a conventional metal aerosol can may be used as a container with various embodiments of the invention. In other embodiments, a plastic container may be used. Also, any shaped container may be used with various embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">During operation of an aerosol actuator connected to a container according to various embodiments of the invention, a force may be applied to a trigger portion of the aerosol actuator. As force is applied to the trigger portion, the manifold moves. Upon reaching a certain force, the manifold may move a distance sufficient to open a valve to which the manifold is attached, allowing product to flow from a container, through the valve and into a product flow path in the manifold. Product may then exit the orifice. Upon release or decreased force upon the trigger portion, the trigger and manifold return to a non-actuated state in which the valve is moved into a closed position and the flow of product through the manifold ceases.
