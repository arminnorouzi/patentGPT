The aerosol provision system <b>100</b> comprises an aerosol generating component <b>110</b>. The aerosol generating component <b>110</b> is for generating an aerosol from an aerosol generating material. The aerosol provision system <b>100</b> also comprises a consumable <b>120</b> comprising aerosol generating material. The consumable <b>120</b> defines a surface at which at least part of the aerosol generating material is disposed, the surface having a characteristic extent in a first direction and a characteristic extent in a second direction. The aerosol provision system <b>100</b> also comprises a movement mechanism <b>130</b>. The movement mechanism <b>130</b> is for providing relative movement between the aerosol generating component <b>110</b> and the consumable <b>120</b>. The movement mechanism <b>130</b> is arranged to provide relative movement between the aerosol generating component <b>110</b> and the consumable <b>120</b> along an axis substantially parallel to the first direction and along an axis substantially parallel to the second direction.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The aerosol generating component <b>110</b> may be a heating element. The aerosol generating component <b>110</b> may be a heating mechanism or part of a heating mechanism. In an example, the aerosol generating component <b>110</b> may be a heater for providing heat to the aerosol generating material in the consumable <b>120</b>. The aerosol generating component <b>110</b> may be a resistive heater to provide heat to the consumable <b>120</b> from a current passed through it by an electrically connected power source. The aerosol generating component <b>110</b> may be made of metal or ceramic or the like. Alternatively or additionally, the aerosol generating component <b>110</b> may be an induction heater or a part of an inductive heating system for providing heat to the consumable <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The consumable <b>120</b> may be a block of aerosol generating material such as tobacco or the like. The consumable <b>120</b> may be a sheet of aerosol generating material such as tobacco or the like.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The surface defined by the consumable may be a curved surface or a flat surface. For example, the consumable may be a sheet or may be in the form of a sphere or the like. Therefore, the characteristic extent in the first direction and the second direction may relate to the projection of the surface onto a plane defined by the first direction and the second direction. In this sense, the surface may be a virtual surface.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a portion of an aerosol provision system <b>200</b> is shown in a perspective view. An aerosol generating component <b>210</b> and a consumable <b>120</b> are shown. In the example shown, the consumable <b>220</b> is relatively long in two directions (e.g. an &#x201c;x-direction&#x201d; and a &#x201c;y-direction&#x201d;) and is relatively short in one direction (e.g. a &#x201c;z-direction&#x201d;). The aerosol generating component <b>210</b> shown is of similar lengths in these directions.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The movement mechanism (not shown) may be configured to provide relative movement between the aerosol generating component <b>210</b> and the consumable <b>220</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, this may be in the two directions indicated by the arrow A and arrow B. These coincide with the two directions in which the consumable <b>220</b> is relatively long. As such, the relative movement allows, e.g., the aerosol generating component <b>210</b> to pass over the full extent of the large surface A of the consumable <b>220</b>. By pass over, this may mean that a lower side surface of the consumable <b>220</b> is passed by an upper side surface of the aerosol generating component <b>210</b>. Alternatively, a lower side surface of the aerosol generating component <b>210</b> may be passed by an upper side surface of the consumable <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The movement mechanism in this example and the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, may also be arranged to provide relative movement between the aerosol generating component <b>210</b> and the consumable <b>220</b> in one or more directions e.g. in the x, y, or z directions.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In another example, the movement mechanism may be configured to provide relative movement between the aerosol generating component <b>210</b> and the consumable <b>220</b> in an orthogonal direction relative to directions A and B i.e. the movement can be in the x, y or z direction. The relative movement can be provided in one or more directions simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a portion of an aerosol provision system <b>300</b> is shown in a perspective view.

In this way, the relative movement may allow for individual alignment of regions of the consumable <b>320</b> with the aerosol generating component <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In an example, the consumable <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b> may comprise a carrier support on which the aerosol generating material is arranged.

The carrier support may be flat or may be curved in some manner.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The carrier support may be formed of a material which is thermally conductive to more easily allow heat to pass from the aerosol generating component <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> to the aerosol generating material on the carrier support. In an example, the carrier support may be formed of an inductive material, such as aluminum.

Moving the aerosol generating component <b>310</b> in the aerosol provision system efficiently uses the space within the aerosol provision system. The consumable <b>320</b> may be provided to fill part of the aerosol provision system. The aerosol generating component <b>310</b> may then be moved within that part of the aerosol provision system to then generate an aerosol from different regions <b>320</b>A, <b>320</b>B of the consumable <b>320</b>. This results from the aerosol generating component <b>310</b> typically having a smaller area than the area of the consumable <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Alternatively, the movement provided by the movement mechanism (not shown) may be provided to the consumable <b>320</b>. The aerosol generating component <b>310</b> will have associated electronics to deliver electrical signals for operation. Moving the aerosol generating component <b>310</b> may involve also moving such electronics. Therefore, moving the consumable <b>320</b> (which may have no associated electronics) is an organizationally simpler task. Furthermore, the consumable <b>320</b> could be arranged on a moving surface to provide movement to the consumable <b>320</b>. This may also operate to increase the ease of insertion of the consumable <b>320</b> into the aerosol provision system, e.g. if the moving surface assists moving the consumable <b>320</b> from an edge of the aerosol provision system to a central heating portion of the aerosol provision system. The moving surface may be a conveyor belt system or the like for providing entry to the aerosol provision system from an opening on the outer of the aerosol provision system to a heating portion inside the aerosol provision system.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a portion of an aerosol provision system <b>400</b> is shown.

In the example wherein the aerosol generating component <b>410</b> is a resistive heater, the heat will transfer more efficiently over the shorter distance between the heater and the consumable <b>420</b>. As such, a greater amount of aerosol will be provided during one heating process. As such, the power source of the aerosol provision system <b>400</b> is more efficiently used thereby improving the lifetime of the aerosol provision system on one full charge of the power source.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In a specific example, the movement mechanism <b>430</b> is arranged to provide relative movement between the aerosol generating component <b>410</b> and the consumable <b>420</b> along an axis perpendicular to the first direction and the second direction (the &#x201c;z&#x201d; axis) to provide contact between the aerosol generating component <b>410</b> and the consumable <b>420</b>.
