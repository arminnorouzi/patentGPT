Isolated power combiners are employed to maintain isolation between these components, particularly in view of plural component amplifiers in large systems. The isolated power combiners include one or more terminating resistors to prevent the impact of the power of one component amplifier on the output of another component amplifier in the system. Achieving this ideal result, however, requires signals with the proper amplitude and phase values. These are most commonly implemented by employing identical component amplifiers or at least a means to adjust the amplitude and phase of the output signals. Otherwise, one or more terminating resistors in the power combiners absorbs a percentage of the power. In extreme cases, the absorption can reach 100%.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While low gain power amplifier systems may not experience as severe consequences when input and output powers of component amplifiers are not identical, this does not hold true for power amplifier systems with high gain and/or many tiers of combining component amplifiers. Varying manufacturing tolerances associated with plural component amplifiers contribute to very large differences in overall gain and phase of the component amplifiers causing degradation in linearity and efficiency. Absent some way to adjust, large amounts of power will be dissipated in one or more power combiners in the system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Adjusting for optimal system performance in terms of amplifier gain and phase in complex amplifier systems poses a host of challenges.

For example, 3-way and higher power amplifier systems with an odd number of component amplifiers is architecturally designed by a specific ratio.

Ultimately, the ratio of power splitters to component amplifiers in a 4-way power amplification system is 3:4. Similarly, the ratio of power combiners to component amplifiers in the 4-way power amplification system is 3:4. Hence the overall ratio of power splitters, component amplifiers and power combiners in a 4-way power amplification system is 3:4:3.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Exemplary component amplifiers are at least manufactured by CACI and Amplifier Research Corporation. Exemplary power combiner types are at least manufactured by Wilkinson, Geysel, Branchline, and Lange. Generally, these power combiners have one or more terminating resistors preventing power from one component amplifier to affect output of another component amplifier. Stated differently, a signal applied to an input port will only flow to the output port. All power will sum at the output provided the input signals have the proper amplitude and phase relative to the split ratio of the combiner. This requires component amplifiers to be identical, or alternatively, have other means to adjust the amplitude and phase of the output signals. If the input signals to the combiner do not have the proper amplitude and phase, the terminating resistor(s) will absorb some percentage of the power. This may have an upper bound of 100% in the extreme cases. The comment above is due to the fact that architectures that use unequal split splitters and combiners will not have the same amplitude at each port.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In power amplifier systems having high gain and/or many tiers of combining, the manufacturing tolerances involved may result in very large differences in overall gain and phase of the component amplifiers. Absent some means for adjustment, linearity and efficiency will be degraded. As a result, large amounts of power will be dissipated into the combiner. Adaptive control of the power amplification system is required. Adaptive control may be necessary. According to another aspect of the application, a method and apparatus are described for the simultaneous, automatic and continuous adjustment of an unlimited number of parameters to achieve the best balance and performance of an amplifier consisting of multiple paralleled component amplifiers. The architecture achieves these results without impairing payload signal, and effectively deals with variations due to temperature, voltage, signal characteristics, load impedance and other parameters.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an exemplary embodiment of the invention portraying a 2-way power amplification system <b>200</b>.

S<b>2</b><i>a</i>, S<b>2</b><i>b </i>are fed to respective downstream gain and phase modulators <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>. The gain and phase modulators <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>may be the combination of a phase shifter and an attenuator. Alternatively, the gain and phase modulators <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>may be a vector modulator driven by sin and cosine signals controlling phase and gain. In one embodiment, the gain and phase modulators <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>are located within a single device. In an alternative embodiment, the gain and phase modulators may be separate and operably coupled to one other in a subsystem.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Signals S<b>2</b><i>a</i>, S<b>2</b><i>b </i>are subsequently fed to respective component amplifiers <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>. Then, the amplified signals S<b>2</b><i>a</i>, S<b>2</b><i>b </i>are fed to a power combiner unit <b>230</b>. The power combiner unit <b>230</b> combines amplified signals S<b>2</b><i>a</i>, S<b>2</b><i>b </i>via two power combiners <b>230</b><i>a</i>, <b>230</b><i>b </i>located therein. In an embodiment, power combiners <b>230</b><i>a</i>, <b>230</b><i>b </i>are in-phase and equal in magnitude.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another embodiment, power combiner unit <b>230</b> includes one or more grounded termination resistors. The power at the termination resistor approaches zero when the component amplifiers approach perfect balance. As a result, a very sensitive method to determine the optimum settings achieved by the power amplification system <b>200</b>. Alternatively, power could be measured at an output of the power combiner unit <b>230</b> with adjustments made to maximize power.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In yet another embodiment, power combiner unit <b>230</b> includes a power detector <b>235</b> configured to detect power absorbed by the termination resistor. Ultimately, a combined signal SO is output from power combiners <b>230</b><i>a</i>, <b>230</b><i>b</i>. Preferably, the power combiner unit <b>230</b> digitizes signal SO.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to a further embodiment, power amplification system <b>200</b> may also include a processor and controller operably coupled to the gain and phase modulators <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>. Here, the processor and controller may include a Walsh generator <b>202</b> configured to provide balance to the power amplification system <b>200</b>. Alternatively, the system <b>200</b> can include a separate, standalone controller including a Walsh code generator, signal processor, and control circuits. The Walsh generator <b>202</b> operates in accordance with known principles to one skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the Walsh generator <b>202</b> generates first and second Walsh codes <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>202</b><i>b </i>and transmits both Walsh codes to each gain and phase modulator <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b</i>. Specifically, generated Walsh codes <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>202</b><i>b </i>are orthogonal to one another. And one set of the Walsh codes is inverted in relation to another set of Walsh codes. As exemplarily shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, inverters <b>203</b><i>a</i>, <b>203</b><i>b </i>are located between Walsh generator <b>202</b> and gain and phase modulator <b>210</b><i>b</i>. Alternatively, the inverters <b>203</b><i>a</i>, <b>203</b><i>b </i>may be located between Walsh generator <b>202</b> and gain and phase modulator <b>210</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The amplitudes of the Walsh codes <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>202</b><i>b </i>are very small and impart slight variations to the phase and amplitude of the signals applied to the component amplifiers. Importantly, the effect of the Walsh codes on one component amplifier, e.g., <b>220</b><i>a</i>, causes a gain and phase change in one direction, while the effect of the inverse Walsh codes on the other component amplifier, i.e., <b>220</b><i>b</i>, causes gain and phase changes in the other direction. Therefore, the effect on the signal output SO leaving the power combiner unit <b>230</b> will be minimal. In an exemplary embodiment, when the amplifier is in a balanced state, either a +/&#x2212;0.5 dB change in component amplifier gain or a +/&#x2212;2.5 degree change in phase will produce less than a 0.01 dB change in overall output power with no change in phase.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">These same changes however will have a very large effect on the power absorbed by the combiner's termination resistor. For example, when the initial balance is sufficient to keep the dissipated power in the termination resistor to 30 dB below that of the output power, a component amplifier gain change of +/&#x2212;0.5 dB or a phase change of +/&#x2212;2.5 degrees will yield power changes at the termination resistor of roughly 5 dB. Very small gain and phase changes can be made in this differential fashion that have virtually no effect on the output signal when the amplifier is balanced, and still be detected easily with high sensitivity at the termination resistor.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition to the benefits noted above for differential adjustment of gain and phase of the component amplifiers, the architectures and methods described herein also prevent driving both component amplifier gains to a minimum ultimately causing a minimum at the terminating resistor. Likewise, power measured at the output will prevent driving both component amplifier gains to a maximum causing a maximum at the output SO. Either case is indicative of the amplifier being unbalanced and not optimally configured.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The power detector <b>235</b> communicates with the terminating resistor of the power combiner unit <b>230</b>. Power detector <b>235</b> will detect any change in power. The power detector <b>235</b> may operably be coupled to a downstream digital signal processor (DSP) or other processor, or alternatively include a DSP or other processor therein, to modulate the detected power when a variation is observed. Namely, the DSP can synchronously multiply, employing multipliers or multiplier functionalities <b>205</b><i>a</i>, <b>205</b><i>b</i>, the individual Walsh codes. The multiplied variation is then accumulated, employing accumulators or accumulator functionalities <b>206</b><i>a</i>, <b>206</b><i>b</i>, over the length of the code.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Non-zero results are indicative of the component amplifiers being in imperfect balance. In such instance, the non-zero results are used as feedback to drive the loop in the direction of best balance. More specifically as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the non-zero results are subtracted, at summers or summer functionalities <b>207</b><i>a</i>, <b>207</b><i>b</i>, and fed back to gain and phase modulator <b>210</b><i>a</i>. Moreover, the non-zero results are added, at summer or summer functionalities <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>b</i>, to gain and phase modulator <b>210</b><i>b</i>. Since the individual Walsh codes are orthogonal, adjustment of gain and phase occurs simultaneously. Hence, a global optimized balance in the power amplification system is quickly reached without an iterative approach.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The maximum loop bandwidth is bounded by the length of the Walsh codes and the speed at which the attenuators and phase shifters can be controlled. These functions may be performed in a DSP or a similar processor.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an alternative embodiment, other orthogonal codes may be used or non-orthogonal sequences such as shifted versions of a pseudo-noise code. Here, longer integration times are required since the shifted codes are not truly orthogonal. Very long codes are needed to avoid a residual offset. Walsh codes are ideal because they are easily generated, can be any desired length, and when multiplied with other codes in the same series yields zero accumulated output regardless of the code's length.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to a further embodiment of the application, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a 3-way power amplification system <b>300</b> with power values in decibels (dB) included for power splitters <b>301</b><i>a</i>, <b>301</b><i>b </i>and power combiners <b>330</b><i>a</i>, <b>330</b><i>b</i>. Generally, in 3-way and higher power amplifier systems with an odd number of component amplifiers, a ratio of 2:1:2 is preferred in connection with the power splitters, component amplifiers and power combiners, respectively. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the power splitter <b>301</b><i>a </i>exhibits the same power ratio (dB) as power combiner <b>330</b><i>a</i>. Moreover, power splitter <b>301</b><i>b </i>exhibits the same power ratio (dB) as power combiner <b>330</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this configuration, splitters <b>301</b><i>a </i>and <b>330</b><i>a </i>are not equally split. Specifically, one splitter exhibits power of &#x2212;1.76 dB while the other splitter exhibits power of &#x2212;4.77 dB. Namely, one port sources or sinks &#x2153; of the total power and the other port sources or sinks &#x2154; of the total power. The signal levels should reflect this relationship.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thus for splitter <b>301</b><i>a</i>, the top port is &#x2212;1.76 dB (&#x2154; in power) because it feeds a pair of two amplifiers (<b>320</b><i>a </i>and <b>320</b><i>b</i>) through splitter <b>301</b><i>b</i>. This is &#x2154; of the total power because it is 2 out of the 3 amplifiers. The lower port of <b>301</b><i>a </i>exhibits power of &#x2212;4.77 dB (&#x2153; the power) and feeds a single amplifier (<b>320</b>C). The combining is exactly the opposite. Here, the output signal levels at <b>301</b><i>a </i>and the input signals at <b>330</b><i>a </i>are not equal. One, 1 splitter represents &#x2154; of the power and the other &#x2153; splitter of the power. The splitter and combiner are configured to match that ratio, with the net result being all power exiting the output port and none burned up in the terminating resistors. It is appreciated in this application that configurations using equal ratio splitters and combiners are easier to understand because the signal levels at the splitters and the combiners are the same. Nevertheless the teachings proposed above are the same.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to yet even another embodiment of the application, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an 8-way power amplification system <b>400</b>. The 8-way power amplification system <b>400</b> includes an initial power splitter <b>401</b>, intermediate power splitters <b>405</b><i>a </i>(<b>405</b><i>b</i>-<b>405</b><i>g </i>not labeled), gain and phase modulators <b>410</b><i>a </i>(<b>410</b><i>b</i>-<b>410</b><i>h </i>not labeled), component amplifiers <b>420</b><i>a </i>(<b>420</b><i>b</i>-<b>420</b><i>h </i>not labeled), intermediate power detectors <b>435</b><i>a </i>(<b>435</b><i>b</i>-<b>435</b><i>f</i>), intermediate power combiners <b>430</b><i>a </i>(<b>430</b><i>b</i>-<i>g </i>not labeled), final power detector <b>455</b>, and final power combiner <b>450</b>. Naturally, an even numbered power amplification system that is 4-way or higher power amplification system exhibits a ratio of 3:4:3 with respect to total number of power splitters, component amplifiers and total power combiners. For simplicity, the 8-way power amplification system <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, does not show the Walsh generator, inverters, multipliers, accumulators and summing junctions for simplicity. The gain and phase modulators <b>410</b><i>a</i>-<i>h </i>and component amplifiers <b>420</b><i>a</i>-<i>h </i>are similar in design as described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Importantly, there is only one gain and phase modulator for every component amplifier as shown in the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In other words, a 1:1 ratio for gain and phase modulators and component amplifiers is preferred for power amplification systems with an even number of component amplifiers. The gain and phase modulators match individual pairs of component amplifiers. The gain and phase modulators also match pairs of the individual pairs of component amplifiers. Additional gain and phase modulators therefore are not required for each tier of power splitting and combining in the system. As a result, overall gain and phase of the complete system can be controlled when global gain and phase control inputs are summed with the Walsh codes.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, each tier of power combination has a unique pair of Walsh codes and their inverses are summed with the Walsh codes of other tiers. This is performed prior to being fed to the gain and phase modulators <b>410</b><i>a</i>-<b>410</b><i>h</i>. In this embodiment, the system <b>800</b> includes eight Walsh codes and their inverses. With each 2-way combination, the termination resistor power is measured, multiplied by the respective Walsh codes, and accumulated. Thereafter the results are subtracted or added to the feedback as required to drive the loops towards best balance. While interactions between component amplifiers is possible in view of less than ideal power combiners and gain and phase modulators (including phase shifters and attenuators), the simultaneous characteristics of the Walsh code algorithm minimizes these effects to achieve best overall power amplifier balance in the shortest amount of time.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to yet a further embodiment of the application, in cold start conditions, the initial gain and phase of the component amplifiers may be far from their final or desired values. Although, it should mathematically be possible to simultaneously achieve convergence of all loops, it may be advantageous to sequentially converge the loops. Sequential convergence of the loops involves beginning from the inner tiers of the system and ending with the outer tiers. Once convergence is achieved, all loops may simultaneously be run and maintained for best balance of all stages irrespective of temperature, voltage, signal level or signal characteristics. For any stored convergence values, any subsequent start-ups may immediately be performed with all loops running simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to yet even a further embodiment, the power combiners are envisaged to be zero degree (in-phase), 180-degree, 90-degree, arbitrary phase, and combinations thereof. Similarly, the amplitude of the power combiners may also be different.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to another aspect of the application, a module architecture is shown in the exemplary embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is envisaged apart from the single integrated unit depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Namely, individual, high-gain, high-power amplifiers may be combined with little concern for: (i) amplifier-to-amplifier differences in gain and phase, (ii) differences in splitter and combiner loss and phase; and/or (iii) differences in connecting cable loss or length. Total delay variations through the system will still need to be kept within reasonable limits to maintain acceptable instantaneous bandwidth. Even if delay differences are substantial the adaptive system can adjust when large frequency changes are made.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The modular amplifier system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is architecturally the same as the amplifier shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Specifically, ordinary passive 2-way power splitters are used at the input. The power output combiners are 2-way with detectors built in. As an example, the individual amplifiers are high gain (perhaps 50 to 60 dB) and high output power (500 Watts for instance). When the configuration includes eight amplifiers cabled together, the combined output power can approach 4 kW adaptive control. With such high-gain, high-power amplifiers, doing this without adaptive control to keep the amplifiers in balance would be problematic.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">While the system and method have been described in terms of what are presently considered to be specific embodiments, the disclosure need not be limited to the disclosed embodiments.
