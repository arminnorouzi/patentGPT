To achieve adequate drug exposure many drugs require administration daily or more frequently. However, with such frequent administration requirements, any number of circumstances can affect patient compliance and required frequency of consumption. If the drug is delivered via a slow-release mechanism, this can reduce the uncertainty associated with drug delivery to the patient and reduce the burden of responsibility on the patient. However, current technology is limited with respect to control of drug release rate. Polymer matrices are not sufficiently tunable to release a drug in vivo with desired levels of speed control. Therefore, there exists a need for new methods and mechanisms of drug release.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The technology disclosed herein enables tunable release of drugs from a compound (e.g., a polymer matrix comprising allyl lactide, lactide, and optionally glycolide residues). The release rate of drugs can be controlled by crosslinking density. In some embodiments, the release rate of drugs can be controlled by the molecular weight of the compound.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments described herein relate generally to compounds comprising allyl lactide residues. A tunable and predictable release rate of a drug can be achieved with the proper compound development, crosslinking density, and residues disclosed herein.

Drug delivery is a parameter that can be finely and predictably tuned in order to deliver a pharmaceutical compound in a patient to achieve a desired therapeutic effect. In addition to the location within the patient's body, the time frame over which the pharmaceutical compound is delivered is an important parameter that can be manipulated to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. Polymers can often be combined with a drug, and the structural characteristics of the polymers can influence the release rate of the drug from the polymer. These structural characteristics can include the types of residues, the molecular weight, the degree of crosslinking, and several other parameters. Specifically, compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which include allyl lactide residues, lactide residues, and are substantially free of valerolactone residue, can be beneficial in the slow delivery of a drug to a patient, as the exclusion of valerolactone residues gives way to finer control of polymer degradation. That is, the claimed compounds enable tunable, predictable degradation and drug release profiles as a function of crosslinking density. A controlled delivery of a drug can include the release of a drug over a period of at least 30 days. In some embodiments, a controlled delivery of a drug can include the release of a drug over a period of less than 30 days (e.g., with polymers including lactide and/or glycolide residues).</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0121" num="0104">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.

In some embodiments, the co-administered compounds are administered separately as part of a single therapeutic approach. In some embodiments, the co-administered compounds are administered in any kind of combination as part of a single therapeutic approach.

In some embodiments, the container is not the packaging that contains the pharmaceutical composition, i.e., the container is a receptacle, such as a box or vial that contains the packaged pharmaceutical composition or unpackaged pharmaceutical composition and the instructions for use of the pharmaceutical composition. In some embodiments, packaging techniques are well known in the art. It should be understood that the instructions for use of the pharmaceutical composition may be contained on the packaging containing the pharmaceutical composition, and as such the instructions form an increased functional relationship to the packaged product.
