This growth, so-called a lesion, can occur on reproductive organs but rare endometriosis form (20% of cases) exist. This rare form, so-called extrapelvic form, is characterized by the presence of functional endometrial glands and stroma in several locations, such as lungs, pleura, kidneys, bladder, abdominal wall, umbilicus, and cesarean section scar (cutaneous endometriosis form) among others as classified by the Orphanet rare disease classification (ORPHA:137820).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disease affects at least 10% of women of reproductive age (approximatively 300 millions of women around the world) with a 0.1% annual incidence of endometriosis among women aged 15-49 years and with a peak between 25 years and 35 years of age. [Parazzini, F., Vercellini, P. &#x26; Pelucchi, C. in <i>Endometriosis science and practice </i>(eds Giudice, L. C., Johannes, L. H. &#x26; Healy, D.

Obstet. Gynaecol. </i>18, 177-200 (2004)]. This disease is associated to pelvic pain and infertility [L. C. Giudice, &#x201c;<i>Clinical practice. Endometriosis,&#x201d; New England Journal of Medicine</i>, vol. 362, no. 25, pp. 2389-2398, 2010] [S. E. Bulun, &#x201c;<i>Endometriosis,&#x201d; New England Journal of Medicine</i>, vol. 360, no. 3, pp. 268-279, 2009].</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Clinical manifestations are menstrually-related and depend on the location of the ectopic tissue, but in general include pain, mass/nodule, swelling and/or bleeding in the involved area.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Three different phenotypes are recognized including superficial, ovarian endometrioma and deep infiltrating endometriosis. The disease is associated with adenomyosis in approximately 30% of the patients. This disease should be considered as an important public health problem having a major effect on the quality of women's life as being long time a substantial economic burden. Medical treatment is the first line therapeutic option for patients with pelvic pain and no desire for immediate pregnancy. In patients with infertility, careful consideration should be made regarding whether to provide assisted reproductive technologies prior to performing endometriosis surgery. Hormonal medication that suppresses the natural cycle, when combined with pain medication, is the typical treatment. These previous hormonal treatments of endometriosis have focused on shutting down estradiol production from the ovary. The failure of this direction of therapy is that it does not suppress estrone from the adrenal glands or environmental toxins (xeno-estrogens) leaking out of the adipose tissue.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Among the hormones which have been used to treat endometriosis are progestogens oral contraceptives and the like modern endometriosis management should be individualized with a patient centered multi modal and interdisciplinary integrated approach.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therapeutically, there main options exist for endometriosis treatment, including medical treatment, surgery and assisted reproductive technology (ART).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Hormonal treatment widely used are effective for the treatment of the symptoms but are not curative, that is, they relieve pain without eliminating the endometriotic lesions. For patients who do not respond to hormonal therapy, new drugs are urgently needed. Novel emerging drugs including GnRH antagonists, selective oestrogen or progesterone receptor modulators, anti-angiogenic drugs, anti-oxydants, immunomodulators as well as certain epigenetic agents represent a new promising treatment, though all require more thorough experimental and clinical evaluation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As defined by the claims, the present invention relates to the use of neuropilin antagonists for the treatment of endometriosis.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Here, the inventors show that the use of Neuropilin/VEGF binding inhibitors, so called, Neuropilin antagonist (NRPa), bring new perspective to treat and cure endometriosis in women suffering thereof. NRPa alone is efficient to inhibit primary endometrial cell proliferation and apoptosis/necrosis program cell death of targeted cells. The effective NRPa concentration needed is very low (NRPa-48 IC<sub>50</sub>=10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup>M) and is dependent of the NRPa structure. Moreover, the association of NRPa with progestatif drug increase the anti-proliferatif effect.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, the first object of the present invention relates to a method of treating endometriosis in a patient in need thereof comprising administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a neuropilin antagonist (NRPa).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As used herein, the term &#x201c;endometriosis&#x201d; has its general meaning in the art (see Background section&#x201d;. In particular, the term includes peritoneal endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis, deep endometriosis and extrapelvic endometriosis.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As used herein the term &#x201c;patient&#x201d; refers to a mammalian female to which the present invention may be applied. Typically said mammal is a human (i.e. a woman), but may concern other mammals such as primates, dogs, cats, pigs, sheep, cows.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As used herein, the term &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; or &#x201c;treat&#x201d; refer to both prophylactic or preventive treatment as well as curative or disease modifying treatment, including treatment of patient at risk of contracting the disease or suspected to have contracted the disease as well as patients who are ill or have been diagnosed as suffering from a disease or medical condition, and includes suppression of clinical relapse. The treatment may be administered to a patient having a medical disorder or who ultimately may acquire the disorder, in order to prevent, cure, delay the onset of, reduce the severity of, or ameliorate one or more symptoms of a disorder or recurring disorder, or in order to prolong the survival of a patient beyond that expected in the absence of such treatment. By &#x201c;therapeutic regimen&#x201d; is meant the pattern of treatment of an illness, e.g., the pattern of dosing used during therapy. A therapeutic regimen may include an induction regimen and a maintenance regimen. The phrase &#x201c;induction regimen&#x201d; or &#x201c;induction period&#x201d; refers to a therapeutic regimen (or the portion of a therapeutic regimen) that is used for the initial treatment of a disease. The general goal of an induction regimen is to provide a high level of drug to a patient during the initial period of a treatment regimen. An induction regimen may employ (in part or in whole) a &#x201c;loading regimen&#x201d;, which may include administering a greater dose of the drug than a physician would employ during a maintenance regimen, administering a drug more frequently than a physician would administer the drug during a maintenance regimen, or both. The phrase &#x201c;maintenance regimen&#x201d; or &#x201c;maintenance period&#x201d; refers to a therapeutic regimen (or the portion of a therapeutic regimen) that is used for the maintenance of a patient during treatment of an illness, e.g., to keep the patient in remission for long periods of time (months or years). A maintenance regimen may employ continuous therapy (e.g., administering a drug at a regular interval, e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly, etc.) or intermittent therapy (e.g., interrupted treatment, intermittent treatment, treatment at relapse, or treatment upon achievement of a particular predetermined criteria [e.g., pain, disease manifestation, etc.]). In particular, in the case of AMLs, maintenance therapy may eradicate clinically invisible minimal residual disease.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">More particularly, the term &#x201c;treatment of endometriosis&#x201d; includes treatment to reduce (or remove) the amount of endometrial tissue which is present inside and/or outside the uterine cavity (e.g. reduction or removal of endometriotic lesions); and/or treatment to reduce and/or ameliorate one or more symptoms associated with endometriosis (e.g. treatment to ameliorate and/or reduce the symptoms of dysmenorrhoea; treatment to ameliorate and/or reduce the symptoms of dyspareunia, and/or treatment to ameliorate and/or reduce pelvic pain). The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) defines a classification system for the various stages of endometriosis, dividing this into four stages (stage IV most severe; stage I least severe) [American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine classification of endometriosis: 1996. Fertil Steril 1997; 67,817 821.]. Thus, the term &#x201c;treatment of endometriosis&#x201d; includes treatment to reduce the severity of the condition as measured by ASRM classification, e.g. treatment to reduce the severity of the endometriosis from Stage IV, III, II, or I to a lower stage, or until the symptoms are completely alleviated.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, the term &#x201c;neuropilin&#x201d; or &#x201c;NRP&#x201d; has its general meaning in the art and refers to a transmembrane glycoprotein that typically consists of five domains: three extracellular domains (a1 a2, b1, b2 and c), a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain. There are two neuropilin members: neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) and neuropilin-2 (NRP-2) that are share 44% sequence homology. Neuropilins are multifunctional non-tyrosine kinase receptors for some members of VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) family members, including VEGF-A<sub>165 </sub>and for others ligands such as, but not limited to class 3 semaphorin, TGF-&#x3b2; (transforming growth factor beta-1), HGF (hepatocyte growth factor), FGF (fibroblast growth factor), and PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) [Neuropilin-1 as therapeutic target for malignant melanoma. Front. Oncol., 3 Jun. 2015 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2015.00125].</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As used herein, the term &#x201c;neuropilin antagonist&#x201d; refers to a molecule that partially or fully blocks, inhibits, or neutralizes a biological activity or expression of a neuropilin protein. A neuropilin antagonist can be a molecule of any type that interferes with the signalling associated with at least one or more neuropilin family members (e.g. NRP-1 or NRP-2) in a cell, for example, either by decreasing transcription or translation of neuropilin-encoding nucleic acid, or by inhibiting or blocking neuropilin polypeptide activity, or both. Examples of neuropilin antagonists include, but are not limited to, antisense polynucleotides, interfering RNAs, catalytic RNAs, RNA-DNA chimeras, neuropilin-specific aptamers, anti-neuropilin antibodies, neuropilin-binding fragments of anti-neuropilin antibodies, neuropilin-binding small molecules, neuropilin-binding peptides, and other polypeptides that specifically bind neuropilin (including, but not limited to, neuropilin-binding fragments of one or more neuropilin ligands, optionally fused to one or more additional domains), such that the interaction between the neuropilin antagonist and neuropilin results in a reduction or cessation of neuropilin activity or expression. In particular, neuropilin antagonist inhibits the interaction between a neuropilin protein (e.g. NRP-1) and one of its partners, in particular VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Neuropilin antagonists are well known in the art and typically include those describe in:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0019">Liu W Q, Megale V, Borriello L, Leforban B, Montes M, Goldwaser E, Gresh N, Piquemal J P, Hadj-Slimane R, Hermine O, Garbay C, Raynaud F, Lepelletier Y, Demange L.

In some embodiments, said inhibitor of gene expression is a siRNA, an antisense oligonucleotide or a ribozyme. For example, anti-sense oligonucleotides, including anti-sense RNA molecules and anti-sense DNA molecules, would act to directly block the translation of NRP-1 mRNA by binding thereto and thus preventing protein translation or increasing mRNA degradation, thus decreasing the level of NRP-1, and thus activity, in a cell. For example, antisense oligonucleotides of at least about 15 bases and complementary to unique regions of the mRNA transcript sequence encoding NRP-1 can be synthesized, e.g., by conventional phosphodiester techniques. Methods for using antisense techniques for specifically inhibiting gene expression of genes whose sequence is known are well known in the art (e.g. see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,566,135; 6,566,131; 6,365,354; 6,410,323; 6,107,091; 6,046,321; and 5,981,732). Small inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs) can also function as inhibitors of expression for use in the present invention. NRP-1 gene expression can be reduced by contacting a patient or cell with a small double stranded RNA (dsRNA), or a vector or construct causing the production of a small double stranded RNA, such that NRP-1 gene expression is specifically inhibited (i.e. RNA interference or RNAi). Antisense oligonucleotides, siRNAs, shRNAs and ribozymes of the invention may be delivered in vivo alone or in association with a vector. In its broadest sense, a &#x201c;vector&#x201d; is any vehicle capable of facilitating the transfer of the antisense oligonucleotide, siRNA, shRNA or ribozyme nucleic acid to the cells and typically cells expressing NRP-1. Typically, the vector transports the nucleic acid to cells with reduced degradation relative to the extent of degradation that would result in the absence of the vector. In general, the vectors useful in the invention include, but are not limited to, plasmids, phagemids, viruses, other vehicles derived from viral or bacterial sources that have been manipulated by the insertion or incorporation of the antisense oligonucleotide, siRNA, shRNA or ribozyme nucleic acid sequences. Viral vectors are a preferred type of vector and include, but are not limited to nucleic acid sequences from the following viruses: retrovirus, such as moloney murine leukemia virus, harvey murine sarcoma virus, murine mammary tumor virus, and rous sarcoma virus; adenovirus, adeno-associated virus; SV40-type viruses; polyoma viruses; Epstein-Barr viruses; papilloma viruses; herpes virus; vaccinia virus; polio virus; and RNA virus such as a retrovirus. One can readily employ other vectors not named but known to the art. In some embodiments, the inhibitor of expression is an endonuclease. In a particular embodiment, the endonuclease is CRISPR-cas. In some embodiment, the endonuclease is CRISPR-cas9, which is from <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,697,359 B1 and US 2014/0068797. In some embodiment, the endonuclease is CRISPR-Cpf1, which is the more recently characterized CRISPR from Provotella and <i>Francisella </i>1 (Cpf1) in Zetsche et al. (&#x201c;Cpf1 is a Single RNA-guided Endonuclease of a Class 2 CRISPR-Cas System (2015); Cell; 163, 1-13).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0040">A &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve a desired therapeutic result. A therapeutically effective amount of drug may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of drug to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the antibody or antibody portion are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. The efficient dosages and dosage regimens for drug depend on the disease or condition to be treated and may be determined by the persons skilled in the art. A physician having ordinary skill in the art may readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example, the physician could start doses of drug employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. In general, a suitable dose of a composition of the present invention will be that amount of the compound, which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect according to a particular dosage regimen. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above. For example, a therapeutically effective amount for therapeutic use may be measured by its ability to stabilize the progression of disease. A therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic compound may decrease tumour size, or otherwise ameliorate symptoms in a subject. One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to determine such amounts based on such factors as the subject's size, the severity of the subject's symptoms, and the particular composition or route of administration selected. An exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically effective amount of drug is about 0.1-100 mg/kg, such as about 0.1-50 mg/kg, for example about 0.1-20 mg/kg, such as about 0.1-10 mg/kg, for instance about 0.5, about such as 0.3, about 1, about 3 mg/kg, about 5 mg/kg or about 8 mg/kg. An exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody of the present invention is 0.02-100 mg/kg, such as about 0.02-30 mg/kg, such as about 0.05-10 mg/kg or 0.1-3 mg/kg, for example about 0.5-2 mg/kg. Administration may e.g. be intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous, and for instance administered proximal to the site of the target. Dosage regimens in the above methods of treatment and uses are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. In some embodiments, the efficacy of the treatment is monitored during the therapy, e.g. at predefined points in time. As non-limiting examples, treatment according to the present invention may be provided as a daily dosage of the agent of the present invention in an amount of about 0.1-100 mg/kg, such as 0.2, 0.5, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 mg/kg, per day, on at least one of days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, or 40, or alternatively, at least one of weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20 after initiation of treatment, or any combination thereof, using single or divided doses every 24, 12, 8, 6, 4, or 2 hours, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0041">The mode of administration selected will depend on the acuteness and severity of the condition being treated. Any mode of administration that produces desired therapeutic effect without unacceptable adverse effects is relevant in practicing the invention. Such modes of administration may include oral, rectal, topical, transdermal, sublingual, intramuscular, parenteral, intravenous, intracavity, vaginal, and adhesive matrix to be used during surgery. Vaginal administration of the neuropilin antagonist is also possible, for example by vaginal pessary or tablet, or by vaginal ring.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0042">Typically, the drug of the present invention is administered to the subject in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, which comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers that may be used in these compositions include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, polyethylene glycol and wool fat. For use in administration to a subject, the composition will be formulated for administration to the subject. Sterile injectable forms of the compositions of this invention may be aqueous or an oleaginous suspension. These suspensions may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents that are commonly used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms including emulsions and suspensions. Other commonly used surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and other emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of formulation. The compositions of this invention may be orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, aqueous suspensions or solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include, e.g., lactose. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavouring or colouring agents may also be added. Alternatively, the compositions of this invention may be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These can be prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable non-irritating excipient that is solid at room temperature but liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols. The compositions of this invention may also be administered topically, especially when the target of treatment includes areas or organs readily accessible by topical application, including diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily prepared for each of these areas or organs. For topical applications, the compositions may be formulated in a suitable ointment containing the active component suspended or dissolved in one or more carriers. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the compositions can be formulated in a suitable lotion or cream containing the active components suspended or dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. Topical application for the lower intestinal tract can be effected in a rectal suppository formulation (see above) or in a suitable enema formulation. Patches may also be used. The compositions of this invention may also be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or dispersing agents. For example, an antibody present in a pharmaceutical composition of this invention can be supplied at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in either 100 mg (10 mL) or 500 mg (50 mL) single-use vials. The product is formulated for IV administration in 9.0 mg/mL sodium chloride, 7.35 mg/mL sodium citrate dihydrate, 0.7 mg/mL polysorbate 80, and Sterile Water for Injection. The pH is adjusted to 6.5. An exemplary suitable dosage range for an antibody in a pharmaceutical composition of this invention may between about 1 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>and 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. However, it will be appreciated that these schedules are exemplary and that an optimal schedule and regimen can be adapted taking into account the affinity and tolerability of the particular antibody in the pharmaceutical composition that must be determined in clinical trials.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0043">In some embodiments, the neuropilin antagonist of the present invention is administered to the patient in combination with a progestogen.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0044">As used herein, the term &#x201c;progestogen&#x201d; or &#x201c;gestagen&#x201d; has its general meaning in the art and covers synthetic hormone compounds which exert anti-estrogenic (counteracting the effects of estrogens in the body) and anti-gonadotropic (inhibiting the production of sex steroids and gonads) properties.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0045">In some embodiments, the progestogen is selected from chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, desogestrel, dienogest, 5&#x3b1;-dihydroprogesterone, drospirenone (Yasmit&#xae;), ethanediol acetate, ethynodiol diacetate, etonouestrel (Nexplanon&#xae;), gestodene, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, levonorgestrel (Alesse&#xae;), medroxyprogesterone acetate (17&#x3b1;-hydroxy-6&#x3b1;-methylprogesterone acetate; Provera&#xae;), megestrol, megestrol acetate (17&#x3b1;acetoxy-6-dehydro-6-methylprogesterone), nestorone, nomegestrol acetate, norethindrone, norethindrone acetate (also known as norethindrone acetate), norethynodrel Enovid&#xae;), norgestimate, norgestrel, progesterone, tanaproget, trimegestone, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of any of the foregoing, and any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0046">As used herein, the term &#x201c;combination&#x201d; is intended to refer to all forms of administration that provide a first drug together with a further (second, third . . . ) drug.

The statistical significance of results was evaluated by ANOVA, with probability values **p&#x3c;0.01, ***p&#x3c;0.001, being considered as significant.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0073">Results</p><p id="p-0057" num="0074">Neuropilin Expression and NRPa Sensitivity of Endometrial Cells</p><p id="p-0058" num="0075">To test the efficiency of Neuropilin antagonist (NRPa) on endometriosis, we first examined its level expression on the human unmodified primary endometrial cell (Gogusev et al. 2019). As we show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, Neuropilin (NRP-1) is significantly express at the cell surface of these cells. Even if NRP-1 is expressed, these might be or not sensitive to NRPa, thus we initially tested at high level concentration of NRPa (NRPa-47, 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>M) if any effect is observed on cells. As expected, after 48 to 72 hours of exposure, quantity of endometrial cells is significantly decreased (80% of inhibition) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0076">Low Concentration of NRPa is Needed to Inhibit Endometrial Cell Growth.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0077">To determine the sensitivity of endometrial cell to NRPa, several concentrations (10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>, 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>, 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M) were evaluated during a time course (including day-2 to day-5 examination). As expected, a rapid endometrial growth inhibition is obtained at high level concentration (10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>M) of NRPa (NRPa-47 and NRPa-48) since 2 days (D2) of exposure (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>). However, Low concentration of NRPa (NRPa-47 and NRPa-48) comprise between 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>and 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M reached a maximum efficiency after 3 days (D3) of exposure since at D5 the effect stayed stable (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>). These results allowed us to determine the approximative IC<sub>50 </sub>of NRPa-48 at 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M (100 nM) and of NRPa-47 comprise between 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>to 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0078">Endometrial Cell Growth Inhibition is Mediated by the Apoptosis Induced by NRPa.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0079">The endometrial cell apoptosis was followed under the NRPa exposure after 48 and 72 hours using Annexin-V/7-AAD staining. NRPa including NRPa-47 and NRPa-48, may induced endometrial cell death reaching a maximum at 72 hours of exposure (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). This induced cell death is divided in two steps, first the induction of apoptosis (Annexin-V<sup>&#x2212;</sup>/7-AAD<sup>+</sup> and Annexin-V<sup>&#x2212;</sup>/7-AAD<sup>&#x2212; </sup>staining) and also the induction of necrosis (Annexin-V<sup>&#x2212;</sup>/7-AAD<sup>+</sup>) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>). Histogram clearly showed the percentage of each cell death phase induced by NRPa on endometrial cells at low concentration.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0080">NRPa May Act Synergistically with Conventional Progestogen.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0081">As patient suffering of endometriosis continuously received progestogen drugs, we investigated the effect of NRPa associated to it. Surprisingly, the association of low NRPa-47 concentration (6&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M) with progestogen drug (Nomegestrol acetate) procured additive effect on cell growth inhibition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). More importantly, using 2-fold less of NRPa-48 IC<sub>50 </sub>concentration (5&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>M) a synergistic effect is observed in presence of progestogen drug (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). These results reinforced the interest of the NRPa use in this pathology and strengthened the importance of its association of conventional progestogen drugs.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0082">Discussion:</p><p id="p-0066" num="0083">Taken together, this report highlighted the pivotal importance of the development of NRPa, which brought new tools for endometriosis treatment and for the knowledge of biological pathways involved in this disease. In this report, we observed that two structurally-related NRPa (NRPa-47 and NRPa-48) rapidly inhibit endometriosis cell line growth alone or in association with conventional hormonal treatment. In this context, NRPa may induce endometriosis cell line apoptosis. Future investigations are needed to identify the downstream pathway mediated by NRPa on kinase regulation as well as on the modulation of death receptors, pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0084">In summary, NRPa might be used alone or in association with a conventional endometriosis hormonal treatment. This observation brought newest interest for the development of NRPa in this pathology.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">REFERENCES</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0085">Throughout this application, various references describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.
