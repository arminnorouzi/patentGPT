After this, the valve can be switched so that the compressor can then directly inflate the tire. Devices can pump air alone in order to inflate balls or air mattresses or performing an air pressure check.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Tire repair kits with sealant material are generally challenging to implement with automatic shutoff features. Automatic shutoff (e.g., Applicant's Inflate Right&#x2122; technology) works in that the inflator automatically turns off when a preset pressure is reached. For example, a user can set the inflator to 35 PSI, and start inflation. When the tire pressure reaches 35 PSI, the inflator automatically shuts off. In tire repair kits, the injection of the sealant into the tire results in a &#x201c;pressure spike&#x201d; in that the back pressure registered in the system can reach around 80 PSI immediately upon start of sealant injection. Exceeding the preset pressure value can immediately stop the inflator, rendering it impractical. Thus there is a continuing need to improve inflation devices for use with automatic shutoff.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is directed to a tire repair kit/device with automatic shutoff. The device includes a sealing material and a controller with a control algorithm that recognizes or responds to sealant pressure surges, and maintains automatic inflation through and/or after the pressure spike. The control logic allows the system to continuously check pressure to track rise and fall between set levels to read actual tire pressure at correct points in cycle, ensuring the &#x201c;Inflate Right&#x201d; feature is not activated or otherwise implemented until after the sealant injection is complete.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention includes a tire repair device comprising a hose configured to attach to a tire valve, an inflation compressor in combination with the hose and configured to provide pressurized air through the hose, a sealant material in combination with the inflation compressor and the hose, and a pressure gauge configured to determine a tire inflation pressure. A controller is configured to identify a completion of an injecting of the sealant material upon a pressure drop measured at the pressure gauge. In embodiments of this invention the controller is configured to automatically shut off the inflation compressor when a tire pressure meets a predetermined inflation value after the pressure drop. The controller is desirably configured to identify the injecting of the sealant material at a pressure surge at a predefined surge pressure (e.g., above 40-50 psi), and the pressure drop at or above a predefined post-surge pressure (e.g., 3-10 psi below the predetermined inflation value).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The predetermined inflation value is generally manually set by a user of the device. Also, the device can be operated by the user to automatically inflate the tire pressure to the predetermined inflation value without any sealant injection.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention further includes a tire repair device including: a hose configured to attach to a tire valve; an inflation compressor in combination with the hose and configured to provide pressurized air through the hose; a sealant material in combination with the inflation compressor and the hose; and a controller. The controller includes or implements a first operation state configured to automatically shut off the inflation compressor when a tire pressure meets a predetermined inflation value, and a second operation state to release the sealant material into the tire valve. The controller initiates or otherwise switches to the first operation state after the sealant material is released into the tire valve.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In embodiments of this invention, the controller is configured to monitor a pressure surge upon the release of the sealant, and automatically switch to the first operation state after the pressure surge. The controller desirably identifies the pressure surge at a predefined surge pressure, and switches to the second operation state at or below a predefined post-surge pressure. An exemplary predefined surge pressure is 50 psi, and an exemplary predefined post-surge pressure is 30 psi.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention further includes a method for inflating a tire with a tire repair device. The method includes the tire repair device receiving a predetermined inflation value from a user; the tire repair device pumping air into the tire; the tire repair device injecting a tire sealant into the tire; and the tire repair device automatically inflating the tire to the predetermined inflation value after the injecting of the tire sealant. In embodiments of this invention, the tire repair device only monitors for the predetermined inflation value after the injecting of the tire sealant.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In embodiments of this invention, when the injecting the tire sealant causes a pressure surge, the tire repair device determines a corresponding pressure drop after the injecting of the tire sealant and then automatically inflates the tire to the predetermined inflation value. The method can further include identifying the pressure surge at a predefined surge pressure, and switching to the automatically inflating the tire to the predetermined inflation value at or below a predefined post-surge pressure lower than the predefined surge pressure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF TIIE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The above-mentioned and other features and objects of this invention will be better understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings wherein:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a flat tire repair kit according to one embodiment of this invention;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a top, partial sectional view of a flat tire repair kit according to one embodiment of this invention; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an operational flow diagram for a flat tire repair kit according to a method of one embodiment of this invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a tire repair device <b>20</b> according to one embodiment of this invention. The device <b>20</b> includes an outer housing <b>22</b>, a power cord <b>24</b>, and an air/sealant dispensing hose <b>26</b>. The hose <b>26</b> can connect to any standard tire valve, such as an auto tire Schrader valve. The hose <b>26</b> can optionally be wrapped around the housing <b>22</b> for storage within a hose recess <b>28</b>, in any suitable arrangement depending on the shape and configuration of the housing <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The device <b>20</b> includes an LCD screen <b>30</b> for receiving and/or displaying pressure information. The LCD screen <b>30</b> is or is associated with a pressure gauge that measures the tire pressure via back pressure through the hose <b>26</b>. Buttons <b>32</b> are provided to allow the user to set the desired inflation pressure. For example, a &#x201c;+&#x201d; button can increase the preset inflation pressure by, for example, 0.5 or 1.0 psi increments, and a &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; button can be used to decrease the preset inflation by a corresponding amount. During operation, the inflator introduces air to the tire until the measured pressure matches the entered preset inflation pressure from the user.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows exemplary internal components for the device <b>20</b>. The device <b>20</b> includes an inflation compressor <b>40</b> in combination with the pressure gauge and LCD control screen <b>30</b>, such as by a controller operating these components. The controller has any suitable processor(s) and recordable medium for implementing inflation and other features of this invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The device <b>20</b> further includes a sealant canister <b>50</b> enclosing a sealant material. The sealant canister <b>50</b> is connected to one or more air lines from the inflation compressor via any suitable valve. The valve can be controlled by switch <b>52</b>, whereby a user can switch between an &#x201c;air only&#x201d; mode or an &#x201c;air+sealant&#x201d; mode. As shown, the pressure gauge is implemented with a digital display, and the switch <b>52</b> is an analog/mechanical switch. As will be appreciated, each of these components can be analog/mechanical or digital, depending on need. Various other internal components, such as tubing, valves, electrical connection, etc., vary depending on the particular device and are within the general skill of the compressor art.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Embodiments of this invention include a method of inflation operation, and a controller for implementing the method with the tire repair device, such as discussed above. The method is implemented by a control logic programmed into the device that will check the system inflation pressure in set intervals. Once the controller determines a pressure drop after the sealant material is injected, then the controller will start or otherwise continue automated inflation until reaching the user's preset inflation value. As an example, for a needed inflation value of 35 psi, the controller will pump air and sealant, resulting in a pressure above 50 psi (due to sealant injection). The controller will continue pumping air and monitor the pressure until the pressure falls below a second value below the preset inflation value, such as 30 psi, and then turn on or otherwise switch to the auto inflate and shut-off function of the inflator, allowing the unit to then turn off at the user's preset pressure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow diagram of a method according to one embodiment of this invention. In step <b>100</b>, the device hose is attached to a valve of a tire. In step <b>110</b>, the device is plugged into a 12 volt accessory power outlet of the vehicle, or other equivalent power source. In stop <b>120</b>, the device pressure gauge, such as LCD <b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, optionally displays the current tire pressure, and then allows for entry of the desired final tire inflation pressure. Referring to box <b>122</b>, and the buttons <b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, pressing the &#x201c;+&#x201d;or &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; button will place the controller into &#x201c;setting mode.&#x201d; Once in &#x201c;setting mode&#x201d;, the LCD <b>30</b> flashes and then pressing the &#x201c;+&#x201d; or &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; button increases or decreases, respectively, the target pressure value, preferably by 0.5 psi or 1.0 psi increments. In embodiments of this invention, continuously pressing the &#x201c;+&#x201d; or &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; button for a given time, such as two seconds, will enter into a &#x201c;fast setting mode&#x201d;, increasing or decreasing the rate of target pressure at an increased speed, or in larger pressure increments. The display <b>30</b> will show the final preset pressure value to which the tire will be inflated.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In box <b>124</b>, an optional light switch can be operated to allow illumination for a flat tire repair. Pressing an included &#x201c;light switch&#x201d; button turns on an LED or equivalent. Pressing the &#x201c;light switch&#x201d; button again turns off the light.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In step <b>130</b>, the user can optionally select a first operation state of &#x201c;air only.&#x201d; In this operation, only air is pumped into the tire, such as where the air pressure needs to be adjusted, and no damage to the tire has occurred. When the pressure gauge measures the preset inflation value, the controller will turn off the inflation compressor, and the hose can be removed from the tire valve.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In step <b>140</b>, the user selects the &#x201c;air+sealant&#x201d; operation state, whereby sealant will be injected into the hose and tire via the fill air from the inflation compressor. In embodiments of this invention, the &#x201c;air+sealant&#x201d; operation state can be selected by a manual valve lever. In other embodiments, the &#x201c;air+sealant&#x201d; operation state is selected digitally by pressing a switch button, such as a dedicated button, or holding a power button. Desirably, the LCD is clear on which operation state is selected. In step <b>150</b>, the compressor is started, such as by pressing a start button. The LCD desirably shows pressure increases in 0.5 psi.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Step <b>160</b> reflects a pressure surge that results from the sealant material being released into the hose and tire. The controller is configured to identify a completion of sealant material injecting upon a pressure drop back to an expected pressure (e.g., between the original pressure and the desired inflation pressure) measured at the pressure gauge. When the controller identifies the pressure drop is complete, the controller is configured to switch (<b>170</b>) to the auto-inflate operation state and automatically shut off the inflation compressor when a tire pressure next meets the preset inflation value after the pressure drop. The value that represents the end of the pressure drop is generally below the preset pressure value, and is desirably set at a particular value or amount below the preset value, such as 5 psi. Switching to the auto-inflate mode several psi below the target value provides a buffer for any additional pressure drop while inflation commences, thus avoiding a quick inflation and shutoff before the pressure drop is actually concluded.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As an example, when the pressure gauge reaches a pressure greater than 50 psi and then drops less than 30 psi, the controller will recognize a completion of the sealant injection. In step <b>170</b>, the controller then continues in or otherwise switches to an &#x201c;air only&#x201d; mode, until automatically stopping the compressor in step <b>190</b> at the preset pressure value. The device is then removed from the tire valve.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Thus the invention provides an unproved inflation logic for use in combining sealant injection with auto-shutoff inflation. The device and method of this invention can be implemented in any of various tire repair kits, and desirably reduces or eliminates device and/or user error.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The invention illustratively disclosed herein suitably may be practiced in the absence of any element, part, step, component, or ingredient which is not specifically disclosed herein.
