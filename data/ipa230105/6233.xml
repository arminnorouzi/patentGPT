num="0228">First, EXAMPLE 8 in which x=0.20 and y=0.10 will be compared with COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 having the same dopant compositional ratio. BaZr<sub>0.70</sub>Yb<sub>0.20</sub>Sc<sub>0.10</sub>O<sub>3-&#x3b4;</sub> of EXAMPLE 8 exhibited the highest proton conductivity.

A dense pellet will be incapable of withstanding this expansion and the pellet will crack.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0232">That is, increasing the proportion of the dopants leads to the occurrence of expansion of the crystal lattices. Thus, it is expected that cracks will occur similarly when (x+y)&#x2264;0.5.
