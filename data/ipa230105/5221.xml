Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A multi-planar reconstruction method is known as three dimensional processing of projection data obtained by imaging a subject using a modality such as a CT imaging apparatus. The multi-planar reconstruction method can extract and display a given plane of three dimensionally constructed CT value information. For example, it is possible to switch display of an axial plane, which is a plane in the body axis direction, to display of a longitudinal, sagittal plane and display of a transverse, coronal plane. Note that CT is an abbreviation of Computed Tomography. The multi-planar reconstruction method is referred to as MPR using an abbreviation of Multi Planar Reconstruction.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">JP2004-194869A describes an image display system including an image server and a display terminal, in which the image server and the display terminal are connected via a network.
