BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hematologic malignancies are highly dependent upon the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 for survival. Over-expression of Bcl-2 is associated with tumor initiation, disease progression, and drug resistance, and is thus a compelling target for anti-tumor therapy. Venetoclax is a potent, selective and orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2 that binds with &#x3e;1,000-fold higher affinity for Bcl-2&#x3c;0.010 nM) than for Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>(K<sub>i</sub>=48 nm) or Mcl-1(K<sub>i</sub>&#x3e;444 nM). See, e.g., Souers et al., <i>Nat Med. </i>2013; 19(2):202-8 (&#x201c;Souers et al., 2013&#x201d;). In vitro, venetoclax has demonstrated cell killing activity against patient-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and a variety of lymphoma and leukemia cell lines, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). See, e.g., Souers et al., 2013.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Bcl-2 over-expression has also been implicated in the maintenance and survival of AML cells and has been associated with resistance to chemotherapeutics. In addition, high levels of Bcl-2 are associated with poor survival in a subset of patients with this disease. See, e.g., Konopleva et al., <i>Cancer Cell</i>. 2006; 10(5):375-88; see also Tsao et al., <i>Ann Hematol. </i>2012; 91(12):1861-70. Venetoclax has also demonstrated killing of AML leukemic stem/progenitor cells ex vivo and antitumor efficacy in vivo, inhibiting the growth of AML cell lines or AML patient-derived primary cells systemically engrafted into immunocompromised mice. See, e.g., Pan et al., <i>Cancer Discov. </i>2014; 4(3):362-75. Single agent venetoclax is was previously studied in relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML and was found to induce rapid reduction in blast counts in some patients indicating activity in this disease. See Konopleva et al., <i>Cancer Discov. </i>2016; 6(10): 1106-17. However, not all AML cell lines, primary patient samples, or patients treated with single agent venetoclax were found to be sensitive, and there is biologic rationale for combining venetoclax with certain chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of AML.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Treatments for AML are sought in view that certain patients respond poorly or develop resistance to standard induction therapy with chemotherapeutic agents such as cytarabine. Combinations of venetoclax and chemotherapeutic agents and hypomethylating agents commonly used in the treatment of AML have been tested. For example, venetoclax was administered daily during the 28-day cycles in combination with decitabine (20 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>intravenously on Days 1-5 once every 28 days) or azacitidine (75 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>intravenously or subcutaneously on Days 1-7 once every 28 days). Preliminary safety and efficacy data are available from a phase Ib dose escalation and expansion of this trial. See DiNardo et al., &#x201c;A phase 1b study of venetoclax (ABT-199/GDC-0199) in combination with decitabine or azacitidine in treatment-naive patients with acute myelogenous leukemia who are &#x3e;65 years and not eligible for standard induction therapy,&#x201d; presented at: 57th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology; Dec. 5-8, 2015; Orlando, Fla. Abstract 327. See also DiNardo et al., <i>Lancet Oncol. </i>2018; 19(2):216-28; and DiNardo et al., <i>Blood. </i>2019; 133(1):7-17. Despite advantages such as, e.g., improved response demonstrated with combination therapy, as compared to response rates in monotherapy response rates, occurrence of cytopenia, such as, e.g., neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, are often observed in many patients undergoing such treatment, requiring further inventions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Cytopenias, including anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, are common in subjects with AML. Subjects with baseline neutropenias or those with secondary AML might be particularly at high risk for developing serious cytopenias. There is an unmet need for new protocols that manage cytopenia in patients on combination therapies of venetoclax and azacitidine to treat AML.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">4.

Those skilled in the art will know how to calculate ANC. As an example, ANC may be calculated as follows: ANC=WBC (cells/4)&#xd7;[percent (PMNs+bands)&#xf7;100]; where &#x201c;WBC&#x201d; is the white blood cell count, &#x201c;PMNs&#x201d; is the percent of neutrophils, and &#x201c;bands&#x201d; are young neutrophils.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0034">As used herein, the term &#x201c;blast clearance&#x201d; means bone marrow with &#x3c;5% bone marrow blasts (myeloblasts).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0035">As used herein, the term &#x201c;complete remission (CR)&#x201d; means bone marrow with &#x3c;5% myeloblasts (blasts), the absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods, hematologic recovery (as evidenced by ANC&#x2265;1,000 cells/4, and platelet count&#x2265;100,000 cells/4), with no need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, and the absence of extramedullary disease.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0036">As used herein, the term &#x201c;complete remission with partial hematological recovery (CRh)&#x201d; (also referred to as &#x201c;complete remission with partial count recovery (CRh)&#x201d;) means all of the criteria for CR except for partial recovery of peripheral blood counts (as evidenced by ANC&#x2265;500 cells/&#x3bc;L and platelet count&#x2265;50,000 cells/&#x3bc;l).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0037">As used herein, the term &#x201c;complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi)&#x201d; means all of the criteria for CR except for residual cytopenia (as evidenced by ANC&#x2264;1,000 cells/&#x3bc;L or platelet count&#x3c;100,000 cells/&#x3bc;L).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0038">As used herein, the term &#x201c;post-remission cytopenia&#x201d; or &#x201c;post-remission cytopenia event&#x201d; means a Grade 4 neutropenia event or a Grade 4 thrombocytopenia event lasting&#x3e;7 days in a patient who had achieved complete remission (CR) or complete remission with partial hematological recovery (CRh).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0039">As used herein, the term &#x201c;morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS)&#x201d; means less than 5% blasts in an aspirate sample with marrow spicules and with a count of at least 200 nucleated cells, absence of circulating blasts and extramedullary disease without peripheral blood count recovery that meet the thresholds for either CR or CRi.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0040">As used herein, the term &#x201c;treating&#x201d; means reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, or preventing, either partially or completely, a cancer in a patient, for example, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a patient. For example, in certain embodiments, treating means reducing the number of circulating blasts, e.g., to less than 5%. In other certain embodiments, treating means the patient has achieved one or more of a complete recovery (CR), complete remission with partial hematological recovery (CRh), complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi), and a morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS). In certain embodiments, &#x201c;treating&#x201d; means increasing the survival of an AML patient.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0041">As used herein, the term &#x201c;a method of treating&#x201d; or its equivalent, when applied to, for example, cancer refers to a procedure or course of action that is designed to reduce or eliminate the number of cancer cells in a patient, or to alleviate the symptoms of a cancer. &#x201c;A method of treating&#x201d; cancer, for example, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), does not necessarily mean that the cancer cells or other disorder will, in fact, be eliminated, that the number of cells or disorder will, in fact, be reduced, or that the symptoms of a cancer or other disorder will, in fact, be alleviated. Often, a method of treating cancer will be performed even with a low likelihood of success, but which, given the medical history and estimated survival expectancy of a patient, is nevertheless deemed to induce an overall beneficial course of action.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0042">As used herein, &#x201c;interrupt,&#x201d; &#x201c;interrupting,&#x201d; &#x201c;interruption,&#x201d; and the like, in the context of, for example, interrupting the administration of venetoclax and/or azacitidine, mean a break, disruption, and/or delay in the administration of venetoclax and/or azacitidine. As such, terms such as interrupt, break, disrupt, delay; interrupting, breaking, disrupting, delaying; or interruption, disruption, delay, etc., may be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0043">As used herein, the term &#x201c;patient&#x201d; typically refers to a human in need of treating a cancer, for example, acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Such patient may exhibit a cytopenia, for example, neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia, because of AML or as a result of the treatment for AML. However, the term &#x201c;patient&#x201d; can also refer to non-human animals, preferably mammals such as dogs, cats, horses, cows, pigs, sheep and non-human primates, among others.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">6.2 Methods of Treating Aml and/or Managing Cytopenia</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0044">In one aspect, provided herein is a method of treating a cancer, for example, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in a patient with cytopenia when on a combination therapy of venetoclax and azacitidine. Without being bound by any theory or mechanism, it is believed that an AML patient who develops a cytopenia when on combination therapy can be treated with certain regimens and doses of the active agents to reduce the cytopenia and continue with combination therapy to treat AML with a reduced likelihood of re-occurrence of the cytopenia.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0045">In certain embodiments, a method provided herein comprises interrupting administration of venetoclax and azacitidine to a patient in need thereof after a first cycle of one or more administration cycles, upon the patient having an occurrence of cytopenia (after patient has achieved remission, where the occurrence of cytopenia is not caused by a relapse of the AML or due to underlying cancer), until the patient recovers from the cytopenia, and resuming the administration of venetoclax and azacitidine for the next cycle of the one or more cycles, wherein the resumed administration of venetoclax and azacitidine starts on the same day.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0046">It will be understood that in AML patients, a cause of cytopenia, e.g., neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, can be the disease itself as opposed to the treatment of the disease. For example, the expansion of one clone of white blood cells can prevent other white cells from flourishing and the diversity of those neutrophils, not necessarily their total number, would be reduced. As such, in certain embodiments of the methods provided herein, the cytopenia, e.g., neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, is not related to or caused by AML, the underlying disease. In some embodiments, the cytopenia, e.g., neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, in the treated patient occurs wherein the bone marrow of the patient has less than 5% blasts, or wherein there is an absence of circulating blasts and/or blasts with Auer rods. In some embodiments, the cytopenia, e.g., neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, in the treated patient occurs wherein the bone marrow has less than 5% blasts. In some embodiments, the occurrence of cytopenia includes an occurrence of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or both.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0047">In certain embodiments, the patient exhibits complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) at one or more steps of the methods described herein.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0048">In certain embodiments, the patient exhibits a morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) at one or more steps of the methods described herein.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0049">In certain embodiments, the venetoclax and azacitidine are administered for one or more 28-day cycles of a multiple 28-day cycle dosing regimen, prior to the interruption.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0050">In certain embodiments, each 28-day cycle of the one or more 28-day cycles comprises orally administering 400 mg venetoclax on days 1-28 of the 28-day cycle, and administering azacitidine 75 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>intravenously or subcutaneously on 7 days of the 28-day cycle. In certain embodiments, azacitidine is administered on 7 consecutive days of the 28-day cycle. In certain embodiments, azacitidine is administered on 7 nonconsecutive days of the 28-day cycle. In certain embodiments, azacitidine is administered in a combination of consecutive and nonconsecutive days of the 28-day cycle, so long as the total number of days azacitidine is administered is 7 days. In certain embodiments, each 28-day cycle of the one or more 28-day cycles comprises orally administering 400 mg venetoclax on days 1-28 of the 28-day cycle, and administering azacitidine 75 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>intravenously or subcutaneously on days 1-5 and days 8-9 of the 28-day cycle. In certain embodiments, each 28-day cycle of the one or more 28-day cycles comprises orally administering 400 mg venetoclax on days 1-28 of the 28-day cycle, and administering azacitidine 75 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>intravenously or subcutaneously on days 1-7 days of the 28-day cycle.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0051">In certain embodiments, prior to interruption of the administration of venetoclax and azacitidine, the patient has achieved one or more of a complete recovery (CR), complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi), complete remission with partial hematological recovery (CRh), and a morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS), as described herein.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0052">Bone marrow blast levels may be determined by any present or future methodology known in the art to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0053">In certain embodiments, a bone marrow assessment (e.g., bone marrow aspirate), biopsy, and blood count is performed on the patient to determine CR, CRi, CRh, and/or MLFS.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0054">In certain embodiments, if the patient does not recover from the cytopenia following interruption of the administration of venetoclax and azacitidine, and the cytopenia is not caused by a relapse of AML, the patient is excluded from the method of treating AML.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0055">In certain embodiments, if the patient does not recover from the cytopenia following interruption of the administration of venetoclax and azacitidine, the patient enters discussion with appropriate medical personnel to determine whether resumption or treatment or other therapeutic steps are necessary.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0056">Disease response may be assessed via bone marrow aspirate, biopsy and blood count at the end of the first cycle of the multiple 28-day cycle dosing regimen, and at least every 3 cycles thereafter. After patients achieve blast clearance (bone marrow blasts&#x3c;5%), various dosing modifications may be implemented to manage cytopenia, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, if during or at the end of a first cycle, incomplete count recovery is assessed (e.g., CRi or MLFS), or cytopenia observed, the upcoming cycle may be delayed as follows: (i) venetoclax is interrupted from Day 29 until ANC reaches a certain threshold, e.g., &#x2265;1,500 cells/&#x3bc;L, &#x2265;1,000 cells/&#x3bc;L, or &#x2265;500 cells/&#x3bc;L, or platelet count reaches a certain threshold, e.g., &#x2265;100,000 cells/&#x3bc;L, &#x2265;75,000 cells/&#x3bc;L, &#x2265;50,000 cells/&#x3bc;L, or &#x2265;25,000 cells/&#x3bc;L, or up to 14 days (if no recovery by Day 42, the patient should enter discussion with appropriate medical personnel to determine whether exclusion from the treatment, resumption of treatment, and/or other therapeutic steps are necessary); (ii) azacitidine is also interrupted from Day 29 until ANC reaches a certain threshold, e.g., &#x2265;1,500 cells/&#x3bc;L, &#x2265;1,000 cells/&#x3bc;L, or &#x2265;500 cells/&#x3bc;L, or platelet count reaches a certain threshold, e.g., &#x2265;100,000 cells/&#x3bc;L, &#x2265;75,000 cells/&#x3bc;L, &#x2265;50,000 cells/&#x3bc;L, or &#x2265;25,000 cells/&#x3bc;L, or up to 14 days; and (iii) assuming recovery by Day 42, venetoclax and azacitidine are resumed on the same day after the interruption. If during or at the end of a second cycle, a new cytopenia is observed (after prior ANC recovery and/or platelet count recovery) lasting more than one week, unless due to underlying disease, e.g., relapse, the upcoming cycle may be delayed as follows: venetoclax is interrupted once cycle completed and until ANC reaches a certain threshold, e.g., &#x2265;1,500 cells/&#x3bc;L, &#x2265;1,000 cells/&#x3bc;L, or &#x2265;500 cells/&#x3bc;L, or platelet count reaches a certain threshold, e.g., &#x2265;100,000 cells/&#x3bc;L, &#x2265;75,000 cells/&#x3bc;L, &#x2265;50,000 cells/&#x3bc;L, or &#x2265;25,000 cells/&#x3bc;L, or up to 14 days, unless medically necessary to interrupt drug within cycle (if no recovery by Day 42, the patient should enter discussion with appropriate medical personnel to determine whether exclusion from the treatment, resumption of treatment, and/or other therapeutic steps, e.g., adjusted azacitidine dose are necessary). If during or at the end of a third cycle, a subsequent cytopenia is observed lasting more than one week (after prior ANC recovery and/or platelet count recovery), the upcoming cycle may be reduced in duration as follows: (i) the next treatment cycle is delayed until ANC reaches a certain threshold, e.g., &#x2265;1,500 cells/4, &#x2265;1,000 cells/4, or &#x2265;500 cells/4, or platelet count reaches a certain threshold, e.g., &#x2265;100,000 cells/4, &#x2265;75,000 cells/&#x3bc;L, &#x2265;50,000 cells/4, or &#x2265;25,000 cells/4, or up to 14 days; and (ii) venetoclax is administered for 21/28 days for subsequent cycles. If during or at the end of a fourth cycle, a 25% increase from the nadir (e.g., the lowest ANC and/or platelet count measured during the multiple 28-day cycle dosing regimen) is not achieved within 14 days after completion of the cycle and/or if recovery after the third or fourth cycles takes more than 14 days (no recovery by Day 42), the azacitidine dose may be adjusted based on bone marrow (BM) cellularity in the upcoming cycle as follows: (i) BM cellularity (15-50%): azacitidine dose adjusted to 50% of prior dose; and (ii) BM cellularity (&#x3c;15%): azacitidine dose adjusted to 33% of prior dose.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0057">It will be understood by those skilled in the art that should cytopenia occur during a 28-day cycle, for example, on day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, or 27 of the cycle, it is not necessary to complete the full 28-day cycle prior to taking action, for example, interrupting, delaying or adjusting doses in the next cycle.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> shows exemplary dose interruptions following a Grade 4 cytopenia (e.g., neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia) event during a 28-day cycle, and resumption of the administration of venetoclax and azacitidine on the same day for the next 28-day cycle.

If a subject enrolled on any arm achieves complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi) or has morphologic leukemia free bone marrow after completion of Cycle 1, venetoclax/placebo may be interrupted from Day 29 for up to 14 days or until recovery of ANC&#x2265;500/&#x3bc;L. If venetoclax/placebo is interrupted, then Cycle 2 administration of azacitidine will also be delayed. Cycle 2 treatment with venetoclax/placebo and azacitidine will resume on the same day after the interruption. Subjects with resistant disease after the end of Cycle 1 will need a bone marrow aspirate to evaluate response after completion of Cycle 2 or 3 if hematologic improvement is seen. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will be done at the end of Cycle 4 and every 3 cycles after for subjects with resistant disease until two successive samples indicate CR or CRi. For subjects with a response of CRi a repeat bone marrow aspirate must be performed to confirm a CR once peripheral blood count recovery is noted. For subjects who have not recovered ANC&#x2265;500 &#x3bc;L within 14 days of drug interruption or require longer duration of interruption between treatment cycles, bone marrow aspirate may be performed per investigator discretion to assess disease status before resuming treatment with next Cycle.

All subjects will have a final visit performed when treatment is discontinued unless the subject has withdrawn consent to participate in the study. Baseline laboratory assessments will be obtained at Cycle 1 Day 1 prior to first dose of study treatment. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures should be completed after a blood sample is taken to confirm the subject is able to receive study treatment at the study visit, but prior to the performance of all other non-PRO assessments and the administration of study treatment. Disease assessments by IWG criteria will be performed at end of Cycle 1 (&#xb1;3 days) and every 3 cycles starting on Cycle 4 Day 1 and continuing until disease progression per the modified IWG criteria, or the subject withdraws consent. In addition to being reviewed by the Investigator and local hematopathologists, all disease assessment information will be sent to an Independent Review Committee (IRC) to provide response assessment.

This example also explores the relationship between venetoclax exposure and overall survival in subgroups of patients with post-remission cytopenia.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0329">Methods: Data from 185 patients treated with VEN+AZA and 33 patients treated with PBO+AZA who achieved CR or CRh (blast clearance with neutrophil count&#x3e;0.5&#xd7;10<sup>3</sup>/&#x3bc;L and platelet count&#x3e;0.5&#xd7;10<sup>5</sup>/&#x3bc;L) were included in the analysis. Venetoclax exposure was calculated as the average plasma concentration (C<sub>avg</sub>) from blast clearance to the event of interest, accounting for dose modifications such as interruptions and reductions. Logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazards models were used to characterize the relationships between venetoclax exposure and frequency or timing of post-remission cytopenia. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to characterize the relationships between venetoclax exposure and overall survival.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0330">Results: There is no apparent relationship between venetoclax exposure and overall survival in subgroups of patients who switched to 21-day dosing following their first post-remission cytopenia (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>) or remained on 28-day dosing and reduced venetoclax dosing duration in later cycles (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>).
