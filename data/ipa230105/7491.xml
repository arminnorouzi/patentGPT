A new MCD may enter a setup application upon start up, and from the setup application, the user may want to enter a staging application which would set up the MCD.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The process of staging the new MCD similarly to the other MCDs can be done a variety of ways. A common way to stage a new MCD would be to have a staging indicia, in some cases a barcode, come in the packaging with the MCD. The indicia may include data that can be used by the MCD for staging. The indicia could then be imaged or scanned by the MCD, which decodes the data included in the indicia and uses the data for staging.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, an issue may arise if the MCD does not have an integrated imager or scanner for which to scan the indicia used for staging. In this scenario, the MCD would not be able to scan the indicia provided for staging, which allows the MCD to exit the setup application and enter the staging application. When a MCD does not have an integrated scanner, the user may use a known method for pairing the MCD with a peripheral scanner. However, when the MCD is in the setup application, which the MCD may be in upon start up, the MCD may not be able to exit the setup mode in order to pair with the peripheral scanning device. An issue then arises as to how to pair a MCD without an integrated scanner with a peripheral scanning device while the MCD is executing the setup application.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The MCD may be used in a facility. Prior to deployment in a given facility, each MCD is configured for operation in that facility. That is, the MCD is received at the facility from a device manufacturer in a state that generally includes an operating system but does not include various facility-specific software to enable the MCD to perform the tasks for which the MCD will be deployed in the facility. Preparing each MCD to operate in the relevant facility is referred to as staging the MCD, and includes one or more of the installation of applications, configuration of settings (e.g., network connections), and retrieval of other data to enable the device to operate within the facility.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Various mechanisms may be employed to stage a MCD. For example, when the MCD includes a barcode reader module, a MCD can be operated to scan one or more previously generated barcodes and retrieve therefrom instructions and/or storage locations for staging data. In other examples, a MCD may be operated to establish a connection to another, previously staged MCD, and retrieve staging data therefrom in what is referred to as peer-to-peer (P2P) staging. In further examples, a MCD can be placed into a charging cradle that is connected to a network, and the MCD may then be operated to initiate staging, e.g., by retrieving staging data from a source previously made available via the charging cradle. The above staging mechanisms, however, involve manual operation of each MCD by staging staff, and may therefore be time-consuming and error prone.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The system described below includes certain components and functionality to reduce manual intervention by staging staff, enabling staging of MCD that is automated to a greater degree than in the mechanisms mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Examples disclosed herein are directed to a method of pairing a mobile computing device with an external device during set up of the mobile computing device, the method comprising, at a computing device: initiate a setup application for the mobile computing device; determining if the mobile computing device has an internal scanner; when the mobile computing device does not have an internal scanner: prepare the mobile computing device for pairing with a peripheral scanning device; prepare the peripheral scanning device for pairing with the mobile computing device; pairing the mobile computing device with the peripheral scanning device; and scanning staging indicia with the peripheral scanning device to initiate a device staging application within the mobile computing device.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Additional examples disclosed herein are directed to a method of pairing a mobile computing device with a peripheral scanning device, the method comprising: initiating a setup application for the mobile computing device; inputting a touch configuration on a user interface of the mobile computing device; displaying a pairing indicia on the user interface, wherein the pairing indicia contains data corresponding to a Bluetooth MAC address of the mobile computing device; scanning the pairing indicia with the peripheral scanning device; in response to scanning the pairing indicia, using the Bluetooth MAC address of the mobile computing device to pair the mobile computer device with the peripheral scanning device; establishing a Bluetooth connection between the mobile computing device and the peripheral scanning device; and scanning a staging indicia with the peripheral scanning device to initiate a device staging application within the mobile computing device.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further examples disclosed herein are directed to a method of pairing a mobile computing device with a peripheral scanning device, the method comprising: initiating a setup application for the mobile computing device; inputting a first hardware key sequence on the mobile computing device to activate a Bluetooth radio of the mobile computing device; inputting a second hardware key sequence on the peripheral scanning device to activate a second Bluetooth radio of the peripheral scanning device; writing data into an Extended Inquiry Response for transmission by with the peripheral scanning device; discovering the peripheral scanning device with the mobile computing device via the data within the Extended Inquiry Response; initiating pairing between the mobile computing device and the peripheral scanning device; authenticating the pairing between the mobile computing device and the peripheral scanning device; and scanning a staging indicia with the peripheral scanning device to initiate a device staging application within the mobile computing device.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further examples disclosed herein are directed to a method of pairing a NFC enabled mobile computing device with a peripheral scanning device, the method comprising: initiating a setup application for the mobile computing device; tapping the peripheral scanning device against the mobile computing device; exchanging Bluetooth data between the mobile computing device and the peripheral scanning device; initiating pairing between the mobile computing device and the peripheral scanning device; authenticating the pairing between the mobile computing device and the peripheral scanning device; and scanning a staging indicia with the peripheral scanning device to initiate a device staging application within the mobile computing device.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a system <b>100</b> including a mobile computing device (MCD) <b>102</b> and a peripheral scanning device <b>104</b>. The MCD <b>102</b> can include any one of, or any combination of, handheld or wearable computers, smartphones, tablet computers, or the like. Each MCD <b>102</b> thus includes a variety of internal components (e.g., controllers, displays, processors, or the like), powered by an integrated battery. Components within the MCD <b>102</b> will be further described below. The MCD in the depicted example do not have an integrated scanner. The MCD <b>102</b> may require configuration upon set up of the MCD <b>102</b>, for example, when it is first removed from the MCD packaging <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Some MCD <b>102</b> are able to configure a device by scanning a staging indicia <b>108</b> that comes with the MCD <b>102</b> in the packaging <b>110</b>. In this scenario, when the MCD <b>102</b> scans the staging indicia <b>108</b>, the MCD <b>102</b> decodes data encoded in the staging indicia <b>108</b> and executes a staging application which stages the device. However, if MCD <b>102</b> does not have an integrated scanner allowing the MCD <b>102</b> to scan the staging indicia <b>108</b>, then other steps need to be taken to allow the staging indicia <b>108</b> to be scanned. In some scenarios, MCD <b>102</b> may pair with a peripheral scanning device (PSD) <b>104</b>. The PSD <b>104</b> will be described in greater detail below. The pairing can be done via Bluetooth or other similar wireless pairing methods. Methods of pairing the MCD <b>102</b> with the PSD <b>104</b> are described further below. One method of pairing includes the MCD <b>102</b> displaying a pairing indicia <b>106</b> on a user interface of the MCD <b>102</b> and using the PSD <b>104</b> to scan the pairing indicia <b>106</b> to being the pairing process.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Once the MCD <b>102</b> is paired with the PSD <b>104</b>, the PSD <b>104</b> is able to scan indicia and transmit the data within the indicia via wireless connection to the MCD <b>102</b>. The PSD <b>104</b> may scan the staging indicia <b>108</b> at this time and transmit the data within the staging indicia <b>108</b> to the MCD <b>102</b>. The MCD <b>102</b> can then use that data to execute the staging application.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts internal components of a MCD <b>102</b>. The MCD <b>102</b> includes a central processing unit (CPU), also referred to as a processor <b>200</b>, interconnected with a non-transitory computer readable storage medium, such as a memory <b>202</b>. The memory <b>202</b> includes any suitable combination of volatile (e.g., Random Access Memory (RAM)) and non-volatile (e.g. read only memory (ROM), Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM), flash) memory. The processor <b>200</b> and the memory <b>202</b> each comprise one or more integrated circuits (ICs).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The memory <b>202</b> stores a plurality of computer-readable instructions <b>210</b>, e.g., in the form of a staging control application and a pairing application. The applications are executable by the processor <b>200</b> to implement various functionality performed by the MCD <b>102</b>. As will be discussed below, the staging control application implements functionality to detect new MCD <b>102</b> settings to be staged, and to select a source of staging data for such devices.
