There are numerous variations of bagpipes. A traditional bagpipe typically consists of an air reservoir (bag), a blowpipe (or bellows) for filling the bag with air, one or more drone pipes, a set of reeds, and one or more chanter pipes. The instrumentalist blows air into the bag through the blowpipe and squeezes the air out of the bag into the drone and chanter pipes, which are all attached to the bag via connecting pipes called stocks. Each drone and chanter pipe contains a reed within the stock over which air passes as it escapes the bag out through the pipes. Typically, a drone reed is a single reed, which is structurally different from a chanter reed, which is a double reed. The passage of air over the reeds causes the reeds to vibrate and produce sound, which is in turn altered by the either the length of each drone pipe or by the hole placement in the case of the chanter pipe. The chanter is the melody pipe and is typically played with two hands. Almost all bagpipes have at least one chanter and some bagpipes have two chanters. Almost all bagpipes have at least one drone and most bagpipes have multiple drones. The drone pipe is typically not fingered but rather produces a constant harmonizing note throughout play</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various features and attendant advantages of the present invention will be more fully appreciated as the same becomes better understood when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters designate the same or similar parts throughout the several views, and wherein:</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a typical traditional bagpipe.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a chanter embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a drone embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts a traditional drone reed (<b>42</b>) with a tongue (<b>41</b>).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a traditional double chanter reed (<b>80</b>)</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a </i></figref>shows an embodiment of the present invention where the chanter sensor (<b>92</b>) tip is bent towards the chanter reed (<b>80</b>).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>b </i></figref>shows embodiment of the present invention where the drone sensor (<b>50</b>) is slightly spaced from the drone reed (<b>42</b>).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>a </i></figref>shows embodiment of the present invention where the chanter sensor (<b>92</b>) is spaced apart from the chanter reed (<b>80</b>).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>b </i></figref>shows embodiment of the present invention where the drone sensor (<b>50</b>) is spaced apart from a drone reed (<b>42</b>).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts a typical traditional bagpipe depicting a chanter with reed spaced apart from the bag and a drone with reed spaced apart from the bag.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts a drone stock embodiment of the present invention where the sensor is placed within a sensor grove indented in the stock wall.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>a </i></figref>depicts a close up view of a canter sensor grove (<b>195</b>) in a canter stock embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>b </i></figref>depicts a close up view of a drone sensor grove (<b>230</b>) in a drone stock embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> depicts a cut away view of a canter stock embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> depicts a cut away view of a canter stock embodiment of the present invention.

The chanter has sound holes (<b>120</b>) which are not typically covered with the fingers while playing the chanter. The instrumentalist blows air into the bag through the blowpipe and squeezes the air out of the bag into the drone and chanter pipes, which are all attached to the bag via connecting pipes called stocks. Each drone and chanter pipe contains a reed within the stock over which air passes as it escapes the bag out through the pipes. The passage of air over the reeds causes the reeds to vibrate and produce sound, which is in turn altered by the either the length of each drone pipe or by the hole placement in the case of the chanter pipe.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The chanter is the melody portion of a bagpipe. The chanter consists of holes (<b>105</b>) which the instrumentalist covers with their fingers to create notes by changing the pitch at which the reed (<b>80</b>) vibrates, thus producing different tones or notes.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Placement of the chanter sensor depends on the desired sound effect and on the selection of the reed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a chanter embodiment of the present invention in which the chanter sensor has a slightly bent tip. In this embodiment the majority of the sensor is spaced from 0.5-5 mm away from the reed and the bent tip is spaced closer the reed. In a preferred embodiment, the bent tip does not touch the reed but it is bent so that the tip is closer to the reed than the rest of the sensor. In certain embodiments, the chanter sensor is parallel to the length of the chanter reed. In certain embodiments, the bent tip actually makes slight contact with the reed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a chanter reed (<b>80</b>) is typically a double reed consisting of two pieces of cane which vibrate against each other to create sound when air is blown over the reed. Chanter reeds may also be made from synthetic materials. The reed is placed into a reed seat (<b>75</b>) located in the top portion of a chanter (<b>65</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The pitch does not originate from the air coming through the holes (<b>105</b>) on the chanter. The source of pitch variation is coming from the reed itself. The distance between the reed and the hole (<b>105</b>) locations on the chanter as air passes through the reed changes the frequency at which the reed vibrates, thus producing different notes.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Chanter notes are higher pitched than the drone notes, thus, a piezo transducer with a higher resonant frequency is better matched. Most piezoelectric pickups range between 1 and 6 KHz. In a preferred embodiment, the chanter piezoelectric pickups ranges between 3 and 5.5 KHz. In a particularly preferred embodiment a piezoelectric chanter pickup with a frequency 4.6 kHz (+/&#x2212;0.5 kHz) was found to produce excellent sound. By placing a chanter sensor (<b>92</b>) in slight contact with the reed itself or, in a preferred embodiment, within 0.5-5 mm apart from the reed, the vibrations of the chanter reed (<b>80</b>) are converted into an electrical audio signal. This electrical audio signal can then be amplified and altered according to the instrumentalist's preference. Because the double reed needs to be able to vibrate freely in order to produce sound, the placement of the chanter sensor (<b>92</b>) is important. The chanter sensor (<b>92</b>), being a contact microphone, must come into contact with the source of vibration (e.g., the cane of the reed) or be spaced very close to the vibration source. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the bent tip of the chanter sensor (<b>92</b>) is designed to make as little contact with the reed as possible so as not to interfere with reed vibrations.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The chanter sensor (<b>92</b>) used to create the electric audio signal is typically a thin disc consisting of a ceramic material adhered to a soft metal such as brass. Preferably, the chanter sensor is between 0.3 and 0.6 mm thick. Most preferably, the chanter sensor is between 0.42 and 0.58 mm thick. Other well-known sensor materials may also be used. By bending the tip of the metal portion of the disc, the piezoelectric transducer can be positioned near the reed without obstructing the reed's ability to vibrate freely as long as only the bent tip of the sensor touches the reed. In certain embodiments, the bent tip of the sensor is slightly spaced apart from the reed. See, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a traditional double chanter reed (<b>80</b>). As shown, the chanter reed is larger at the base and narrows towards the top portion. Thus, in certain embodiments, the entire chanter sensor (<b>92</b>) is bent such that the length of the sensor follows the length of the reed with an even spacing between the sensor and the reed along the length of the reed.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In certain embodiments, the sensor is attached to the base and is straight. See for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>a</i></figref>. In such embodiments the gap between the sensor and the reed will vary along the length of the reed from e.g., between 0.5 to 5 mm. The gap will be smaller at the base and larger towards the top of the reed.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Bagpipe drone reeds have typically been produced from a hollow piece of cane tubing which is sealed at one end and open at the opposing end. A &#x201c;tongue&#x201d; or elongated three-sided flap of cane is cut into the cane. The length of the tongue is altered by means of a bridle which girdles the body of the reed and can be moved upward or downward to change pitch. While a drone reed is most commonly a cylindrically-bored tube with a single reed, drones with double reeds exist. GB190814366A, US2003075035A, US2014331849A, U.S. Pat. No. 5,959,226A and GB2376559A depict and describe variations on drone reeds.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a preferred drone embodiment of the present invention. As seen, a drone base top (<b>37</b>) is adapted to be removably engaged (by threads) from the drone base (<b>35</b>). However, in certain embodiments the joints between removable portions may have traditional hemp twine seals. In the case of the drone the wire (<b>55</b>) which leads from the drone sensor (<b>50</b>) leads thru a hole in the drone base (<b>35</b>) and a projecting mount (<b>39</b>) to a cable (<b>60</b>). However, in certain embodiments the wire and cable are mounted to the outside surface of the drone base (<b>35</b>).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts a traditional drone reed (<b>42</b>). The passage of air over the drone reed (<b>42</b>) causes the drone reed tongue (<b>41</b>) to vibrate and produce sound. Modern drone reeds are often made of synthetic materials which tend to be thicker than natural cane reeds. The optimal gap between the reed and the sensor will depend on the type of reed, the type of sensor and the desired sound. For example, in a typical cane reed an optimal space between the reed and the drone sensor is typically 2-3 mm. In a typical synthetic reed the space between the reed and the drone sensor is smaller and for some reeds it is preferable that the drone sensor is actually slightly touching the reed.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Drone notes are lower pitched, thus a drone sensor with a lower resonant frequency often sounds best. Piezoelectric pickups often range between 1 and 6 KHz. In a preferred embodiment the drone pickup is between 1 and 3 kHz (+/&#x2212;0.3 kHz). In a most preferred embodiment, a piezo pickup with a frequency 2.2 kHz (+/&#x2212;0.3 kHz) produced excellent sound. In general a drone sensor which is piezo electric and between 0.4-0.6 thick produces the best sound. Preferably, the piezo electric sensor is between 0.5-0.7 mm thick. Most preferably, the piezo electric sensor is between 0.55-0.65 mm thick.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Placement of the drone sensor depends on the desired sound effect and on the selection of the reed. Some drone reeds are made of synthetic body with a synthetic tongue (e.g., carbon fiber or polycarbonate). Reeds are also typically made of wood (e.g. redwood) or cane. Thus, if a synthetic tongue is used the sensor may be placed closer to the reed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a </i></figref>shows an embodiment of the present invention where the chanter sensor (<b>92</b>) is slightly bent at the tip so that the tip is closer to the reed.

Preferably the chanter sensor is made of a Brass/Ceramic material. Although, other sensor materials may also be used such as, for example, single-crystal materials (such as quartz, gallium-phosphate, tourmaline, etc). Ceramic materials are more sensitive but less stable over time whereas single crystal based sensors are less sensitive but more stable over time.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>b </i></figref>shows embodiment of the present invention where the drone sensor (<b>50</b>) is slightly spaced from the drone reed (<b>42</b>).

The figure also depicts a drone pipe with reed (<b>80</b>) removed from and spaced apart from the bag. Thus, in a typical bagpipe the drone pipes and chanter pipe are removable from the bag. This allows the reeds (e.g., <b>80</b>, <b>42</b>) to be replaced or different chanter pipes or drone pipes to be used depending on the desired sound the musician is interested in achieving. The chanter pipe or drone pipes couple to the bag via bagpipe stocks. The term &#x201c;bagpipe stock&#x201d; referred to herein refers a stock which is capable of being mounted to an outlet of an inflatable bag of a set of bagpipes, and which is capable of having any pipe of the bagpipe coupled therewith, including tenor and base drone pipes, chanter and blowpipe.

In the chanter, it is preferable that the reed sits closer to the opening of the stock. In the drone, it is preferable that the reed is located about midway between the base and middle of the stock. Preferably, the sensor is positioned as close to the sound source (reed) as possible. However, placement of the sensors in other areas of the drone may be higher or lower depending on the sound and tones desired. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> depicts a cut away view of a canter stock embodiment of the present invention showing the sensor placement towards the chanter insertion end of the stock (<b>140</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> depicts a cut away view of a canter stock embodiment of the present invention, which is engaged with the chanter mount and reed.

Some tropical hardwoods used to make the chanter and drones, particularly ebony, are ideal for damp climates but do not work well in the drier regions. Plastics, particularly acetyl homopolymers, are often used to avoid the complications of moisture and temperature fluctuations. An ideal material for a Chanter Stock is a hard wood such as African Black Wood (traditionally used in Highland Bagpipes) but other types of wood can be used. The wood absorbs some of the moisture from the breath that can collect on the cane chanter reed. Thus, when cane reeds are used, having a wooden stock is preferred. In the case of synthetic reeds, as is more common in the bagpipe drone reeds, a stock made of hard plastic such as Delrin or Polypenco is preferable. If a cane drone reed is being used in the drone, (less common) then wooden stocks might be preferable.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The groove for the sensor can be machined into the inner wall of the stock after the bore has been drilled out. Moldable plastics are not often used in Bagpipe parts because the softer plastic materials tend to change shape depending on external temperature and humidity. However, in plastic stocks the groove may be molded into the inner wall of the stock. The sensor groove may also be machined into the inner wall of plastic stocks.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The sensor may be conventionally adhered to the sensor grove in the stock wall by an adhesive such as, for example, a commercially available two-part epoxy adhesive consisting of a base and an accelerator.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In certain embodiments the stock may be attached via a hook and loop type adhesive. This allows the sensor to be repositioned or replaced. The sensor may also be placed in the groove with only a pressure fit, as the wire will hold the sensor in place.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">There numerous conventional ways that chanter or drone pipes may be attached to their corresponding stocks. For example, the stock may attach to the reed mount (e.g., <b>150</b>, <b>290</b>) via a cork pressure fit. In a preferred embodiment they may be attached via threaded couplings such as can be seen in GB2514991A. Traditionally, chanter or drone pipes are attached to their corresponding stocks and held in place when the outward pressure of a material in the gap creates friction between the parts. The most commonly used material for this application is either hemp or linen string which is often coated with wax.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In certain embodiments, the piezoelectric sensor is soldered to two 26 gauge wires (<b>165</b>) (<b>260</b>). The wires lead from the sensor thru a hole in the stock to the respective jack housing. To protect the wires, which exit the drone or chanter, the wires are covered with cable material such as, for example, heat-shrink plastic wrap. In preferred embodiments, the ends of the wires are soldered to a &#x215b;&#x2033; (3.5 mm) mono &#x2018;male&#x2019; plug. To connect the sensor to an external amplification device, a cable adapter may be necessary. The preferred cable adapter is a mono &#x2018;female&#x2019; &#x215b;&#x2033; to a mono &#x2018;female&#x2019; &#xbc;&#x2033; adapter. The adapter is secured to the drone or chanter stock using, for example, a metal hose clamp or bound to the stock with twine. A &#xbc;&#x2033; instrument cable of varying length can be connected to the adapter and fed into an amplification device. Alternatively, if connecting into a computer or other smaller device a cable with a &#x215b;&#x2033; mono &#x2018;female&#x2019; jack leading to a &#x215b;&#x2033; mono &#x2018;male&#x2019; plug may be used. This type of cable can be directly fitted to the plug coming out of the bagpipe and no adapter is necessary. An adapter may be necessary for &#xbc;&#x2033; connections, which are more typical in guitar and live instrument amplification.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0000"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i></figref>depict another preferred embodiment of the present invention where the pickup device includes an integrated buffer circuit (<b>310</b>) added to the jack housing (<b>190</b>, <b>275</b>). The integrated buffer circuit (<b>310</b>) is located in the chanter/drone stock in between the piezo pickup (<b>175</b>, <b>270</b>) that is attached to the inner wall of the stock and the output jack. Preferably, the integrated buffer circuit is housed inside the same enclosure that constitutes the jack housing (<b>190</b>, <b>275</b>). Rather than being wired directly to the jack, the piezo pickup may be wired directly into the integrated buffer circuit which in turn is wired to the output jack. The signal is connected to an amplifier by means of an audio cable connecting the output jack and the amplifier. In certain embodiments the integrated buffer circuit requires external power (<b>320</b>). The integrated buffer circuit may be powered via either a 9 Volt battery or a DC Power Adapter attached to a DC Power Jack wired into the buffer circuit. The purpose of the buffer circuit is to correct an impedance mismatch which naturally occurs between the piezo pickup and most modern amplifiers and/or effects units. Generally, piezo pickups do work as effectively without a buffer circuit, however, the audio quality and audio device compatibility is greatly improved by first running the signal through a buffer circuit before it reaches the amplifier and/or effects units. A musician wishing to use the pickup system without an integrated buffer circuit can correct the impedance mismatch by connecting an independently dedicated buffer circuit in between the line out from the un-buffered pickup and the amplifier. Dedicated buffer circuits can often be purchased in the form of an effects pedal which is also commonly referred to as a &#x2018;stomp box&#x2019;. An advantage to having an integrated buffer circuit embedded into the enclosure is that the musician does not have to use additional audio devices to correct the naturally occurring piezo pickup impedance mismatch.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can, using the preceding description, utilize the present invention to its fullest extent.
