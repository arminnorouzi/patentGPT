More particularly, the embodiments described herein relate to medical devices that include a force sensor unit that is coupled to a mechanical structure of the medical device and is used to measure axial forces applied to the end effector of the medical device during a surgical procedure.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Minimally invasive medical techniques are intended to reduce the amount of tissue that is damaged during diagnostic or surgical procedures, thereby reducing patient recovery time, discomfort, and deleterious side effects. Teleoperated surgical systems that use robot assisted technology can be used to overcome limitations of manual laparoscopic and open surgery. Advances in telepresence systems provide surgeons views inside a patient's body, an increased number of degrees of motion of surgical tools, and the ability for surgical collaboration over long distances. In teleoperation surgery systems, a tool operator can actuate an input to a master control device to send control signals to a mechanical control device at a proximal end portion of an elongated tool shaft to control motion of a connector, such as a cable, or a connector-hypotube combination that extends within a length of the shaft, to control movement of an end effector at a distal end portion of the tool shaft. Control connectors or connector-hypotube combinations, typically are pre-tensioned to enable a surgical tool at a surgical site to respond rapidly and accurately to actuation signals. Thus, direct natural force feedback to a tool operator is largely eliminated because such tool user does not manually manipulate the tool directly.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A force sensor can be disposed at or near a tool shaft to measure clinical forces imparted to patient tissue during a medical procedure due to contact with an end effector, for example. These force measurements at or near a tool shaft can be used to produce haptic feedback forces at an input to a master control device to provide to a user an indication of the forces imparted by the tool to patient tissue, for example. Enhancements to force sensor systems can lead to more accurate force measurements, which in turn, can result in more accurate haptic feedback.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This summary introduces certain aspects of the embodiments described herein to provide a basic understanding.

As the magnet is moved axially within the coils, a change in inductance at each coil results. The change in inductance at each of the coils can be used to measure changes in position of the instrument shaft, which can be translated to z-axis force measurements.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an embodiment of an example illustrative plan view of a minimally invasive teleoperated surgical system <b>10</b> for performing a minimally invasive diagnostic or surgical procedure on a patient <b>12</b> who is lying on an operating table <b>14</b>.

A medical device typically includes an end effector associated with one or more surgical tasks, such as forceps, a needle driver, a shears, a bipolar cauterizer, a tissue stabilizer or retractor, a clip applier, an anastomosis device, an imaging device (e.g., an endoscope or ultrasound probe), and the like. In various embodiments, some medical devices can also provide an articulated support, sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;wrist,&#x201d; for the end effector, so that the position and orientation of the end effector can be manipulated with one or more mechanical degrees of freedom in relation to the tool's shaft <b>410</b>. Further, many surgical end effectors can include a functional mechanical degree of freedom, such as jaws that open or close, or a knife that translates along a path.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Surgical instruments appropriate for use in one or more embodiments of the present disclosure can control their end effectors with one or more connectors that can be, for example, rods and/or flexible cables. In some examples, rods, which can be in the form of tubes, can be combined with cables to provide a pull, push, or combined &#x201c;push/pull&#x201d; or &#x201c;pull/pull&#x201d; control of the end effector, with the connectors providing flexible sections as required. A typical elongated tool shaft <b>410</b> for a medical device is small, for example five to eight millimeters in diameter. The diminutive scale of the mechanisms in the surgical instrument creates unique mechanical conditions and issues with the construction of these mechanisms that are unlike those found in similar mechanisms constructed at a larger scale, because forces and strengths of materials do not scale at the same rate as the size of the mechanisms. The connectors must fit within the elongated tool shaft <b>410</b> and be able to control the end effector through the wrist joint. The connectors can be manufactured from a variety of metal (e.g., tungsten or stainless steel) or polymer (e.g., high molecular weight polyethylene) materials.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is an illustrative side view of a medical device <b>26</b> including a distal portion <b>420</b> and a proximal mechanical structure <b>422</b> coupled to one another by an elongated shaft <b>410</b> defining an internal bore. As used herein, the term &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; indicates a location nearer to the center of a body or the point of attachment and the term &#x201c;distal&#x201d; indicates a location more distant from the center of a body or the point of attachment. For example, the term &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; indicates a location closer to a manipulator arm and the term &#x201c;distal&#x201d; indicates a location more distant from the manipulator arm. Mechanical structure <b>422</b> can include a support structure that can include, for example, a housing <b>425</b> supporting an input device <b>429</b>. Input device <b>429</b> can include an instrument control surface <b>427</b>. In other embodiments, various support structures optionally may be used, such as a chassis, a frame, a bed, a unitized surrounding outer body of the mechanical structure, and the like. The input device facilitates controlled adjustment of the instrument's end effector via a connector (which functions as, for example, a tension member to actuate the end effector) extending along an internal bore of the elongated tool shaft <b>410</b>. In some embodiments, the connector can be a cable, a band or the like.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Control surface <b>427</b> provides mechanical connections to other control features of medical device <b>26</b>. During use, instrument control surface <b>427</b> couples to a medical device carriage <b>75</b> (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), which provides motor-driven rotational forces to steering inputs <b>432</b> at the control surface <b>427</b> to control the medical device <b>26</b>.

Further, in the illustrated embodiment, forceps <b>428</b> are coupled to the elongated tool shaft <b>410</b> by a wrist joint <b>430</b>, which allows the orientation of the forceps to be manipulated with reference to the elongated tool shaft <b>424</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is an illustrative bottom view of the example medical device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> showing the control surface <b>427</b> of input device <b>429</b>. The control surface <b>427</b> can rest atop a carriage <b>75</b>, which includes actuators such as motors (not shown) controlled by control signals produced in response to user input at the control inputs <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, for example. As shown, control surface <b>427</b> includes multiple steering inputs <b>432</b>, each of which governs a different aspect of movement by wrist joint <b>430</b> and forceps <b>428</b>. Of course, more or less steering inputs <b>432</b> can be provided in different implementations. When control surface <b>427</b> is coupled to tool carriage <b>75</b>, each of steering inputs <b>432</b> interfaces with an actuator (e.g., servo motor, not shown) within the carriage <b>75</b> that drives the steering input. In this example, steering inputs <b>432</b> are configured to form a direct mechanical engagement with respective rotary actuators (e.g., servo motors) of tool carriage <b>75</b>. However, other suitable configurations for power transmission can also be used (e.g., indirect mechanical couplings including speed and/or torque converters, fluid couplings, and/or electrical couplings). Each of steering inputs <b>432</b> is part of a limited slip capstan and drive shaft assembly that operates a drive cable controlling movement of an end effector such as forceps <b>428</b>, for example. In various embodiments, the mechanical structure <b>422</b> can be structured as a back-end housing that includes a force sensor unit <b>440</b> to detect axial force at a distal end of the elongated shaft <b>410</b>. The force sensor unit <b>440</b> may be disposed in the mechanical structure <b>422</b> in a number of arrangements. For example, a portion of the force sensor <b>440</b> can be arranged over the elongated shaft <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A design of a compact, axial force sensor unit, which has components small enough to fit on a proximal end of an instrument shaft, can be implemented using target material with respect to multiple coils to generate signals that can be compared to determine axial motion of the instrument shaft in response to an axial force applied to the distal end of the instrument shaft. The designs described herein are temperature stable, robust against cautery interference, and survives autoclave cleaning. The force sensor unit is frictionless, not disturbing the force being measured.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In various embodiments, a dual-coil distance displacement sensor can be used in conjunction with a spring or flexure to determine the axial force imparted upon an instrument shaft. Since force is bi-directional, the spring can be structured as a bi-directional spring. The axial direction can be taken as a z-axis direction. A z-direction force upon a distal end of the instrument shaft displaces the instrument shaft axially in the proximal direction of the instrument shaft. With the spring operatively coupled to a proximal end portion of the instrument shaft, the spring is displaced by a distance proportionate to a z-direction force imparted to a distal portion of the instrument shaft. The dual-coil displacement sensor can include a proximal coil and a distal coil, which are coaxially mounted in fixed positions upon a support structure of a proximal mechanical structure to measure axial displacement of the spring based upon change in magnetic flux through the coils or the inductance within the coils, as described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The proximal end of the instrument shaft or a component coupled to the proximal end of the instrument shaft, can include a magnet disposed thereon. Any of the magnets described herein can be, for example, a ferrite bead, an EMI suppression bead, a Nickel-zinc bead, or any other suitable material. Thus, in one aspect it should be understood that the term &#x201c;magnet&#x201d; as used herein can refer to any component or material coupled to the instrument shaft that can be used to provide a signal indicative of the position of the shaft within the coils as the magnet moves within the coils. The magnet can be in the form of a bead, though other forms may be used. The magnet can be disposed or connected to the instrument shaft in a number of ways. With the magnet connected to the instrument shaft, movement of the instrument shaft results in movement of the magnet. The proximal end of the instrument shaft (or an extension of the instrument, a rod, or the like) with the magnet thereon extends through the dual windings such that there is an air gap between the instrument shaft (or rod) with the magnet disposed thereon and the dual-coils. When &#x201c;at rest,&#x201d; with no z-direction force exerted upon the instrument shaft, the instrument shaft can be axially positioned such that the magnet is disposed in part within each coil. In some embodiments, with no z-direction force exerted upon the instrument shaft, equal portions of the magnet can be disposed within each of the coils. Each coil is coupled into a separate LC circuit in which the coil acts as an inductor (L) and in which the inductance varies with the amount of the magnet contained within the coil. The resonant frequency of each circuit varies with changes in inductance of the circuit. Materials other than a magnetic material can be used, where such other materials contribute or influence the inductance associated with the coils used in the LC circuits. For example, these other materials can be used in the configurations discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The inductance of each coil, and therefore, the resonant frequency of each circuit varies with z-axis force upon the distal end portion of the instrument shaft. With the spring operatively coupled to the proximal end portion of the instrument shaft, the spring displacement in response to z-direction force upon the distal portion of the instrument shaft corresponds to the amount of axial displacement of the instrument shaft and the axial displacement of the magnet thereon. The amount of axial displacement of the magnet determines the portion of the magnet extending into each coil. For example, a larger z-direction force causes more of the magnet to be disposed within the proximal coil than within the distal coil.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">A frequency detection circuit can be used to detect the resonant frequencies of the circuit including the proximal coil and the circuit including the distal coil. Each circuit of the two circuits will have a resonant frequency defined by its coil and the magnet, where the contribution of the magnet is based on a distance of the magnet in the z-direction within the respective coil. When the magnet is disposed within the proximal coil more than within the distal coil, the resonant frequency of the circuit using the proximal coil will be different from the resonant frequency of the circuit using the distal coil. The resonant frequencies can be used to determine the axial displacement of the shaft, and, therefore, the amount of displacement of the spring, from which correspondingly, a measure of the z-direction force upon the distal portion of the shaft can be determined.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> is a schematic illustration of a medical device <b>326</b>, according to an embodiment. In some embodiments, the medical device <b>326</b> or any of the components therein are optionally parts of a surgical system that performs surgical procedures, and which can include a manipulator unit, a series of kinematic linkages, a series of cannulas, or the like as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>B</figref>. The medical device <b>326</b> and the medical devices described herein can include a mechanical structure <b>322</b> and a force sensor unit <b>340</b> coupled to or included within the mechanical structure <b>322</b>, a shaft <b>310</b> coupled to the mechanical structure <b>322</b> and an end effector <b>328</b> coupled to a distal end of the shaft <b>310</b>. The end effector <b>328</b> can include, for example, articulatable jaws or another suitable surgical tool that is coupled to a link <b>330</b>. In some embodiments, the link <b>330</b> can be included within a wrist assembly having multiple articulating links. In some embodiments, the shaft <b>310</b> is also movably coupled at a proximal end portion to the mechanical structure <b>322</b>. The mechanical structure <b>322</b> can include components configured to move one or more components of the medical device, such as, for example, the end effector <b>328</b>. The mechanical structure <b>322</b> can be similar to the mechanical structure <b>422</b> described herein.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Generally, during a medical procedure, the end effector <b>328</b> contacts anatomical tissue, which may result in X, Y, or Z direction forces being imparted on the end effector <b>328</b> and that may result in moment forces such as a moment M<sub>Y </sub>about a y-direction axis as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>. In some embodiments, one or more strain sensors (not shown), which can be strain gauges, can be included in the medical device <b>326</b> to measure strain that can be used to determine forces imparted on the end effector <b>328</b> in the X and Y axes directions. These X and Y axes forces are transverse (e.g., perpendicular) to the Z axis (which is parallel or collinear with a center axis of the shaft).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The force sensor unit <b>340</b> (and any of the force sensor units described herein) can be used to measure the axial force(s) (i.e., in the direction of the Z-axis parallel to the center axis of the shaft) imparted on the end effector <b>328</b>. For example, an axial force imparted to the end effector <b>328</b> in a direction of the Z-axis can cause axial displacement of the shaft <b>310</b> in a direction along a center axis C-A of the shaft <b>310</b>. The axial force may be in the proximal direction (e.g., a reactive force resulting from pushing against tissue with the end effector) or it may be in the distal direction (e.g., a reactive force resulting from pulling tissue grasped with the end effector). As described herein, the shaft <b>310</b> can be coupled to the mechanical structure <b>322</b> via a biasing mechanism (e.g., a spring member) such that the amount of travel of the shaft <b>310</b> relative to the mechanical structure <b>322</b> can be correlated to the magnitude of the axial force imparted to the end effector <b>328</b>. In this manner, measuring the distance through which the shaft <b>310</b> moves relative to the mechanical structure <b>322</b> can be used to determine the axial force.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the force sensor units described herein can include any suitable components to isolate the axial movement of the shaft (i.e., to constrain the shaft such that the measured movement is caused only by the axial force and not the transverse forces along the X and Y axes), and limit frictional force opposing movement of the shaft (which can cause errors in determining the axial force). In some embodiments, the force sensor unit can include a coil assembly and a microprocessor.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As described herein, the coil assembly of the force sensor unit measures the displacement of the shaft along the z-axis, which is then converted to the force measurement. The coil assembly can include two inductive coils each wound around a cylinder formed from a nonconductive material, such as, for example, PEEK. The two coils can be positioned coaxially relative to each other and coupled to, or within, the mechanical structure. In some embodiments, a rod is movable within an interior of the coils and is coupled to the instrument shaft of the medical device. In alternative embodiments, the medical device may not include a rod and instead a proximal portion of the instrument shaft is movable within the coils. The rod can, for example, include a core with a magnet coupled to the core that moves with the rod within the coaxial coils. The core can be, for example, a glass core, a stainless steel core or a core formed with another suitable material. The magnet and any of the magnets described herein, can be, for example, a ferrite bead, an EMI suppression bead, a Nickel-zinc bead, or any other suitable material. Thus, on another aspect it should be understood that the term &#x201c;magnet&#x201d; as used herein can refer to any component or material coupled to the core that can be used to provide a signal indicative of the position of the core within the coils as the rod and core move within the coils. The rod is operably coupled to the shaft such that when the shaft moves axially due to forces imparted on a distal end of the medical device, the rod moves with the shaft and within the coils. As the rod moves within the inductive coils, the inductance at each of the coils changes, which can be used to measure changes in position of the instrument shaft. As described above, the change in position of the shaft can be translated to a z-axis force measurement.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">During use of the medical device, as force is imparted on the shaft n a z-direction, the shaft will travel along the z-axis, which in turn causes the rod to move along the z-axis. As the rod moves within the coils, each of the coils generate a signal associated with a position of the magnet on the rod within the coils. The microprocessor receives the signals from the coils. For example, in some embodiments, each of the coils generate a signal associated with a linear displacement of the shaft along the center axis of the shaft (e.g., along the z-axis). In some embodiments, the signals from the coils can include a first signal from the first coil having a first frequency, and a second signal from the second coil having a second frequency. The microprocessor is configured to execute instructions to determine from the first frequency and the second frequency a measure of a force on the shaft along the center axis of the shaft.
