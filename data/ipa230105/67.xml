continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 17/126,177, filed on Dec. 18, 2020. The patent application identified above is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety to provide continuity of disclosure.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to insect management devices. More particularly, this disclosure relates to devices for preventing insects from accessing food, water, and plants.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Insects are a nuisance and can even threaten animal health when they crawl into places that set aside food intended for animals such as pets. For example, roaches are known disease carriers. If they crawl into food intended for a dog or a cat, they can contaminate the food to such a degree as to cause illness in the animal that ingests the contaminated food. The affected dog or cat could, for instance, contract a stomach worm if it has eaten an infected roach.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various devices have been implemented to prevent unwanted intrusion of insects into animal feed dishes. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,860,229 to Craft teaches what purports to be an ant-proof pet food bowl, comprised of a top food container and a bottom water container connected to one another by a central post. The bottom water container is at least partially filled with water so as to create a &#x201c;moat&#x201d; intended to prevent crawling insects from reaching the top food container. For further example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,802,302 to Alnafissa discloses a pet food dish comprised of a base section and a feed dish removably received in the base section. A band with an insect-trapping adhesive layer on its outer surface is placed around the periphery of a cylindrical side wall of the base section. The feed dish has a flanged side wall that prevents access to the band by the animal intended to be fed, once the feed dish sits in the base section. Additionally, a plurality of lugs extend radially outwardly from the base section side wall to function as a stop intended to prevent downward slippage of the band along the side wall.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While devices such as those mentioned above may have some effectiveness toward preventing unwanted insect intrusion into feeding dishes, they are subject to some drawbacks. For example, devices that rely upon creation of a &#x201c;moat&#x201d; in a lower bowl or container can fail if a quantity of the water evaporates sufficient to allow an insect to crawl on a portion of the inside surface of the lower bowl. Additionally, devices that require the use of adhesive-carrying strips may be require frequent replacement. Strips, by definition, have a small height, such that it may take only a relatively few number of insects to cover the adhesive strip to the point where its effectiveness becomes limited.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is to be understood that this summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure. This summary is exemplary and not restrictive. The sole purpose of this summary is to explain and exemplify certain concepts of the disclosure as an introduction to the following complete and extensive detailed description.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an aspect of the present disclosure, an insect barrier base system comprises a base, a column defining a top column end and a bottom column end, the column further defining a periphery, wherein the bottom column end communicates with the base, insect-trapping material positioned around the periphery of the column between the top column end and the bottom column end, and a tray communicating with the top column end, the tray configured to hold a perishable item. Optionally, the insect-trapping material is positioned around the column with a spool assembly comprising a hollow core disposed around the periphery of the column, and a supply of the insect-trapping material wound around the core, the spool assembly configured to permit selective removal of successive increments of the insect-trapping material from the core.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect of the present disclosure, a method of preventing insect intrusion upon a perishable item comprises the steps of placing the perishable item in a tray, the tray communicating with a top column end of a column that communicates at a column bottom end with a base, and causing an insect to be trapped at a position above the base but before it reaches the tray.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various implementations described in the present disclosure can comprise additional systems, methods, features, and advantages, which may not necessarily be expressly disclosed herein but will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following detailed description and accompanying drawings. It is intended that all such systems, methods, features, and advantages be included within the present disclosure and protected by the accompanying claims. The features and advantages of such implementations can be realized and obtained by means of the systems, methods, features particularly pointed out in the appended claims. These and other features will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or can be learned by the practice of such exemplary implementations as set forth hereinafter.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The features and components of the following figures are illustrated to emphasize the general principles of the present disclosure.

However, before the present devices, systems, and/or methods are disclosed and described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to the specific devices, systems, and/or methods disclosed unless otherwise specified, and, as such can, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular aspects only and is not intended to be limiting.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The following description is provided as an enabling teaching of the present devices, systems, and/or methods in their best, currently known aspect. To this end, those skilled in the relevant art will recognize and appreciate that many changes can be made to the various aspects described herein, while still obtaining the beneficial results of the present disclosure.

This helps to prevent the base <b>16</b> from catching any food or water that may be pushed out of the tray <b>12</b> by the feeding animal. If the shape of the tray <b>12</b> is circular as shown, the tray diameter d<sub>t </sub>can be sufficiently large to thwart access by a feeding animal of the insect trapping material <b>28</b> on the spool assembly <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> additionally shows an optional non-slip footing <b>42</b> that can be attached in any suitable manner, such as adhesively, to a bottom surface <b>44</b> of the base bottom <b>32</b>. Non-slip footing <b>42</b> can be used to enhance functionality of the insect barrier base systems of the present disclosure for indoor use, exemplified with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, discussed later herein. Non-slip footing is preferably constructed of rubber to resist slippage of the insect barrier base system when supported on an indoor surface. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts footing <b>42</b> as a continuous ring, footing <b>42</b> may instead comprise a plurality of discontinuous non-slip pads spaced from one another and distributed across the bottom surface <b>44</b> in any suitable pattern.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref> illustrate an insect barrier base system <b>60</b> constructed in accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure. System <b>60</b> may be constructed identically as system <b>10</b>, except that a spool assembly <b>24</b> substitutes for the insect trapping material <b>15</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) used by itself in system <b>10</b>. The spool assembly <b>24</b> is intended to provide for a more convenient means of replenishing a supply of insect trapping material once it has been completely spent. As discussed above, the column <b>14</b> defines a top column end <b>18</b> and a bottom column end <b>20</b> communicating with the base <b>16</b>. The column <b>14</b> further defines a periphery <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). The spool assembly <b>24</b> is positioned around the periphery <b>22</b> of the column <b>14</b> between the top column end <b>18</b> and the bottom column end <b>20</b>. The spool assembly <b>24</b> comprises a hollow core <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) positioned around, and preferably contacting, the periphery <b>22</b> of the column <b>14</b>, and further comprises a supply of insect-trapping material <b>28</b> wound around the hollow core <b>26</b>. The spool assembly <b>24</b> is configured to permit selective removal of successive increments of the insect-trapping material <b>28</b> from the core <b>26</b>. Specifically, once an increment of material <b>28</b> that is exposed to the ambient outdoor environment E traps a number of insects <b>30</b> that, in the judgment of a user of the system <b>10</b>, diminishes its continued effectiveness to trap additional insects, the user can peel off the exposed increment from the spool assembly <b>24</b> to reveal a new, successive increment of the insect-trapping material <b>28</b> that now becomes the increment exposed to the outdoor environment E. The insect-trapping material <b>28</b> may have the same characteristics as the insect-trapping material <b>15</b> discussed above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the tray <b>12</b> defines a tray bottom surface <b>46</b>, the base <b>16</b> defines an upper base edge <b>48</b>, and the column <b>14</b> further defines a column height h<sub>c</sub>, which separates the tray bottom surface <b>46</b> from the upper base edge <b>48</b> by a distance d that is sufficiently small to prevent a feeding animal from accessing the insect-trapping material <b>28</b> on the spool assembly <b>24</b>. Yet the distance d is also sufficiently large to prevent an insect <b>30</b> from bridging the tray bottom surface <b>46</b> and the upper base edge <b>48</b>. Preferably, the distance d ranges from and including 1.5 inches to and including 1.75 inches.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As seen from the exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the spool assembly <b>24</b> is disposed between the upper flange <b>33</b> and the lower flange <b>21</b>. Preferably, in such an arrangement, the axial height of the insect-trapping material <b>28</b> is coextensive with the height h<sub>c </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) of the column <b>14</b>. This ensures that an upper end <b>50</b> of the material <b>28</b> will abut a lower surface of the upper flange <b>33</b>, and that a lower end <b>52</b> of the material <b>28</b> will abut against an upper surface of the lower flange <b>21</b>. With such an arrangement, crawling insects <b>30</b> entering the base <b>16</b> will not be able to contact any part of the column <b>14</b> when attempting to climb the system <b>60</b>, because any such attempt will instead result in the insects <b>30</b> contacting the insect-trapping material <b>28</b>. Such an embodiment thus causes an insect <b>30</b> to be trapped at a position above the base <b>16</b> but before it reaches the tray <b>12</b>. Alternatively, though not shown, the spool assembly <b>24</b> may peripherally surround both the upper flange <b>33</b> and the lower flange <b>21</b>, though such a relative sizing may bring the hollow core <b>26</b> out of the direct engagement with the periphery <b>22</b> of column <b>14</b> that is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an exploded view of an insect barrier base system <b>90</b> constructed according to yet another aspect of the present disclosure, wherein a peripheral shield <b>92</b> extends downwardly from the tray <b>12</b>.

The peripheral shield <b>92</b> functions as an additional barrier to prevent access to the insect-trapping material <b>28</b> by a feeding animal. The peripheral shield <b>92</b> defines a bottom shield edge <b>94</b>. Once system <b>90</b> is fully assembled, the bottom shield edge <b>94</b> and the upper base edge <b>48</b> may be separated from one another by a distance that is sufficiently small to prevent a feeding animal from accessing the insect-trapping material <b>28</b> on the spool assembly <b>24</b>, yet also sufficiently large to prevent an insect <b>30</b> from bridging the bottom shield edge <b>94</b> and the upper base edge <b>48</b>. Such a distance preferably ranges from and including 1.25 inches to and including 1.5 inches.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows an alternative use of the insect barrier base system <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>) to protect plants (such as the plant P shown), rather than consumables such as food or water. Certain types of crawling insects are known to harm and eat plants. For example, aphids suck out plant sap, and the affected plant can die without treatment. As further examples, cutworms and slugs also feed on plants. To protect plant P, the tray <b>12</b> can hold soil S in which the plant P is planted.
