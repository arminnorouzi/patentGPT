For example, nebulizers, devices containing propellants, and dry powder inhalers have been used for the treatment of diseases, such as asthma, respiratory tract infections and systemic diseases such as diabetes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The efficiency of delivering the required dosage of a therapeutic substance to a patient in treating a disease depends on the efficiency of the device, and overall efficiency can be enhanced by providing proper feedback mechanisms to a patient, clinician or physician during use of the device to teach, for example, proper inhalation techniques to a patient. Improper use of the device and poor inhalation technique can lead to lack of efficacy in treating a disease. For example, administering lower or higher dosages of a therapeutic substance than intended can be harmful to a patient. To effectively deliver therapeutic substances to the respiratory tract, a patient or user can be trained or coached to use the device in an appropriate manner.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Dry powder inhalers used to deliver medicaments to the lungs contain a dose of a powder formulation usually either in bulk supply or quantified into individual doses stored in unit dose compartments, like hard gelatin capsules, cartridges, or blister packs. Dosing reproducibility requires that the drug formulation is uniform and that the dose can be delivered to the patient with consistent and reproducible results. Therefore, dosing can be improved by optimizing discharge of a formulation, which is effectuated, for example, by having patients perform proper inhalation maneuvers that achieve the necessary dosing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Devices for training patients to properly deliver therapeutic substances by the pulmonary tract are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,333,106, which discloses an apparatus for interactive training of a patient in use of an aerosol inhaler, including a feedback display based upon air flow versus volume data using a proper sequence of inhalation steps. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/759,859 (Publication No. US 2004/0187869) discloses a training device for medicament inhalers, for example, dry powder inhalers, which is based on measuring pressure differential and displaying a single value corresponding to both inhalation rapidity and inhalation flow rate peak, using a dry powder inhaler simulator.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Dry powder inhalers and cartridge systems, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,499,757 and 8,636,001, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all they teach regarding dry powder inhalers, can generate primary drug particles or suitable inhalation plumes during an inspiratory maneuver by deagglomerating a powder formulation within the inhaler and capsule or cartridge. The benefits of delivering drugs via pulmonary circulation are numerous and, include rapid entry into arterial circulation, avoidance of first pass drug degradation by liver metabolism and ease of use, for example, the lack of discomfort compared to other routes of administration such as by injection. These devices have been in use in clinical settings and are now commercially available.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An interactive apparatus and method for profiling of inhalation efforts is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 9,364,619, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is a need in the art for improvements in design and manufacture of inhaler devices which would maximize accuracy and require minimal training and effort for subjects in proper use of the inhalation system and monitoring patients during use of the inhalation system and their overall course of care and improvements to the flexibility of application to inhalers and inhaler parts including medicament packages and the reusability of such systems overall. The present disclosure presents apparatus and methods that achieve these goals.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Described herein is an interactive apparatus for detecting and measuring inspiratory characteristic parameters of an inhalation system in use, including, inhalers and a patient's use of an inhaler in conjunction with the apparatus. In disclosed embodiments, the apparatus and method for using the apparatus are useful, for example, in sensing, detecting, measuring and monitoring a subject's characteristic inhalation profile, or breathing patterns, by collecting data generated from the subject's inhalation maneuver and identifying the effort required to deliver an appropriate or therapeutic dose with an inhaler provided to the subject for use in a treatment regimen.

In some embodiments, the sensor can comprise a Doppler sensing device which can detect a flow of air or a gas through an inhaler. In other embodiments, the sensor comprises a pressure sensor which can detect pressure drop during an inhalation maneuver.

In this embodiment, the sensors <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> can be a pressure, flow, sound, optical, gas, humidity, or temperature transducer that is either analog or digital. Electrical signal generated from sensor <b>51</b> is then transmitted to signal conditioner <b>61</b> to remove unwanted portions of signals, such as signal noise. Conditioned electrical signal <b>62</b> is then transmitted to bandwidth limiter <b>63</b> to reduce the frequency of the signal to a desired range to reduce and select the data needing to be analyzed and the signal is then transmitted to a signal amplifier <b>64</b> and in signal amplifier <b>64</b>, the selected signal can be amplified to a predetermined voltage range, and transmitted as amplified signal <b>65</b>.

It should be appreciated by one skilled in the art that certain &#x201c;smart&#x201d; sensors can be used which integrate certain of the conditioning, filtering, amplifying and converting functionality into the sensor itself. Therefore, any reference to these subsequent elements in this specification can be replaced by use of such integrated sensors.

Display <b>58</b> can be a screen comprising LED, OLED, LCD, touch screen, or other interactive display. In certain embodiments, a baseline curve for the user is stored in the system <b>50</b> and provided on the display <b>58</b> along with the inhalation signal information. The baseline curve is indicative of the level of performance for an inhaler type to deliver a substantially accurate dose to a patient as measured using an inhaler training device <b>10</b> as a reference standard to guide the user's inhalation maneuver. Therefore, during an inhalation, a user can visually compare his/her inhalation maneuver to the baseline standard. It is possible to omit the medicament form the inhaler during training of the user so that the medicament is not wasted on failed inhalation maneuvers. In this manner, the user can alter his/her inhalation effort to conform to the requirements of the standard when the drug is actually inhaled. The displayed data for each inhalation performed by a subject can be saved via second connection <b>76</b> to output <b>55</b>, wherein the data can be stored or transferred accordingly. For example, output <b>55</b> can be in the form of a disc drive or flash drive or printer, or transmitted via email or text to a physician for review or further training as needed. In some embodiments, signals from an inhalation training device can be transmitted to the computer/PDA/mobile/tablet and signals from the computer/PDA/mobile/tablet can be received by the inhalation training device, thereby establishing a two way communication between the two components. For instance, a user can input into computer <b>57</b> certain information such as patient number, dose strength, comments on condition, etc. In this and other embodiments, sensor <b>52</b> is a digital sensor or a sensor that can produce a digital output. It can be an accelerometer, a Doppler sensor, a luxometer or a laser and signal detected can be transmitted directly to the on-board microprocessor and analyzed, processed and transmitted thereafter. Signal information in the microprocessor can be analyzed and processed using algorithms, which converts the data, for example, into a pressure versus time curve using a graphical interface that can be displayed.
