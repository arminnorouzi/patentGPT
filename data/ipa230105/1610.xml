A plurality of films is arranged in a mold, so that when the mold is closed, at least two films are placed side by side. A first substrate is injected into a first portion of the molding cavity, then a carriage is moved to a retracted position so as to create a second cavity. A second substrate is introduced into the second cavity.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this way, a molded part with two surface zones is obtained, having a visual effect produced by a film.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, a limited number of visual effects can be produced this way. Moreover, the link between the zones is not fluid.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One object of the invention is therefore to propose a manufacturing method of a trim element with a particularly satisfactory visual effect.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For this purpose, an object of the invention is a manufacturing method of a trim element, comprising the following steps:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">supplying a mold comprising a first mold part and a second mold part, where the first mold part has a first molding surface, and the second mold part has a second molding surface, the mold being movable between at least an open configuration and a closed configuration, the first molding surface and the second molding surface together delimit at least partially, a mold cavity in the closed mold configuration, where the mold is in the open configuration,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">positioning a first decoration against the first molding surface, the first decoration being preformed,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0010">positioning a wedge in contact with at least one edge of the first decoration, said wedge being suitable for maintaining the first decoration at least partially against the first molding surface of the first mold part,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0011">positioning a second decoration, where the second decoration is flexible,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0012">closing the mold in the closed configuration, where the second decoration is arranged between the first mold part and the second mold part after the closing of the mold, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0013">the back-injection of a substrate into the molding cavity, where the second decoration is being pushed against the first decoration by the substrate during the back-injection.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0014">The application of the second decoration against the first decoration by injecting a substrate produces a special visual effect, by the overlay of materials.

In this way, the wedge <b>34</b> is placed at a distance from the second mold part <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0175">The hook <b>100</b> is in the holding position.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0176">The hook <b>100</b> does not mate with the matching element <b>106</b>, more particularly at the corresponding shoulders, since the wedge <b>34</b> extends at a distance from the second mold part.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0177">When the mold is moved into the closed configuration, the sliding surface <b>104</b> of the hook mates with the sliding surface <b>110</b> of the matching element.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0178">The hook <b>100</b> is driven, by mating, into the free position, more particularly via the contact between the sliding surfaces.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0179">The return element <b>112</b> is compressed.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0180">Once the mold is in the closed position, the second mold part <b>14</b> extends against the first mold part <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0181">The hook <b>100</b> is no longer in contact with the sliding surface <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0182">In this way, the return element <b>112</b> extends and engages the hook <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0183">The hook <b>100</b> moves automatically to the holding position by means of the return element.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0184">The shoulders <b>102</b>, <b>108</b> mate so that wedge <b>34</b> is held against the second mold part <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0185">During the opening of the mold after the back-injection, the wedge <b>34</b> is held, e. g. against the second mold part <b>14</b>, namely at least partly by means of the mating between the hook <b>100</b> and the matching element <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0186">Thus, the hook <b>100</b> helps to hold the wedge against the second mold part, e.g. in addition to a cylinder <b>114</b> which is suitable for controlling the movement of the wedge with respect to the first mold part.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0187">The movement of the wedge <b>34</b> with respect to the first mold part <b>12</b> is driven, e. g. by a pneumatic or hydraulic cylinder.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0188">The presence of the holding hook makes it possible to design a smaller size of cylinder, since a lower pressure is required for extending the wedge when the mold is opening.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0189">Other not shown variants of the method are possible, e.g. the variants described below.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0190">Alternatively, the contact surface of the first decoration <b>24</b> is not provided with a heat-adhesive layer, but the surface of the second decoration <b>38</b>, intended to come into contact with the contact surface of the first decoration <b>24</b>, is provided with a heat-adhesive layer.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0191">Alternatively, the contact surface of the first decoration <b>24</b> and the surface of the second decoration <b>38</b>, designed to come into contact with the contact surface of the first decoration <b>24</b>, each have a thermal adhesive layer.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0192">Alternatively, neither the contact surface of the first decoration <b>24</b> nor the surface of the second decoration <b>38</b>, designed to come into contact with the contact surface of the first decoration <b>24</b>, is provided with a thermal adhesive layer.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0193">In an alternative which is not described, the wedge has a blade at the end portion.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0194">In this way, after the part has solidified, the wedge and/or the part is moved, so that the blade cuts the outer portion of the second decoration from the rest of the part.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0195">In one embodiment not shown, the holding device for the second decoration includes a flange suitable for squeezing the second decoration against the wedge and for sliding the second decoration with respect to the molding cavity. In particular, in this way, a bit of the second decoration can enter into the molding cavity during the closing of the mold, more particularly if the second decoration is not very elastic and the part to be produced is very far from having a flat shape.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0196">The present invention further relates to the manufacturing device comprising the mold and wedge, and, where appropriate, the first gripping tool and/or the second gripping tool <b>42</b> and/or the hook <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0197">In the manufacturing, the presence of the second decoration against the first decoration produces a special visual effect, by overlaying materials, in an easy way. The wedge holds the first decoration thus contributing to achieving a satisfactory final appearance, while providing sealing between the first mold part and the second mold part at this level.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
