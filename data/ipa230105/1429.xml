Furthermore, the invention relates to a separating machine for performing a method according to the invention for processing explosive products, according to claim <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is known that explosive products, the flashpoint of which is close to the processing temperature, cannot be readily processed in a separating machine, in particular in a solid bowl screw centrifuge or in a separator, in particular when the processing temperature is only by 15 Kelvin lower than the respective specific flashpoint of the product to be processed. According to technical regulations for operational safety (TRBS)-2152, a threshold with respect to the processing temperature in case of pure, non-halogenated liquids is defined to be 5 K below the flashpoint of the liquid. A threshold with respect to the processing temperature in case of solvent mixtures without a halogenated component is defined to be 15 K below the flashpoint.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Due to the resulting or prevailing temperatures during processing and/or at standstill, the flashpoint within the separating machine, in particular within the solid bowl screw centrifuge or the separator can be exceeded so that a dangerous explosive atmosphere might be formed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to be able to process such products, the explosion protection within separating machines, in particular within solid bowl screw centrifuges or separators has hitherto been ensured by methods of inertization. The formation of an explosive atmosphere within the separating machine is thus avoided.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to be able to perform such an intertization method, an inertization unit is required which monitors and controls an inert gas supply to the separating machine and the maintenance of the necessary pressures within the separating machine. Thus, the inert atmosphere within the separating machine can be guaranteed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such a monitoring places certain requirements on measurement technology. Furthermore, the system periphery of an inertized centrifuge needs to be realized such that the required pressures are maintained and an unintentional escape of gas is avoided.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In summary, the operation of an inertized separating machine is expensive in terms of costs and technology. Moreover, inert gas needs to be provided which in turn involves further dangers such as, for example, people suffocating, and due to that, precautions need to be taken for protecting personnel from this inert gas.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">From the aforementioned, it is therefore a task of the present invention to propose a further developed method for processing explosive products in a separating machine, in particular in a solid bowl screw centrifuge or in a separator, which is not such as complex as hitherto known inertization methods. Overall, a method is intended to be provided which can be easily performed and furthermore can be retrofitted in already existing separating machines, in particular solid bowl screw centrifuges and systems, respectively, or separators.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, it is a task of the invention to propose a separating machine, in particular a solid bowl screw centrifuge or a separator which serves the purpose of performing a method according to the invention for processing explosive products.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The solution of the task of the invention is performed by a method for processing explosive products in a separating machine, according to the teaching of claim <b>1</b>. Furthermore, the solution of the task of the invention is performed by a separating machine for performing a method according to the invention, according to the teaching of claim <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The subclaims represent at least appropriate configurations and further developments of the method according to the invention or of the separating machine according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The method according to the invention for processing explosive products in a separating machine provides for the separating machine to firstly comprise a rotary device located in a drum, wherein the drum itself is located in a machine housing. According to the invention, cooling liquid is directly or indirectly applied, in particular sprayed onto an outer surface of the drum during processing of the products at least onto portions thereof and/or intermittently. Furthermore, the temperature within the machine housing is monitored during processing.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The method according to the invention for processing explosive products in a solid bowl screw centrifuge provides for the solid bowl screw centrifuge to firstly comprises a screw located in a drum, wherein the drum itself is located in a machine housing. According to the invention, cooling liquid is directly or indirectly applied, in particular sprayed onto an outer surface of the drum during processing of the products at least onto portions thereof and/or intermittently. Furthermore, the temperature within the machine housing is monitored during processing.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The method according to the invention for processing explosive products in a separator provides for the separator to firstly comprise a rotary disc stack located in a drum, wherein the drum itself is located in a machine housing. According to the invention, cooling liquid is directly or indirectly applied, in particular sprayed onto an outer surface of the drum during processing of the products at least onto portions thereof and/or intermittently. Furthermore, the temperature within the machine housing is monitored during processing.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It can be recognized that a method according to the invention for processing explosive products in a separating machine is provided which can be likewise applied to solid bowl screw centrifuges and separators.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The outer surface of the drum of a solid bowl screw centrifuge is to be understood to be the surface of the drum which is not formed to be internal, i.e., is not pointing in the direction of the screw. In other words, the outer surface of the drum forms the rotor surface. In solid bowl screw centrifuges, the component group formed of the screw and the drum, is designated to be a rotor.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The outer surface of the drum of a separator is to be understood to be the surface of the drum which is not formed to be internal, i.e., is not pointing in the direction of the disc stack.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Cooling liquid is applied, in particular sprayed onto the outer surface of the drum , at least onto portions thereof during processing of the products.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is further possible for cooling liquid to be applied, in particular sprayed both onto the surface of the drum and the inner surfaces of the machine housing during processing of the products at least onto portions thereof and/or intermittently.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the invention, cooling liquid is predominantly, in particular exclusively applied, in particular sprayed onto the outer surface of the drum of the separating machine. Directly cooling the product to be processed and/or the rotary device, in particular of the screw or the disc stack, is usually not necessary, preferably not necessary at all.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In this case, in particular cooling liquid is applied, in particular sprayed onto the outer surface of the drum and/or the inner surfaces of the machine housing of a solid bowl screw centrifuge at least in portions, which cooling liquid surrounds the upper half of the screw in case of an imaginary division of the screw along the longitudinal axis.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In this case, in particular cooling liquid is applied, in particular sprayed onto the outer surface of the drum and/or the inner surfaces of the machine housing of a separator at least in portions, which cooling liquid concerns the upper portion of the drum housing in case of an imaginary division of the drum housing along a horizontal axis.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a further embodiment of the invention, it is possible for cooling liquid to be applied, in particular sprayed onto the outer surface of the drum over the complete circumference and/or onto the inner surfaces of the machine housing over the complete inner surfaces.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Due to cooling liquid being applied, in particular sprayed onto the outer surface of the drum and simultaneously monitoring the temperature within the machine housing during processing of the product, a method for processing explosive products is provided which can be performed without any inertization process. This concerns in particular the processing of products, the processing temperature of which is relatively slightly below the flashpoint. It is in particular possible for the processing temperature to be lower than the flashpoint by only 5 Kelvin.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Surprisingly, it has been shown that the formation of an explosive atmosphere within the centrifuge can be prevented in that during processing of the explosive product, components getting in contact with the product are directly cooled.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Due to cooling the outer surface of the drum, the formation of an explosive atmosphere is avoided in that the flashpoint is prevented from being exceeded.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In turn, it has been shown that with respect to heating the product to be processed within the drum, the products remaining in the drum are decisive for additional material heating. The large part of the product flow conducted through the separating machine, in particular through the solid bowl screw centrifuge or the separator, receives little temperature due to the relative short dwelling time, when the throughflow is sufficient. Therefore, cooling the outer surfaces of the drum and/or the inner surfaces of the machine housing result/s in a sufficiently low temperature of the product located within the separating machine.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The cooling liquid preferably gets in contact with the product to be processed or the processed product at most to a small extent. The cooling liquid may be selected according to the product to be processed. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the cooling liquid is cooling water.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Spraying the outer surface of the drum may preferably then be taken as a basis when the separating machine has a spraying system with several spraying nozzles as a cooling device.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">An application of cooling liquid may be performed within such cooling devices that have cooling tubes, for example. Such cooling tubes can be installed around the outer surface of the drum.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a further embodiment of the invention, the cooling device may be designed such that an intermediate space is formed in the separating machine. Such an intermediate space is preferably formed between the outer surface of the drum and a housing portion spaced from the outer surface of the drum. Cooling liquid can circulate in this intermediate space. In other words, cooling liquid can flow in a double-walled drum housing. Consequently, it is possible that a direct or indirect application of cooling liquid onto the outer surface of the drum is performed.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a further embodiment of the invention, it is provided for the maximum temperature of the cooling liquid to be regulated. The temperature of the cooling liquid is regulated to a maximum temperature which is slightly below the admissible processing temperature of the product. The cooling liquid preferably is regulated to a maximum temperature of 35&#xb0; C., in particular 30&#xb0; C., in particular 25&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In most cases, this means that in Central Europe's normal environmental temperatures the cooling liquid does not need to be cooled to a large extent. Only in case of higher environmental temperatures, slight cooling of the cooling liquid is necessary.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Due to cooling the cooling liquid, the influence of increased environmental temperatures upon the temperature increase within the separating machine is reduced.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a further embodiment of the invention, it is possible for the maximum temperature of the cooling liquid located in a tank to be regulated. It is possible for the separating machine or the cooling device associated with the separating machine to have a tank, in particular a reservoir tank, wherein the cooling liquid is stored or buffered in this tank.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Regulating the maximum temperature of the cooling liquid located in a tank enables a particularly exact cooling of the outer surface of the drum. Regulating the temperature of the cooling liquid located in the tank is preferably performed on the basis of temperature monitoring of the cooling liquid located in the tank. Due to such a temperature monitoring and a corresponding regulation of the maximum temperature of the cooling liquid in a tank, a sufficient temperature difference can be provided.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In monitoring the cooling liquid located in a tank, it is inter alia taken into account that a corresponding heating of the cooling liquid takes place already due to the circulation of cooling liquid in a cooling device.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A Cooling liquid inflow and/or spraying nozzles is/are activated in temporal intervals, and cooling liquid is distributed, preferably via spraying nozzles, within the machine housing, and preferably in portions on inner sides of the machine housing.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Upon detecting a first temperature threshold value in the machine housing and/or in a liquid phase outflow, the cooling liquid inflow and/or spraying nozzles is/are activated.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Consequently, it is possible that an application, in particular spraying, of the drum at least onto portions thereof during processing of the products, is not performed during the complete processing time. The application, in particular spraying, of the drum, and thus a cooling process may only be started after a first temperature threshold value has been detected, for example. This enables cooling liquid to be saved, since this is only used if it becomes necessary due to detected temperatures.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Moreover, it is possible for such a first temperature threshold value to be specified and/or such a machine adjustment to be made that the cooling liquid being applied, in particular spraying onto the drum is performed during the complete processing time. This is in particular advantageous when the separating machine is used in high environmental temperatures or a particularly explosive product should be processed.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, it is possible for the temperature of a centrate, i.e., the liquid phase separated from the product, generated by the separating machine, in particular by the solid bowl screw centrifuge or the separator, to be monitored. Such a monitoring of the centrate determines temperature increases of the product during processing at an early stage. When an admissible centrate temperature is exceeded, it is possible to stop the supply of products to be processed in the separating machine, in particular the solid bowl screw centrifuge or the separator. In a separator, this may comprise both the heavy liquid phase and the light liquid phase.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Upon detecting a second temperature threshold value, which is higher than the first temperature threshold value, it is possible for a supply of the product to be processed in the separating machine, in particular the solid bowl screw centrifuge or the separator, to be stopped in the machine housing and/or in the liquid phase outflow, and to pump in particular cooled liquid into the drum or into the separating space of the separating machine.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The supply of liquid, in particular cooling liquid, into the drum of a solid bowl screw centrifuge or a separator preferably takes place via the inlet tube through which the product to be processed is usually supplied to the drum. Supplying of liquid preferably is performed for such a long time until the temperature value detected in the machine housing has dropped again below the second temperature threshold value.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Due to stopping the supply of a product to be processed and supplying of liquid, an explosive atmosphere is prevented from being formed. This is due to the fact that no product to be processed and potentially being explosive continues to flow into the drum, and the flashpoint of the product still located in the separating machine is diluted due to the dilution with liquid, in particular cooling liquid.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Upon detecting a third temperature threshold value, which is greater or higher than the second temperature threshold value, the separating machine, in particular the solid bowl screw centrifuge or the separator, preferably is switched off. In other words, the solid bowl screw centrifuge or the separator is shut down with regard to safety, when the third temperature threshold value is reached. Switching on of the solid bowl screw centrifuge or the separator preferably should be enabled only when the temperature(s) detected in the machine housing and/or in the liquid phase outflow has or have dropped below the second temperature threshold value.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">It is furthermore possible for the cooling liquid, when the second temperature threshold value is detected, to be itself cooled in such a manner that the maximum temperature of the cooling liquid has a lower value than it was specified prior to detecting the first temperature threshold value. In other words, a regulation of the cooling liquid temperature may be performed in dependence of the temperature(s) detected in the machine housing. In particular, when a second temperature threshold value and/or a third temperature threshold value are or is detected, a corresponding regulation of the maximum temperature of the cooling liquid can cause the explosive product located in the drum to be correspondingly cooled.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">It is furthermore possible for the detection of a second temperature threshold value to be performed in combination with the detection of a temperature value of the cooling liquid located in a tank. The regulation of the cooling liquid temperature, in particular the regulation of the temperature of the cooling liquid may be performed due to detecting the temperature in the machine housing and/or in the liquid phase outflow as well as by additionally detecting the cooling liquid temperature in the tank.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">It is furthermore possible for the throughput of the product to be processed in the separating machine to be performed in dependence of detected temperature values. It is possible for the product supply to be stopped when the admissible centrate temperature is exceeded so as to prevent the product located in the drum to be further heated. It is furthermore possible for the product temperature itself and/or the throughflow amount to be regulated in dependence of the centrate temperature. When a throughflow amount is too small, the heat input into the product during processing is higher and can result in the second or third temperature threshold value to be exceeded.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the cooling liquid is collected after the application, in particular after the spraying, in the machine housing, and is subsequently used again for application, in particular spraying. A cooling liquid circuit can be formed, which after being applied, in particular sprayed, onto the outer surface of the drum provides for the drained off cooling liquid to be collected and subsequently to be applied, in particular sprayed. It is possible for the cooling liquid to be examined for pollutions prior to the repeated use, so that the cooling liquid can be optionally purified.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">It can be seen that the proposed method according to the invention can be implemented and handled in an extremely simple manner. Inert gases are not needed to be used. Thus, the dangers associated with the use of inert gases are omitted.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It has shown that the method according to the invention can be particularly well used in processing alcoholic products or oil sludge media. The alcoholic products may be inter alia potable alcohol products.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">A further aspect of the invention is related to a separating machine for performing the method according to the invention. The separating machine has a rotary device located in a drum, wherein the drum is located in a machine housing.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to the invention, a cooling device, in particular a spraying system with several spraying nozzles is formed in the machine housing, wherein the cooling device, in particular one of the spraying nozzles, is directed towards the outer surface of the drum or is arranged such that cooling liquid can be directly or indirectly applied onto the outer surface of the drum. In addition, at least one temperature monitoring unit is formed in the machine housing.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">A further aspect of the invention is related in particular to a solid bowl screw centrifuge for performing the method according to the invention. The solid bowl screw centrifuge has a screw located in a drum, wherein the drum is located in a machine housing. According to the invention, a cooling device, in particular a spraying system with several spraying nozzles, is formed in the machine housing, wherein the cooling device, in particular at least one of the spraying nozzles, is directed towards the outer surface of the drum or is arranged such that cooling liquid can be applied directly or indirectly onto the outer surface of the drum. In addition, at least one temperature monitoring unit is formed in the machine housing.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A further aspect of the invention is related in particular to a separator for performing the method according to the invention. The separator has a rotary disc stack located in a drum, wherein the drum is located in a machine housing. According to the invention, a cooling device, in particular a spraying system with several spraying nozzles, is formed in the machine housing, wherein the cooling device, in particular at least one of the spraying nozzles, is directed towards the outer surface of the drum or is arranged such that cooling liquid can be applied directly or indirectly onto the outer surface of the drum.

In such an embodiment of the invention, cooling liquid can directly be applied onto the outer surface of the drum. A kind of double-walled housing is formed into which the cooling medium can be introduced continuously. In other words, it is possible for the drum to have a double-walled drum housing, wherein cooling liquid can flow due to the intermediate space being formed by double walls. The advantage of such an embodiment of the invention is that cooling liquid is extensively applied onto the outer surface of the drum. Furthermore, no targeted arrangement of the cooling device needs to be performed, since cooling liquid can be applied onto almost the complete surface of the drum.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Preferably, the spraying nozzles are formed in an upper side or in a region of an upper side of the machine housing or in the region of a cover surface of the machine housing.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Due to the arrangement of the spraying nozzles, it is moreover possible that cooling liquid, at least in portions, can be sprayed onto the inner side of the machine housing.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Such an arrangement of the spraying nozzles enables cooling liquid to be sprayed in particular onto the outer surface of a solid bowl screw centrifuge which is located in the upper part in an imaginary division of the screw along the longitudinal axis of the screw.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In forming a separator according to the invention, at least one of the spraying nozzles can be arranged in the machine housing such that cooling liquid is sprayed onto the upper portion of the drum housing in an imaginary division of a drum housing along a horizontal axis.

The spraying system <b>50</b> has several spraying nozzles <b>51</b>.
