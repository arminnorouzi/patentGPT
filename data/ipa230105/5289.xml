With the continuous development of smartphones, under-screen fingerprint recognition technology has become one of the research hotspots and development directions in the current smartphone market. At present, the under-screen fingerprint recognition technology can be divided into under-screen capacitive fingerprint identification technology, under-screen ultrasonic fingerprint identification technology and under-screen optical fingerprint identification technology.

Usually, the ultrasonic fingerprint identification structure is a three-layer structure, which includes a driving electrode, a receiving electrode and a piezoelectric layer between the driving electrode and the receiving electrode. In a case that a driving voltage is applied to the driving electrode and the receiving electrode, the piezoelectric layer is excited by the voltage to generate an inverse piezoelectric effect, and a first ultrasonic wave is emitted outward. After the first ultrasonic wave contacts a finger, the first ultrasonic wave is reflected back to generate a second ultrasonic wave by the finger. because the fingerprint includes valleys and ridges, the vibration intensity of the second ultrasonic wave reflected by the fingerprint and back to the piezoelectric layer is different, at this time, a fixed voltage is applied to the driving electrode, the piezoelectric layer can convert the second ultrasonic wave into a voltage signal, the voltage signal is transmitted to the fingerprint identification module through the receiving electrode, positions of the valleys and ridges of the fingerprint are determined according to the voltage signal.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a fingerprint identification structure, a driving method of the fingerprint identification structure, and an electronic device.

The driving method includes the following steps S101-S102.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Step S101: applying a driving voltage to the i-th driving electrode and the i-th auxiliary driving electrode to drive the piezoelectric material layer corresponding to the i-th driving electrode and the i-th auxiliary driving electrode to emit an ultrasonic wave.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Step S102: using the piezoelectric material layer to receive the ultrasonic wave reflected by a fingerprint, and outputting a corresponding fingerprint electrical signal through at least a part of the M receiving electrodes.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the driving method of the fingerprint identification structure, after applying the driving voltage to the i-th driving electrode and the i-th auxiliary driving electrode, the piezoelectric material layer corresponding to the i-th driving electrode and the i-th auxiliary driving electrode will deform due to the inverse piezoelectric effect or drive film layers above and below the piezoelectric material layer to vibrate together, so that the ultrasonic wave can be generated and emitted outward. In this way, compared with the case of driving only by the driving electrodes, the driving method can drive or excite a larger area of the piezoelectric material layer through the i-th driving electrode and the i-th auxiliary driving electrode, so that the ultrasonic emission efficiency of the fingerprint identification structure is improved and the ultrasonic emission efficiency is maximized. Therefore, the electronic device can have high fingerprint recognition performance.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The following points required to be explained:</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">(1) the drawings of the embodiments of the present disclosure only relate to the structures related to the embodiments of the present disclosure, and other structures can refer to the general design.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">(2) without conflict, the embodiments of the present disclosure and the features in the embodiments may be combined with each other to obtain new embodiments.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The above are only the specific embodiments of this disclosure, but the scope of protection of this disclosure is not limited to this.
