For example, in the aerospace and automotive industries, CFRP is particularly attracting attention, from the perspective of energy savings through weight reduction. Of course, CFRP is also attracting attention in fields besides the industries described above. Recently, attention is also directed to cellulose fiber-reinforced plastics.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Additive manufacturing technology (3D printing technology) is a known forming technology. This technology is described as follows in the &#x201c;2013 Patent Application Technical Trend Survey (Summary), 3D Printers&#x201d;. 3D printing technology (additive manufacturing technology) refers to the process of making an article from a numerical representation of its three-dimensional shape, using material deposition. Often, this process is achieved by stacking a layer onto another layer. The representation of a 3D printer is used from a two-dimensional contrast output onto paper. In ASTM F2792-12a (Standard Terminology for Additive Manufacturing Technologies), the term additive manufacturing is used.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thermoplastic resin laminated products made using additive manufacturing technology (3D printing technology) are becoming more and more popular, even for personal use, because this technology can make an object having a desired shape with a great degree of freedom. However, in these products, the resin itself has low mechanical properties. For this reason, products made using additive manufacturing technology have so far been limited to toys and the like.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, a 3D printer for CFRP has been proposed by MarkForged, Inc. As a fiber is added to materials, a previously known concept of free molding has been expanded to free fiber orientation. Therefore, even in the aerospace and automotive industries, efforts are underway to develop CFRP products through additive manufacturing technology. The development of CFRP products through additive manufacturing technologies is even being attempted in the mechanical component industry.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION

performed under a condition of 0.1 MPa or more.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0063">The present invention proposes the method described above, in which the 3D printing step includes, in a case where a fiber-reinforced plastic product is divided into two or more parts, forming parts separately, each of which corresponds to each of the divided parts, and the pressurizing includes combining the parts formed separately into one body and pressurizing the combined body. Depending on a configuration (and/or shape) of the fiber-reinforced plastic product (product A), it may be difficult to form it by a single (one) 3D printing step. For example, a product A may be a combination of parts A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, . . . , and An (where n is an integer of 2 or more). The part Ak (k=1 to n) may be easily formed by a single 3D printing step. Such a case is conceivable of course. For example, the fibers in the part A<b>1</b> are different from the fibers in the part Ak (k=2 to n). Another example is when the resin is changed. Yet another example is when the shape of the product A is too complex to be formed (or difficult to be formed) in a single 3D printing step. In short, the method described above is effective when the finished product is a combination of several parts. That is, the part A<b>1</b> is formed by a 3D printing step A<b>1</b>.

The fiber-reinforced resin article is also referred to as a fiber-reinforced resin (plastic) product. The fiber-reinforced resin article includes at least fibers and a resin. The method includes a 3D printing step. In the 3D printing step, forming is performed by a 3D printer. In the 3D printing step, at least fibers and a resin are used as materials. Examples of the 3D printing step include the following steps: a step in which fibers and a resin are molded by an additive manufacturing device (3D printer) including a nozzle; a step in which fibers and a resin are molded by an additive manufacturing device (3D printer) using the fused deposition molding method; a step in which fibers and a resin are molded using an additive manufacturing technology that does not include a step of coating and printing uncoagulated coagulant on a top surface of a laminate or on a surface of a sheet bonded to the laminate, based on laminate area data in a specified cross-section of a 3D model, does not include a step of laminating a sheet on which the uncoagulated coagulant has been coated and printed and the laminate by overlapping and bonding them under heat retention, or does not include a bonding step in which sheets with a coagulant selectively applied to the surface are laminated and the coagulant selectively bonds the sheets together; and a step in which an additive manufacturing technology excluding the one including a step of laminating and bonding sheets coated with a coagulant is used to form an article using fibers and resins. Of course, the present embodiment is not limited to these examples.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0081">In the 3D printing step, a resin (plastic) and fibers are used. In the step described above, the resin (the resin that serves as a matrix) and fibers may be supplied (discharged) separately from nozzles. These materials may be supplied (discharged) simultaneously. They may be supplied (discharged) with a time delay. A fiber-reinforced plastic material (a material with fibers dispersed in a resin) may be supplied (discharged) from a single nozzle. The step described above resulted in a fiber-reinforced plastic product (3D printed article) with the desired shape. An article having the substantially identical shape to that of the fiber-reinforced plastic product A may be formed in a single (one) 3D printing step. The product A may be a combination of the parts A<b>1</b>, . . . , Ak (where k is an integer of n or less), . . . , and An (where n is an integer of 2 or more). In such a case, the part A<b>1</b> is formed by a single (one) 3D printing step A<b>1</b>. Similarly, the part Ak is formed by a single (one) 3D printing step Ak. The part An is formed by a single (one) 3D printing step An. When the parts A<b>1</b>, . . . , Ak, . . . , An formed by the 3D printing steps A<b>1</b>, . . . , Ak, . . . An are assembled, this assembly has the same shape as the product A. That is, there are a case where only a single (one) 3D printing step is needed, and a case where twice or more (two or more) steps are needed. Selection of the case is determined depending on the configuration of the product A. The product obtained in the 3D printing step may be preformed before the pressurizing step. The preforming produces a product with a shape close to that of the final product. Of course, there may be a case where the preforming is unnecessary. The preforming here refers to the forming of an article performed between the 3D printing step and the pressurizing step. In the product (fiber-reinforced plastic product) obtained in the step described above, the fibers in the product are preferably dispersed in the plastic (matrix resin). Preferably, the 3D printing step was performed in such a manner that the fibers were dispersed in the plastic (resin). The 3D printing step may be performed under a known condition. Alternatively, a special condition may be employed.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0082">The method described above includes a pressurizing step. In the pressurizing step, a 3D printed article is pressurized. The 3D printed article is obtained by the 3D printing step described above. The pressurizing step is performed at a temperature where the resin of the 3D printed article is softened. Heating to the temperature at which the resin is softened is performed, for example, without contact between the 3D printed article and the heating device (heating source) that heats the 3D printed article. The heating time of the heating was preferably 0.1 second or more, even more preferably 1 second or more. The heating time was preferably within 10 minutes, and even more preferably within 5 minutes. The heating is preferably, for example, by induction heating. The heating is preferably, for example, by infrared irradiation. The heating is preferably, for example, by laser irradiation. The heating is preferably, for example, by microwave irradiation. When the 3D printed article was heated by any of the heating methods described above, its mechanical properties such as flexural strength and flexural modulus were better compared to the case where the 3D printed article loaded inside a heated mold was heated. The temperature at which the resin of the 3D printed article is softened was preferably from (a softening temperature of the resin&#x2212;100&#xb0; C.) to (a softening temperature of the resin+300&#xb0; C.), more preferably (a softening temperature of the resin&#x2212;50&#xb0; C.) or higher, even more preferably (a softening temperature of the resin+250&#xb0; C.) or lower, and yet even more preferably a softening temperature of the resin or higher. The temperature was, for example, 90&#xb0; C. or higher. The temperature was, for example, 500&#xb0; C. or lower. Furthermore, the temperature was, for example, 450&#xb0; C. or lower. Furthermore, the temperature was, for example, 400&#xb0; C. or lower. The concept (term) &#x201c;softening temperature&#x201d; may be any concept (term) among the melting point, glass transition point, and softening point. The concept (term) used is selected according to the resin. When the resin has a melting point, the softening temperature is the melting point. When the resin has the melting point, glass transition point, and softening point, the highest temperature among them is preferred to be employed. For example, in a case where the resin has the melting point (Mp) and glass transition point (Tg), and Tg=140&#xb0; C. and Mp=340&#xb0; C., the melting point is the softening temperature. The temperature during the pressurizing is as described above. The 3D printed article may be heated before the 3D printed article is disposed in a pressurizing device (mold). The 3D printed article may be heated after the 3D printed article is disposed in a pressurizing device (mold). The 3D printed article may be heated during the disposition of the 3D printed article in a pressurizing device (mold) (in the course of disposition: the 3D printed article is partially disposed in the mold). Even if the article is heated to a temperature higher than the temperature described above, it is sufficient if the temperature at the time of pressurizing is the approximately same as the temperature described above by natural cooling. The pressurizing device (mold) itself may or may not be heated. In a case where the temperature of the pressurizing device (mold) is low, when the 3D printed article is disposed in the pressurizing device (mold), the temperature of the 3D printed article may be lower than the temperature described above. In view of this, it is preferable that the pressurizing device, especially the mold in which the 3D printed article is disposed, is heated.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0083">The heating described above is preferably performed by the induction heating method. The device used for induction heating was preferably an electromagnetic induction heating device. The device used for induction heating was particularly preferably a high-frequency induction heating device. The frequency used for induction heating was preferably 1 kHz or higher. The frequency used for induction heating was even more preferably 10 kHz or higher. The frequency used for induction heating was preferably 10 MHz or lower. The frequency used for induction heating was even more preferably 400 kHz or lower. The use of an electromagnetic induction heating device (high-frequency induction heating device) exerted the effect on reducing the voids in the 3D printed article after the pressurizing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> are X-ray CT images showing presence of the void in the pressurized molded article when the 3D printed article which has been pre-heated by induction heating is disposed in a mold and pressurized. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref> are X-ray CT images showing presence of the void in the pressurized molded article when the 3D printed article disposed in the mold is heated and pressurized by heating the mold. The comparison between the X-ray CT images in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> and those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref> indicates that when the induction heating method is used for heating, there are fewer voids in the pressurized molded article. This feature would be unpredictable. The 3D printed article (fiber-reinforced resin article) with the fewer voids has the higher the mechanical strength. When the induction heating method is used, the 3D printed article is heated from the inside. This efficiently softens the 3D printed article. The softening proceeds in a short time. For example, the time required for softening was less than &#x2155; of the time required for a method in which the article is heated from the surface, such as the infrared irradiation heating method. When the induction heating method is used, the fibers must be conductive fibers. Examples of the conductive fibers include metal fibers, carbon fibers, or conductive polymers. Of these, carbon fibers were the most preferred. The thickness of the 3D printed article was preferably 0.1 cm or more. The thickness of the 3D printed article was more preferably 0.3 cm or more. In other words, in a case where the induction heating method is used, compared to the case where the infrared heating method is used, temperature irregularities were less likely to occur even if the 3D printed article was thick. Therefore, the induction heating method was suitable for the 3D printed article with a thicker thickness. There is no particular restriction on the upper limit of the thickness. When the 3D printed article was large (flat area was large), heating performance of induction heating failed to be effective. The method was suitable for a small product. Therefore, when the induction heating method was used, a length of one side in the longitudinal direction of the 3D printed article was preferably 20 cm or less, and more preferably 10 cm or less.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0084">The heating described above is preferably performed by the infrared irradiation method. Examples of the infrared rays include short wavelengths, medium wavelengths, near infrared, and far infrared wavelengths. For example, when the 3D printed article was relatively large in area, the use of the infrared irradiation method was preferable to the use of the induction heating method. For example, the 3D printed article had a length of one side in the longitudinal direction of preferably 5 cm or more, and more preferably 10 cm or more.

For example, in this step, the product obtained in the 3D printing step (or the preformed product if there is a preforming step) is disposed in a mold of a predetermined shape (for example, a forming die (mold)) and pressurized. The temperature of the product (3D printed article) during the pressurizing step is as described above. The product may be heated during or before this step. However, heating during pressurizing actually results in significant heat loss. Therefore, the product is preferably heated before pressurizing. The pressurizing step was performed under conditions (pressure) of preferably 0.01 MPa or more. The pressurizing step was performed under conditions (pressure) of more preferably 0.1 MPa or more. The pressurizing step was performed under conditions (pressure) of even more preferably 0.5 MPa or more. The pressurizing step was performed under conditions (pressure) of preferably 100 MPa or less. The pressurizing step was performed under conditions (pressure) of more preferably 70 MPa or less. The pressurizing step was performed under conditions (pressure) of even more preferably 50 MPa or less. When the pressure was too low, the effect of the invention were small. When the pressure was too high, the features did not improve proportionally. When the pressure was too high, the cost was high. As such, the range described above was preferred. The pressurizing time was preferably 0.5 seconds or more. The pressurizing time was more preferably 1 second or more. The upper limit of the pressurizing time is not particularly limited. However, if the pressurizing time is too long, it is not economical.

It was considered that the presence of the voids in the product lead to insufficient degree of improvement in the mechanical strength of the product. However, when the product after the additive manufacturing technology process was pressurized (especially heated and pressurized), the number of the voids decreased (or the voids disappeared), which was thought to improve the mechanical strength of the product.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0108">The resin (plastic) may be any resin (matrix resin) that can be used in the 3D printing step (additive manufacturing technology).
