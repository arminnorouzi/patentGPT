id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the present disclosure provides an embodiment of an electric control box. The electric control box <b>200</b> is suitable for being installed in electrical equipment as an electric control device. For example, the electric control box <b>200</b> may be applied to an air conditioner or other home appliances. The air conditioner may be a window air conditioner <b>100</b> or a split-type air conditioner. For the window air conditioner <b>100</b>, the electric control box <b>200</b> may be installed in the indoor housing of the window air conditioner <b>100</b>, or may be installed in the outdoor housing of the window air conditioner <b>100</b>. For the split-type air conditioner, the electric control box <b>200</b> may be installed in an indoor unit or an outdoor unit. In the following embodiments, the application of the electric control box <b>200</b> to the window air conditioner <b>100</b> is mainly used as an example for introduction.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, the electric control box <b>200</b> includes a box body <b>210</b>. The box body <b>210</b> includes a bottom plate <b>211</b> and a box cover <b>212</b> that covers the bottom plate <b>211</b>. The box cover <b>212</b> includes an outer box cover <b>500</b> and an inner box cover <b>600</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>), and an edge of the inner box cover <b>600</b> is configured with a water blocking member <b>611</b>. The water blocking member <b>611</b> protrudes outward from the edge of the inner box cover <b>600</b> toward an edge of the outer box cover <b>500</b>, and the water blocking member <b>611</b> is configured for blocking water on the outer box cover <b>500</b> from flowing into the inner box cover <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">The electric control box <b>200</b> may be placed vertically; or the electric control box <b>200</b> may also be placed horizontally. For example, the electric control box <b>200</b> is placed vertically. In this case, the box body <b>210</b> of the electric control box <b>200</b> is vertical, and the box cover <b>212</b> of the box body <b>210</b> is opposite to its bottom plate <b>211</b> in the front-rear direction or the left-right direction. Since the box cover <b>212</b> covers the bottom plate <b>211</b>, the water falling on the top of the outer box cover <b>500</b> will be blocked by the water blocking member <b>611</b> on the inner box cover <b>600</b>. Therefore, the water cannot flow to the inner side of the inner box cover <b>600</b>, so the water can only be drained down along the back or side surface of the outer box cover <b>500</b>, and it is difficult to enter the interior of the inner box cover <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">For another example, the electric control box <b>200</b> is placed horizontally, in this case, the box body <b>210</b> of the electric control box <b>200</b> is horizontal, and the box cover <b>212</b> of the box body <b>210</b> is opposite to its bottom plate <b>211</b> in the up-down direction. Since the box cover <b>212</b> covers the bottom plate <b>211</b>, the water falling on the top of the outer box cover <b>500</b> will be blocked by the water blocking member <b>611</b> on the inner box cover <b>600</b> and cannot flow to the inner side of the inner box cover <b>600</b>, instead, can only be dripped down from the outer edge of the water blocking member <b>611</b> and discharged. Since the outer edge of the water blocking member <b>611</b> is far away from the inside of the inner box cover <b>600</b>, the water cannot easily enter the inside of the inner box cover <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">The above two ways of arranging the electric control box <b>200</b> can be reasonably selected according to the position of the electric control box <b>200</b> in the application product, which is not limited herein. In order to avoid redundant description, in the following embodiments, the electric control box <b>200</b> is mainly provided in the vertical direction for introduction and description.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">In technical solutions of the present disclosure, the water blocking member <b>611</b> is provided at the edge of the inner box cover <b>600</b> of the electric control box <b>200</b>, and the water blocking member <b>611</b> protrudes outward from the edge of the inner box cover <b>600</b> toward the edge of the outer box cover <b>500</b>. The water blocking member <b>611</b> is configured for blocking the flow of water on the outer box cover <b>500</b> to the inside of the inner box cover <b>600</b>, thereby improving the waterproof performance of the electric control box <b>200</b> and reducing the occurrence of water from the external environment falling into the electric control box <b>500</b>, and preventing the electric control assemblies inside the electric control box <b>200</b> from being damaged by moisture.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, in an embodiment, for the box body <b>210</b> of the electric control box <b>200</b>, the bottom plate <b>211</b> of the box body <b>210</b> includes an outer bottom plate <b>300</b> and an inner bottom plate <b>400</b>, and the box cover <b>212</b> includes an outer box cover <b>500</b> and an inner box cover <b>600</b>. The outer box cover <b>500</b> is made of metal, and the inner box cover <b>600</b> is made of plastic; and/or, the outer bottom plate <b>300</b> is made of metal, and the inner bottom plate <b>400</b> is made of plastic.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">The box body <b>210</b> of the electric control box <b>200</b> actually has an inner part and an outer part. The inner part is composed of the inner bottom plate <b>400</b> and the inner box cover <b>600</b>. The inner part (i.e., the inner bottom plate <b>400</b> and the inner box cover <b>600</b>) is made of plastic, which is convenient for manufacturing and molding, and has low manufacturing cost. The outer part is composed of the outer bottom plate <b>300</b> and the outer metal box cover <b>212</b>. The outer part is made of metal, which can play the role of fire prevention and rust prevention, so that the electric control box <b>200</b> has high safety performance. The water blocking member <b>611</b> is integrated with the inner box cover <b>600</b>, and additional manufacturing processes can be added, which can improve production efficiency.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, in an embodiment, the water blocking member <b>611</b> can be a water blocking plate, or a water blocking rib, or a water blocking flange, or other structures that can play a role in blocking water. The inner box cover <b>600</b> has an upper cover plate <b>610</b>, and the upper cover plate <b>610</b> corresponds to the top wall of the outer box cover <b>500</b>. The outer side of the upper cover plate <b>610</b> has a flange extending toward the outer side of the outer box cover <b>500</b>, and the flange forms the water blocking member <b>611</b>. Specifically, the side surface of the water blocking member <b>611</b> abuts against the upper edge of the outer box cover <b>500</b>, so that the gap between the outer box cover <b>500</b> and the water blocking member <b>611</b> can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">When the water of the external environment falls on the top of the outer box cover <b>500</b>, this part of the water is not easy to penetrate into the gap between the outer box cover <b>500</b> and the water blocking member <b>611</b>, and can only be drained downward from the side or back of the outer box cover <b>500</b>. Of course, in addition to providing the water blocking member <b>611</b> on the upper cover <b>610</b>, the water blocking member <b>611</b> can also be provided at other edges of the inner box cover <b>600</b> (e.g., left and right side panels). In view of the characteristics of water flowing from top to bottom, it is not easy for water to penetrate into the interior of the inner box cover <b>600</b> from both sides of the outer box cover <b>500</b>, therefore, it is not necessary to provide the water blocking member <b>611</b> on the left and right edges of the inner box cover <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, in an embodiment, the top wall of the outer box cover <b>500</b> is provided with an installation member, and the installation member is provided with an installation hole, and the installation hole is configured for a connection member to pass through to connect and fix the box body <b>210</b> with the external structure. After the connection member passes through the installation hole, the inner end of the connection member is located between the outer box cover <b>500</b> and the inner box cover <b>60</b>. If the connection member and the installation hole are loose, the water falling on the outer box cover <b>500</b> may also fall onto the inner box cover <b>600</b> from the installation hole along the connection member. In view of this, a drainage groove <b>640</b> corresponding to the installation hole is provided at the top of the inner box cover <b>600</b>, and the drainage channel <b>640</b> can receive water falling onto the inner box cover <b>600</b> from the installation hole.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, considering that the outer box cover <b>500</b> and the water blocking member <b>611</b> are not completely sealed, when the amount of water falling on the outer box cover <b>500</b> is large, water may also accumulate between the outer box cover <b>500</b> and the inner box cover <b>600</b> from the gap between the outer box cover <b>500</b> and the water blocking member <b>611</b>, and there is a great installation hidden danger. To avoid this, optionally, the upper cover plate <b>610</b> of the inner box cover <b>600</b> is inclined toward the drainage groove <b>640</b> from the outer side of the inner box cover <b>600</b> to the inner side thereof. That is to say, an included angle &#x3b1; is formed between the upper cover plate <b>610</b> and the horizontal plane (for the included angle &#x3b1;, please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>), such that the water infiltrating from the gap between the outer box cover <b>500</b> and the water blocking member <b>611</b> will flow into the drainage groove <b>640</b> along the inclined direction of the upper cover plate <b>610</b>, then is discharged downward from the drainage groove <b>640</b> through the back surface of the inner box cover <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">In an embodiment, a plurality of support ribs <b>641</b> protrude from the top of the inner box cover <b>600</b>. The plurality of the support ribs <b>641</b> are suitable for supporting the top wall of the outer box cover <b>500</b>, and the drainage groove <b>640</b> is formed between two adjacent ribs. Specifically, the plurality of the support ribs <b>641</b> cooperate to support the top wall of the outer box cover <b>500</b> to prevent the top wall of the outer box cover <b>500</b> from collapsing downward.

Alternatively, the cross section of the annular rib <b>691</b> may be configured in a semicircular shape (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>).

The inner part is composed of an inner plastic bottom plate <b>400</b> and an inner plastic box cover <b>600</b>. The inner part is made of plastic material, which is easy to manufacture and has low manufacturing cost. The outer part is composed of the outer metal bottom plate <b>300</b> and the outer metal box cover <b>500</b>. The outer part is made of sheet metal parts, which can play the role of fire prevention and rust prevention, so that the electric control box <b>200</b> has high safety performance.

In the related art, if the side wall of the main cavity <b>601</b> is not provided with the heat dissipation hole <b>680</b>, then, the heat generated by the electric control box <b>200</b> needs to be transferred to the inner plastic box cover <b>600</b> first, and then transferred to the outer metal box cover <b>500</b> through the inner plastic box cover <b>600</b>, resulting in poor heat dissipation efficiency.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0175">In technical solutions of the present disclosure, a heat dissipation gap is formed between the side wall of the main cavity <b>601</b> and the outer metal box cover <b>500</b>.

The existence of the heat dissipation gap enables air to flow in the heat dissipation gap, thereby accelerating the heat transfer in the main cavity <b>601</b> to the outer metal box cover <b>500</b>, and effectively improving the heat dissipation efficiency.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0176">As shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, in an embodiment, the number of the heat dissipation holes <b>680</b> is multiple. There may be various forms for the arrangement of the plurality of heat dissipation holes <b>680</b>. For example, a plurality of heat dissipation holes <b>680</b> are spaced apart along the front-rear direction; or, a plurality of the heat dissipation holes <b>680</b> are spaced apart along the up-down direction. A plurality of the heat dissipation holes <b>680</b> are spaced apart in the up-down direction. The shape of the heat dissipation hole <b>680</b> is not limited herein. For example, but not limited to, the heat dissipation holes <b>680</b> may be circular holes, square holes, or elongated holes.

This not only prevents water from the external environment from entering the inner plastic box cover <b>220</b> from the heat dissipation holes <b>680</b>, but also prevents the electric control assemblies inside the electric control box <b>200</b> from being exposed outside the box body <b>210</b>, thereby improving the safety performance of the electric control box <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0178">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, however, considering that the moisture in the external environment may penetrate into the interior through the gap at the top of the outer metal bottom plate <b>300</b> and the outer metal box cover <b>500</b>, and then enter the main cavity <b>601</b> from the heat dissipation hole <b>680</b>, causing the electric control board <b>220</b> to be damaged due to moisture. In order to avoid the above-mentioned situation, a water baffle <b>681</b> protrudes laterally on the periphery of the heat dissipation hole <b>680</b>. The water baffle <b>681</b> surrounds the heat dissipation holes <b>680</b> to block the heat dissipation holes <b>680</b>, so as to prevent the water dripping from the top of the inner plastic box cover <b>600</b> from entering the heat dissipation holes <b>680</b>.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0179">Further, the plate surface of the water baffle <b>681</b> is inclined downward from the inner side of the heat dissipation hole <b>680</b> to the outer side thereof.

Therefore, water droplets can be prevented from entering the main cavity <b>601</b> from the heat dissipation holes <b>680</b>, and the occurrence of failure of the electric control board <b>220</b> due to moisture is reduced.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0180">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the surface of the water baffle <b>681</b> slopes downward from the inner side of the heat dissipation hole <b>680</b> to the outer side thereof, so an angle is formed between the surface of the water baffle <b>681</b> and the horizontal plane. Considering that if the angle is large, the water baffle will block the heat dissipation holes, which is not conducive to the heat dissipation of the air dissipation holes. However, if the angle is too small, the effect of the water baffle to guide water downward is not obvious.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0181">In view of this, the angle formed by the plate surface of the water baffle <b>681</b> and the horizontal plane is not less than 15&#xb0; and not more than 50&#xb0;.

By limiting the angle within this range, the water baffle <b>681</b> cannot overly block the heat dissipation holes <b>680</b>, so as to ensure the heat dissipation holes <b>620</b> to quickly dissipate heat. In addition, the water baffle <b>681</b> obtains a better slope, which can well guide water downward and prevent water flow from entering the heat dissipation holes <b>680</b>.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0182">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, since a heat dissipation gap is formed between the side wall of the main cavity <b>601</b> and the outer metal box cover <b>500</b>, when the electric control box <b>200</b> is used for a period of time or when external components are pressed against the outer metal box cover <b>500</b>, the outer metal box cover <b>500</b> may be dented and deformed toward the heat dissipation gap. In view of this, the two ends of the water baffle <b>681</b> are provided with support protrusions <b>682</b> protruding therefrom. The support protrusion <b>682</b> is suitable for abutting against the side wall of the outer metal box cover <b>500</b> to support the side wall of the outer metal box cover <b>500</b>. The side wall of the outer metal box cover <b>500</b> is not easily deformed into the heat dissipation gap, so as to ensure the integrity of the box body <b>210</b> of the electric control box <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0183">Based on any of the above embodiments, the bottom of the inner plastic box cover <b>600</b> is provided with a corner at one end corresponding to the main cavity <b>601</b>, so that a notch for the wire supply to pass through the electric control box <b>200</b> is formed at the corner position. The corner position <b>605</b> between the notch and the side wall of the main cavity <b>601</b> is configured with a water blocking plate <b>604</b>. The water blocking plate <b>604</b> is suitable for blocking the flow of water from the side wall of the main cavity <b>601</b> to the notch.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0184">The top wall or side wall of the notch is provided with a wire outlet hole <b>606</b>.

In this way, the water can be prevented from flowing along the corner position <b>605</b> to the wire outlet hole <b>606</b> on the top wall of the notch, and thus the wire body is damped.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0186">In an embodiment, the outer metal box cover <b>500</b> is configured with a corner cover plate <b>590</b> corresponding to the corner position <b>605</b>.
