The illustrative system <b>100</b> includes a smart communication manager <b>102</b>, one or more access control devices <b>104</b>, one or more smart antennas <b>106</b>, one or more third party systems <b>108</b>, and IoT services <b>110</b>. It should be appreciated that the system <b>100</b> is depicted as a high level architecture/system and, therefore, one or more of the devices/components of the system <b>100</b> may be form a portion of other devices/components, be embodied as hardware/firmware/software, and/or be otherwise embodied. It should be further appreciated that, in some embodiments, the system <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the system <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the system <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, and/or the system <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may be embodied as an implementation of the high level system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Further, in some embodiments, one or more of features of the system <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the system <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the system <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, and/or the system <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may be incorporated into the same embodiment.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As described in greater detail below, the system <b>100</b> allows for the integration of access control communication and control logic into network gears (e.g., access points, network switches, routers, firewalls, hubs, PoE switches, and/or other devices for networking or interconnectivity) and/or other devices via the smart communication manager <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the logic of the smart communication manager <b>102</b> may leverage existing hardware capabilities such as wireless communications to communicate with wireless locks and/or Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) locks.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">It should be appreciated that the system <b>100</b> significantly lowers the costs to implement real-time connected access control and provides a single interface (e.g., via the smart communication manager <b>102</b> and/or APIs thereof) for all devices regardless of the technology used in the device. Accordingly, access control partners and/or other integration partners are able to integrate a single time for all device types, rather than integrating separately for each different device type, while also providing for consistent user experiences and enforcing similar (or the same) capabilities for all integrations with that partner.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some implementations, the techniques described herein involve providing logic (e.g., as object code or an application) to be integrated into existing devices capable of communicating with one or more series/type of access control device (e.g., the access control devices <b>104</b>). For example, in a multi-family access control system implementation, the logic (e.g., for the smart communication manager <b>102</b>) may execute on existing smart apartment hubs (e.g., the smart hub/router <b>302</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) to handle communications with the respective access control devices (e.g., the access control devices <b>308</b>). In another embodiment, the logic may be incorporated into and execute on an existing network gear (e.g., the network switch <b>402</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and/or the PoE switch <b>502</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) to provide communications over existing IT network infrastructure rather than using a traditional approach of installing a redundant network dedicated to access control.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It should be appreciated that the smart communication manager <b>102</b>, the access control device(s) <b>104</b>, the smart antenna(s) <b>106</b>, the third party system(s) <b>108</b>, and/or the IoT services <b>110</b> may be embodied as, or form a portion of, any type of device/system or collection of devices/systems suitable for performing the functions described herein. More specifically, in the illustrative embodiment, the smart communication manager <b>102</b> provides a simple interface through which third party systems <b>108</b> (e.g., integration partner applications) can communicate with the access control devices <b>104</b> (e.g., of various types/series with different communication protocols). Accordingly, the smart communication manager <b>102</b> may receive data and/or commands received from the third party system <b>108</b> and/or another external system (e.g., via an API) directed to a particular access control device <b>104</b>, and the smart communication manager <b>102</b> may translate that data/command to the device-specific protocol associated with the corresponding access control device <b>104</b> and provide the appropriate payload corresponding with the data/command and protocol for receipt by the access control device <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the smart communication manager <b>102</b> may transmit that payload to a device (e.g., access point, smart antenna <b>106</b>, and/or other device) equipped with the relevant communication circuitry (e.g., 900 MHz wireless antenna and chipset, BLE chipset and antenna, etc.) and/or other technologies needed to communicate with the access control device <b>104</b> via the device-specific protocol. Accordingly, the smart communication manager <b>102</b> may manage multiple, simultaneous partner connections including connections with the third party systems <b>108</b> and/or one or more Internet of Things (IoT) services <b>110</b>. Depending on the context and the particular embodiment, the smart communication manager <b>102</b> may be embodied as and described herein as one or more of a software development kit (SDK), software library, logic bundle, firmware, and/or a dedicated device/component.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the illustrative embodiment, each of the one or more access control devices <b>104</b> may be embodied as any type of device capable of controlling access through a passageway. For example, in some embodiments, the access control device <b>104</b> may be embodied as an electronic lock (e.g., a mortise lock, a cylindrical lock, or a tubular lock), gate opener, exit device, auto-operator, garage door opener, or a peripheral controller of a passageway.
