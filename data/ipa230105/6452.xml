In the electrically powered vehicle, when the power of the battery, which is a power source, is exhausted, it is necessary to charge the battery.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The battery has an upper limit power of a power to be output or a power to be input. The upper limit power varies depending on an environment, and when the battery is used in excess of the upper limit power, deterioration of the battery is accelerated.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some electrically powered vehicles use a detachable battery that is detachable. Therefore, development of a battery sharing service in which a plurality of users who use an apparatus to which a battery can be mounted share a detachable battery has been studied. The battery sharing service is preferably applicable not only to electrically powered vehicles of the same type but also to other electrically powered vehicles (for example, a motorcycle, a four-wheeled vehicle, a lawn mower) and other apparatuses (for example, a floodlight), but even with the detachable battery, it is necessary to appropriately understand an upper limit power on an apparatus side.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Literature 1 describes an electrically assisted bicycle capable of finely controlling a traveling control of a vehicle by communicating information between a battery-side controller and a vehicle-side controller. Specifically, Patent Literature 1 discloses that a battery management controller constantly monitors a state of a battery, and performs a type determination of the battery, a battery remaining capacity calculation process, a maximum discharge current value calculation process for battery protection, a discharge stop determination, a discharge prohibition determination, a diagnosis information process for failure diagnosis, and other various calculation processes. Further, Patent Literature 1 discloses that a vehicle controller performs a battery map determination process, a current command calculation process, a battery current control process, a discharge stop process, a battery capacity calculation process, a diagnosis information process, and other various calculation processes based on various information from the battery management controller.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Literature 2 describes a vehicle equipped with a battery that is not a detachable battery, in which a battery ECU provided in the vehicle calculates an output upper limit value of a normal battery and bypasses an abnormal battery.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Literature 1: JP-A-2001-122180</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent Literature 2: JP-A-2010-273417</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, in the electrically assisted bicycle of Patent Literature 1, it is necessary to perform recalculation with the vehicle controller in order to acquire an upper limit power. The electrically powered vehicle of Patent Literature 2 is not originally equipped with a detachable battery, but even if a detachable battery can be equipped, the battery ECU of the electrically powered vehicle calculates an output upper limit value.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this way, when an upper limit power is calculated on an apparatus side to which a power storage device is equipped, there is no problem in using only a power storage device having a fixed specification, but when a power storage device having an unclear performance is used or when a power storage device having a different performance every time the power storage device is mounted is used, it is assumed that a power storage device is used in excess of an upper limit power of the power storage device, and deterioration of the power storage device is accelerated.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is to provide a power storage device, a vehicle, a power storage device control method,
