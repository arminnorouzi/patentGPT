The cap handle engaging section <b>13</b> is perimetrically connected around the annular wall <b>10</b> as the cap handle engaging section <b>13</b> is oriented downward from the annular wall <b>10</b>. The bottle engaging section <b>15</b> is perimetrically connected around the cap handle engaging section <b>13</b>, wherein the cap handle engaging section <b>13</b> functions as the interconnecting body between the annular wall <b>10</b> and the bottle engaging section <b>15</b>. Furthermore, the bottle engaging section <b>15</b> is externally offset from the cap handle engaging section <b>13</b>. In other words, the outer diameter of the bottle engaging section <b>15</b> is larger than the outer diameter of cap handle engaging section <b>13</b> so that the lateral wall <b>12</b> can hermetically seals the opening <b>11</b> of the water bottle. More specifically, the bottle engaging section <b>15</b> is integrated with at least one inner bottle thread that engages with an existing thread of the water bottle. Due to the offsetting feature of the bottle engaging section <b>15</b> and the cap handle engaging section <b>13</b>, the cap handle engaging section <b>13</b> is then able to press upon a rim of the water bottle to delineate a hermetic connection. The cap handle engaging section <b>13</b> is integrated with at least one outer cap thread so that the cap handle <b>1</b> can be threadedly attached to the cap base <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention can further comprise a rim gasket <b>17</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. More specifically, the rim gasket <b>17</b> is connected into the cap handle engaging section <b>13</b> through a bottom surface <b>14</b> of the cap handle engaging section <b>13</b>. As a result, the rim gasket <b>17</b> is oriented toward the bottle engaging section <b>15</b> and radially positioned atop the rim of the water bottle when the cap base <b>6</b> is threadedly attached around the water bottle. The rim gasket <b>17</b> is able to create a hermetic seal so that the stored beverage does not leak through the lateral wall <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The cap handle <b>1</b> encloses the flange <b>7</b> and the annular wall <b>10</b> while allowing the user to comfortably carry the attached water bottle. In reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, the cap handle <b>1</b> that threadedly engaged around the lateral wall <b>12</b> comprises a handle body <b>2</b>, an annular panel <b>3</b>, a lateral panel <b>4</b>, and an inner gasket <b>5</b>. The lateral panel <b>4</b> is perimetrically connected around the annular panel <b>3</b> so that the flange <b>7</b> and the annular wall <b>10</b> can be enclosed. The lateral panel <b>4</b> is integrated with at least one inner cap thread so that the lateral wall <b>12</b> can engage with the at least one outer cap thread through the at least one inner cap thread. The handle body <b>2</b> is externally connected to the annular panel <b>3</b> thus allowing a surface area to grasp the present invention. Preferably, the handle body <b>2</b> is shaped into a wide upside-down U-shape body so that the user can put their fingers around the handle body <b>2</b> to grip the cap handle <b>1</b>. The inner handle surface is created with a soft plastic material to ensure the cap handle <b>1</b> can be held and carried comfortably.
