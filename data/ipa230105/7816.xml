More specifically, the present invention relates to an electromagnetic wave shielding film used for a printed wiring board.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Printed wiring boards are widely used in electronic devices such as mobile phones, video cameras, and notebook computers to incorporate circuits into the mechanisms. It is also used for connecting a movable unit such as a printer head and a control unit. In these electronic devices, electromagnetic wave shielding measures are indispensable, and shield printed wiring boards to which an electromagnetic wave shielding measure is applied are also used in the printed wiring boards used in the devices.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For the shield printed wiring board, an electromagnetic wave shielding film (hereinafter, may be simply referred to as &#x201c;shielding film&#x201d;) is used. For example, a shielding film used by being bonded to a printed wiring board includes a shielding layer such as a metal layer and a conductive adhesive sheet provided on a surface of the shielding layer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As the shielding film having a conductive adhesive sheet, for example, those disclosed in Patent Literatures 1 and 2 are known. The shielding films are used in such a manner that a surface on which the conductive adhesive sheet is exposed is laminated to a surface of a printed wiring board, specifically, a surface of a coverlay provided on the surface of the printed wiring board. These conductive adhesive sheets are usually adhered and laminated to a printed wiring board by thermocompression bonding under high temperature and high pressure conditions. The shielding film disposed on the printed wiring board as such exhibits a performance (shielding performance) of shielding electromagnetic waves from the outside of the printed wiring board.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2015-110769</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0006">Patent Literature 2: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2012-28334</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0007">Shielding films have been recently required in some cases to have a performance that facilitates alignment when laminated to a printed wiring board. The shielding films thus tend to be required to have transparency. A method conceivable to improve the transparency is thinning of the metal layer in the shielding film. This method improves the transparency; however, a problem is that in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment or an environment in which an electrolyte is present, the transparent metal layer deteriorates and becomes cloudy and the transparency is deteriorated, and that the shielding performance decreases, that is, the environmental resistance is inferior.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0008">Further, a shielding film having a conductive adhesive layer capable of adhering to a printed wiring board under relatively mild conditions, not under high temperature and high pressure conditions, is likely to be required in recent years. However, in a case where a conventional anisotropic conductive pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet is used as the conductive adhesive layer in the shielding film, there is a problem in that the electrical connection with the external ground is unstable. In order to improve the stability of the electrical connection, a method of increasing the amount of the conductive particles contained in the conventional anisotropic conductive pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet may be considered. In this case, the connection stability can be improved, but the decrease in environmental resistance due to the thinning of the metal layer cannot be compensated for, and the transparency decreases.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide an electromagnetic wave shielding film capable of easily adhering to an object, excellent in electrical connection stability, and excellent in transparency, shielding performance, and environmental resistance.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0010">As a result of intensive studies to achieve the above object, the present inventors have found that an electromagnetic wave shielding film using a specific conductive adhesive layer and having a specific layer structure is capable of easily adhering to an object, excellent in electrical connection stability, and excellent in transparency, shielding performance, and environmental resistance.

When the thickness is 1 &#x3bc;m or more, it is possible to more sufficiently support the shielding film and protect the transparent metal layer.

has been confirmed that the shielding film of the present invention has high total light transmittance and excellent transparency, has low connection resistance value and excellent shielding performance, and has good salt water resistance and excellent environmental resistance. On the other hand, in a case where the adhesive layer did not contain conductive particles, the connection resistance value was high and the shielding property was inferior (Comparative Example 1). Further, in a case where the content ratio of the conductive particles was excessive, the connection resistance value was high and the shielding property was inferior (Comparative Example 2). In a case where the thickness of the second insulating layer was thin, the salt water resistance was poor and the environmental resistance was inferior (Comparative Example 3). In a case where the thickness of the second insulating layer was thick (Comparative Example 4) and in a case where the median size of the conductive particles was small (Comparative Example 5), the connection resistance value was high and the shielding property was inferior. In a case where the median size of the conductive particles was large (Comparative Example 6) and in a case where the shape of the conductive particles was dendritic (Comparative Example 7), the total light transmittance was low and the transparency was low.</p><heading id="h-0028" level="1">REFERENCE SIGNS LIST</heading><p id="p-0111" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0110"><b>1</b> to <b>4</b> Shielding film</li>    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0111"><b>11</b> First insulating layer</li>    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0112"><b>12</b> Transparent metal layer</li>    <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0113"><b>13</b> Second insulating layer</li>    <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0114"><b>13</b><i>a </i>Inorganic substance layer</li>    <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0115"><b>13</b><i>b </i>Resin layer</li>    <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0116"><b>14</b> Conductive adhesive layer</li>    <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0117"><b>15</b> Third insulating layer</li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
