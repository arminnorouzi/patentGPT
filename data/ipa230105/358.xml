More particularly, the present invention relates to systems for controlling and navigating devices used to directly visualize and/or manipulate tissue regions within a body lumen while also detecting any electrophysiological activity of the visualized tissue regions.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional devices for visualizing interior regions of a body lumen are known. For example, ultrasound devices have been used to produce images from within a body in vivo. Ultrasound has been used both with and without contrast agents, which typically enhance ultrasound-derived images.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Other conventional methods have utilized catheters or probes having position sensors deployed within the body lumen, such as the interior of a cardiac chamber. These types of positional sensors are typically used to determine the movement of a cardiac tissue surface or the electrical activity within the cardiac tissue. When a sufficient number of points have been sampled by the sensors, a &#x201c;map&#x201d; of the cardiac tissue may be generated.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another conventional device utilizes an inflatable balloon which is typically introduced intravascularly in a deflated state and then inflated against the tissue region to be examined. Imaging is typically accomplished by an optical fiber or other apparatus such as electronic chips for viewing the tissue through the membrane(s) of the inflated balloon. Moreover, the balloon must generally be inflated for imaging. Other conventional balloons utilize a cavity or depression formed at a distal end of the inflated balloon. This cavity or depression is pressed against the tissue to be examined and is flushed with a clear fluid to provide a clear pathway through the blood.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, such imaging balloons have many inherent disadvantages. For instance, such balloons generally require that the balloon be inflated to a relatively large size which may undesirably displace surrounding tissue and interfere with fine positioning of the imaging system against the tissue. Moreover, the working area created by such inflatable balloons are generally cramped and limited in size. Furthermore, inflated balloons may be susceptible to pressure changes in the surrounding fluid. For example, if the environment surrounding the inflated balloon undergoes pressure changes, e.g., during systolic and diastolic pressure cycles in a beating heart, the constant pressure change may affect the inflated balloon volume and its positioning to produce unsteady or undesirable conditions for optimal tissue imaging.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, these types of imaging modalities are generally unable to provide desirable images useful for sufficient diagnosis and therapy of the endoluminal structure, due in part to factors such as dynamic forces generated by the natural movement of the heart. Moreover, anatomic structures within the body can occlude or obstruct the image acquisition process. Also, the presence and movement of opaque bodily fluids such as blood generally make in vivo imaging of tissue regions within the heart difficult.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other external imaging modalities are also conventionally utilized. For example, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are typical modalities which are widely used to obtain images of body lumens such as the interior chambers of the heart. However, such imaging modalities fail to provide real-time imaging for intra-operative therapeutic procedures. Fluoroscopic imaging, for instance, is widely used to identify anatomic landmarks within the heart and other regions of the body. However, fluoroscopy fails to provide an accurate image of the tissue quality or surface and also fails to provide for instrumentation for performing tissue manipulation or other therapeutic procedures upon the visualized tissue regions. In addition, fluoroscopy provides a shadow of the intervening tissue onto a plate or sensor when it may be desirable to view the intraluminal surface of the tissue to diagnose pathologies or to perform some form of therapy on it.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, a tissue imaging system which is able to provide real-time in vivo images of tissue regions within body lumens such as the heart through opaque media such as blood and which also provide instruments for therapeutic procedures upon the visualized tissue are desirable.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A tissue imaging and manipulation apparatus that may be utilized for procedures within a body lumen, such as the heart, in which visualization of the surrounding tissue is made difficult, if not impossible, by medium contained within the lumen such as blood, is described below. Generally, such a tissue imaging and manipulation apparatus comprises an optional delivery catheter or sheath through which a deployment catheter and imaging hood may be advanced for placement against or adjacent to the tissue to be imaged.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The deployment catheter may define a fluid delivery lumen therethrough as well as an imaging lumen within which an optical imaging fiber or assembly may be disposed for imaging tissue. When deployed, the imaging hood may be expanded into any number of shapes, e.g., cylindrical, conical as shown, semi-spherical, etc., provided that, an open area or field is defined by the imaging hood. The open area is the area within which the tissue region of interest may be imaged. The imaging hood may also define an atraumatic contact lip or edge for placement or abutment against the tissue region of interest. Moreover, the distal end of the deployment catheter or separate manipulatable catheters may be articulated through various controlling mechanisms such as push-pull wires manually or via computer control.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The deployment catheter may also be stabilized relative to the tissue surface through various methods. For instance, inflatable stabilizing balloons positioned along a length of the catheter may be utilized, or tissue engagement anchors may be passed through or along the deployment catheter for temporary engagement of the underlying tissue.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In operation, after the imaging hood has been deployed, fluid maybe pumped at a positive pressure through the fluid delivery lumen until the fluid fills the open area completely and displaces any blood from within the open area. The fluid may comprise any biocompatible fluid, e.g., saline, water, plasma, Fluorinert&#x2122;, etc., which is sufficiently transparent to allow for relatively undistorted visualization through the fluid. The fluid may be pumped continuously or intermittently to allow for image capture by an optional processor which may be in communication with the assembly.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an exemplary variation for imaging tissue surfaces within a heart chamber containing blood, the tissue imaging and treatment system may generally comprise a catheter body having a lumen defined therethrough, a visualization element disposed adjacent the catheter body, the visualization element having a field of view, a transparent fluid source in fluid communication with the lumen, and a hairier or membrane extendable from the catheter body to localize, between the visualization element and the field of view, displacement of blood by transparent fluid that flows from the lumen, and a piercing instrument translatable through the displaced blood for piercing into the tissue surface within the field of view.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The imaging hood may be formed into any number of configurations and the imaging assembly may also be utilized with any number of therapeutic tools which may be deployed through the deployment catheter.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">More particularly in certain variations, the tissue visualization system may comprise components including the imaging hood, where the hood may further include a membrane having a main aperture and additional optional openings disposed over the distal end of the hood. An introducer sheath or the deployment catheter upon which the imaging hood is disposed may further comprise a steerable segment made of multiple adjacent links which are pivotally connected to one another and which may be articulated within a single plane or multiple planes. The deployment catheter itself may be comprised of a multiple lumen extrusion, such as a four-lumen catheter extrusion, which is reinforced with braided stainless steel fibers to provide structural support. The proximal end of the catheter may be coupled to a handle for manipulation and articulation of the system.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The apparatus and methods described herein are systems utilized with tissue visualization catheters, as described in U.S. Pat. App. 20061/0184048 A1 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The systems described are also applicable to provide electrophysiological mapping of the heart chambers. Additionally and/or alternatively, the hood assembly may be variously configured to provide other capabilities as well. For instance, the hood may be configured to interact with a magnetic field imparted to the patient body to provide information on a position and/or orientation of the hood within the patient body and for detecting electrophysiological mapping of the visualized tissue as well. Thus, direct visualization of an underlying tissue region and measurement of the electrophysiological activity of the visualized tissue may be accomplished.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A number of sensor coils may be positioned over the hood or along various sections of the deployment catheter and/or sheath. Additionally, various implementations and maps of the detected electrophysiological activity may be utilized in combination with the visualized images to provide the user with direct visualization of the tissue and the corresponding electrical activity in the tissue with respect to the position and/or orientation of the hood.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0093" num="0092">A tissue-imaging and manipulation apparatus described below is able to provide real-time images in vivo of tissue regions within a body lumen such as a heart, which is filled with blood flowing dynamically therethrough and is also able to provide intravascular tools and instruments for performing various procedures upon the imaged tissue regions. Such an apparatus may be utilized for many procedures, e.g., facilitating transseptal access to the left atrium, cannulating the coronary sinus, diagnosis of valve regurgitation/stenosis, valvuloplasty, atrial appendage closure, arrhythmogenic focus ablation, among other procedures.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">One variation of a tissue access and imaging apparatus is shown in the detail perspective views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>1</b>C</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, tissue imaging and manipulation assembly <b>10</b> may be delivered intravascularly through the patient's body in a low-profile configuration via a delivery catheter or sheath <b>14</b>. In the case of treating tissue, such as the mitral valve located at the outflow tract of the left atrium of the heart, it is generally desirable to enter or access the left atrium while minimizing trauma to the patient. To non-operatively effect such access, one conventional approach involves puncturing the intra-atrial septum from the right atrial chamber to the left atrial chamber in a procedure commonly called a transseptal procedure or septostomy. For procedures such as percutaneous valve repair and replacement, transseptal access to the left atrial chamber of the heart may allow for larger devices to be introduced into the venous system than can generally be introduced percutaneously into the arterial system.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">When the imaging and manipulation assembly <b>10</b> is ready to be utilized for imaging tissue, imaging hood <b>12</b> may be advanced relative to catheter <b>14</b> and deployed from a distal opening of catheter <b>14</b>, as shown by the arrow. Upon deployment, imaging hood <b>12</b> may be unconstrained to expand or open into a deployed imaging configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. Imaging hood <b>12</b> may be fabricated from a variety of pliable or conformable biocompatible material including but not limited to, e.g., polymeric, plastic, or woven materials. One example of a woven material is Kevlar&#xae; (E. I. du Pont de Nemours, Wilmington, Del.), which is an aramid and which can be made into thin, e.g., less than 0.001 in., materials which maintain enough integrity for such applications described herein. Moreover, the imaging hood <b>12</b> may be fabricated from a translucent or opaque material and in a variety of different colors to optimize or attenuate any reflected lighting from surrounding fluids or structures, i.e., anatomical or mechanical structures or instruments. In either case, imaging hood <b>12</b> may be fabricated into a uniform structure or a scaffold-supported structure, in which case a scaffold made of a shape memory alloy, such as Nitinol, or a spring steel, or plastic, etc., may be fabricated and covered with the polymeric, plastic, or woven material. Hence, imaging hood <b>12</b> may comprise any of a wide variety of barriers or membrane structures, as may generally be used to localize displacement of blood or the like from a selected volume of a body lumen or heart chamber. In exemplary embodiments, a volume within an inner surface <b>13</b> of imaging hood <b>12</b> will be significantly less than a volume of the hood <b>12</b> between inner surface <b>13</b> and outer surface <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Imaging hood <b>12</b> may be attached at interface <b>24</b> to a deployment catheter <b>16</b> which may be translated independently of deployment catheter or sheath <b>14</b>. Attachment of interface <b>24</b> may be accomplished through any number of conventional methods. Deployment catheter <b>16</b> may define a fluid delivery lumen <b>18</b> as well as an imaging lumen <b>20</b> within which an optical imaging fiber or assembly may be disposed for imaging tissue. When deployed, imaging hood <b>12</b> may expand into any number of shapes, e.g., cylindrical, conical as shown, semi-spherical, etc., provided that an open area or field <b>26</b> is defined by imaging hood <b>12</b>. The open area <b>26</b> is the area within which the tissue region of interest may be imaged. Imaging hood <b>12</b> may also define an atraumatic contact lip or edge <b>22</b> for placement or abutment against the tissue region of interest. Moreover, the diameter of imaging hood <b>12</b> at its maximum fully deployed diameter, e.g., at contact lip or edge <b>22</b>, is typically greater relative to a diameter of the deployment catheter <b>16</b> (although a diameter of contact lip or edge <b>22</b> may be made to have a smaller or equal diameter of deployment catheter <b>16</b>). For instance, the contact edge diameter may range anywhere from 1 to 5 times (or even greater, as practicable) a diameter of deployment catheter <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> shows an end view of the imaging hood <b>12</b> in its deployed configuration. Also shown are the contact lip or edge <b>22</b> and fluid delivery lumen <b>18</b> and imaging lumen <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The imaging and manipulation assembly <b>10</b> may additionally define a guidewire lumen therethrough, e.g., a concentric or eccentric lumen, as shown in the side and end views, respectively, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>D to <b>1</b>F</figref>. The deployment catheter <b>16</b> may define guidewire lumen <b>19</b> for facilitating the passage of the system over or along a guidewire <b>17</b>, which may be advanced intravascularly within a body lumen. The deployment catheter <b>16</b> may then be advanced over the guidewire <b>17</b>, as generally known in the art.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">During operation, after imaging hood <b>12</b> has been deployed, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, and desirably positioned against the tissue region to be imaged along contact edge <b>22</b>, the displacing fluid may be pumped at positive pressure through fluid delivery lumen <b>18</b> until the fluid fills open area <b>26</b> completely and displaces any fluid <b>28</b> from within open area <b>26</b>. The displacing fluid flow may be laminarized to improve its clearing effect and to help prevent blood from re-entering the imaging hood <b>12</b>. Alternatively, fluid flow may be started before the deployment takes place. The displacing fluid, also described herein as imaging fluid, may comprise any biocompatible fluid, e.g., saline, water, plasma, etc., which is sufficiently transparent to allow for relatively undistorted visualization through the fluid. Alternatively or additionally, any number of therapeutic drugs may be suspended within the fluid or may comprise the fluid itself which is pumped into open area <b>26</b> and which is subsequently passed into and through the heart and the patient body.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">As seen in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, deployment catheter <b>16</b> may be manipulated to position deployed imaging hood <b>12</b> against or near the underlying tissue region of interest to be imaged, in this example a portion of annulus A of mitral valve MV within the left atrial chamber. As the surrounding blood <b>30</b> flows around imaging hood <b>12</b> and within open area <b>26</b> defined within imaging hood <b>12</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the underlying annulus A is obstructed by the opaque blood <b>30</b> and is difficult to view through the imaging lumen <b>20</b>. The translucent fluid <b>28</b>, such as saline, may then be pumped through fluid delivery lumen <b>18</b>, intermittently or continuously, until the blood <b>30</b> is at least partially, and preferably completely, displaced from within open area <b>26</b> by fluid <b>28</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Although contact edge <b>22</b> need not directly contact the underlying tissue, it is at least preferably brought into close proximity to the tissue such that the flow of clear fluid <b>28</b> from open area <b>26</b> may be maintained to inhibit significant backflow of blood <b>30</b> back into open area <b>26</b>. Contact edge <b>22</b> may also be made of a soft elastomeric material such as certain soft grades of silicone or polyurethane, as typically known, to help contact edge <b>22</b> conform to an uneven or rough underlying anatomical tissue surface. Once the blood <b>30</b> has been displaced from imaging hood <b>12</b>, an image may then be viewed of the underlying tissue through the clear fluid <b>30</b>. This image may then be recorded or available for real-time viewing for performing a therapeutic procedure. The positive flow of fluid <b>28</b> may be maintained continuously to provide for dear viewing of the underlying tissue. Alternatively, the fluid <b>28</b> maybe pumped temporarily or sporadically only until a clear view of the tissue is available to be imaged and recorded, at which point the fluid flow <b>28</b> may cease and blood <b>30</b> may be allowed to seep or flow back into imaging hood <b>12</b>. This process may be repeated a number of times at the same tissue region or at multiple tissue regions.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In desirably positioning the assembly at various regions within the patient body, a number of articulation and manipulation controls may be utilized. For example, as shown in the articulatable imaging assembly <b>40</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, one or more push-pull wires <b>42</b> may be routed through deployment catheter <b>16</b> for steering the distal end portion of the device in various directions <b>46</b> to desirably position the imaging hood <b>12</b> adjacent to a region of tissue to be visualized. Depending upon the positioning and the number of push-pull wires <b>42</b> utilized, deployment catheter <b>16</b> and imaging hood <b>12</b> may be articulated into any number of configurations <b>44</b>. The push-pull wire or wires <b>42</b> may be articulated via their proximal ends from outside the patient body manually utilizing one or more controls. Alternatively, deployment catheter <b>16</b> may be articulated by computer control, as further described below.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Additionally or alternatively, an articulatable delivery catheter <b>48</b>, which may be articulated via one or more push-pull wires and having an imaging lumen and one or more working lumens, may be delivered through the deployment catheter <b>16</b> and into imaging hood <b>12</b>. With a distal portion of articulatable delivery catheter <b>48</b> within imaging hood <b>12</b>, the clear displacing fluid may be pumped through delivery catheter <b>48</b> or deployment catheter <b>16</b> to clear the field within imaging hood <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the articulatable delivery catheter <b>48</b> may be articulated within the imaging hood to obtain a better image of tissue adjacent to the imaging hood <b>12</b>. Moreover, articulatable delivery catheter <b>48</b> may be articulated to direct an instrument or tool passed through the catheter <b>48</b>, as described in detail below, to specific areas of tissue imaged through imaging hood <b>12</b> without having to reposition deployment catheter <b>16</b> and re-clear the imaging field within hood <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Alternatively, rather than passing an articulatable delivery catheter <b>48</b> through the deployment catheter <b>16</b>, a distal portion of the deployment catheter <b>16</b> itself may comprise a distal end <b>49</b> which is articulatable within imaging hood <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>. Directed imaging, instrument delivery, etc., may be accomplished directly through one or more lumens within deployment catheter <b>16</b> to specific regions of the underlying tissue imaged within imaging hood <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Visualization within the imaging hood <b>12</b> may be accomplished through an imaging lumen <b>20</b> defined through deployment catheter <b>16</b>, as described above. In such a configuration, visualization is available in a straight-line manner, i.e., images are generated from the field distally along a longitudinal axis defined by the deployment catheter <b>16</b>. Alternatively or additionally, an articulatable imaging assembly having a pivotable support member <b>50</b> may be connected to, mounted to, or otherwise passed through deployment catheter <b>16</b> to provide for visualization off-axis relative to the longitudinal axis defined by deployment catheter <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. Support member <b>50</b> may have an imaging element <b>52</b>, e.g., a CCD or CMOS imager or optical fiber, attached at its distal end with its proximal end connected to deployment catheter <b>16</b> via a pivoting connection <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">If one or more optical fibers are utilized for imaging, the optical fibers <b>58</b> may be passed through deployment catheter <b>16</b>, as shown in the cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, and routed through the support member <b>50</b>. The use of optical fibers <b>58</b> may provide for increased diameter sizes of the one or several lumens <b>56</b> through deployment catheter <b>16</b> for the passage of diagnostic and/or therapeutic tools therethrough. Alternatively, electronic chips, such as a charge coupled device (CCD) or a CMOS imager, which are typically known, may be utilized in place of the optical fibers <b>58</b>, in which case the electronic imager may be positioned in the distal portion of the deployment catheter <b>16</b> with electric wires being routed proximally through the deployment catheter <b>16</b>. Alternatively, the electronic imagers may be wirelessly coupled to a receiver for the wireless transmission of images. Additional optical fibers or light emitting diodes (LEDs) can be used to provide lighting for the image or operative theater, as described below in further detail. Support member <b>50</b> may be pivoted via connection <b>54</b> such that the member <b>50</b> can be positioned in a low-profile configuration within channel or groove <b>60</b> defined in a distal portion of catheter <b>16</b>, as shown in the cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>. During intravascular delivery of deployment catheter <b>16</b> through the patient body, support member <b>50</b> can be positioned within channel or groove <b>60</b> with imaging hood <b>12</b> also in its low-profile configuration. During visualization, imaging hood <b>12</b> may be expanded into its deployed configuration and support member <b>50</b> may be deployed into its off-axis configuration for imaging the tissue adjacent to hood <b>12</b>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. Other configurations for support member <b>50</b> for off-axis visualization may be utilized, as desired.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an illustrative cross-sectional view of a heart H having tissue regions of interest being viewed via an imaging assembly <b>10</b>. In this example, delivery catheter assembly <b>70</b> may be introduced percutaneously into the patient's vasculature and advanced through the superior vena cava SVC and into the right atrium RA. The delivery catheter or sheath <b>72</b> may be articulated through the atrial septum AS and into the left atrium LA for viewing or treating the tissue, e.g., the annulus A, surrounding the mitral valve MV. As shown, deployment catheter <b>16</b> and imaging hood <b>12</b> may be advanced out of delivery catheter <b>72</b> and brought into contact or in proximity to the tissue region of interest. In other examples, delivery catheter assembly <b>70</b> may be advanced through the inferior vena cava IVC, if so desired.

Alternatively, robotically-controlled delivery catheters may also be optionally utilized with the imaging assembly described herein, in which case a computer-controller <b>74</b> may be used to control the articulation and positioning of the delivery catheter <b>14</b>. An example of a robotically-controlled delivery catheter which may be utilized is described in further detail in US Pat.

For example, when utilizing a transseptal approach across the atrial septum AS into the left atrium LA, the inflatable balloons <b>76</b> may be inflated from a low-profile into their expanded configuration to temporarily anchor or stabilize the catheter <b>16</b> position relative to the heart H. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> shows a first balloon <b>78</b> inflated while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> also shows a second balloon <b>80</b> inflated proximal to the first balloon <b>78</b>. In such a configuration, the septal wall AS may be wedged or sandwiched between the balloons <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> to temporarily stabilize the catheter <b>16</b> and imaging hood <b>12</b>. A single balloon <b>78</b> or both balloons <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> may be used. Other alternatives may utilize expandable mesh members, malecots, or any other temporary expandable structure. After a procedure has been accomplished, the balloon assembly <b>76</b> may be deflated or re-configured into a low-profile for removal of the deployment catheter <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">To further stabilize a position of the imaging hood <b>12</b> relative to a tissue surface to be imaged, various anchoring mechanisms may be optionally employed for temporarily holding the imaging hood <b>12</b> against the tissue. Such anchoring mechanisms may be particularly useful for imaging tissue which is subject to movement, e.g., when imaging tissue within the chambers of a beating heart. A tool delivery catheter <b>82</b> having at least one instrument lumen and an optional visualization lumen may be delivered through deployment catheter <b>16</b> and into an expanded imaging hood <b>12</b>. As the imaging hood <b>12</b> is brought into contact against at issue surface T to be examined, anchoring mechanisms such as a helical tissue piercing device <b>84</b> may be passed through the tool delivery catheter <b>82</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, and into imaging hood <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The helical tissue engaging device <b>84</b> may be torqued from its proximal end outside the patient body to temporarily anchor itself into the underlying tissue surface T. Once embedded within the tissue T, the helical tissue engaging device <b>84</b> may be pulled proximally relative to deployment catheter <b>16</b> while the deployment catheter <b>16</b> and imaging hood <b>12</b> are pushed distally, as indicated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, to gently force the contact edge or lip <b>22</b> of imaging hood against the tissue T. The positioning of the tissue engaging device <b>84</b> may be locked temporarily relative to the deployment catheter <b>16</b> to ensure secure positioning of the imaging hood <b>12</b> during a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure within the imaging hood <b>12</b>. After a procedure, tissue engaging device <b>84</b> may be disengaged from the tissue by torquing its proximal end in the opposite direction to remove the anchor form the tissue T and the deployment catheter <b>16</b> may be repositioned to another region of tissue where the anchoring process may be repeated or removed from the patient body. The tissue engaging device <b>84</b> may also be constructed from other known tissue engaging devices such as vacuum-assisted engagement or grasper-assisted engagement tools, among others.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Although a helical anchor <b>84</b> is shown, this is intended to be illustrative and other types of temporary anchors may be utilized, e.g., hooked or barbed anchors, graspers, etc. Moreover, the tool delivery catheter <b>82</b> may be omitted entirely and the anchoring device may be delivered directly through a lumen defined through the deployment catheter <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In another variation where the tool delivery catheter <b>82</b> may be omitted entirely to temporarily anchor imaging hood <b>12</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> shows an imaging hood <b>12</b> having one or more tubular support members <b>86</b>, e.g., four support members <b>86</b> as shown, integrated with the imaging hood <b>12</b>. The tubular support members <b>86</b> may define lumens therethrough each having helical tissue engaging devices <b>88</b> positioned within. When an expanded imaging hood <b>12</b> is to be temporarily anchored to the tissue, the helical tissue engaging devices <b>88</b> may be urged distally to extend from imaging hood <b>12</b> and each may be torqued from its proximal end to engage the underlying tissue T. Each of the helical tissue engaging devices <b>88</b> maybe advanced through the length of deployment catheter <b>16</b> or they may be positioned within tubular support members <b>86</b> during the delivery and deployment of imaging hood <b>12</b>. Once the procedure within imaging hood <b>12</b> is finished, each of the tissue engaging devices <b>88</b> may be disengaged from the tissue and the imaging hood <b>12</b> may be repositioned to another region of tissue or removed from the patient body.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">An illustrative example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> of a tissue imaging assembly connected to a fluid delivery system <b>90</b> and to an optional processor <b>98</b> and image recorder and/or viewer <b>100</b>. The fluid delivery system <b>90</b> may generally comprise a pump <b>92</b> and an optional valve <b>94</b> for controlling the flow rate of the fluid into the system. A fluid reservoir <b>96</b>, fluidly connected to pump <b>92</b>, may hold the fluid to be pumped through imaging hood <b>12</b>. An optional central processing unit or processor <b>98</b> maybe in electrical communication with fluid delivery system <b>90</b> for controlling flow parameters such as the flow rate and/or velocity of the pumped fluid. The processor <b>98</b> may also be in electrical communication with an image recorder and/or viewer <b>100</b> for directly viewing the images of tissue received from within imaging hood <b>12</b>. Imager recorder and/or viewer <b>100</b> may also be used not only to record the image but also the location of the viewed tissue region, if so desired.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Optionally, processor <b>98</b> may also be utilized to coordinate the fluid flow and the image capture. For instance, processor <b>98</b> may be programmed to provide for fluid flow from reservoir <b>96</b> until the tissue area has been displaced of blood to obtain a clear image. Once the image has been determined to be sufficiently clear, either visually by a practitioner or by computer, an image of the tissue may be captured automatically by recorder <b>100</b> and pump <b>92</b> may be automatically stopped or slowed by processor <b>98</b> to cease the fluid flow into the patient. Other variations for fluid delivery and image capture are, of course, possible and the aforementioned configuration is intended only to be illustrative and not limiting.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> shows a further illustration of a hand-held variation of the fluid delivery and tissue manipulation system <b>110</b>. In this variation, system <b>110</b> may have a housing or handle assembly <b>112</b> which can be held or manipulated by the physician from outside the patient body. The fluid reservoir <b>114</b>, shown in this variation as a syringe, can be fluidly coupled to the handle assembly <b>112</b> and actuated via a pumping mechanism <b>116</b>, e.g., lead screw. Fluid reservoir <b>114</b> may be a simple reservoir separated from the handle assembly <b>112</b> and fluidly coupled to handle assembly <b>112</b> via one or more tubes. The fluid flow rate and other mechanisms may be metered by the electronic controller <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Deployment of imaging hood <b>12</b> may be actuated by a hood deployment switch <b>120</b> located on the handle assembly <b>112</b> while dispensation of the fluid from reservoir <b>114</b> may be actuated by a fluid deployment switch <b>122</b>, which can be electrically coupled to the controller <b>118</b>. Controller <b>118</b> may also be electrically coupled to a wired or wireless antenna <b>124</b> optionally integrated with the handle assembly <b>112</b>, as shown in the figure. The wireless antenna <b>124</b> can be used to wirelessly transmit images captured from the imaging hood <b>12</b> to a receiver, e.g., via Bluetooth&#xae; wireless technology (Bluetooth SIG, Inc., Bellevue, Wash.), RF, etc., for viewing on a monitor <b>128</b> or for recording for later viewing.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Articulation control of the deployment catheter <b>16</b>, or a delivery catheter or sheath <b>14</b> through which the deployment catheter <b>16</b> may be delivered, may be accomplished by computer control, as described above, in which case an additional controller may be utilized with handle assembly <b>112</b>. In the case of manual articulation, handle assembly <b>112</b> may incorporate one or more articulation controls <b>126</b> for manual manipulation of the position of deployment catheter <b>16</b>. Handle assembly <b>112</b> may also define one or more instrument ports <b>130</b> through which a number of intravascular tools may be passed for tissue manipulation and treatment within imaging hood <b>12</b>, as described further below. Furthermore, in certain procedures, fluid or debris may be sucked into imaging hood <b>12</b> for evacuation from the patient body by optionally fluidly coupling a suction pump <b>132</b> to handle assembly <b>112</b> or directly to deployment catheter <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">As described above, fluid may be pumped continuously into imaging hood <b>12</b> to provide for clear viewing of the underlying tissue. Alternatively, fluid may be pumped temporarily or sporadically only until a clear view of the tissue is available to be imaged and recorded, at which point the fluid flow may cease and the blood may be allowed to seep or flow back into imaging hood <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A to <b>9</b>C</figref> illustrate an example of capturing several images of the tissue at multiple regions. Deployment catheter <b>16</b> may be desirably positioned and imaging hood <b>12</b> deployed and brought into position against a region of tissue to be imaged, in this example the tissue surrounding a mitral valve MV within the left atrium of a patient's heart. The imaging hood <b>12</b> may be optionally anchored to the tissue, as described above, and then cleared by pumping the imaging fluid into the hood <b>12</b>. Once sufficiently clear, the tissue may be visualized and the image captured by control electronics <b>118</b>. The first captured image <b>140</b> may be stored and/or transmitted wirelessly <b>124</b> to a monitor <b>128</b> for viewing by the physician, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The deployment catheter <b>16</b> may be then repositioned to an adjacent portion of mitral valve MV, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, where the process may be repeated to capture a second image <b>142</b> for viewing and/or recording. The deployment catheter <b>16</b> may again be repositioned to another region of tissue, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, where a third image <b>144</b> may be captured for viewing and/or recording. This procedure may be repeated as many times as necessary for capturing a comprehensive image of the tissue surrounding mitral valve MV, or any other tissue region. When the deployment catheter <b>16</b> and imaging hood <b>12</b> is repositioned from tissue region to tissue region, the pump may be stopped during positioning and blood or surrounding fluid may be allowed to enter within imaging hood <b>12</b> until the tissue is to be imaged, where the imaging hood <b>12</b> may be cleared, as above.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">As mentioned above, when the imaging hood <b>12</b> is cleared by pumping the imaging fluid within for clearing the blood or other bodily fluid, the fluid may be pumped continuously to maintain the imaging fluid within the hood <b>12</b> at a positive pressure or it may be pumped under computer control for slowing or stopping the fluid flow into the hood <b>12</b> upon detection of various parameters or until a clear image of the underlying tissue is obtained. The control electronics <b>118</b> may also be programmed to coordinate the fluid flow into the imaging hood <b>12</b> with various physical parameters to maintain a clear image within imaging hood <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">One example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> which shows a chart <b>150</b> illustrating how fluid pressure within the imaging hood <b>12</b> may be coordinated with the surrounding blood pressure. Chart <b>150</b> shows the cyclical blood pressure <b>156</b> alternating between diastolic pressure <b>152</b> and systolic pressure <b>154</b> over time T due to the beating motion of the patient heart. The fluid pressure of the imaging fluid, indicated by plot <b>160</b>, within imaging hood <b>12</b> may be automatically timed to correspond to the blood pressure changes <b>160</b> such that an increased pressure is maintained within imaging hood <b>12</b> which is consistently above the blood pressure <b>156</b> by a slight increase &#x394;P, as illustrated by the pressure difference at the peak systolic pressure <b>158</b>. This pressure difference, &#x394;P, may be maintained within imaging hood <b>12</b> over the pressure variance of the surrounding blood pressure to maintain a positive imaging fluid pressure within imaging hood <b>12</b> to maintain a dear view of the underlying tissue. One benefit of maintaining a constant &#x394;P is a constant flow and maintenance of a clear field.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> shows a chart <b>162</b> illustrating another variation for maintaining a clear view of the underlying tissue where one or more sensors within the imaging hood <b>12</b>, as described in further detail below, may be configured to sense pressure changes within the imaging hood <b>12</b> and to correspondingly increase the imaging fluid pressure within imaging hood <b>12</b>. This may result in a time delay, &#x394;T, as illustrated by the shifted fluid pressure <b>160</b> relative to the cycling blood pressure <b>156</b>, although the time delays &#x394;T may be negligible in maintaining the dear image of the underlying tissue. Predictive software algorithms can also be used to substantially eliminate this time delay by predicting when the next pressure wave peak will arrive and by increasing the pressure ahead of the pressure wave's arrival by an amount of time equal to the aforementioned time delay to essentially cancel the time delay out.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The variations in fluid pressure within imaging hood <b>12</b> may be accomplished in part due to the nature of imaging hood <b>12</b>. An inflatable balloon, which is conventionally utilized for imaging tissue, may be affected by the surrounding blood pressure changes. On the other hand, an imaging hood <b>12</b> retains a constant volume there within and is structurally, unaffected by the surrounding blood pressure changes, thus allowing for pressure increases there within. The material that hood <b>12</b> is made from may also contribute to the manner in which the pressure is modulated within this hood <b>12</b>. A stiffer hood material, such as high durometer polyurethane or Nylon, may facilitate the maintaining of an open hood when deployed. On the other hand, a relatively lower durometer or softer material, such as a low durometer PVC or polyurethane, may collapse from the surrounding fluid pressure and may not adequately maintain a deployed or expanded hood.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Turning now to the imaging hood, other variations of the tissue imaging assembly may be utilized, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, which shows another variation comprising an additional imaging balloon <b>172</b> within an imaging hood <b>174</b>. In this variation, an expandable balloon <b>172</b> having a translucent skin may be positioned within imaging hood <b>174</b>. Balloon <b>172</b> may be made from any distensible biocompatible material having sufficient translucent properties which allow for visualization therethrough. Once the imaging hood <b>174</b> has been deployed against the tissue region of interest, balloon <b>172</b> may be filled with a fluid, such as saline, or less preferably a gas, until balloon <b>172</b> has been expanded until the blood has been sufficiently displaced. The balloon <b>172</b> may thus be expanded proximal to or into contact against the tissue region to be viewed. The balloon <b>172</b> can also be filled with contrast media to allow it to be viewed on fluoroscopy to aid in its positioning. The imager, e.g., fiberoptic, positioned within deployment catheter <b>170</b> may then be utilized to view the tissue region through the balloon <b>172</b> and any additional fluid which may be pumped into imaging hood <b>174</b> via one or more optional fluid ports <b>176</b>, which may be positioned proximally of balloon <b>172</b> along a portion of deployment catheter <b>170</b>. Alternatively, balloon <b>172</b> may define one or more holes over its surface which allow for seepage or passage of the fluid contained therein to escape and displace the blood from within imaging hood <b>174</b>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> shows another alternative in which balloon <b>180</b> may be utilized alone.

Deployment catheter <b>190</b> in this variation may define an inner tubular member <b>196</b> which may be integrated with deployment catheter <b>190</b> or independently translatable. Fluid delivery lumen <b>198</b> defined through member <b>196</b> may be fluidly connected to imaging hood <b>192</b>, which may also define one or more open channels <b>194</b> over its contact lip region. Fluid pumped through fluid delivery lumen <b>198</b> may thus fill open area <b>202</b> to displace any blood or other fluids or objects there within. As the clear fluid is forced out of open area <b>202</b>, it may be sucked or drawn immediately through one or more channels <b>194</b> and back into deployment catheter <b>190</b>.

As shown, a distal portion of deployment catheter <b>16</b> may have several pivoting members <b>250</b>, e.g., two to four sections, which form a tubular shape in its low profile configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>. When pivoted radially about deployment catheter <b>16</b>, pivoting members <b>250</b> may open into a deployed configuration having distensible or expanding membranes <b>252</b> extending over the gaps in-between the pivoting members <b>250</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref>. The distensible membrane <b>252</b> may be attached to the pivoting members <b>250</b> through various methods, e.g., adhesives, such that when the pivoting members <b>250</b> are fully extended into a conical shape, the pivoting members <b>250</b> and membrane <b>252</b> form a conical shape for use as an imaging hood. The distensible membrane <b>252</b> may be made out of a porous material such as a mesh or PTFE or out of a translucent or transparent polymer such as polyurethane, PVC, Nylon, etc.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A and <b>19</b>B</figref> show yet another variation where the distal portion of deployment catheter <b>16</b> may be fabricated from a flexible metallic or polymeric material to form a radially expanding hood <b>254</b>. A plurality of slots <b>256</b> may be formed in a uniform pattern over the distal portion of deployment catheter <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref>. The slots <b>256</b> may be formed in a pattern such that when the distal portion is urged radially open, utilizing any of the methods described above, a radially expanded and conically-shaped hood <b>254</b> may be formed by each of the slots <b>256</b> expanding into an opening, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>. A distensible membrane <b>258</b> may overlie the exterior surface or the interior surface of the hood <b>254</b> to form a fluid-impermeable hood <b>254</b> such that the hood <b>254</b> may be utilized as an imaging hood. Alternatively, the distensible membrane <b>258</b> may alternatively be formed in each opening <b>258</b> to form the fluid-impermeable hood <b>254</b>. Once the imaging procedure has been completed, hood <b>254</b> may be retracted into its low-profile configuration.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Yet another configuration for the imaging hood may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B</figref> where the imaging hood may be formed from a plurality of overlapping hood members <b>260</b> which overlie one another in an overlapping pattern. When expanded, each of the hood members <b>260</b> may extend radially outward relative to deployment catheter <b>16</b> to form a conically-shaped imaging hood, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>. Adjacent hood members <b>260</b> may overlap one another along an overlapping interface <b>262</b> to form a fluid-retaining surface within the imaging hood. Moreover, the hood members <b>260</b> may be made from any number of biocompatible materials, e.g., Nitinol, stainless-steel, polymers, etc., which are sufficiently strong to optionally retract surrounding tissue from the tissue region of interest.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Although it is generally desirable to have an imaging hood contact against a tissue surface in a normal orientation, the imaging hood may be alternatively configured to contact the tissue surface at an acute angle. An imaging hood configured for such contact against tissue may also be especially suitable for contact against tissue surfaces having an unpredictable or uneven anatomical geography. For instance, as shown in the variation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>A</figref>, deployment catheter <b>270</b> may have an imaging hood <b>272</b> that is configured to be especially compliant. In this variation, imaging hood <b>272</b> may be comprised of one or more sections <b>274</b> that are configured to fold or collapse, e.g., by utilizing a pleated surface. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>B</figref>, when imaging hood <b>272</b> is contacted against uneven tissue surface T, sections <b>274</b> are able to conform closely against the tissue. These sections <b>274</b> may be individually collapsible by utilizing an accordion style construction to allow conformation, e.g., to the trabeculae in the heart or the uneven anatomy that may be found inside the various body lumens.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In yet another alternative, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>A</figref> shows another variation in which an imaging hood <b>282</b> is attached to deployment catheter <b>280</b>. The contact lip or edge <b>284</b> may comprise one or more electrical contacts <b>286</b> positioned circumferentially around contact edge <b>284</b>. The electrical contacts <b>286</b> may be configured to contact the tissue and indicate affirmatively whether tissue contact was achieved, e.g., by measuring the differential impedance between blood and tissue. Alternatively, a processor, e.g., processor <b>98</b>, in electrical communication with contacts <b>286</b> may be configured to determine what type of tissue is in contact with electrical contacts <b>286</b>. In yet another alternative, the processor <b>98</b> maybe configured to measure any electrical activity that may be occurring in the underlying tissue, e.g., accessory pathways, for the purposes of electrically mapping the cardiac tissue and subsequently treating as described below, any arrhythmias which may be detected.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Another variation for ensuring contact between imaging hood <b>282</b> and the underlying tissue may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>B</figref>. This variation may have an inflatable contact edge <b>288</b> around the circumference of imaging hood <b>282</b>. The inflatable contact edge <b>288</b> may be inflated with a fluid or gas through inflation lumen <b>289</b> when the imaging hood <b>282</b> is to be placed against a tissue surface having an uneven or varied anatomy. The inflated circumferential surface <b>288</b> may provide for continuous contact over the hood edge by conforming against the tissue surface and facilitating imaging fluid retention within hood <b>282</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Aside from the imaging hood, various instrumentation may be utilized with the imaging and manipulation system. For instance, after the field within imaging hood <b>12</b> has been cleared of the opaque blood and the underlying tissue is visualized through the clear fluid, blood may seep back into the imaging hood <b>12</b> and obstruct the view. One method for automatically maintaining a clear imaging field may utilize a transducer, e.g., an ultrasonic transducer <b>290</b>, positioned at the distal end of deployment catheter within the imaging hood <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>. The transducer <b>290</b> may send an energy pulse <b>292</b> into the imaging hood <b>12</b> and wait to detect back-scattered energy <b>294</b> reflected from debris or blood within the imaging hood <b>12</b>. If back-scattered energy is detected, the pump may be actuated automatically to dispense more fluid into the imaging hood until the debris or blood is no longer detected.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Alternatively, one or more sensors <b>300</b> may be positioned on the imaging hood <b>12</b> itself as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>A</figref>, to detect a number of different parameters. For example, sensors <b>300</b> may be configured to detect for the presence of oxygen in the surrounding blood, blood and/or imaging fluid pressure, color of the fluid within the imaging hood, etc. Fluid color may be particularly useful in detecting the presence of blood within the imaging hood <b>12</b> by utilizing a reflective type sensor to detect back reflection from blood. Any reflected light from blood which may be present within imaging hood <b>12</b> may be optically or electrically transmitted through deployment catheter <b>16</b> and to a red colored filter within control electronics <b>118</b>. Any red color which may be detected may indicate the presence of blood and trigger a signal to the physician or automatically actuate the pump to dispense more fluid into the imaging hood <b>12</b> to clear the blood.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Alternative methods for detecting the presence of blood within the hood <b>12</b> may include detecting transmitted light through the imaging fluid within imaging hood <b>12</b>. If a source of white light, e.g., utilizing LEDs or optical fibers, is illuminated inside imaging hood <b>12</b>, the presence of blood may cause the color red to be filtered through this fluid. The degree or intensity of the red color detected may correspond to the amount of blood present within imaging hood <b>12</b>. A red color sensor can simply comprise, in one variation, a phototransistor with a red transmitting filter over it which can establish how much red light is detected, which in turn can indicate the presence of blood within imaging hood <b>12</b>. Once blood is detected, the system may pump more clearing fluid through and enable closed loop feedback control of the clearing fluid pressure and flow level.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Any number of sensors may be positioned along the exterior <b>302</b> of imaging hood <b>12</b> or within the interior <b>304</b> of imaging hood <b>12</b> to detect parameters not only exteriorly to imaging hood <b>12</b> but also within imaging hood <b>12</b>. Such a configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>B</figref>, may be particularly useful for automatically maintaining a clear imaging field based upon physical parameters such as blood pressure, as described above for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Aside from sensors, one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs) may be utilized to provide lighting within the imaging hood <b>12</b>. Although illumination may be provided by optical fibers routed through deployment catheter <b>16</b>, the use of LEDs over the imaging hood <b>12</b> may eliminate the need for additional optical fibers for providing illumination. The electrical wires connected to the one or more LEDs may be routed through or over the hood <b>12</b> and along an exterior surface or extruded within deployment catheter <b>16</b>. One or more LEDs may be positioned in a circumferential pattern <b>306</b> around imaging hood <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref>, or in a linear longitudinal pattern <b>308</b> along imaging hood <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref>. Other patterns, such as a helical or spiral pattern, may also be utilized. Alternatively, LEDs may be positioned along a support member forming part of imaging hood <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In another alternative for illumination within imaging hood <b>12</b>, a separate illumination tool <b>310</b> may be utilized, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>A</figref>. An example of such a tool may comprise a flexible intravascular delivery member <b>312</b> having a carrier member <b>314</b> pivotably connected <b>316</b> to a distal end of delivery member <b>312</b>. One or more LEDs <b>318</b> may be mounted along carrier member <b>314</b>. In use, delivery member <b>312</b> may be advanced through deployment catheter <b>16</b> until carrier member <b>314</b> is positioned within imaging hood <b>12</b>. Once within imaging hood <b>12</b>, carrier member <b>314</b> may be pivoted in any number of directions to facilitate or optimize the illumination within the imaging hood <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">In utilizing LEDs for illumination, whether positioned along imaging hood <b>12</b> or along a separate instrument, the LEDs may comprise a single LED color, e.g., white light. Alternatively, LEDs of other colors, e.g., red, blue, yellow, etc., may be utilized exclusively or in combination with white LEDs to provide for varied illumination of the tissue or fluids being imaged. Alternatively, sources of infrared or ultraviolet light may be employed to enable imaging beneath the tissue surface or cause fluorescence of tissue for use in system guidance, diagnosis, or therapy.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Aside from providing a visualization platform, the imaging assembly may also be utilized to provide a therapeutic platform for treating tissue being visualized. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>, deployment catheter <b>320</b> may have imaging hood <b>322</b>, as described above, and fluid delivery lumen <b>324</b> and imaging lumen <b>326</b>. In this variation, a therapeutic tool such as needle <b>328</b> may be delivered through fluid delivery lumen <b>324</b> or in another working lumen and advanced through open area <b>332</b> for treating the tissue which is visualized. In this instance, needle <b>328</b> may define one or several ports <b>330</b> for delivering drugs therethrough. Thus, once the appropriate region of tissue has been imaged and located, needle <b>328</b> maybe advanced and pierced into the underlying tissue where a therapeutic agent may be delivered through ports <b>330</b>. Alternatively, needle <b>328</b> maybe in electrical communication with a power source <b>334</b>, e.g., radio-frequency, microwave, etc., for ablating the underlying tissue area of interest.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> shows another alternative in which deployment catheter <b>340</b> may have imaging hood <b>342</b> attached thereto, as above, but with a therapeutic tool <b>344</b> in the configuration of a helical tissue piercing device <b>344</b>.

In this variation, an ablation probe, such as a cryo-ablation probe <b>380</b> having a distal end effector <b>382</b>, may be positioned through the imaging hood <b>12</b> such that the end effector <b>382</b> is placed distally of a transparent membrane or enclosure <b>384</b>, as shown in the end view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>B</figref>. The shaft of probe <b>380</b> may pass through an opening <b>386</b> defined through the membrane <b>384</b>. In use, the clear fluid may be pumped into imaging hood <b>12</b>, as described above, and the distal end effector <b>382</b> maybe placed against a tissue region to be ablated with the imaging hood <b>12</b> and the membrane <b>384</b> positioned atop or adjacent to the ablated tissue. In the case of cryo-ablation, the imaging fluid may be warmed prior to dispensing into the imaging hood <b>12</b> such that the tissue contacted by the membrane <b>384</b> may be warmed during the cryo-ablation procedure. In the case of thermal ablation, e.g., utilizing radio-frequency energy, the fluid dispensed into the imaging hood <b>12</b> may be cooled such that the tissue contacted by the membrane <b>384</b> and adjacent to the ablation probe during the ablation procedure is likewise cooled.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">In either example described above, the imaging fluid may be varied in its temperature to facilitate various procedures to be performed upon the tissue. In other cases, the imaging fluid itself may be altered to facilitate various procedures. For instance as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>A</figref>, a deployment catheter <b>16</b> and imaging hood <b>12</b> may be advanced within a hollow body organ, such as a bladder filled with urine <b>394</b>, towards a lesion or tumor <b>392</b> on the bladder wall. The imaging hood <b>12</b> may be placed entirely over the lesion <b>392</b>, or over a portion of the lesion. Once secured against the tissue wall <b>390</b>, a cryo-fluid, i.e., a fluid which has been cooled to below freezing temperatures of, e.g., water or blood, may be pumped into the imaging hood <b>12</b> to cryo-ablate the lesion <b>390</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>B</figref> while avoiding the creation of ice on the instrument or surface of tissue.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">As the cryo-fluid leaks out of the imaging hood <b>12</b> and into the organ, the fluid may be warmed naturally by the patient body and ultimately removed. The cryo-fluid may be a colorless and translucent fluid which enables visualization therethrough of the underlying tissue. An example of such a fluid is Fluorinert&#x2122; (3M, St. Paul, Minn.), which is a colorless and odorless perfluorinated liquid. The use of a liquid such as Fluorinert&#x2122; enables the cryo-ablation procedure without the formation of ice within or outside of the imaging hood <b>12</b>. Alternatively, rather than utilizing cryo-ablation, hyperthermic treatments may also be effected by heating the Fluorinert&#x2122; liquid to elevated temperatures for ablating the lesion <b>392</b> within the imaging hood <b>12</b>. Moreover, Fluorinert&#x2122; may be utilized in various other parts of the body, such as within the heart.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b>A</figref> shows another variation of an instrument which may be utilized with the imaging system. In this variation, a laser ring generator <b>400</b> may be passed through the deployment catheter <b>16</b> and partially into imaging hood <b>12</b>. A laser ring generator <b>400</b> is typically used to create a circular ring of laser energy <b>402</b> for generating a conduction block around the pulmonary veins typically in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. The circular ring of laser energy <b>402</b> may be generated such that a diameter of the ring <b>402</b> is contained within a diameter of the imaging hood <b>12</b> to allow for tissue ablation directly upon tissue being imaged. Signals which cause atrial fibrillation typically come from the entry area of the pulmonary veins into the left atrium and treatments may sometimes include delivering ablation energy to the ostia of the pulmonary veins within the atrium. The ablated areas of the tissue may produce a circular scar which blocks the impulses for atrial fibrillation.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">When using the laser energy to ablate the tissue of the heart, it may be generally desirable to maintain the integrity and health of the tissue overlying the surface while ablating the underlying tissue. This may be accomplished, for example, by cooling the imaging fluid to a temperature below the body temperature of the patient but which is above the freezing point of blood (e.g., 2&#xb0; C. to 35&#xb0; C.). The cooled imaging fluid may thus maintain the surface tissue at the cooled fluid temperature while the deeper underlying tissue remains at the patient body temperature. When the laser energy (or other types of energy such as radio frequency energy, microwave energy, ultrasound energy, etc.) irradiates the tissue, both the cooled tissue surface as well as the deeper underlying tissue will rise in temperature uniformly. The deeper underlying tissue, which was maintained at the body temperature, will increase to temperatures which are sufficiently high to destroy the underlying tissue. Meanwhile, the temperature of the cooled surface tissue will also rise but only to temperatures that are near body temperature or slightly above.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b>B</figref>, one example for treatment, may include passing deployment catheter <b>16</b> across the atrial septum AS and into the left atrium LA of the patient's heart H. Other methods of accessing the left atrium LA may also be utilized. The imaging hood <b>12</b> and laser ring generator <b>400</b> may be positioned adjacent to or over one or more of the ostium OT of the pulmonary veins PV and the laser generator <b>400</b> may ablate the tissue around the ostium OT with the circular ring of laser energy <b>402</b> to create a conduction block. Once one or more of the tissue around the ostium OT have been ablated, the imaging hood <b>12</b> may be reconfigured into a low profile for removal from the patient heart H.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">One of the difficulties in treating tissue in or around the ostium OT is the dynamic fluid flow of blood through the ostium OT. The dynamic forces make cannulation or entry of the ostium OT difficult. Thus, another variation on instruments or tools utilizable with the imaging system is an extendible cannula <b>410</b> having a cannula lumen <b>412</b> defined therethrough, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>A</figref>. The extendible cannula <b>410</b> may generally comprise an elongate tubular member which may be positioned within the deployment catheter <b>16</b> during delivery and then projected distally through the imaging hood <b>12</b> and optionally beyond, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">In use, once the imaging hood <b>12</b> has been desirably positioned relative to the tissue, e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>C</figref> outside the ostium OT of a pulmonary vein PV, the extendible cannula <b>410</b> may be projected distally from the deployment catheter <b>16</b> while optionally imaging the tissue through the imaging hood <b>12</b>, as described above. The extendible cannula <b>410</b> may be projected distally until its distal end is extended at least partially into the ostium OT. Once in the ostium OT, an instrument or energy ablation device may be extended through and out of the cannula lumen <b>412</b> for treatment within the ostium OT. Upon completion of the procedure, the cannula <b>410</b> may be withdrawn proximally and removed from the patient body. The extendible cannula <b>410</b> may also include an inflatable occlusion balloon at or near its distal end to block the blood flow out of the PV to maintain a clear view of the tissue region. Alternatively, the extendible cannula <b>410</b> may define a lumen therethrough beyond the occlusion balloon to bypass at least a portion of the blood that normally exits the pulmonary vein PV by directing the blood through the cannula <b>410</b> to exit proximal of the imaging hood.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Yet another variation for tool or instrument use may be seen in the side and end views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>36</b>A and <b>36</b>B</figref>. In this variation, imaging hood <b>12</b> may have one or more tubular support members <b>420</b> integrated with the hood <b>12</b>. Each of the tubular support members <b>420</b> may define an access lumen <b>422</b> through which one or more instruments or tools may be delivered for treatment upon the underlying tissue. One particular example is shown and described above for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Various methods and instruments may be utilized for using or facilitating the use of the system. For instance, one method may include facilitating the initial delivery and placement of a device into the patient's heart. In initially guiding the imaging assembly within the heart chamber to, e.g., the mitral valve MV, a separate guiding probe <b>430</b> may be utilized, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>37</b>A and <b>37</b>B</figref>, Guiding probe <b>430</b> may, for example, comprise an optical fiber through which a light source <b>434</b> may be used to illuminate a distal tip portion <b>432</b>. The tip portion <b>432</b> may be advanced into the heart through, e.g., the coronary sinus CS, until the tip is positioned adjacent to the mitral valve MV. The tip <b>432</b> may be illuminated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b>A</figref>, and imaging assembly <b>10</b> may then be guided towards the illuminated tip <b>432</b>, which is visible from within the atrial chamber, towards mitral valve MV.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">Aside from the devices and methods described above, the imaging system may be utilized to facilitate various other procedures. Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>38</b>A and <b>38</b>B</figref>, the imaging hood of the device in particular may be utilized. In this example, a collapsible membrane or disk-shaped member <b>440</b> may be temporarily secured around the contact edge or lip of imaging hood <b>12</b>. During intravascular delivery, the imaging hood <b>12</b> and the attached member <b>440</b> may both be in a collapsed configuration to maintain a low profile for delivery. Upon deployment, both the imaging hood <b>12</b> and the member <b>440</b> may extend into their expanded configurations.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">The disk-shaped member <b>440</b> may be comprised of a variety of materials depending upon the application. For instance, member <b>440</b> may be fabricated from a porous polymeric material infused with a drug eluting medicament <b>442</b> for implantation against a tissue surface for slow infusion of the medicament into the underlying tissue. Alternatively, the member <b>440</b> may be fabricated from a non-porous material, e.g., metal or polymer, for implantation and closure of a wound or over a cavity to prevent fluid leakage.

In this variation, rather than utilizing a hood, an inflatable imaging balloon <b>640</b> may be positioned upon deployment catheter <b>16</b>, which is coupled to handle <b>642</b>. Handle <b>642</b> may include a power supply <b>644</b>, e.g., a battery, and may also be fluidly coupled via line <b>648</b> to a fluid reservoir <b>646</b>, e.g., syringe, containing the transparent fluid for infusing into balloon <b>640</b>. A distal portion of balloon <b>640</b> that comes into contact against the tissue surface may incorporate the plurality of electrodes <b>632</b>, which are illustrated in a circumferential configuration but may be configured into various patterns or shapes. Electrodes <b>632</b> may surround a distal opening <b>658</b> of access lumen <b>656</b> extending through balloon <b>640</b> towards deployment catheter <b>16</b> for providing a pathway for introducing any number of instruments or materials through balloon <b>640</b> and into or against the underlying tissue region.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">Moreover, a light source <b>654</b> (e.g., optical fiber, light emitting diode, etc.) may also be positioned near or at the distal end of catheter <b>16</b> within balloon <b>640</b> to provide light through balloon <b>640</b> for visualizing the tissue contacted by balloon <b>640</b>. Additionally, an imaging element <b>652</b> (e.g., optical fiber, CMOS or CCD camera, etc.) may be positioned at the distal end of catheter <b>16</b> within balloon <b>640</b> or alternatively upon an articulatable support member <b>650</b>, which may be angled into an off-axis positioned relative to a longitudinal axis of catheter <b>16</b>. In either case, the tissue surface contacted by the distal portion of balloon <b>640</b> may be visualized through balloon <b>640</b> via imaging element <b>652</b> while the pacing or mapping electrodes <b>632</b> may simultaneously detected any electrophysiological activity of the visualized tissue for evaluation and/or treatment, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">The applications of the disclosed invention discussed above are not limited to certain treatments or regions of the body, but may include any number of other treatments and areas of the body.
