id="p-0003" num="0002">The present specification relates to a technique for performing multi-link communication in a wireless LAN system, and more particularly, to a method for a power save mode (PS mode) in multi-link communication and an apparatus supporting the same.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wireless local area network (WLAN) has been improved in various ways. For example, the IEEE 802.11ax standard proposed an improved communication environment using orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and downlink multi-user multiple input multiple output (DL MU MIMO) techniques.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present specification proposes a technical feature that can be utilized in a new communication standard. For example, the new communication standard may be an extreme high throughput (EHT) standard which is currently being discussed. The EHT standard may use an increased bandwidth, an enhanced PHY layer protocol data unit (PPDU) structure, an enhanced sequence, a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) scheme, or the like, which is newly proposed. The EHT standard may be called the IEEE 802.11be standard.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the EHT standard, in order to support high throughput and high data rate, a wide bandwidth (for example, 160/320 MHz), 16 streams, and/or multi-link (or multi-band) operation may be used.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the EHT standard, the multi-link may include a primary link and a secondary link. A device supporting multi-link (that is, multi-link device) may designate one or more links among the multi-link as a primary link. The remaining links may operate as a secondary link.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Exchange of a management frame or a control frame may be performed only on the primary link. A higher load may be generated in the primary link than in the secondary link. Therefore, technical features for changing the primary link for load balancing may be required.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Solutions</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to various embodiments, a multi-link device (MLD) including a first station (STA) and a second STA may perform the steps of transmitting, to an access point (AP) through the first STA related to a first link among a multi-link, a request frame for changing a primary link from the first link to a second link among the multi-link, wherein the request frame includes first information related to a link identifier (ID) of the second link; receiving a response frame based on the request frame from the AP through the first STA; and determining whether to change the primary link to the second link based on the response frame.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Technical Effects</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to various embodiments, the multi-link device may check the data traffic of the primary link and change the primary link based on the data traffic. Accordingly, there is an effect that the load between links can be similarly maintained in the multi-link.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, according to various embodiments, there is an effect that a multi-link device can select a primary link suitable for its own data traffic or power amount by changing or adding a primary link according to a situation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">That is, since the multi-link device changes or requests to change the primary link, there is an effect of maintaining load balancing between links and reducing power consumption of STAs included in the multi-link device.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

The network discovery operation may include a scanning operation of the STA. That is, to access a network, the STA needs to discover a participating network. The STA needs to identify a compatible network before participating in a wireless network, and a process of identifying a network present in a particular area is referred to as scanning. Scanning methods include active scanning and passive scanning.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a network discovery operation including an active scanning process. In active scanning, a STA performing scanning transmits a probe request frame and waits for a response to the probe request frame in order to identify which AP is present around while moving to channels. A responder transmits a probe response frame as a response to the probe request frame to the STA having transmitted the probe request frame. Here, the responder may be a STA that transmits the last beacon frame in a BSS of a channel being scanned. In the BSS, since an AP transmits a beacon frame, the AP is the responder. In an IBSS, since STAs in the IBSS transmit a beacon frame in turns, the responder is not fixed. For example, when the STA transmits a probe request frame via channel 1 and receives a probe response frame via channel 1, the STA may store BSS-related information included in the received probe response frame, may move to the next channel (e.g., channel 2), and may perform scanning (e.g., transmits a probe request and receives a probe response via channel 2) by the same method.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, scanning may be performed by a passive scanning method. In passive scanning, a STA performing scanning may wait for a beacon frame while moving to channels. A beacon frame is one of management frames in IEEE 802.11 and is periodically transmitted to indicate the presence of a wireless network and to enable the STA performing scanning to find the wireless network and to participate in the wireless network. In a BSS, an AP serves to periodically transmit a beacon frame. In an IBSS, STAs in the IBSS transmit a beacon frame in turns. Upon receiving the beacon frame, the STA performing scanning stores information related to a BSS included in the beacon frame and records beacon frame information in each channel while moving to another channel. The STA having received the beacon frame may store BSS-related information included in the received beacon frame, may move to the next channel, and may perform scanning in the next channel by the same method.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">After discovering the network, the STA may perform an authentication process in S<b>320</b>. The authentication process may be referred to as a first authentication process to be clearly distinguished from the following security setup operation in S<b>340</b>. The authentication process in S<b>320</b> may include a process in which the STA transmits an authentication request frame to the AP and the AP transmits an authentication response frame to the STA in response. The authentication frames used for an authentication request/response are management frames.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The authentication frames may include information related to an authentication algorithm number, an authentication transaction sequence number, a status code, a challenge text, a robust security network (RSN), and a finite cyclic group.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The STA may transmit the authentication request frame to the AP.

The association process includes a process in which the STA transmits an association request frame to the AP and the AP transmits an association response frame to the STA in response. The association request frame may include, for example, information related to various capabilities, a beacon listen interval, a service set identifier (SSID), a supported rate, a supported channel, RSN, a mobility domain, a supported operating class, a traffic indication map (TIM) broadcast request, and an interworking service capability. The association response frame may include, for example, information related to various capabilities, a status code, an association ID (AID), a supported rate, an enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) parameter set, a received channel power indicator (RCPI), a received signal-to-noise indicator (RSNI), a mobility domain, a timeout interval (association comeback time), an overlapping BSS scanning parameter, a TIM broadcast response, and a QoS map.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In S<b>340</b>, the STA may perform a security setup process.

For example, when an 80 MHz PPDU is transmitted, a STA may apply puncturing to the secondary 20 MHz band out of the 80 MHz band, and may transmit a PPDU only through a primary 20 MHz band and a secondary 40 MHz band.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0199">For example, a pattern of the preamble puncturing may be configured in advance. For example, when a first puncturing pattern is applied, puncturing may be applied only to the secondary 20 MHz band within the 80 MHz band. For example, when a second puncturing pattern is applied, puncturing may be applied to only any one of two secondary 20 MHz bands included in the secondary 40 MHz band within the 80 MHz band. For example, when a third puncturing pattern is applied, puncturing may be applied to only the secondary 20 MHz band included in the primary 80 MHz band within the 160 MHz band (or 80+80 MHz band). For example, when a fourth puncturing is applied, puncturing may be applied to at least one 20 MHz channel not belonging to a primary 40 MHz band in the presence of the primary 40 MHz band included in the 80 MHaz band within the 160 MHz band (or 80+80 MHz band).</p><p id="p-0205" num="0200">Information related to the preamble puncturing applied to the PPDU may be included in U-SIG and/or EHT-SIG. For example, a first field of the U-SIG may include information related to a contiguous bandwidth, and second field of the U-SIG may include information related to the preamble puncturing applied to the PPDU.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0201">For example, the U-SIG and the EHT-SIG may include the information related to the preamble puncturing, based on the following method. When a bandwidth of the PPDU exceeds 80 MHz, the U-SIG may be configured individually in unit of 80 MHz. For example, when the bandwidth of the PPDU is 160 MHz, the PPDU may include a first U-SIG for a first 80 MHz band and a second U-SIG for a second 80 MHz band. In this case, a first field of the first U-SIG may include information related to a 160 MHz bandwidth, and a second field of the first U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern) applied to the first 80 MHz band. In addition, a first field of the second U-SIG may include information related to a 160 MHz bandwidth, and a second field of the second U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern) applied to the second 80 MHz band. Meanwhile, an EHT-SIG contiguous to the first U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing applied to the second 80 MHz band (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern), and an EHT-SIG contiguous to the second U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern) applied to the first 80 MHz band.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0202">Additionally or alternatively, the U-SIG and the EHT-SIG may include the information related to the preamble puncturing, based on the following method. The U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern) for all bands. That is, the EHT-SIG may not include the information related to the preamble puncturing, and only the U-SIG may include the information related to the preamble puncturing (i.e., the information related to the preamble puncturing pattern).</p><p id="p-0208" num="0203">The U-SIG may be configured in unit of 20 MHz. For example, when an 80 MHz PPDU is configured, the U-SIG may be duplicated. That is, four identical U-SIGs may be included in the 80 MHz PPDU. PPDUs exceeding an 80 MHz bandwidth may include different U-SIGs.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0204">The EHT-SIG of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> may include control information for the receiving STA.

The mode in which the common field of the EHT-SIG is omitted may be called a compressed mode. When the compressed mode is used, a plurality of users (i.e., a plurality of receiving STAs) may decode the PPDU (e.g., the data field of the PPDU), based on non-OFDMA. That is, the plurality of users of the EHT PPDU may decode the PPDU (e.g., the data field of the PPDU) received through the same frequency band. Meanwhile, when a non-compressed mode is used, the plurality of users of the EHT PPDU may decode the PPDU (e.g., the data field of the PPDU), based on OFDMA.

As described above, information related to an MCS scheme applied to the EHT-SIG may be included in U-SIG. The EHT-SIG may be configured based on a DCM scheme. For example, among N data tones (e.g., 52 data tones) allocated for the EHT-SIG, a first modulation scheme may be applied to half of contiguous tones, and a second modulation scheme may be applied to the remaining half of the contiguous tones. That is, a transmitting STA may use the first modulation scheme to modulate specific control information through a first symbol and allocate it to half of the contiguous tones, and may use the second modulation scheme to modulate the same control information by using a second symbol and allocate it to the remaining half of the contiguous tones. As described above, information (e.g., a 1-bit field) regarding whether the DCM scheme is applied to the EHT-SIG may be included in the U-SIG.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0214">An HE-STF of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> may be used for improving automatic gain control estimation in a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) environment or an OFDMA environment.

An STF signal generated based on the first type STF sequence may have a period of 0.8&#x3bc;s, and a periodicity signal of 0.8 &#x3bc;s may be repeated 5 times to become a first type STF having a length of 4 &#x3bc;s.

In the following equation, (a:b:c) may imply a duration defined as b tone intervals (i.e., a subcarrier interval) from a tone index (i.e., subcarrier index) &#x2018;a&#x2019; to a tone index &#x2018;c&#x2019;. For example, the equation 2 below may represent a sequence defined as 16 tone intervals from a tone index &#x2212;112 to a tone index 112. Since a subcarrier spacing of 78.125 kHz is applied to the EHT-STR, the 16 tone intervals may imply that an EHT-STF coefficient (or element) is arranged with an interval of 78.125*16=1250 kHz.

If the S20 channel is in an idle state, the STA may perform bonding on the P20 channel and the S20 channel.

That is, the Primary 20 MHz channel, the Secondary 20 MHz channel, the Secondary 40 MHz channel, and the Secondary 80 MHz channel can be sequentially bonded. However, if the secondary 20 MHz channel is determined to be in the busy state, channel bonding may not be performed even if all other secondary channels are in the idle state. In addition, when it is determined that the secondary 20 MHz channel is in the idle state and the secondary 40 MHz channel is in the busy state, channel bonding may be performed only on the primary 20 MHz channel and the secondary 20 MHz channel.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0252">Hereinafter, preamble puncturing supported by an STA in the present disclosure will be described.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0253">For example, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, if the Primary 20 MHz channel, the Secondary 40 MHz channel, and the Secondary 80 MHz channel are all in the idle state, but the Secondary 20 MHz channel is in the busy state, bonding to the secondary 40 MHz channel and the secondary 80 MHz channel may not be possible. In this case, the STA may configure a 160 MHz PPDU and may perform a preamble puncturing on the preamble transmitted through the secondary 20 MHz channel (for example, L-STF, L-LTF, L-SIG, RL-SIG, U-SIG, HE-SIG-A, HE-SIG-B, HE-STF, HE-LTF, EHT-SIG, EHT-STF, EHT-LTF, etc.), so that the STA may transmit a signal through a channel in the idle state. In other words, the STA may perform preamble puncturing for some bands of the PPDU. Information on preamble puncturing (for example, information about 20/40/80 MHz channels/bands to which puncturing is applied) may be included in a signal field (for example, HE-SIG-A, U-SIG, EHT-SIG) of the PPDU.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0254">Hereinafter, technical features of a multi-link (ML) supported by an STA of the present disclosure will be described.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0255">The STA (AP and/or non-AP STA) of the present disclosure may support multi-link (ML) communication. ML communication may refer to communication supporting a plurality of links.

For example, a plurality of links supported by one STA for ML communication may be a plurality of channels in a 2.4 GHz band, a plurality of channels in a 5 GHz band, and a plurality of channels in a 6 GHz band. Alternatively, a plurality of links supported by one STA for ML communication may be a combination of at least one channel in the 2.4 GHz band (or 5 GHz/6 GHz band) and at least one channel in the 5 GHz band (or 2.4 GHz/6 GHz band). Meanwhile, at least one of the plurality of links supported by one STA for ML communication may be a channel to which preamble puncturing is applied.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0257">The STA may perform an ML setup to perform ML communication. The ML setup may be performed based on a management frame or control frame such as a Beacon, a Probe Request/Response, an Association Request/Response, and the like. For example, information about ML setup may be included in an element field included in a Beacon, a Probe Request/Response, an Association Request/Response, and the like.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0258">When ML setup is completed, an enabled link for ML communication may be determined.

For example, one STA supporting two links could be expressed as one multi-link device (MLD) including a first STA for a first link and a second STA for a second link. For example, one AP supporting two links could be expressed as one AP MLD including a first AP for a first link and a second AP for a second link. In addition, one non-AP supporting two links may be expressed as one non-AP MLD including a first STA for the first link and a second STA for the second link.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0260">Hereinafter, more specific features related to the ML setup are described.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0261">The MLD (the AP MLD and/or the non-AP MLD) may transmit information about a link that the corresponding MLD can support through ML setup. Link information may be configured in various ways. For example, information about the link may include at least one of 1) information on whether the MLD (or STA) supports simultaneous RX/TX operation, 2) information on the number/upper limit of uplink/downlink links supported by the MLD (or STA), 3) information about the location/band/resource of the uplink/downlink link supported by the MLD (or STA), 4) information on available or preferred frame types (management, control, data, etc.) in at least one uplink/downlink link, 5) ACK policy information available or preferred in at least one uplink/downlink link, and 6) information on available or preferred traffic identifier (TID) in at least one uplink/downlink link. The TID is related to the priority of traffic data and is expressed as eight types of values according to the conventional wireless LAN standard. That is, eight TID values corresponding to four access categories (AC) (AC_BK(background), AC_BE(best effort), AC_VI(video), AC_VO(voice)) according to the conventional WLAN standard may be defined.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0262">For example, it may be pre-configured in advance that all TIDs are mapped for uplink/downlink link. Specifically, when negotiation is not made through ML setup, all TIDs are used for ML communication. If the mapping between the uplink/downlink link and the TID is negotiated through additional ML settings, the negotiated TID may be used for ML communication.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0263">A plurality of links usable by the transmitting MLD and the receiving MLD related to ML communication may be configured through ML setup, and this may be referred to as an &#x201c;enabled link&#x201d;.

For example, it may be referred to as various expressions such as a first link, a second link, a transmission link, and a reception link.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0264">After the ML setup is completed, the MLD may update the ML setup. For example, the MLD may transmit information about a new link when it is necessary to update information about the link. Information on the new link may be transmitted based on at least one a management frame, a control frame, and a data frame.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0265">According to an embodiment, the MLD may include anon-AP MLD and an AP-MLD. The non-AP MLD and the AP-MLD may be classified according to the function of an access point (AP). The non-AP MLD and the AP-MLD may be physically separated or logically separated. For example, when the MLD performs an AP function, it may be referred to as an AP MLD, and when the MLD performs an STA function, it may be referred to as a non-AP MLD.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0266">According to an embodiment, in the EHT standard (that is, 802.11be), a multi-link may be divided into a Primary/Secondary link to reduce power consumption. APs supporting a multi-link can be managed by designating each link as a primary link or a secondary link. The AP can designate one or more links among several links as the Primary Link. Links other than primary links can operate as secondary links.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0267">According to an embodiment, the primary link may mean a link that performs all functions of the link. In addition, the secondary link may mean a link that performs a limited function (for example, data frame exchange) for power-saving.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0268">According to an embodiment, in the EHT standard, a multi-link may be divided into a general/power-saving link. The above-described primary link may correspond to a general link. In other words, the above-described primary link may be related to a general link. In addition, the above-described secondary link may correspond to a power-saving link. In other words, the above-described secondary link may be related to a power-saving link.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0269">For example, the primary link may be used not only for frame exchange for synchronization but also for non-data frame exchange (that is, Control/Management frame exchange). The secondary link can only be used for data frame exchange.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0270">Therefore, the STA can listen only to the primary link for receiving the Beacon and/or Control/Management frame during the idle time (or period). In other words, the STA may operate only in the primary link for receiving the Beacon and/or Control/Management frame during the idle time (or period). Therefore, a non-AP Multi-Link Device (MLD) must be connected to at least one primary link.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0271">In the following specification, MLD may refer to a multi-link device. The MLD has one or more connected STAs and has one MAC service access point (SAP) that connects to an upper link layer (Logical Link Control, LLC). MLD may mean a physical device or a logical device. Hereinafter, a device may mean an MLD.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0272">In addition, the MLD may include at least one STA connected to each link of the multi-link. For example, the processor of the MLD may control the at least one STA. For example, the at least one STA may be independently configured and operated. The at least one STA may include a processor and a transceiver, respectively. For example, the at least one STA may operate independently regardless of the processor of the MLD.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0273">In the following specification, for the convenience of description, it is described that the MLD (or the processor of the MLD) controls at least one STA, but is not limited thereto.

The non-AP MLD can perform management/control frame (for example, beacon frame) exchange and frame exchange for synchronization only through the primary link. Therefore, the STA connected through the primary link should always maintain the enabled state. For example, even when the power save mode is supported, the STA connected through the primary link should enter the awake state according to the Target Beacon Transmission Time (TBTT) to receive the Beacon frame.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0278">Therefore, the operation of the primary link may require a relatively large load and a lot of power compared to the secondary link. On the other hand, the secondary link, in which data frame exchange does not occur, can enter the unavailable state (Disable or doze state). That is, power consumption in the secondary link can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0279">Operations of the above-described primary link and secondary link may be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0280"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> shows an example of the operation of a primary link and a secondary link in a multi-link.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0281">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, the vertical axis may mean frequency, and the horizontal axis may mean time.

Due to the characteristics of the above-described primary link, load unbalancing may occur in which data traffic is concentrated on one link. In addition, when a management frame transmission for another STA occurs during DL transmission through the primary link, the transmission of the management frame to another STA may be delayed until the DL transmission is completed. The above-described problem may occur more seriously as the number of STAs connected to the AP increases and the amount of data traffic to be transmitted to the STAs increases.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0284"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> shows an example of the configuration of a primary link and a secondary link in a multi-link.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0285">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, a plurality of non-AP MLDs may be connected to AP MLD 1.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0286">AP MLD 1 may include AP 1 to AP 4.

In other words, STA 10 may be connected to link 4. That is, STA 10 may be connected to AP 4.</p><p id="p-0317" num="0291">For example, the AP MLD may support two primary links. For example, AP MLD 1 may allocate Link 1 and Link 3 as primary links.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0292">In this case, non-AP MLDs (for example, non-AP MLD 1, non-AP MLD 2, non-AP MLD 3, and non-AP MLD 4) connected to AP MLD 1 should be connected to at least one primary link in order to receive a beacon frame.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0293">In this example, STA1, STA 3, and STA 6 use Link 1 as a primary link, and STA 8 uses Link 3 as a primary link.

Link 2 and link 4, which are secondary links, can be used only for data frame transmission.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0294">For example, AP MLD 1 may transmit DL data to non-AP MLD 1 through Links 1 and 2. During the DL data transmission, a management frame for non-AP MLD 3 may occur in AP MLD 1. In this case, AP MLD 1 cannot transmit a management frame to non-AP MLD 3 because Link 1 is busy. Therefore, the transmission of the management frame may be delayed until the DL data transmission of Link 1 is completed (that is, until link 1 is in the idle state).</p><p id="p-0321" num="0295">As in the above-described example, when multiple STAs use one primary link at the same time, data load unbalancing may occur and transmission efficiency may be reduced. In particular, this problem may occur more frequently when multiple non-AP MLDs are connected to one AP MLD or when the AP MLD has only one primary link to reduce power consumption.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0296">Accordingly, in the following specification, technical features/embodiments for solving the above-described problems in an MLD environment supporting a multi-link may be described.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0297">In general, the primary link of the STA may be determined after the association or association process. Each STA can listen only through the Primary Link during the idle period. For this, the link designated as the primary link can always maintain the enablement state. Therefore, the primary link may consume more power than the secondary link.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0298">In addition, the primary link may be responsible for the management/control frame exchange of all STAs connected to the AP MLD. That is, more frame exchanges may occur in the primary link than in the secondary link. Therefore, the AP MLD should be able to reallocate the primary link to the STA for load balancing. In addition, the non-AP MLD must also be able to reassign its primary link for various reasons (link state change, data congestion prevention, etc.). In particular, in a Multi-Link Device (MLD) environment supporting a multi-link, it may be necessary to reassign the number of primary links based on data traffic or the OBSS transmission environment.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0299">In order to solve the above-described problem occurring in the multi-link, in the following specification, a technical feature in which the AP MLD or the non-AP MLD changes the primary link may be proposed. An AP MLD or a non-AP MLD may exchange various information (for example, element or field) to change the Primary Link, and the names of various information to be described below are an example, and could be configured in various ways. In addition, the names of the primary link and the secondary link are also an example, and may be configured in various ways. For example, the primary link may be referred to as an anchor link.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0300">As another example, the primary link may be referred to as a general link. The secondary link may be called a power-saving link. That is, an operation for changing a primary link is described below for the convenience of description, but the operation for changing a primary link could mean an operation for changing a general link into a power-saving link.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0301">Element and Field to Change a Primary Link</p><p id="p-0328" num="0302">According to an embodiment, elements and fields for changing the primary link may be newly proposed.
