A conventional signal transmission structure usually includes a circuit board (PCB) and a chip element and a connector that are installed on the circuit board. In a technical solution, as a core part, a chip is welded on a surface of the circuit board by using a BGA (Ball Grid Array). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a structure of a signal transmission structure in the conventional technology. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a signal inside the chip <b>1</b> is transmitted to a circuit board <b>2</b> by using a solder ball, and then is connected to elements such as another chip or a connector by using a wire <b>21</b> inside the circuit board, to implement signal transmission. In this solution, the chip <b>1</b> is connected to a connector by using the wire <b>21</b> inside the circuit board, and connectors are further connected to each other, to implement signal transmission between different chips.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the conventional technology, wiring needs to be performed inside the circuit board, which imposes a relatively high requirement for a level of the circuit board, and consequently costs of a product are relatively high. In addition, a loss in signal transmission through the wire inside the circuit board is large, which seriously restricts an increase in a signal transmission rate. Therefore, a new signal transmission solution needs to be proposed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This application provides a cable assembly, a signal transmission structure, and an electronic device, to increase a transmission rate of a signal transmission structure and reduce costs of the signal transmission structure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, this application provides a signal transmission structure. The signal transmission structure includes a circuit board, a chip, and a cable assembly, the chip is assembled on one side of the circuit board, and the cable assembly is assembled on the other side of the circuit board. The cable assembly includes a cable, and the circuit board includes a plurality of conductive holes. The chip is electrically connected to the cable of the cable assembly by using the conductive hole, to transmit a signal of the chip by using the cable. In this technical solution, wires do not need to be disposed in a large area inside the circuit board, so that a requirement for a loss-resistance property of a PCB board material is relatively low, that is, a requirement for a level of the PCB board material may be reduced, thereby reducing material costs. In addition, a signal transmission rate of the cable is much higher than a signal transmission rate of the wire inside the circuit board, which further facilitates long-distance signal transmission. Therefore, in this solution, not only costs of a product are reduced, but also an application range of a communications device is extended and high-speed performance of the product is improved.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To electrically connect the chip and the cable, the circuit board further includes a first pad and a second pad. The first pad is electrically connected to the chip, and the second pad is electrically connected to the cable. Two ends of the conductive hole are respectively electrically connected to the first pad and the second pad, to electrically connect the chip and the cable. Specifically, the first pad and the second pad may be connected in a plurality of manners. For example, the first pad and the second pad may be directly connected at the two ends of the conductive hole. Alternatively, a relatively short wire inside the circuit board is used to connect the first pad to one end of the conductive hole, the other end of the conductive hole is connected to the wire inside the circuit board, and the wire inside the circuit board is connected to the second pad, so as to form a conductive path to electrically connect the first pad and the second pad. In another technical solution, the first pad may be connected to a wire inside the circuit board, the wire inside the circuit board is connected to one end of the conductive hole, and the other end of the conductive hole is connected to the second pad, so as to form a conductive path to electrically connect the first pad and the second pad.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The cable assembly includes a base and a plurality of cable units installed on the base. The cable unit includes a cable and a grounding part. The grounding part is configured to be grounded. The cable may be configured to transmit a differential signal, and the grounding part may provide a reference voltage for the differential signal of the cable. A surface of the base has a conductive part that is grounded. A quantity of conductive parts is not limited, and there may be one or more conductive parts. The grounding part of the cable unit is electrically connected to the conductive part of the base, to ground the grounding part. Specifically, the grounding part is electrically connected to the conductive part. In this solution, the grounding part is configured to provide the reference voltage for the differential signal, which helps simplify a structure of the cable assembly and improve arrangement density of the cable units on the base of the cable assembly. The chip further includes a ground pin. The ground pin is electrically connected to the conductive part of the base by using the conductive hole, so that a ground network may be formed to shield a crosstalk signal of the chip. In this solution, the cable and the circuit board may be relatively fastened by using the base. Specifically, a manner of fastening the base and the circuit board is not limited, for example, the base and the circuit board may be fastened through threaded connection, bonding, welding, crimping, or riveting.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A specific form and structure of the conductive part of the base are not limited. For example, the base may be a metal base, and the base has conductivity. In this case, it may be considered that the conductive part is at least a part of a region of the base. Alternatively, the base may be an insulation base manufactured by using an insulation material, and the conductive part may be fastened on a surface of the insulation base, to be used as a grounding structure. It should be noted that when the base is insulated, the conductive part may be located on the surface of the base or another conductor inside the base is electrically connected to the grounding part.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A specific structure of the conductive part fastened on the surface of the base is also not limited. For example, a metal plate may be fastened on the surface of the base, and the metal plate may be used as the conductive part. The metal plate may further include a compressible contact, such as a stamping bump or a cut elastic pin. The metal plate may be electrically connected to the conductive hole of the circuit board by using the compressible contact, to be electrically connected to the ground pin of the chip. In this solution, a structure of the conductive part of the base is relatively simple and has the compressible contact that may be directly electrically connected to the conductive hole of the circuit board, so that a connection structure is also relatively simple.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another type of conductive part may be a conductive adhesive, a conductive foam, or the like, and is bonded to the surface of the base. The conductive part is elastic, so that when the base and the circuit board are fixedly installed, the conductive part may be directly electrically connected to the conductive hole, and a structure is relatively simple.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The cable unit further includes a cable and a signal connection terminal, and the cable includes a signal wire connected to the signal connection terminal in a one-to-one correspondence manner. The chip includes a signal pin, and the signal pin is electrically connected to the signal connection terminal by using the conductive hole, to electrically connect the chip and the cable, so as to transmit a signal of the chip by using the cable.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It should be noted that the cable includes at least two signal wires, or the cable may include one or more pair of signal wires.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">To implement reliable connection between the cable and the signal connection terminal, the cable unit further includes a cable fastening head. The cable fastening head is at a location at which the signal wire is connected to the signal connection terminal, and the cable fastening head is installed on a substrate, so that the cable unit can be installed on the substrate. Specifically, the cable fastening head may be disposed perpendicularly to the base, or the cable fastening head may be disposed to form a specified angle with the base, that is, the cable fastening head is disposed inclined to the base.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The cable fastening head may be further used as another conductor to connect the grounding part of the cable assembly to the conductive part of the base. Specifically, the cable fastening head may have a conductive structure, and the conductive structure is electrically connected to the conductive part of the base. Specifically, when the cable fastening head is installed on the base, the conductive structure of the cable fastening head is in contact with the base. When the base is a metal base, the base may be connected to the conductive part by using conductivity of the base. Alternatively, when the base is an insulation base, a conductive layer may be coated on an inner wall of an opening at which the cable fastening head is installed on the base, the conductive layer is in contact with and electrically connected to the conductive structure of the cable fastening head, and then the conductive layer is electrically connected to the conductive part of the base.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a specific technical solution, a specific structure of the grounding part is also not limited. Optionally, the cable may further include a grounding wire disposed in parallel with the signal wire, and the grounding wire may be used as the grounding part. The grounding wire does not need to protrude from the cable fastening head and can be directly electrically connected to the cable fastening head to be electrically connected to the conductive part of the base. Alternatively, the cable further includes a wrapping layer wrapped outside the signal wire. The wrapping layer includes a shielding layer electrically connected to the cable fastening head, and the shielding layer is electrically connected to the cable fastening head to be electrically connected to the conductive part of the base. In this solution, the grounding part of the cable is electrically connected to the base by using the cable fastening head, and the cable unit does not need to protrude from a fastening head of the base, which helps reduce space occupied by the cable unit on the base, thereby improving arrangement density of the cable units on the base.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Specifically, because the cable unit is electrically connected to the signal pin of the chip by using the conductive hole, the arrangement density of the cable units on base matches arrangement density of signal pins of the chip. In this case, the arrangement density of the cable arrangement units on the base is relatively high. The &#x201c;matching&#x201d; may be the same or may be slightly different.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a specific embodiment, the cable assembly may further include a ground connection terminal electrically connected to the conductive part of the base, and the ground connection terminal is electrically connected to the ground pin of the chip by using a through-hole of the circuit board. The signal connection terminal and the ground connection terminal of the cable assembly each may be an elastic pin, a spring pin, a solder ball, or a crimping pin. A user may select an appropriate terminal form based on a requirement.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a second aspect, this application further provides an electronic device. The electronic device includes the signal transmission structure in any of the foregoing technical solutions. In this technical solution, wires do not need to be disposed in a large area inside the circuit board in the signal transmission structure, so that a requirement for a loss-resistance property of a PCB board material is relatively low, that is, a requirement for a level of the PCB board material may be reduced, thereby reducing material costs. In addition, a signal transmission rate of the cable is much higher than a signal transmission rate of the wire inside the circuit board, which further facilitates long-distance signal transmission.

In the conventional technology, a chip is installed on a circuit board, and signal transmission between the chip and another structure usually needs to be implemented by using a wire located inside the circuit board. Wiring is performed inside the circuit board, which imposes a relatively high requirement for a level of the circuit board, and consequently costs of a product are relatively high. In addition, signal transmission efficiency of the wire inside the circuit board is relatively low, and there is a relatively high loss between wires, which may also cause a limited signal transmission rate.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Therefore, this application provides an electronic device. The electronic device includes a signal transmission structure in which wiring does not need to be performed inside a circuit board or an extremely short wire inside the circuit board is required. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a structure of a signal transmission structure according to an embodiment of this application. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the signal transmission structure includes a chip <b>1</b>, a circuit board <b>2</b> (PCB), and a cable assembly <b>3</b> (HSCGA, high speed cable grid array). The chip <b>1</b> is disposed on a surface on one side of the circuit board <b>2</b>, and the chip <b>1</b> has a plurality of pins <b>11</b>. The circuit board <b>2</b> has a plurality of conductive holes <b>22</b>, and the pin <b>11</b> of the chip <b>1</b> is electrically connected to a side that is of the conductive hole <b>22</b> and that is close to the chip <b>1</b>. The cable assembly <b>3</b> includes a cable <b>31</b>. The cable assembly <b>3</b> is assembled on a surface on a side that is of the circuit board <b>2</b> and that is away from the chip <b>1</b>. The cable <b>31</b> is electrically connected to a side that is of the conductive hole <b>22</b> and that is away from the chip <b>1</b>, so that the cable <b>31</b> is electrically connected to the chip <b>1</b>, and a signal of the chip <b>1</b> can be transmitted by using the cable <b>31</b>. In this solution, the cable <b>31</b> is connected to the pin <b>11</b> of the chip <b>1</b> to transmit the signal of the chip <b>1</b>. The conductive hole <b>22</b> can be disposed on the circuit board <b>2</b> to connect the chip <b>1</b> and the cable <b>31</b>, and wires do not need to be disposed in a large area inside the circuit board <b>2</b>. Wires do not need to be disposed in a large area inside the circuit board <b>2</b>, so that a requirement for a loss-resistance property of a PCB board material is relatively low, that is, a requirement for a level of the PCB board material may be reduced, thereby reducing material costs. For example, when a same use requirement is met, the circuit board <b>2</b> in the conventional technology needs to be formed by pressing 32 layers of sub-boards, where a thickness of the circuit board is about 4 mm. However, when the technical solution in this application is used, the circuit board <b>2</b> needs to be formed by pressing only 16 layers of sub-boards, where a thickness of the circuit board is about 2.5 mm. Therefore, when the technical solution provided in this application is used, costs of the circuit board are reduced by about 50%. In addition, a signal transmission rate of the cable <b>31</b> is much higher than a signal transmission rate of the wire inside the circuit board <b>2</b>. Specifically, in an application scenario of high-speed signal transmission, a transmission loss of the cable is only 25% of a loss of the wire inside the PCB. To be specific, when the chip <b>1</b> has a same driving capability and there is no driver gain compensation, in a same link length, a transmission rate that can be supported by the cable is about four times of a transmission rate of the wire inside the PCB. In addition, at a same transmission rate, a transmission distance of the cable is at least four times of a transmission distance of the wire inside the PCB. Therefore, in this solution, not only costs of a product are reduced, but also an application range of a communications device is extended and high-speed performance of the product is improved.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">It should be noted that in the embodiments of this application, &#x201c;electrical connection&#x201d; means that two structures may be conductive or a signal may be transmitted between the two structures. However, two electrically connected structures may not be directly physically connected, that is, there may be another conductive structure such as a conductive hole, a conducting wire, or a pad between the two electrically connected structures.

The relatively short wire <b>25</b> is disposed inside the circuit board <b>2</b>, so that the conductive hole <b>22</b> can be arranged appropriately based on a requirement to improve flexibility of arrangement of the conductive hole <b>22</b>, thereby reducing limitations on arrangement of the conductive hole <b>22</b> by the pin <b>11</b> in the chip <b>1</b>, and improving flexibility of arrangement of the cable <b>31</b> in the cable assembly <b>3</b>. The conductive hole <b>22</b> may be specifically an electroplated hole. The pin <b>11</b> of the chip <b>1</b> is connected to the first pad <b>23</b>, and the cable <b>31</b> is connected to the second pad <b>24</b>.
