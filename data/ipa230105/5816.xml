The trenches <b>13</b> extend along the thickness direction of the substrate <b>10</b> from the first surface <b>14</b> of the substrate <b>10</b>, so that the bottom surfaces of the trenches <b>13</b> are close to the second surface <b>15</b> of the substrate <b>10</b>, and the first surface <b>14</b> and the second surface <b>15</b> are arranged opposite to each other.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The number of trenches <b>13</b> on the substrate <b>10</b> is not specifically limited, and may be one, two or more. Taking the plane parallel to the substrate <b>10</b> as the cross section, cross-sectional shapes of the trenches <b>13</b> include, but are not limited to, circular, rectangular and diamond.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A variety of active devices (for example, transistors, diodes, etc.) may be arranged on the first surface <b>14</b> of the substrate <b>10</b>, and various electrical interconnection structures may also be formed between the active devices.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In step <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, a first auxiliary layer <b>20</b> is first deposited in the trenches <b>13</b> so that the first auxiliary layer <b>20</b> covers the bottom surfaces of the trenches <b>13</b>, and the first auxiliary layer <b>20</b> has a certain thickness. Then, a first conductive layer <b>30</b> is deposited above the first auxiliary layer <b>20</b> so that the first conductive layer <b>30</b> covers the first auxiliary layer <b>20</b>. That is, the first auxiliary layer <b>20</b> is located at the bottoms of the trenches <b>13</b>, and the first auxiliary layer <b>20</b> is located on the side close to the second surface <b>15</b> relative to the first conductive layer <b>30</b>. The material of the first conductive layer <b>30</b> can be a material with good conductivity, such as silver, copper, aluminum, etc.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In this embodiment, the first auxiliary layer <b>20</b> and the first conductive layer <b>30</b> may directly contact and connected with side wall surfaces of the trenches <b>13</b>, that is, no other structures are arranged between the first auxiliary layer <b>20</b> and side wall surfaces of the trenches <b>13</b> and between the first conductive layer <b>30</b> and side wall surfaces of the trenches <b>13</b>. Of course, it can be understood that in other embodiments, other structures such as barrier layer may be provided between the first auxiliary layer <b>20</b> and side wall surfaces of the trenches <b>13</b> and between the first conductive layer <b>30</b> and side wall surfaces of the trenches <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this embodiment, when there are two or more trenches <b>13</b> on the substrate <b>10</b>, the depths of different trenches <b>13</b> may be different. However, the distance between the contact surface of the first conductive layer <b>30</b> and the first auxiliary layer <b>20</b> in any trench <b>13</b> and the first surface <b>14</b> of the substrate <b>10</b> is smaller than the depths of any other trenches <b>13</b> to avoid grinding to the first conductive layer <b>30</b> when performing step S<b>103</b>, that is, thinning the substrate <b>10</b> on the second surface <b>15</b> of the substrate <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In step <b>103</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, a method of grinding the second surface <b>15</b> of the substrate <b>10</b> may be used to thin the substrate <b>10</b> until the first auxiliary layer <b>20</b> is exposed. Then, the top surface of the first auxiliary layer <b>20</b> is flush with the second surface <b>15</b>, and the surface of the first conductive layer <b>30</b> is flush with the first surface <b>14</b>. The trenches <b>13</b> form openings on both the first surface <b>14</b> and the second surface <b>15</b>, so that the trenches <b>13</b> form through holes penetrating the first surface <b>14</b> and the second surface <b>15</b> of the substrate <b>10</b>. During the grinding process of thinning the substrate <b>10</b>, part of the material of the substrate <b>10</b> close to the second surface <b>15</b> and part of the first auxiliary layer <b>20</b> are ground away at the same time, so as to avoid grinding to the first conductive layer <b>30</b>. When the material of the first auxiliary layer <b>20</b> is non-metallic material (such as silicon dioxide or silicon nitride, etc.), on the one hand, there is no case that the metal material contaminates the second surface of the substrate <b>10</b>; on the other hand, the ductility of the non-metallic material is weaker than the ductility of the metallic material, and the ductility of the first auxiliary layer <b>20</b> is more similar to the ductility of the substrate <b>10</b>. When part of the material of the substrate <b>10</b> and part of the first auxiliary layer <b>20</b> are ground away at the same time, the deformation of the first auxiliary layer <b>20</b> in the radial direction is very small, so that the extrusion of the first auxiliary layer <b>20</b> on the substrate <b>10</b> in the radial direction is small, and the probability of cracks on the second surface <b>15</b> of the substrate <b>10</b> is reduced, thereby improving the yield of TSV.
