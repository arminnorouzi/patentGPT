The damper helps to stabilize and balance the coil while vibrating. Also, a good damper will help optimize the mechanical compliance of the transducer suspension (Cms) of the vibration system and lower the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). Conventionally, a damper is designed flat with the peripheral and central bounding areas in the same or substantially the same level along the z-axis. (By z-axis is intended the front-to-rear axis of symmetry of the transducer. Such a flat design will take up a large amount of Z-room to avoid interference with a yoke side wall and a lead wire. It is generally desirable to provide a flat transducer with maintained performance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Document WO 88/08239 discloses a &#x201c;shallow&#x201d; loudspeaker with a generally conical damper. The conical shape of the damper enables a larger excursion without contact between the damper and the yoke. However, the conical damper is less stable than a flat, annular damper. Also, the design in WO88/08239 requires attachment of four components (diaphragm, cover, coil former and damper) along a narrow, ring-shaped intersection.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">GENERAL DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A first aspect of the present invention relates to an electro-acoustic transducer comprising a supporting frame with a substantially circular front edge, a magnet assembly mounted in the frame, the magnet assembly including an annular yoke surrounding a magnet, a diaphragm attached to the front edge of the supporting frame, a voice coil suspended by the diaphragm in a gap formed between the magnet and the annular yoke, the voice coil being axially movable with respect to the magnet, and an annular damper arranged to stabilize the diaphragm, the annular damper being formed with concentric corrugations, an outer perimeter of the annular damper being attached to the supporting frame. The transducer further comprises a damper holder having a substantially flat annular portion attached to the diaphragm, and a conical wall portion extending from an outer perimeter of the annular portion away from the diaphragm and radially out from the annular portion, so that the conical wall portion surrounds the voice coil, wherein an inner perimeter of the damper is attached to a rear region of the conical wall portion.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This aspect of the invention enables an ultra-slim loudspeaker design with maintained performance. The loudspeaker includes a voice coil, a cone (diaphragm), a surround member (frame), and a damper supporting the cone. According to the invention, a damper holder is arranged so that the damper is positioned separately from the voice coil and away from a yoke. The distance between the damper and the voice coil allows the damper to keep a distance from the yoke. The distance avoids contact between the damper and the yoke, allowing greater excursion of the cone during vibration, compared to conventional loudspeakers. The grater excursion allows the loudspeaker to be thinner than a conventional speaker for moving the same amount of air, thus improving low frequency response. Put differently, the invention enables making the transducer thinner at the same excursion level.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is noted that &#x201c;front&#x201d; herein refers to a sound emitting side of the transducer, while &#x201c;rear&#x201d; refers to the opposite side. So, for example, the diaphragm is arranged &#x201c;in front&#x201d; of the magnet and voice coil. An axis extending front-to-rear is referred to as the z-axis.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">By having an annular damper connected to a conical damper holder in this manner, all available space in the z-direction may be used for transducer excursion. Specifically, the voice coil can be lowered until the front portion of the yoke meets the annular portion of the damper holder.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The sloping form of the conical wall provides a suitable surface for attaching the inner rim of the annular damper.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the innermost corrugation of the annular damper has an open groove facing the diaphragm (and thus a ridge facing away from the diaphragm). This means that the annular damper has an inner rim sloping inwards towards the diaphragm. By designing the slope of the conical wall and the slope of the inner rim of the damper to be similar (or even the same), attachment of the damper to the damper holder is facilitated. This design also increases the space (z-room) between the damper and diaphragm.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The damper holder is preferably made of a different, and stiffer (less elastic), material than the damper itself, which is typically made of a deformable material. This ensures that the conical shape does not introduce non-linearities and instability to the damper. As an example, the damper holder can be made of non-elastic material such as paper, multilayer formed fiber, aluminum, etc. The damper can be made of a highly elastic material, such as rubber, foam or fibric material.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The conical wall of the damper holder is preferably provided with one or several openings, allowing air to escape.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, an end of a wire forming the voice coil extends between the damper holder and the voice coil former, and between the damper holder and the diaphragm, to a location on an outside of the conical wall. The transducer may further comprises a lead wire having a first end electrically connected to the coil wire end, and a second end electrically connected to an electric terminal in the frame.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">With this design, the damper holder serves to guide the coil wire along its surface to a location on the outside of the damper holder. The connection point of the lead wire and coil wire is thus located at a distance from the diaphragm, to avoid interfering with the movement of the diaphragm.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The first end of the lead wire may be soldered to the coil wire end on the outside of the conical wall. No soldering is therefore required on the diaphragm, which improves performance and extends the life-time of the soldering joint. The conical wall provides a suitable surface for soldering, especially when the damper holder is made of a stiff material, such as paper.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The diaphragm may be substantially flat, in which case the transducer may be referred to as a flat transducer.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Other advantages over conventional loudspeaker technology are presented in the drawings and corresponding descriptions.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention will be described in more detail with reference to the appended drawings, showing currently preferred embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> illustrate a conventional speaker design.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example implementation of a transducer according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref> are perspective views of a transducer according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a cross section of the transducer in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a conventional speaker design. A voice coil <b>1</b> is suspended inside a yoke <b>2</b>. A damper <b>3</b> is connected to the voice coil. Accordingly, excursion E of the voice coil and cone is limited by the distance D between the damper <b>3</b> and the yoke <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows another example of a prior art design. The transducer <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> has a frame <b>21</b> with a (typically circular) front edge <b>22</b>. The back side of the frame <b>21</b> supports a magnet assembly <b>23</b>, including an annular yoke <b>24</b> and a central pole piece <b>25</b> with a permanent magnet <b>26</b>. An annular diaphragm <b>27</b> has an outer suspension <b>27</b><i>a </i>attached to the edge <b>22</b> and an inner perimeter <b>27</b><i>b </i>attached to a voice coil former <b>30</b> on which a coil wire <b>31</b> is wound. The voice coil <b>30</b>, <b>31</b> is stabilized by a damper <b>32</b> (or &#x201c;spider&#x201d;) in an air gap <b>33</b> formed between the yoke <b>24</b> and the pole piece <b>25</b>. A dust cover <b>34</b> is arranged in front of the voice coil former <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">An end <b>35</b> of the coil wire extends between the diaphragm <b>27</b> and the voice coil former <b>30</b>, and then through a gap formed between the dust cover <b>34</b> and the diaphragm <b>27</b>, and ends on top of the diaphragm <b>27</b>. A lead wire <b>36</b> extends through a hole <b>37</b> in the diaphragm <b>27</b>. The lead wire has one end <b>36</b><i>a </i>connected to an electrical terminal <b>38</b> in the frame <b>21</b>, and another end <b>36</b><i>b </i>connected, e.g. soldered, to the coil wire end <b>35</b>. The solder joint is typically covered by a glue.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows, if we want to reduce the total height of the transducer <b>20</b> and at the same time keep excursion E as large as possible, we need to reduce the height of the voice coil former <b>30</b>, but it becomes hard to attach both diaphragm <b>27</b> and damper <b>32</b> to the voice coil former <b>30</b> when this also needs to be reduced in size.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example implementation of an ultra-slim transducer design. The techniques disclosed in this specification include a new design with a damper with special shape to connect cone but still keep the excursion space between cone to yoke, make full use of Z-height. For the ultra-thin transducer it will help to set a larger magnet system inside and more space for the excursion to improve the performance.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>-<b>7</b></figref> illustrate an example implementation of an ultra-slim transducer design.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Similar to the transducer <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the transducer <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>7</b></figref> has a frame <b>71</b> with a front edge <b>72</b>, a magnet assembly <b>73</b> with a yoke <b>74</b>, and a voice coil including a coil wire <b>75</b> wound on a coil former <b>76</b>. The diaphragm of the transducer <b>70</b> includes a rigid cover <b>77</b> attached to the front of the coil former, and an annular suspension <b>78</b> having its outer perimeter <b>78</b><i>a </i>attached to the edge <b>72</b>, and its inner perimeter <b>78</b><i>b </i>attached to the cover <b>77</b>. It is noted that the transducer alternatively could have a dust cover which is separate from the diaphragm (e.g. like in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the transducer <b>70</b> includes a damper holder <b>80</b>. The damper holder <b>80</b> has the shape of a truncated cone, with a generally flat annular portion <b>81</b> attached to the inside of the diaphragm, and a conical wall portion <b>82</b> extending away from the diaphragm and radially outwards from the annular portion. The conical wall portion thus surrounds the front part of the yoke <b>74</b> (i.e. upper part of the yoke in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The transducer <b>70</b> further includes an annular damper <b>83</b>, formed with a plurality of concentric corrugations <b>84</b>. The inner perimeter of the damper <b>83</b> is glued on (or otherwise attached) to the rear portion of conical wall portion <b>82</b> (i.e. lower portion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). The damper holder <b>80</b> thereby eliminates the constraint of excursion between the diaphragm and yoke.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The flat annular portion <b>81</b> of the damper holder enables reliable attachment, e.g. by glue, to the diaphragm. The annular portion <b>81</b> extends radially beyond the front part of the yoke <b>74</b>, so as to avoid interference between the conical wall portion <b>82</b> and the yoke <b>74</b> during transducer working. The conical wall portion <b>82</b> is provided with openings <b>85</b>, to allow passage of air.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The innermost region <b>86</b> of the annular portion <b>82</b> is bent, so as to form a triangular groove <b>87</b> next to the coil former <b>76</b>. The groove may hold glue, thereby making the bind between voice coil former <b>76</b> and the damper holder <b>80</b>/cover <b>77</b> more reliable.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The damper holder is preferably made of hardness paper, but other materials with a certain stiffness may also be used.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Damper holder <b>80</b> can be manufactured in one procedure and the damper <b>83</b> can be pasted on the slope surface of the conical wall portion <b>82</b> of the damper holder <b>83</b> by using a conventional jig. A conventional producing process may thus be used by the cone paper manufacturer, so that the design in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>7</b></figref> does not add much cost compared to the traditional design in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It is noted that the gradient of the conical wall portion <b>82</b>, as well as the width of the annular portion <b>81</b> and size of bent region <b>86</b> can be changed to adapt to a different transducer.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The innermost corrugation <b>84</b> of the damper <b>83</b> has an open side facing the front of the transducer (i.e. upwards in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>)&#x2014;and thus a ridge facing the rear (i.e. downwards in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). This is sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;down rolled&#x201d; structure. As a consequence, the inner edge <b>86</b> of the damper has a slope which corresponds to the slope of the conical wall portion <b>82</b>.
