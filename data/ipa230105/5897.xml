For example, the light emitting element LD may be implemented as an emission stack (or also referred to as &#x201c;stack&#x201d;) formed by successively stacking the first conductive semiconductor layer <b>11</b>, the active layer <b>12</b>, and the second conductive semiconductor layer <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The light emitting element LD may extend in a direction. If the direction in which the light emitting element LD extends is defined as a longitudinal direction, the light emitting element LD may have one end (or a lower end) and a remaining end (or an upper end or another end) in the longitudinal direction. One of the first and second semiconductor layers <b>11</b> and <b>13</b> may be disposed on the one end of the light emitting element LD, and the other one of the first and second semiconductor layers <b>11</b> and <b>13</b> may be disposed on the remaining end of the light emitting element LD.

The size of the light emitting element LD may be changed to meet conditions (or design conditions) of a lighting device or a self-emissive display device to which the light emitting element LD is applied.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The first semiconductor layer <b>11</b> may include, for example, at least one n-type semiconductor layer. For instance, the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b> may include an n-type semiconductor layer which includes any one semiconductor material of InAlGaN, GaN, AlGaN, InGaN, AlN, and InN and is doped with a first conductive dopant (or an n-type dopant) such as Si, Ge, or Sn. However, the material of the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b> is not limited to thereto, and the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b> may be formed of (or include) various other materials. The first semiconductor layer <b>11</b> may include, in the longitudinal direction of the light emitting element LD, an upper surface that contacts the active layer <b>12</b>, and a lower surface exposed to the outside. The lower surface of the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b> may correspond to the one end (or the lower end) of the light emitting element LD.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The active layer <b>12</b> may be disposed on the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b> and have a single or multiple quantum well structure. For example, in case that the active layer <b>12</b> has a multiple quantum well structure, the active layer <b>12</b> may be formed by periodically repeatedly stacking a barrier layer, a stain reinforcing layer, and a well layer which are provided as a unit. The stain reinforcing layer may have a lattice constant less than that of the barrier layer so that strain, e.g., compressive strain, to be applied to the well layer may be further reinforced. However, the structure of the active layer <b>12</b> is not limited to that of the foregoing embodiment.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The active layer <b>12</b> may emit light having a wavelength ranging from about 400 nm to about 900 nm and use a double hetero structure. In an embodiment, a clad layer (not shown) doped with a conductive dopant may be formed over or under the active layer <b>12</b> in the longitudinal direction of the light emitting element LD. For example, the cladding layer may be formed of (or include) an AlGaN layer or an InAlGaN layer. In an embodiment, material such as AlGaN or InAlGaN may be used to form the active layer <b>12</b>, and various other materials may be used to form the active layer <b>12</b>. The active layer <b>12</b> may include a first surface which contacts the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b>, and a second surface which contacts the second semiconductor layer <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">If an electric field having a predetermined voltage or more is applied to the opposite ends of the light emitting element LD, the light emitting element LD may emit light by coupling of electron-hole pairs in the active layer <b>12</b>. Since light emission of the light emitting element LD may be controlled based on the foregoing principle, the light emitting element LD may be used as a light source (or a light emitting source) of various light emitting devices as well as a pixel of the display device.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The second semiconductor layer <b>13</b> may be disposed on the second surface of the active layer <b>12</b> and include a semiconductor layer having a type different from that of the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b>. For example, the second semiconductor layer <b>13</b> may include at least one p-type semiconductor layer. For instance, the second semiconductor layer <b>13</b> may include a p-type semiconductor layer which includes any one semiconductor material of InAlGaN, GaN, AlGaN, InGaN, AlN, and InN and is doped with a second conductive dopant (or a p-type dopant) such as Mg, Zn, Ca, Sr, or Ba. However, the material for forming the second semiconductor layer <b>13</b> is not limited thereto, and the second semiconductor layer <b>13</b> may be formed of (or include) various other materials. The second semiconductor layer <b>13</b> may include, in the longitudinal direction of the light emitting element LD, a lower surface that contacts the second surface of the active layer <b>12</b>, and an upper surface exposed to the outside.

For example, the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b> may have a thickness greater than that of the second semiconductor layer <b>13</b> in the longitudinal direction of the light emitting element LD. Hence, the active layer <b>12</b> of the light emitting element LD may be disposed closer to the upper surface of the second semiconductor layer <b>13</b> than to the lower surface of the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Although the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b> and the second semiconductor layer <b>13</b> each is formed of a single layer, the disclosure is not limited thereto. In an embodiment, depending on the material of the active layer <b>12</b>, the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b> and the second semiconductor layer <b>13</b> each may further include one or more layers, for example, a clad layer and/or a tensile strain barrier reducing (TSBR) layer. The TSBR layer may be a strain relief layer of which a lattice structure is disposed between other semiconductor layers so that the strain relief layer functions as a buffer layer to reduce a difference in lattice constant. Although the TSBR layer may be formed of a p-type semiconductor layer such as p-GaInP, p-AlInP, or p-AlGaInP, the disclosure is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In an embodiment, the light emitting element LD may further include a contact electrode (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;first contact electrode&#x201d;) disposed on the second semiconductor layer <b>13</b>, as well as including the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b>, the active layer <b>12</b>, and the second semiconductor layer <b>13</b>. Furthermore, in an embodiment, the light emitting element LD may further include another contact electrode (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;second contact electrode&#x201d;) disposed on one end of the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Each of the first and second contact electrodes may be an ohmic contact electrode, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. In an embodiment, each of the first and second contact electrodes may be a Schottky contact electrode. The first and second contact electrodes may include conductive material. For example, the first and second contact electrodes may include opaque metal such as chromium (Cr), titanium (Ti), aluminum (Al), gold (Au), nickel (Ni), and oxides or alloys thereof, which are used alone or in combination, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. In an embodiment, the first and second contact electrodes may also include transparent conductive oxides such as indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), zinc oxide (ZnO), indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO), and indium tin zinc oxide (ITZO).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Materials included in the first and second contact electrodes may be equal to or different from each other. The first and second contact electrodes may be substantially transparent or translucent. Therefore, light generated from the light emitting element LD may pass through the first and second contact electrodes and then be emitted outside the light emitting element LD. In some embodiments, in case that light generated from the light emitting element LD is emitted outside the light emitting element LD through an area other than the opposite ends of the light emitting element LD rather than passing through the first and second contact electrodes, the first and second contact electrodes may include opaque metal.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In an embodiment, the light emitting element LD may further include an insulating film <b>14</b>. However, in some embodiments, the insulating film <b>14</b> may be omitted, or may be provided to cover only some of the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b>, the active layer <b>12</b>, and the second semiconductor layer <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The insulating film <b>14</b> may prevent the active layer <b>12</b> from short-circuiting due to contact with conductive material except the first and second semiconductor layers <b>13</b>. Furthermore, the insulating film <b>14</b> may minimize a surface defect of the light emitting element LD, thus enhancing the lifespan and emission efficiency of the light emitting element LD. In case that light emitting elements LD are disposed in close contact with each other, the insulating film <b>14</b> may prevent undesired short circuit between the light emitting elements LD. It is not limited whether the insulating film <b>14</b> is provided or not, so long as the active layer <b>12</b> may be prevented from short-circuiting with external conductive material.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The insulating film <b>14</b> may be provided to enclose an overall outer circumferential surface of the emission stack including the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b>, the active layer <b>12</b>, and the second semiconductor layer <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Although in the foregoing embodiment the insulating film <b>14</b> has been described as enclosing the entirety of the respective outer circumferential surfaces of the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b>, the active layer <b>12</b>, and the second semiconductor layer <b>13</b>, the disclosure is not limited thereto.

The light emitting element LD may be fabricated by a surface treatment process. For example, the light emitting element LD may be surface-treated so that, in case that light emitting elements LD are mixed with a fluidic solution (or solvent) and then supplied to each pixel area (e.g., an emission area of each pixel or an emission area of each sub-pixel), the light emitting elements LD may be evenly distributed rather than unevenly aggregating in the solution.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">A light emitting unit (or light emitting part or light emitting device) including the light emitting element LD described above may be used in various types of devices including a display device which requires a light source.
