The system generally includes the following components:</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">(1) Integrated Medical device (abbreviated as &#x201c;IMD&#x201d;): Integrated Bio-sensors in an embedded system environment to create composite data acquisition/Storge system for medical parameters. Data Capture module consisting of Inter-operability of different sensors and Internal DS.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">(2) A Server, for control and management of data capture process.

The re-use of same software component as local and/or cloud level servers gives extreme flexibility in creating a deep hierarchical network of servers. The configuration of the cloud-based servers always contains the network address and credentials to connect to a parent server, if it is there.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">At an exemplary situation, such as a hospital facility, let the health data capturing devices <b>102</b> may be a chair <b>202</b>. Therefore, a number of chairs <b>202</b> can be connected through a LAN to a local server <b>204</b> (an instance of cloud server, deployed locally). The server aggregates health data from all the chairs <b>202</b> in the hospital and store the data locally. It does not need any internet connectivity, as all the components are connected over LAN.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Similarly, a number of such servers from different medical establishments or different locations can connect to a centrally located cloud-hosted server <b>206</b> (another instance of cloud server, deployed on cloud). This cloud-based server <b>206</b> then can aggregate data from all hospital servers centrally. The local server <b>204</b> and the cloud-based server <b>206</b> can communicate over a communication channel <b>208</b>, which may be wired or wireless or both, such as including and not limiting to Ethernet, WiFi, WLAN and the like.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In another embodiment, the re-use of same component facilitates introduction of another layer in the hierarchy seamlessly. For example, the hospital servers <b>204</b> may be configured to connect to a district level server <b>208</b>, and then the district level server <b>208</b> connects to the central cloud server <b>206</b>. On the other hand, if the system administrator decides to remove the district servers <b>208</b> for some specific district, he can change the parent server ID of all the individual hospital servers <b>204</b>, which are reporting to the specific district server <b>208</b>, to the cloud server's <b>206</b> network ID.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">This flexibility and on-demand hierarchy alteration is possible due to (a) Servers configuration only includes the parent server address, if any; (b) The server components in each level of hierarchy are all identical instances of cloud servers <b>206</b>; and (c) Multi-system unique identifier (MSUID) mechanism, used for identification of the subject.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In an embodiment, in the Multi-system unique identifier (MSUID) mechanism, the IUTs or the register containing the details of the subject themselves and the system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> provides them with a unique identification which is uniquely associated with the IUT along with all the tests and diagnosis related to the IUT. The IUTs are identified with their unique identification all over the number of cloud servers, and hence, remotely to all the remote devices and facilities. The IUTs register themselves at the lowest level (i.e. the data capturing device <b>102</b>) of the network setup. However, the captured health data from different locations is aggregated in hierarchy of servers. The system allows</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">a. Referrals: an IUT may be referred or transferred to another hospital/super specialty facility; or any other medical establishment or health like that of a gym or any health outlet.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">b. Independence of location: The IUT may present himself/herself in any of the data capturing devices <b>102</b> in the same hospital or a different hospital.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In both the cases above, the system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> ensures that the IUT is uniquely identified across hierarchy. Each IUT, during registration uses one of the Government/authorized authority issued identification document bearing an identifier, for example (in India) Aadhar card, Passport, voter ID card, PAN card, Driving license, etc. Further, the system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> encodes the type and identifier in a combined field to form a Multi-system unique identifier (MSUID). The MSUID is mapped to a local unique identifier, which encodes the identifier of the data capturing devices <b>102</b> ID.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In an embodiment, in a parent cloud server-based instance, this (MSUID, local data capturing devices <b>102</b> ID) tuple is converted to a globally unique identifier (UID) for IUT. The UID is internally maintained and mapped to all data and interactions pertaining to the IUT. Only the central server <b>206</b>, which does not have any parent (i.e. the central server <b>206</b> in cloud) can have all data aggregated. All other servers in the hierarchy fetch data on-demand. The synchronization process between the components in the hierarchy ensures the matching of MSUID (without the local device identified) to ensure unique identification of each IUT. Hence, in an exemplary working embodiment, medical test involves different methods like sensing bio-signals (ECG, NIBP, Temperature, Auscultatory heart and lung sounds, SpO2, measuring respiratory volumes etc.), collecting bio-samples (blood and Urine samples), as well as interactive responses from IUT (Vision testing audiometry, Muscle strength, cognitive tests, etc.) The results of the medical tests are shown immediately as real time local display to the IUT as visual feedback, and also to an operator for correct sequencing of operations. The collected data is visible in a composite printable form to IUT as well as any doctor (locally available within the same premises&#x2014;local doctor&#x2014;LDOC), with a doctor's device display panel (<b>102</b>), and connected in the local LAN. The data may be then packetized, encrypted and stored in local database with index. The collected data is synchronized with the central database (available on cloud) through a proprietary hand-shaking command-response method. All communications are encrypted, such that data on the move are secure. An IUT can use any of his IMD in the network. Patient data transportability is achieved through the multi-system unique identifier mechanism (MSUID), explained later. Specialty doctors (SDOC) from geographically dispersed location can access individual's data through proper authentication mechanism (unique username, password and OTP). All accesses are logged, which is notifiable to the concerned individuals. Each IUT can also view his/her own data from web interface, through proper authentication mechanism (unique username, password and OTP). Each IUT is registered to the system, where unique identifier code for the user is created. The unique identifier code is synchronized with globally unique identifier through synchronization process, with the central server in cloud.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary environment showing a flowchart of a method of monitoring, recording and sharing health related, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.

The systems <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> implement a web-based architecture to a data capturing embedded device (such as the device <b>102</b>, <b>202</b>) environment. It facilitates modularity, loose coupling and flexibility to change presentation, processing and device independence in the whole system. It has the following features:</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Follows MVC (Model&#x2014;view&#x2014;Controller) architecture</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Navigation Service: This sub-system manages test performance sequence</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Internal Data store Service: a gateway and acts as a repository for all test definitions and buffers. It can be accessed by other modules through a service. During startup this module triggers all test parameters to be updated from master database. It creates and pushes commands to a command list for DataCapture module.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Database service: responsible for communicating with structured and unstructured databases</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Controller&#x2014;service used by the user interface for communicating with the server. All are configured as web service calls.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Further, advantageously, the present invention provides the data capturing devices <b>102</b>, <b>202</b> which are capable of communicating with different sensors in various communication/data exchange protocols. The communication/data exchange protocols may include and not restrict USB, Analog Audio channels, Wired Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth and the like.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">All communication protocols are made as independent components. The communication protocols end-points are used by Input unit in Data Capturing device <b>102</b>. Internal database stores the mapping between specific tests, its corresponding device (and data pattern) and the communication protocol (along with connection parameters) to be used.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">As a further advantage of the present invention, all devices are implemented as separate service. Even interactive tests (e.g. vision test, audiometry, memory and cognitive tests) are modeled as separate services.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The test configurations, which include corresponding devices and data path parameters are stored in an internal database. The internal databases may include cloud-based database, or the memory <b>114</b> of the device <b>192</b>. The process for monitoring and recording the health related data of an IUT starts with an Internal Data store setting up the devices, such as the devices <b>102</b>, <b>202</b> with the sensors <b>104</b> and the user devices <b>106</b>, for initialization, setting up command list (cmdList) and response List (data), separate for each device <b>102</b> and the user device <b>106</b>. The system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> allocates Buffer in the memory <b>114</b>, separate for each thread of execution, to provide insulation between tests and to avoid interference. The Controller which may be the first user device <b>106</b> or the processor <b>112</b> of the data capturing device <b>102</b> invokes of test Stop/Done command, for each of the tests selected by the user/operator. The Controller which may be the first user device <b>106</b> or the processor <b>112</b> of the data capturing device <b>102</b> communicating with each other.

Data Capture device <b>102</b> or module (running as a separate process) picks up the commands from cmd List and routes to the corresponding device or sensors instance (running as different services) for acting. The device action includes starting of the test, collection of results (data) and stopping the corresponding device. Implementation as separate service makes the devices independent of each other.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">When Data Capture module or the data capturing device <b>102</b> sends data to the first user device <b>106</b>, or to an application running on the first user device <b>106</b>, it invokes a Data Parser to parse the Raw Data recorded. The interpretation of data pattern is defined in each test definition, as separate service class implementation. A Data Sync sub-system performs data synchronization between the application running on the first user device <b>106</b> and the Data Capture module or the device <b>102</b>. It runs two threads for (i) uploading device data to the application running on the first user device <b>106</b> (ii) get command list from the application running on the first user device <b>106</b>. The application module calls specific Application program interface (API) to get the data for further processing and display at the first user device <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Further, the system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> also implements for data storage as both structured and unstructured data. The results from the tests running by the data capturing device <b>102</b> consist of both structured and unstructured databases.
