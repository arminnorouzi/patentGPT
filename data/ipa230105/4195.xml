Some mobile computing devices such as laptops or hybrid 2-in-1 tablet-laptop systems have elements that are foldable at a hinge to allow for switching between configurations for use and storage. In implementations, the closeable nature of the computing device protects certain interior elements of the computing device. In implementations in which the computing device has a kickstand or other support, a similar hinge may be used.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A trend in mobile device development has been towards reducing the size and/or thickness of mobile devices. The presence of a hinge can limit the minimum thickness of a mobile computing device. For example, in some systems, the hinge has elements between panels that are meant to rotate about the hinge. This can require a gap as thick as the hinge separating the two surfaces of the panels. Further, the thickness of a hinge itself may be greater than either of the two panels, making the requisite thickness greater than that of the combined panels. Making portions of the hinge largely recessed within the panels themselves may reduce the overall thickness of the mobile device.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In mobile computing devices, having a panel rotate with respect to another panel about an axis within a hinge or within one of the panels may limit the range of rotation of the panels relative to one another. In one implementation, a hinge that creates a virtual pivot axis outside of the hinge and/or the panels can allow for folding to an extent that the panels can have surfaces that touch one another (such as by having surface panels that touch one another) in a closed configuration.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Hinged elements of computing devices can provide friction at certain axes and positions to allow for multiple adjustable and fixable positions of panels relative to one another. For example, the panels coupled about the hinge which rotate relative to one another may be positionable at certain angles relative to one another, and frictional rotatable couplings (e.g., ones using friction pins within couplings) can maintain that position until sufficient force is supplied to change the relative positions of the panels. Using more than one friction pin can improve the range of angles over which the panels can be fixed in positions relative to one another.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The technology disclosed herein may solve technical problems associated with providing a hinge with a wide range of rotation angles in a small device. The disclosed features function independently and/or in synergistic cooperation to solve the technical problems. For example, using, without limitation, one or more of conformal elements, motion of multiple components that can share dimensional space in certain configurations, and a virtual pivot axis of rotation of components may provide the wide range of hinge rotation in a small form factor.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate an elevated view of an example hinge device system <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B in an open configuration.

Although only one slot <b>150</b> is visibly illustrated, there may be a same and an opposing slot within each of the slidable couplings <b>114</b>, <b>124</b>.

The virtual pivot axis <b>195</b> being outside of the hinge device system <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B may facilitate a fuller relative rotation of panels <b>140</b> and <b>130</b> without interference from components. Also, it may facilitate a distance or gap between the panels <b>130</b>, <b>140</b> to allow attachment of additional surface panels between the panels <b>130</b>, <b>140</b> that can close on one another.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The hinge device system <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B further includes a first side support section <b>160</b> and a second side support section <b>162</b>. The first side support section <b>160</b> may be on an opposite side of the central support section <b>106</b> relative to the second side support section <b>162</b>. In one implementation, one or more of the first side support section <b>160</b> and the second side support section <b>162</b> are operable to couple the first panel <b>130</b> to the second panel <b>140</b> on opposing sides of the central support section <b>106</b> by slip fit.

In an implementation, the first side support section <b>160</b> and the second side support section <b>162</b> are not directly coupled to the central support section <b>106</b>, which may allow for easier manufacturing of the hinge device system <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B.

The complementary portions may have male and female complementary components to facilitate the slip fit coupling. In an implementation, the side support sections <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> have proximal complementary components on sides proximal to the central support section <b>106</b> and have the same or different distal complementary components on sides distal from the central support section <b>106</b>. In an implementation, the distal complementary portions couple the side support sections <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> to the first panel <b>130</b>, by slip fit. The proximal complementary portions may couple the side support sections <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> to the second panel <b>140</b> by slip fit. In an implementation, the side support sections <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> are coupled to the first panel <b>130</b> and the second panel <b>130</b> by plain bearing fittings. Slip fit couplings may synergistically provide advantages of a largely conformal coupling and guidance for rotation in a virtual pivot axis.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The proximal complementary portions may oppose the distal complementary components to prevent decoupling of the side support sections <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> from the first panel <b>130</b> and the second panel <b>140</b>.

For example, the side support sections <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> may have elements that conform to a part of the central support section cradle that is adjacent to the central support section <b>106</b> and may surround the part of the central support section cradle. The complementary elements may include protrusions and complementary recesses that form tracks or channels that direct one or more of the central support section <b>106</b> and the side support sections <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> to rotate substantially about the virtual pivot axis <b>195</b>. Using complementary portions may reduce the thickness of the hinge device system <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B and may improve ease of manufacturing.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Portions of the central support section <b>106</b> and the side support sections <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> may be hemicylindrical (or a sliced-cylinder or elliptically cylindrical) and/or conformal to a recessed portion of the interior of the central support section cradle. The term, sliced-cylinder is herein defined as a shape that is less than half of a cylinder that would result from cutting a majority of a cylinder away at a plane at a consistent radial position from the center of the cylinder along a length of the cylinder with the plane being parallel to a central axis of the cylinder (the central axis may be defined by the center of each circular cross-section of the cylinder). The cradle may be conformally shaped to receive and/or may have a surface portion that in an open configuration of the hinge device system <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B is substantially flush with one or more of the central support section <b>106</b> and the side support sections <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>.

In implementations, the central support cradle is composed of two parts on opposite sides of the central support section <b>106</b>. In an implementation, the first and second slidable couplings <b>114</b>, <b>124</b> may limit an extent to which the central support section <b>106</b> can rotate, preventing one or more of the first panel <b>130</b> and the second panel <b>140</b> from decoupling from the side support sections <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> (e.g., by the one or more of the first panel <b>130</b> and the second panel <b>140</b> sliding out of a slip fit of complementary portions). In an implementation, one or more of the first side support section <b>160</b>, second side support section <b>162</b>, the first panel <b>130</b>, and the second panel <b>140</b> have hard stops to prevent rotation of fitted couplings to the point that the fittings decouple.

A comparison of the implementations illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates that surface panels <b>273</b>, <b>271</b> can be accommodated by a gap between panels <b>230</b> and <b>240</b> when the hinge device system <b>200</b> closes. This gap may reflect a distance between rotatable couplings <b>212</b>, <b>222</b> on a central support section <b>206</b>.
