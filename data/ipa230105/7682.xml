Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, and/or the like). Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems, and Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE/LTE-Advanced is a set of enhancements to the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wireless communication network may include a number of base stations (BSs) that can support communication for a number of user equipment (UEs). A user equipment (UE) may communicate with a base station (BS) via the downlink and uplink. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the BS to the UE, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the UE to the BS. As will be described in more detail herein, a BS may be referred to as a Node B, a gNB, an access point (AP), a radio head, a transmit receive point (TRP), a New Radio (NR) BS, a 5G Node B, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different user equipment to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. New Radio (NR), which may also be referred to as 5G, is a set of enhancements to the LTE mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). NR is designed to better support mobile broadband Internet access by improving spectral efficiency, lowering costs, improving services, making use of new spectrum, and better integrating with other open standards using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with a cyclic prefix (CP) (CP-OFDM) on the downlink (DL), using CP-OFDM and/or SC-FDM (e.g., also known as discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM)) on the uplink (UL), as well as supporting beamforming, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology, and carrier aggregation. However, as the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase, there exists a need for further improvements in LTE and NR technologies. Preferably, these improvements should be applicable to other multiple access technologies and the telecommunication standards that employ these technologies.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some aspects, a method of wireless communication, performed by a primary user equipment (UE), may include transmitting, on a sidelink, information indicating a set of sidelink random access configurations corresponding to a set of uplink random access configurations; receiving, on the sidelink and from a secondary UE, a random access signal based at least in part on a selected sidelink random access configuration of the set of sidelink random access configurations, wherein the selected sidelink random access configuration corresponds to a selected uplink random access configuration of the set of uplink random access configurations; and selectively performing a random access procedure in accordance with the selected uplink random access configuration.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some aspects, a method of wireless communication, performed by a secondary UE, may include determining a selected uplink random access configuration for a random access procedure; receiving, on a sidelink and from a primary UE, system information indicating a sidelink random access configuration corresponding to the selected uplink random access configuration; and transmitting, on the sidelink and to the primary UE, a random access signal indicated by the sidelink random access configuration.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some aspects, a method of wireless communication, performed by a base station, may include receiving a random access signal associated with a random access procedure, wherein the random access signal is associated with a group of random access preambles; determining a repetition scheme for a transmission of the base station based at least in part on the random access signal; and performing the transmission using the repetition scheme.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some aspects, a primary UE for wireless communication may include memory and one or more processors operatively coupled to the memory.

For example, the primary UE <b>120</b> may provide the one or more sidelink SIBs on the sidelink connection between the primary UE <b>120</b> and the secondary UE <b>120</b>. A sidelink SIB may identify one or more sidelink random access configurations. For example, a sidelink random access configuration may identify a sidelink random access preamble, a sidelink RACH occasion, and/or an association of the sidelink random access preamble and/or the sidelink RACH occasion with an SSB or an uplink random access configuration. In some aspects, the primary UE <b>120</b> may provide respective sidelink random access configurations corresponding to a plurality of uplink random access configurations. In some aspects, a sidelink random access configuration may identify a time-frequency resource configuration for use by the secondary UE <b>120</b> to transmit or receive subsequent communications with the primary UE <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some aspects, the information described above as being provided in a sidelink SIB may be provided to the secondary UE <b>120</b> by other means, such as a sidelink RRC configuration and/or the like. Additionally, or alternatively, such information may be pre-configured, such as by way of a wireless telecommunication standard.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The sidelink random access preamble may be configured to use a lower transmit power than an uplink random access preamble. For example, the sidelink random access preamble, relative to the uplink random access preamble, may have fewer possible preamble sequences, a smaller subcarrier spacing, shorter preamble sequences, a smaller cyclic shift, and/or the like. Thus, the secondary UE <b>120</b> may conserve power and reduce complexity associated with random access by using a lower-power or lower-complexity random access preamble to trigger the primary UE <b>120</b> to perform random access.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown by reference number <b>415</b>, the secondary UE <b>120</b> may select an SSB (e.g., an uplink random access configuration associated with the SSB). For example, the secondary UE <b>120</b> may select the SSB for performance of the RACH procedure using an uplink random access configuration (e.g., a RACH occasion and random access preamble) associated with the SSB. In some aspects, the selection of the SSB may be referred to as selecting a preferred SSB or a selected SSB.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some aspects, the primary UE <b>120</b> may select an SSB. For example, the primary UE <b>120</b> may select a preferred SSB or selected SSB. In some aspects, the primary UE <b>120</b> may perform the operations indicated by reference number <b>430</b> only if the selected SSB of the primary UE <b>120</b> matches the selected SSB of the secondary UE <b>120</b>. In some aspects, the primary UE <b>120</b> may perform the operations indicated by reference number <b>430</b> even though the selected SSBs of the primary UE <b>120</b> and the secondary UE <b>120</b> do not match. For example, the primary UE <b>120</b> may selectively perform the RACH procedure if a difference between the selected SSBs of the primary UE <b>120</b> and the secondary UE <b>120</b> satisfies a threshold (e.g., if the selected SSBs are sufficiently similar in configuration).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown by reference number <b>420</b>, the secondary UE <b>120</b> may select a sidelink RACH occasion in accordance with the selected SSB. For example, the secondary UE <b>120</b> may select a sidelink random access configuration associated with the selected SSB. Thus, the UE <b>120</b> may identify a sidelink RACH occasion and random access preamble corresponding to the selected SSB.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown by reference number <b>425</b>, the secondary UE <b>120</b> may transmit a random access signal (e.g., a random access preamble) to the primary UE <b>120</b> on a sidelink RACH occasion. For example, the sidelink RACH occasion and the random access signal may correspond to a sidelink random access configuration associated with the selected SSB. Thus, the secondary UE <b>120</b> may indicate, to the primary UE <b>120</b>, the SSB and uplink random access configuration for which the primary UE <b>120</b> is to perform the RACH procedure.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown by reference number <b>430</b>, the primary UE <b>120</b> may perform at least part of a RACH procedure with the BS <b>110</b> on behalf of the secondary UE <b>120</b>. For example, the primary UE <b>120</b> may transmit one or more of a RACH Message 1, a RACH Message A, or a RACH Message 3 to the BS <b>110</b> using a RACH occasion and a random access signal identified by the uplink random access configuration. In some aspects, the primary UE <b>120</b> may perform an entirety of the RACH procedure on behalf of the secondary UE <b>120</b>, and may provide contention information or RRC connection information to the secondary UE <b>120</b> for establishment of the RRC connection with the BS <b>110</b>. In some aspects, the primary UE <b>120</b> may transmit only an initial message of the RACH procedure (e.g., RACH Message 1 or RACH Message A), and the secondary UE <b>120</b> may handle subsequent communications with the BS <b>110</b>, as described in more detail below. In some aspects, the primary UE <b>120</b> may handle uplink communications with the BS <b>110</b>, and the secondary UE <b>120</b> may receive downlink communications from the BS <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown by reference number <b>435</b>, in some aspects, the primary UE <b>120</b> may provide feedback to the secondary UE <b>120</b>. In some aspects, the feedback may indicate whether the RACH procedure is successful (e.g., whether the primary UE <b>120</b> has received a random access response from the BS <b>110</b>). In some aspects, the feedback may indicate whether the primary UE <b>120</b> will perform the RACH procedure. For example, in a case when the primary UE <b>120</b> will not perform the RACH procedure due to selecting a different SSB than the secondary UE <b>120</b>, the feedback may indicate that the primary UE <b>120</b> will not perform the RACH procedure. In some aspects, the primary UE <b>120</b> may provide the feedback only if the primary UE <b>120</b> is to perform the RACH procedure or has performed the RACH procedure. In some aspects, the feedback may include random access information, such as one or more parts of a RACH Message 2, a RACH Message 4, or a RACH Message B.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown by reference number <b>440</b>, in some aspects, the secondary UE <b>120</b> may receive a RACH message from the BS <b>110</b>. For example, in some aspects, the secondary UE <b>120</b> may monitor a RACH Message 2 or a RACH Message B from the BS <b>110</b> according to the random access preamble sequence used by the primary UE <b>120</b> to transmit the random access signal to the BS <b>110</b>. For example, before monitoring the RACH message from the BS <b>110</b>, the secondary UE <b>120</b> may receive a sidelink message from the primary UE <b>120</b> identifying the random access preamble sequence used by the primary UE <b>120</b> to transmit the random access preamble. As another example, the random access preamble sequence used by the primary UE <b>120</b> may be determined by a sidelink preamble sequence and RACH occasion, and by the sidelink random access configuration. Thus, the secondary UE <b>120</b> may reduce the amount of information obtained by the primary UE <b>120</b> regarding the secondary UE <b>120</b> (e.g., UE-specific RNTIs and/or the like), thereby improving security of the secondary UE <b>120</b> while reducing transmit power for random access preambles.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown by reference number <b>445</b>, in some aspects, the secondary UE <b>120</b> may transmit a message to the BS <b>110</b> using timing information determined based at least in part on the RACH message received from the BS <b>110</b>. For example, the secondary UE <b>120</b> may use timing correction information in the received RACH Message 2 or RACH Message B (shown in connection with reference number <b>440</b>) for a transmission to the BS <b>110</b>. This may be feasible because the secondary UE <b>120</b> may be located close to or collocated with the primary UE <b>120</b> that transmitted the random access signal, and because the secondary UE <b>120</b> may be synchronized with the primary UE <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some aspects, the secondary UE <b>120</b> may use a repetition scheme to communicate with the BS <b>110</b> in order to reduce transmit power and number of receive antennas used for a communication. In this case, it may be beneficial to indicate, to the BS <b>110</b>, that a random access signal received from a primary UE <b>120</b> is transmitted on behalf of a secondary UE <b>120</b>. For example, a group of random access preamble sequences or RACH occasions may be used to indicate that the random access signal is on behalf of the secondary UE <b>120</b> and/or to indicate that a repetition scheme is to be used for the RACH procedure. In some aspects, multiple, different groups of random access preamble sequences or RACH occasions may be used to indicate respective repetition schemes. For example, a first group of random access preamble sequences or RACH occasions may indicate a repetition level of 1, a second group of random access preamble sequences or RACH occasions may indicate a repetition level of 2, and so on. In this case, the sidelink random access configuration may include information indicating a mapping of repetition schemes to groups of random access preamble sequences or RACH occasions. Thus, the primary UE <b>120</b> may indicate a repetition scheme for communication with the secondary ULE <b>120</b> to the BS <b>110</b> as part of the RACH procedure, thereby reducing overhead, improving efficiency of communication between the secondary UE <b>120</b> and the BS <b>110</b>, and improving utilization of computing resources.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As indicated above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is provided as an example.
