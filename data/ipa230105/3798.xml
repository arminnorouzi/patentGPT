However, various changes, modifications, and equivalents of the methods, apparatuses, and/or systems described herein will be apparent after an understanding of the disclosure of this application. For example, the sequences of operations described herein are merely examples, and are not limited to those set forth herein, but may be changed as will be apparent after an understanding of the disclosure of this application, with the exception of operations necessarily occurring in a certain order. Also, descriptions of features that are known after an understanding of the disclosure of the application, may be omitted for increased clarity and conciseness.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The features described herein may be embodied in different forms, and are not to be construed as being limited to the examples described herein. Rather, the examples described herein have been provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Herein, it is to be noted that use of the term &#x201c;may&#x201d; with respect to an embodiment or example, e.g., as to what an embodiment or example may include or implement, means that at least one embodiment or example exists in which such a feature is included or implemented while all examples and examples are not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Throughout the specification, when an element, such as a layer, region, or substrate, is described as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element, it may be directly &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; the other element, or there may be one or more other elements intervening therebetween. In contrast, when an element is described as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element, there can be no other elements intervening therebetween.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any one and any combination of any two or more of the associated listed items.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Although terms such as &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; and &#x201c;third&#x201d; may be used herein to describe various members, components, regions, layers, or sections, these members, components, regions, layers, or sections are not to be limited by these terms. Rather, these terms are only used to distinguish one member, component, region, layer, or section from another member, component, region, layer, or section. Thus, a first member, component, region, layer, or section referred to in examples described herein may also be referred to as a second member, component, region, layer, or section without departing from the teachings of the examples.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Spatially relative terms such as &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; and &#x201c;lower&#x201d; may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element's relationship to another element as illustrated in the figures. Such spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, an element described as being &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;upper&#x201d; relative to another element will then be &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;lower&#x201d; relative to the other element. Thus, the term &#x201c;above&#x201d; encompasses both the above and below orientations depending on the spatial orientation of the device. The device may also be oriented in other ways (for example, rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations), and the spatially relative terms used herein are to be interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The terminology used herein is for describing various examples only, and is not to be used to limit the disclosure.

The terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; and &#x201c;has&#x201d; specify the presence of stated features, numbers, operations, members, elements, and/or combinations thereof, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, numbers, operations, members, elements, and/or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Due to manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, variations of the shapes illustrated in the drawings may occur. Thus, the examples described herein are not limited to the specific shapes illustrated in the drawings, but include changes in shape occurring during manufacturing.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any one and any combination of any two or more of the associated listed items.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Unless otherwise defined, all terms, including technical and scientific terms, used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure pertains after an understanding of the disclosure of this application.
