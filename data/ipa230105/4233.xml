embodiments may relate to a method and/or an electronic device for controlling a remote interaction (e.g., an air mouse mode and an air action mode) of a remote input device (e.g., a stylus pen) detached from the electronic device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A remote input device (e.g., a stylus pen) wirelessly connected to an electronic device (e.g., a smart phone) can be connected to the electronic device according to a compatible short-range wireless communication standard (e.g., Bluetooth/Wi-Fi). Here, a wireless communication distance through which the electronic device and the remote input device can be connected may vary according to the short-range wireless communication standard. As an embodiment, the remote input device compatible with the Bluetooth communication standard can provide a wireless communication distance of less than 10 m. As an embodiment, the remote input device compatible with the Wi-Fi communication standard can provide a wireless communication distance of less than 100 m. Accordingly, the remote input device can determine at least one wireless communication standard from the compatible wireless communication standards according to communication performance, and be wirelessly connected to the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The electronic device can provide a remote (e.g., an air action mode) as a default in response to a detachment state of the remote input device (e.g., the stylus pen). The electronic device can receive motion sensor data (e.g., acceleration, gyro, and geomagnetic sensor data) along with a button input from the remote input device. The electronic device can determine at least one directional motion in response to the received motion sensor data. The electronic device can provide a remote interaction capable of executing at least one application operation (e.g., volume up/down) corresponding to the determined directional motion.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An electronic device cannot provide a complete remote control interface with only one remote interaction (e.g., an air action mode). The electronic device should be able to provide various remote interactions (e.g., an air mouse mode) through a remote input device, along with a remote motion instruction interaction (e.g., the air action mode), while the electronic device is in a communication connection activation state (e.g., desktop experience (DEX) mode activation) with other external electronic devices.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The device can receive a remote control input of a specific application through the remote motion instruction interaction (e.g., the air action mode). However, although an execution application conversion operation, and a separate user input operation (e.g., pen input) through the electronic device (e.g., a touch screen) such as icon selection for application execution, etc. are needed, a support for them is not being provided.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to various example embodiments, a method of remote interaction control for a remote input device (e.g., a stylus pen) detached from an electronic device can be provided. It can determine a communication connection activation state (e.g., DEX mode activation) between the electronic device and another external display device (e.g., a monitor, a notebook, or a tablet). It can determine an attachment or detachment operation (e.g., a detached state) of the remote input device (e.g., the stylus pen) with respect to the electronic device, and provide various remote interactions to the electronic device in response to a trigger input (e.g., a button input) of the remote input device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An electronic device of various example embodiments may include a first communication circuit, a second communication circuit, a wireless charging coil, a sensor circuit, a first interface display unit, a second interface display unit, and a processor. The first communication circuit may connect first communication with a remote input device postioned in the electronic device. The second communication circuit may connect second communication with an external display device. The wireless charging coil may sense a change of a magnetic field signal of the remote input device, and output an electrical signal dependent on the change of the magnetic field signal. The sensor circuit may sense the movement of the remote input device. The first interface display unit may display a first user interface on an internal display of the electronic device. The second interface display unit may display a second user interface on the external display device. The processor may determine the attachment and detachment of the remote input device, and recognize a button input signal of the remote input device and sensor data of the remote input device, through wireless communication. The processor may activate one of a plurality of interactions, based on the button input signal or the sensor data.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A remote interaction control method of an electronic device of various example embodiments may include connecting first communication with a remote input device positioned in the electronic device, connecting second communication with an external display device, outputting an electrical signal dependent on the attachment and detachment of the remote input device, determining the detachment of the remote input device with respect to the electronic device, receiving, through wireless communication, a button input signal of the remote input device and sensor data of the remote input device, and activating one of a plurality of interactions, based on at least one of the button input signal and the sensor data of the remote input device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to various example embodiments, an electronic device may determine at least one compatible wireless communication standard in response to an attachment/detachment state of a remote input device, and convert into a wireless connection state with the remote input device. The electronic device may present a first interface (e.g., a first user interface screen) for the wirelessly connected remote input device (e.g., a stylus pen) through a built-in display.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The electronic device may output a signal (e.g., a graphic buffer signal) for presenting a user interface through a peripheral external display device and a wired/wireless communication standard (e.g., a high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI), wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), etc.). The electronic device may present a second interface (e.g., a second user interface screen) through the external display device that is wired/wireless communication connected. It may control at least one graphic object (e.g., an app icon) from the second interface in response to a touch control input of the electronic device. In this case, the electronic device may optimize information of the wired/wireless connected external display device and present the second interface (e.g., a DEX screen) different from the first interface.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, various effects directly or indirectly identified through the present document may be presented.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of
