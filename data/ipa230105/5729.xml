Here, the length of the compression spring <b>31</b> to be compressed is a constant length that is determined by the shape of the nut part <b>30</b> and the like, and thus the sealing force produced by the compression spring <b>31</b> is constant. Therefore, it is possible to apply the same sealing force between the downstream end face <b>34</b> of the pipe <b>11</b> and the upstream side end face <b>37</b> of the capillary <b>12</b> every time on the mounting work that occurs for replacement and the like of the pipe <b>11</b> or the capillary <b>12</b> (high sealing reproducibility).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the conventional ion source (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) descried in Non-Patent Literature 1, the result of the fastening work of the connector <b>115</b> and the set screw <b>122</b> depends on the skill level of an operator. For example, fastening is performed with a tool, such as a spanner, or hand fastening and the like, which might lead to the occurrence of leakage or the breakage of a component due to over fastening.

Thus, the fixing position of the capillary <b>112</b> in the longitudinal direction is not reproduced, and the positional relationship between the downstream end <b>113</b> and the hole <b>108</b> of the introduction electrode <b>107</b> varies, which possibly leads to a factor that degrades the reproducibility of analysis sensitivity.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In contrast to this, in accordance with the ion source according to the present embodiment, the internal lower end face <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the nut part <b>30</b> contacts the installation face <b>41</b> of the capillary retaining unit <b>28</b>, and thus a position Z<b>1</b> of the downstream end <b>13</b> of the capillary <b>12</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, for example, the distance from the downstream end <b>13</b> of the capillary <b>12</b> in the axial direction to the center of the hole <b>8</b> of the introduction electrode <b>7</b>) is the same every time (high assemble reproducibility). Thus, variations in the analysis sensitivity are also decreased (high analysis reproducibility). Moreover, since the downstream end face <b>34</b> of the pipe <b>11</b> directly contacts the upstream side end face <b>37</b> of the capillary <b>12</b>, the dead volume is eliminated.

Regarding this point, in the conventional ion source described in Non-Patent Literature 1, the replacement work is complicated and assemble reproducibility is also degraded. In the rough description of actual replacement procedures of the conventional configuration with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, first, the connector <b>115</b> is loosened to remove the pipe <b>111</b>, and then the ion producing unit <b>105</b> is pulled out from the housing part, such as the ion source chamber <b>106</b>. After that, the set screw <b>122</b> is loosened to remove the capillary <b>112</b>. The work of setting a new capillary <b>112</b> is basically reverse the above-described work.

However, other parts may be formed as the positioning faces, or the sealing force and the positions may be regulated by a configuration other than the positioning faces using the other members. For example, a configuration may be provided in which the nut part <b>30</b> is rotatable until an outer lower end face <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the nut part <b>30</b> contacts the lower end face of the male screw part <b>42</b> of the capillary retaining unit <b>28</b> and the nut part <b>30</b> is brought into a state in which the nut part <b>30</b> is not further rotatable at the time point at which the contact of the outer lower end face <b>30</b><i>b </i>contacts the lower end face.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, the coupling means using translatory movement by rotating the screw with the nut part is described. According to such a configuration, the configuration can be made simple. However, the coupling means can also be implemented using another mechanism. The mechanism may be a manual mechanism or may be an automatic mechanism. various direct-acting mechanisms, such as a lever mechanism, cam mechanism, rack gear mechanism, slide mechanism, and piston mechanism, may be used as well. In addition, the configuration is made simple when the direct-acting mechanism is used.

For example, when a system that can manage the torque amount of rotation of the screw (i.e., sealing force) can be used, a configuration using no compression spring <b>31</b> can be formed. For example, a compression spring other than the compression coil spring may be used, a tension spring may be used, rubber or another elastic member may be used, or an elastic structure formed using a plurality of members may be used.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the configuration of the first embodiment described above, the pipe is directly joined to the capillary using the spring force to achieve face seal, and thus it is possible to eliminate or decrease a dead volume at the connecting portion of the pipe to the capillary.

These droplets are vaporized or evaporated, and this leads to the possibility of improving ionization efficiency. To this end, a spray gas by the gas spray pipe <b>57</b> can be used.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In regard to the flow rate of a spray gas, an inert gas, such as nitrogen or argon, can be used in the range of 0.5 to 10 L/min., for example. Moreover, in the case of reinforcing the vaporization of droplets, a method (not shown) can also be used in which a heated gas (e.g., temperatures of about 800&#xb0; C. or less, or 800&#xb0; C. or less) is sprayed further from the outer side. The flow rate of the heated gas is in the range of 0.5 to 50 L/min., for example, and an inert gas, such as nitrogen or argon, can be similarly used.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In the configuration in which the spray gas is used, in order to seal the gas, a sealing material <b>60</b> is disposed on a large-diameter member <b>36</b> of the capillary <b>12</b>. For the sealing material <b>60</b>, various configurations, such as an O-ring and a gasket, can be used. In the present embodiment, the configuration is described in which the sealing material <b>60</b> is disposed on the large-diameter member <b>36</b>.

Here, a complete axial sealing configuration may be formed in which the sealing material <b>60</b> is disposed at a position corresponding to the fitting part <b>61</b>. However, when seal is provided at the tapered part <b>40</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the frictional resistance of the sealing material <b>60</b> in the insertion and extraction of the capillary <b>12</b> is relatively made small, and it is possible to improve maintainability.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, since the spring force of the compression spring <b>31</b> is used for the force of pressing the sealing material <b>60</b>, the sealing force is lost correspondingly. The loss of the sealing force occurs also in the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>. However, since oblique sealing is provided, the loss is smaller than in the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">In the case of using such an axial sealing method, the sealing material <b>60</b> may be disposed on the capillary retaining unit <b>28</b>, not on the large-diameter member <b>36</b>. However, in such a configuration, the sealing material <b>60</b> is present at the insertion place of the capillary <b>12</b>, and this is possibly a cause for the capillary <b>12</b> to be stuck when it is inserted. Therefore, disposing the sealing material <b>60</b> on the capillary <b>12</b> is more desirable.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the coordinate axis of the capillary <b>12</b> in the longitudinal direction (in the axial direction) is defined as a Z-axis, and the coordinate axes of directions orthogonal to the Z-axis and orthogonal to each other are defined as an X-axis and a Y-axis. Particularly, the downward direction of the paper surface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a Z-axis positive direction, the front direction of the paper surface is a Y-axis positive direction, and the right direction of the paper surface is an X-axis positive direction. The direction when ions travel from the downstream end <b>13</b> of the capillary <b>12</b> toward the introduction electrode <b>7</b> is roughly a direction along the X-axis.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Since the fitting part <b>61</b> is present as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the position in the X-axis direction and in the Y-axis direction can be regulated, and thus the reproducibility of the mounting position is improved.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Next, the importance of the reproducibility of the projecting amount Z<b>2</b> of the capillary <b>12</b> from the tip end of the gas spray pipe <b>57</b> will be described. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the experiment of detecting an electric current with the projecting amount Z<b>2</b> was performed. The coordinates of the center of the hole <b>8</b> of the introduction electrode <b>7</b> (the inlet position) is defined as the origin point (X, Y, Z)=(0, 0, 0). A Z-axis direction distance Z from the origin point to the tip end of the gas spray pipe <b>57</b> is 10 mm, and an X-axis direction distance X from the origin point to the axis of the capillary <b>12</b> is 5 mm.

The value of the electric current relates to the strength of the electric field, i.e., analysis sensitivity. In order to obtain high analysis reproducibility, the necessity of an assembly of high reproducibility of the projecting amount Z<b>2</b> is shown.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">Next, the result of evaluating pressure resistance evaluation in the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> will be described. In regard to the configuration of the pipe <b>11</b>, the downstream end face <b>34</b> was made of a PEEK resin, the contacting part with the capillary <b>12</b> was formed in a ring shape, and the outer diameter of this ring shape was 1.6 mm, and the inner diameter thereof was 0.8 mm.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">On the other hand, in regard to the configuration of the capillary <b>12</b>, the upstream side end face <b>37</b> was made of stainless steel, and the inner diameter of the capillary <b>12</b> was sealed in order to increase a pressure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> shows the result in which the relationship between the pressure resistance and the load of the compression spring <b>31</b> when a liquid solution (water:methanol=1:1) was delivered to the pipe <b>11</b> at a flow rate 0.1 mL/min was plotted under these conditions.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, comparison is based on the presence or absence of the sealing material <b>60</b>. Compared with the experimental result in a configuration in which the sealing material <b>60</b> is present (&#x201c;WITH O-RING&#x201d;), in the experimental result in a configuration in which the sealing material <b>60</b> is absent (&#x201c;WITHOUT O-RING&#x201d;), high pressure resistance was obtained with a small load. From this result, as described above, since the force of pressing the sealing material <b>60</b> is necessary, it can be determined that the spring force is lost.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">In the present experiment, an O-ring (an inner diameter of 3 mm, and a wire diameter of 1 mm) was used for the sealing material <b>60</b>, the angle of the tapered part <b>40</b> was at an angle of 30 degrees, and the margin for pressing the O-ring was 15% (i.e., the depth of the groove for disposing the O-ring was 85% of the wire diameter of the O-ring). In the case in which face seal as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is provided with the same margin for pressing, the force of pressing the O-ring is required in the oblique direction to need about four times of the pressing force, for example, and thus the spring force is further lost.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> shows the result in which in the same experimental configuration as &#x201c;the O-ring is present&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, wherein the average pressure at the flow rate when a liquid solution (water:methanol=1:1) was actually carried without sealing the inner diameter of the capillary <b>12</b> was plotted.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">This experiment is performed under the conditions in which the length of the capillary <b>12</b> was 168 mm, and the inner diameter was 0.1 mm.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, the linearity between the flow rate and the pressure is excellent. Moreover, in regard to the actually measured value and the theoretical value of the liquid solution amount, the value considerably close to one is maintained, and it was possible to confirm that there is no leakage of the liquid solution or the like.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Seventh Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0158" num="0157">A seventh embodiment is an ion source and a mass spectrometer in which a capillary retaining unit is formed in a double structure.
