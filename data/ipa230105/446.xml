In particular, there is interest in developing a closed-loop system capable of predicting glycemic responses to various events. As used herein, an event may refer to a meal event, an exercise event, a sleep event, an illness event, or any other occurrence that can affect glucose levels. The term &#x201c;glycemic response&#x201d; refers to a change in glucose levels resulting from an event and can be represented as a series of glucose levels over time.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Some approaches for predicting glycemic response involve modeling glucose dynamics based on glucose levels measured prior to an event. For example, a glycemic response to a meal event can be predicted based on extrapolation from glucose levels measured prior to the meal. However, predictions made in such a manner tend to lose accuracy as the event progresses. This is at least partly due to variability among events. For example, a glycemic response to a lunch meal may differ from a glycemic response to a dinner meal due to differences in meal characteristics (e.g., carbohydrate intake may be different at lunch versus dinner) and physiological context (e.g., a person's metabolism may be different at lunch versus dinner). Thus, modeling the same glucose dynamics for all events can result in glycemic response predictions that become increasingly inaccurate over time.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Accordingly, disclosed herein are event-oriented approaches for predicting glycemic responses. Such approaches enable glycemic response predictions that account for variability among events. For example, such approaches may take into consideration event characteristics (e.g., carbohydrate content of a meal) and physiological context (e.g., a person's metabolic rates at the time of the meal) when predicting glycemic responses. Thus, the techniques disclosed herein provide a robust approach that enables increased accuracy of glycemic response predictions even several hours after the start of an event.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present disclosure is described primarily with respect to insulin delivery systems. Aspects and embodiments of the present disclosure can be practiced with one or more types of insulin (e.g., fast-acting insulin, intermediate-acting insulin, and/or slow-acting insulin). Unless indicated by the context, terms such as &#x201c;dose,&#x201d; &#x201c;insulin,&#x201d; &#x201c;basal,&#x201d; and &#x201c;bolus&#x201d; may not denote a particular type of insulin. For example, fast-acting insulin may be used for both basal dosages and bolus dosages. As used herein, the term &#x201c;basal&#x201d; refers to and includes insulin that is delivered in an amount and at a frequency that is intended to correspond to a healthy body's release of insulin between meals and during sleep. The term &#x201c;bolus&#x201d; refers to and includes insulin that is delivered in an amount and at a timing that is intended to correspond to a healthy body's release of insulin for counteracting a high glucose level, such as that caused by consumption of a meal. A meal may include any type or amount of food or beverage consumption, including breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and beverages, among others.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Although the present disclosure may be described primarily with respect to insulin delivery systems, the scope of the present disclosure is not limited to insulin delivery systems. Rather, the present disclosure applies to and can be implemented for other therapy systems as well. It is intended that any aspects, embodiment, and description relating to insulin delivery systems shall be applicable to other types of therapy delivery systems as well.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Although the disclosure is not limited in this regard, discussions utilizing terms such as, for example, &#x201c;processing,&#x201d; &#x201c;computing,&#x201d; &#x201c;calculating,&#x201d; &#x201c;determining,&#x201d; &#x201c;establishing,&#x201d; &#x201c;analyzing,&#x201d; &#x201c;checking,&#x201d; or the like, may refer to operation(s) and/or process(es) of a computer, a computing platform, a computing system, or other electronic computing device, that manipulates and/or transforms data represented as physical (e.g., electronic) quantities within the computer's registers and/or memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer's registers and/or memories or other non-transitory information storage media that may store instructions to perform operations and/or processes.

Blocks <b>410</b>-<b>430</b> relate to generation of a person-specific prediction model that correlates a person's glycemic responses to events with the person's physiological parameters during the events. Blocks <b>440</b>-<b>460</b> relate to application of the prediction model. Subsequent figures will describe the blocks in more detail.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">At block <b>410</b>, event data for a plurality of events of a person is accessed. The event data may be historical data for events that occurred in the past. In various embodiments, the accessed event data may be filtered for events of a particular type, such as event data for only meal events, only exercise events, only sleep events, or only illness events, among others. In various embodiments, the accessed event data may be filtered for a particular grouping of events, such as breakfast events, lunch events, dinner events, snack events, beverage events, nap events, overnight sleep events, jogging events, swimming events, fever events, or vomiting events, among others. The type or grouping of events may be specified by user input or may be automatically determined by one or more devices (e.g., <b>102</b>-<b>108</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) to be the type or grouping for which a glycemic response prediction model is desired.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">At block <b>420</b>, similar events are identified for the person. As used herein, events are identified as being &#x201c;similar&#x201d; if their associated glycemic responses are similar (e.g., substantially identical). However, identifying similar events can be difficult due to variability in physiological state and/or variability in therapy provided in relation to events (e.g., the amount of insulin delivered in relation to a meal event may vary). Such variability can result in significantly different glycemic responses even for otherwise identical events occurring at different times of day. Thus, to facilitate identification of similar events, glycemic responses may be normalized for comparison (e.g., by using the same physiological state data and/or the same therapy data).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, Ronald may eat a cheeseburger for lunch and for dinner. Ronald's actual glycemic responses may be graphically represented as curves generated based on plotting glucose levels (e.g., stored as physiological measurement data <b>330</b>) as a function of time. Despite the meal content being the same for both meals, the actual glycemic response curves for the meals may have significantly different shapes. This may be due to different metabolic rates at lunch versus dinner and/or different amounts of insulin delivered for lunch versus dinner. To account for such differences, Ronald's metabolic rates at lunch may be derived (e.g., using techniques that will be described in greater detail in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) and used to generate a hypothetical glycemic response curve for dinner (e.g., using techniques that will be described in greater detail in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) based on replacing Ronald's metabolic rates at dinner. Additionally or alternatively, the amount of insulin delivered for lunch may be used to generate a hypothetical glycemic response curve for dinner. Thus, if the actual glycemic response curve for lunch is similar to the hypothetical glycemic response curve for dinner, then the meals can be identified as being similar.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Comparing glycemic responses can be performed using a variety of techniques. In some embodiments, a person's physiological model may be used to simulate glycemic response curves for comparison. Additionally or alternatively, comparing glycemic responses may involve computing a mean absolute relative difference (MARD) for corresponding glucose levels at various points in time. Additionally or alternatively, comparing glycemic responses may involve computing the sum of the absolute values of differences between corresponding glucose levels at various points in time. Additionally or alternatively, comparing glycemic responses may involve applying a weighting function to the differences between corresponding glucose levels at various points in time. For example, a weighting function may penalize differences that exceed a predetermined threshold. Persons skilled in the art will recognize various techniques for comparing glycemic responses and/or for weighting differences between the glycemic responses, and all such techniques are contemplated to be within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">At block <b>430</b>, a prediction model is developed based on the events determined to be similar events at block <b>420</b>. As mentioned above, similar events result in similar glycemic responses if the variability among events is taken into consideration (e.g., by using the same physiological state data and/or therapy data to normalize glycemic responses). To build on this, similar events can be analyzed to determine how sources of variability (e.g., physiological state, therapy, and/or event characteristics) contribute to differences in glycemic responses. As will be explained in greater detail in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, machine learning and/or statistical techniques may be used to develop a prediction model that accounts for the sources of variability. Such a prediction model enables greater accuracy in glycemic response predictions, because it is robust enough to account for variability among events.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A non-limiting example of such a prediction model is a set of one or more equations that can be used to predict a person's glycemic responses to meal events. The prediction model may take, as input, the person's metabolic rates m<sub>1 </sub>and k<sub>m </sub>at the time of a meal, an estimated amount of carbohydrates included in the meal, and/or an amount of time elapsed since the start of the meal. The prediction model may provide, as output, information indicative of the person's glucose levels resulting from the meal (e.g., information indicating a cumulative total amount of glucose predicted to have appeared in the person's blood after the amount of time has elapsed since the start of the meal). This information may be used to generate a glycemic response curve representative of the person's glycemic response to a particular meal event (e.g., a curve representing the person's glucose levels as a function of time after the particular meal event has started).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As mentioned above, blocks <b>440</b>-<b>460</b> relate to application of the prediction model. At block <b>440</b>, event data is obtained for a new event (e.g., an ongoing event being experienced by the person). The event data may include event characteristic data, therapy data, and/or physiological measurement data. For example, if the new event is a meal, the event data may include an estimated amount of carbohydrates in the meal, an amount of insulin delivered to the person, and/or a glucose level measured by a glucose sensor.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">At block <b>450</b>, physiological state data (e.g., <b>340</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) may be determined or accessed for the person at the time of the new event. In the example context of a meal event, the physiological state data may include one or more metabolic rates (e.g., m<sub>1</sub>, and k<sub>m</sub>) that can fluctuate for a person throughout the day. The physiological state data may be determined (e.g., estimated) based on applying the person's physiological model to the event data obtained for the new event. For example, a person's physiological model may typically output estimated glucose levels based on input comprising event characteristic data and based on the person's physiological state data at the time of the event. Thus, the person's physiological state data may be back-calculated by providing physiological measurement data and event characteristic data as input to the person's physiological model.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In various embodiments, the physiological state data may be determined based on physiological state data for other events. For example, the values of rate m<sub>1 </sub>and rate k<sub>m </sub>may be estimated based on the time of day and based on rate m<sub>1 </sub>and rate k<sub>m </sub>for other events at such time of day. Additionally or alternatively, the values of rate m<sub>1 </sub>and rate k<sub>m </sub>may be estimated based on the values of rate m<sub>1 </sub>and rate k<sub>m </sub>for an immediately prior event.

The grouping distinguishes the similar events <b>910</b> from dissimilar events <b>920</b>. In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, the similar events <b>910</b> may be used to determine a prediction model based on fitting a curve or surface to the similar events <b>910</b>. For a graphical representation in two dimensions, a curve may be fitted to a group of similar events, and for a graphical representation in three dimensions, a surface may be fitted to a group of similar events. For generality, the term &#x201c;hyper-surface&#x201d; may be used herein to refer to a fit in n dimensions and thus can refer to a line, curve, or surface.

However, it should be appreciated that in some embodiments, the graphical representation may include a plurality of groupings, and each grouping may correspond to a different row of the table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Furthermore, a separate hyper-surface may be fitted to each grouping such that the graphical representation includes a plurality of hyper-surfaces.

The one or more equations may relate an output variable to at least one of the input variables corresponding to an axis of the graphical representation. For instance, using a meal event example, the one or more equations may relate an output variable to k<sub>m</sub>, m<sub>1</sub>, and/or a carbohydrate count. The output variable may be indicative (e.g., predictive) of a person's glycemic response to an event (e.g., an ongoing event). For instance, using a meal event example, the output variable may indicate all or part of the area under a curve representative of a rate at which glucose is predicted to appear in a person's blood as a function of time.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">As used herein, fAUC refers to a fractional area under a curve, and an output variable may correspond to a fAUC value when the output variable indicates a part of the area under a curve. Many types of fAUC values are referenced herein. For example, fAUC<sub>Ra </sub>refers to a part of the area under a curve representative of a rate at which glucose appears in a person's blood as a function of time, and fAUC<sub>Ip </sub>refers to part of the area under a curve representative of a rate at which insulin appears in a person's blood as a function of time. In some embodiments, the fAUC value may correspond to a fractional area under the curve between times T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2</sub>. In such embodiments, fAUC<sup>T1,T2 </sup>may refer to the fractional area. When T<sub>1 </sub>corresponds to the start time of an event, fAUC<sup>T1,T2 </sup>may simply be written as fAUC<sup>T</sup>, where T<sub>2 </sub>is simply written as T and can correspond to any point in time between the start and end of an event (e.g., T may correspond to a time that typically corresponds to the end of an event).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Notably, fAUC values can be used to predict future glucose levels in a person. For example, a fAUC<sub>Ra</sub><sup>T </sup>value may provide a cumulative total amount of glucose that is expected to appear in the person's blood from the start of an event to a time T, and a fAUC<sub>Ip</sub><sup>T </sup>value may provide a cumulative total amount of insulin that is expected to appear in the person's blood from the start of the event to the time T. Multiplying the fAUC<sub>Ip</sub><sup>T </sup>value by the person's insulin sensitivity factor would yield a cumulative total amount of glucose expected to be metabolized from the start of the event to the time T, and this cumulative total amount of glucose expected to be metabolized can be subtracted from the fAUC<sub>Ra</sub><sup>T </sup>value to yield the person's glucose level at time T (relative to the person's glucose level at the start of the event). Thus, the person's glucose level at time T may be obtained from the output of the prediction model.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The prediction model may be generated in various ways, including by using machine learning techniques and/or statistical analysis techniques (e.g., regression analysis), among other things.

Accordingly, different prediction models may be used to obtain different output values that each correspond to different time values after the start of the event.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-B</figref> depict a glycemic response curve generated based on two different output values obtained from two different prediction models. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> depicts a portion of the glycemic response curve generated based on an output value specific to a duration from the start of an event to a time T<sub>a</sub>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> depicts a portion of the glycemic response curve generated based on an output value specific to a duration from the start of the event to a time T<sub>b</sub>. Although two different time values are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-B</figref>, it should be appreciated that the techniques disclosed herein can be practiced with any number of time values (e.g., more than two time values or less than two time values).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-B</figref>, glucose values <b>1104</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>correspond to points along the glycemic response curve at time values T<sub>a </sub>and T<sub>b</sub>, respectively. The glucose values <b>1104</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>may be determined based on subtracting fAUC values <b>1106</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>from fAUC values <b>1102</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, respectively. For example, curve <b>1102</b> may be representative of a rate at which glucose appears in a person's blood as a function of time, and the fAUC value <b>1102</b><i>a </i>may correspond to a cumulative total amount of glucose expected to appear in a person's blood between the start of the event to the time value T<sub>a</sub>; whereas curve <b>1106</b> may be representative of a rate at which glucose is metabolized in a person's blood as a function of time, and the fAUC value <b>1106</b><i>a </i>may correspond to a cumulative total amount of blood glucose that is expected to be metabolized between the start of the event to the time value T<sub>a</sub>. Thus, subtracting the fAUC value <b>1106</b><i>a </i>from the fAUC value <b>1102</b><i>a </i>would yield a net change in glucose level (relative to the person's glucose level <b>1110</b> at the start of the event) expected to occur by the time value T<sub>a</sub>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">As mentioned above, the fAUC values <b>1102</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>may be obtained from different prediction models. For example, a first prediction model may yield a first output value specific to a duration from the start of an event to a time value T<sub>a</sub>, and a second prediction model may yield a second output specific to a duration from the start of the event to a time value T<sub>b</sub>. In some embodiments, each prediction model may be generated at a remote or cloud computing system (e.g., one or more server computers) and communicated to a different computing system (e.g., a smartphone), where the prediction models are locally stored for application at the different computing system.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The fAUC values <b>1106</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>may be determined based on providing therapy data (e.g., <b>320</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) to the physiological model <b>500</b> to simulate glucose metabolism. For example, the model <b>500</b> may provide an equation or a curve representative of a rate at which glucose is metabolized in the presence of insulin, and integrating the equation or curve through the time values T<sub>a </sub>and T<sub>b </sub>would respectively yield cumulative total amounts of glucose expected to be metabolized as of the time values T<sub>a </sub>and T<sub>b</sub>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">For the avoidance of doubt, the techniques depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-B</figref> are merely provided as examples, and the glycemic response curve can be derived using other techniques. For example, some techniques may involve using the fAUC values <b>1102</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>to determine glucose values <b>1104</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>without accounting for glucose metabolism (e.g., in the absence of therapy data).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In some embodiments, the output value <b>1022</b> of the prediction model <b>1000</b> may be used for therapy determination. For example, the output value <b>1022</b> may be used to determine an insulin delivery amount (e.g., the size of a meal bolus to be delivered to a person in relation to a meal event) for maximizing time-in-range. In such embodiments, the predicted glycemic response would be a desired glycemic response. Thus, the glucose values <b>1104</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and the fAUC values <b>1102</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>could be used to back-calculate the fAUC values <b>1106</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, which could be used to determine the total amount of glucose that would be metabolized to achieve the desired glycemic response. For example, the fAUC values <b>1106</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>could be used to derive a glucose metabolism rate curve, and calculating the area under this curve would yield the total amount of glucose metabolized. To determine an insulin delivery amount, the total amount of glucose metabolized can be divided by an insulin sensitivity factor.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In some embodiments, therapy may be effected based on communicating a therapy determination toward a therapy delivery device. A non-limiting example of such a device is described below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">As mentioned above, therapy determinations may be communicated toward an insulin delivery device <b>1200</b> (e.g., from a cloud computing system <b>108</b> via an intermediary computing device <b>106</b> communicatively coupled to the device <b>1200</b>). In such a device, insulin delivery may be performed based on internal communication between a central computing module (e.g., a microcontroller for device <b>1200</b> as a whole) and an insulin delivery module (e.g., including a microcontroller, a motor, and a pump). For instance, insulin delivery may be caused by the central computing module communicating a delivery command in the form of an electrical signal that travels via a communication fabric to the insulin delivery module. The central computing module may also be configured to communicate (e.g., via a transceiver) with a computing device (e.g., <b>106</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) communicatively coupled to a remote or cloud computing system (e.g., <b>108</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).
