The IEEE 802.11 family of standards relate to WLANs and their quality of service (QoS), access point protocol, security enhancement, wireless management, etc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are different wireless network versions of IEEE 802.11. The versions include 802.11a, 802.11g (Extended Rate Physical Layer (PHY), ERP), 802.11n (High Throughput, HT), 802.11ac (Very High Throughput, VHT), and 802.11ax (High Efficiency, HE). There are increasing demands on traffic caused by video streaming, cloud computing, Internet-Of-Things (IOT), big data, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), and other factors. New versions of WLAN are being developed to meet the requirements for high transmission data rates. For example, a recent Task Group called &#x201c;TGbe&#x201d; in IEEE 802.11 was formed to develop a next generation 802.11 WLAN standard, called IEEE 802.11be (also known as Extremely High Throughput, EHT). IEEE 802.11be has a target of maximum throughput of 30 Gigabits per second (Gbps) with carrier frequency operation between 1 and 7.250 GigaHertz (GHz) while ensuring backward compatibility and coexistence with legacy IEEE 802.11 compliant devices operating in the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A wireless communication device is required to know which version of IEEE 802.11 is being used in a communication frame so as to properly interpret or respond to the communication frame. The device can also benefit from knowing what type of frame is being communicated. As well, the frame needs to be compatible with legacy versions along with current versions of IEEE 802.11.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a solution for efficient, backward-compatible, low-error and robust detection of the particular WLAN version of a communication. It would also be desirable to provide a communication format that indicates the type of frame being communicated.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Example embodiments relate to a control signal that enables automatic detection of a wireless network version (PHY type) of a transmission, so that the wireless network version can be used for interpreting signaling information and decoding of the payload of the transmission. In some example embodiments, the control signal is within a preamble of the transmission. The wireless network version can be an IEEE 802.11 version, such as proposed IEEE 802.11be. The control signal is compatible with legacy systems and can indicate the legacy signaling information by way of a Legacy Signal (SIG) (L-SIG) field.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The receiver can be configured to automatically detect the specific wireless network version of the transmission, which can be a Physical Layer Convergence Procedure (PLCP) Protocol Data Unit (PPDU). The receiver can then correctly conduct further interpretation of signaling information and payload data carried by the PPDU. It is desirable that automatic wireless network version detection be performed at an early stage in the PPDU detection, e.g. after detection of the PPDU packet and performance of frequency channel estimation. The particular wireless network version can then be applied in order to further interpret the signaling information, decode the received payload data, and perform other functions. Example embodiments of PPDU with auto-detection can be applied to the proposed IEEE 802.11be (EHT) as well as other wireless communication versions.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some wireless communication versions, the indication of data rate in L-SIG is fixed. For example, in IEEE 802.11ax and the proposed IEEE 802.11be the data rate is indicated to be fixed at 6 Megabits per second (Mb/s) in L-SIG. Some example embodiments do not require repeating of rate information because the pre-defined data rate is described in a corresponding SIG field once that particular wireless network version is identified, and therefore the rate is known to the receiver.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An example embodiment is a method for enabling wireless network version detection, performed by a wireless

In some example embodiments, the control signal is within a preamble of the transmission. The wireless network version can be an IEEE 802.11 version, such as proposed IEEE 802.11be. The control signal is compatible with legacy systems and can indicate the legacy signaling information by way of a Legacy Signal (SIG) (L-SIG) field.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> provides an example schematic diagram of a wireless communication system <b>100</b> in which example embodiments may be implemented. The wireless communication system <b>100</b> includes an access point (AP, also known as an AP STA or a network coordinator) <b>101</b> and at least one station (STA, also known as non-AP STA) <b>102</b> in a wireless communication network, such as a wireless local area network (WLAN). The AP <b>101</b> is any entity that has STA functionality and provides access to the Internet or a distribution service for the associated STAs <b>102</b>. The STAs <b>102</b> may be mobile communication devices enabled for wireless communications, including but not limited to mobile phones, smart phones, laptops, tablet computers, machine-type communication devices, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and wireless sensing and reporting devices. The AP <b>101</b> and the STAs <b>102</b> can each be configured to execute uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmissions in the WLAN.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the WLAN, the AP <b>101</b> may provide access to the Internet or a distribution service for one or more STAs <b>102</b> that are wirelessly and communicatively associated with the AP <b>101</b>. The AP <b>101</b> can access the Internet or the distribution service by way of wired or wireless communication. Although only one single AP <b>101</b> is shown, this is only illustrative and is not intended to be limiting. In other examples, there may be more than one AP <b>101</b> within the wireless communication system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, examples of the WLAN will be described in the context of wireless communications between a plurality of STAs <b>102</b> and an AP <b>101</b>. The wireless communication system <b>100</b> supports multi-user multiple input multiple output (MU-MIMO) transmissions, also known as a multiple access transmissions. The AP <b>101</b> and at least one of the STAs <b>102</b> may be configured for single user (SU) communications in other examples (not shown here). MU-MIMO based transmission, which can use multiple antennas, allows simultaneous channel access by the STAs <b>102</b> for effective use of frequency channels in the WLAN. The AP <b>101</b> can simultaneously transmit spatial-multiplexed data to the STAs <b>102</b>. Payload data can be simultaneously transmitted by the AP <b>101</b> to the STAs <b>102</b> using a plurality of respective spatial streams (stream <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) in the DL direction, shown as DL MU transmissions <b>120</b>(<b>1</b>) to <b>120</b>(<b>3</b>) (generically referred to as DL MU transmission <b>120</b>). In the DL direction, payload data transmitted to each STA <b>102</b> may be different for each STA <b>102</b>. In the UL direction, payload data can be simultaneously transmitted to the AP <b>101</b> using a plurality of respective spatial streams (stream <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>), shown as UL MU transmissions <b>121</b>(<b>1</b>) to <b>121</b>(<b>3</b>) (generically referred to as UL MU transmission <b>121</b>). The DL MU transmissions <b>120</b> and the UL MU transmissions <b>121</b> are payload transmissions. The DL MU transmissions <b>120</b> and the UL MU transmissions <b>121</b> may use Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), with MU-MIMO or without MU-MIMO.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which illustrates an OFDMA transmission scheme to multiplex communications with a plurality of STAs <b>102</b> over different frequencies (f) and times (t). The OFDMA is a multiple access scheme where different subsets of sub-carriers are allocated to different STAs <b>102</b>, allowing the AP <b>101</b> to have data communication with the different STAs <b>102</b> (e.g., STAs <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>) to <b>102</b>(<b>4</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The STAs <b>102</b> can have data transmission scheduled across both frequency (such as sub-carriers <b>200</b>(<b>1</b>) to <b>200</b>(<i>n</i>) (generically referred to as sub-carrier <b>200</b>) and time. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, transmission frequency channels are divided into smaller sub-channels with a predefined number of sub-carriers. A Resource Unit (RU) <b>201</b> includes a plurality of sub-carriers, typically with a minimum size of 26 sub-carriers <b>200</b>. The RU <b>201</b> has a maximum number of sub-carriers that can be used by one or more of the STAs <b>102</b>. The AP <b>101</b> can assign each STA <b>102</b> one or more RUs in order to perform a UL or DL transmission, or can assign multiple STAs <b>102</b> to a RU.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates a transmitter <b>310</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates a receiver <b>320</b>, in accordance with example embodiments. In example embodiments, the transmitter <b>310</b> is configured to encode the preamble and payload data of the PPDU, and then transmit the PPDU. The receiver <b>320</b> is configured to receive the PPDU, as applicable. In some examples, the receiver <b>320</b> first decodes part of the preamble of the received UL or DL PPDU in order to determine a wireless network version of the PPDU, and then the receiver <b>320</b> is configured to interpret the preamble and the payload according to the determined wireless network version. In some examples, the transmitter <b>310</b> and the receiver <b>320</b> are used to communicate trigger frames in order to solicit the UL PPDU.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The transmitter <b>310</b> is configured to transmit PPDU. In some examples, the transmitter <b>310</b> may be included within the AP <b>101</b> or the STA <b>102</b> to implement the DL or UL transmission, respectively. For example, in DL direction, the transmitter <b>310</b> may be included within the AP <b>101</b> to transmit PPDU containing a preamble and respective payload data to STAs <b>102</b> on their respective sub-carriers in one or more RUs. In UL direction, the transmitter <b>310</b> may be included within an associated STA <b>102</b> to transmit preamble and payload data of the STA <b>102</b> on its respective sub-carriers in one or more RUs.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the transmitter <b>310</b> includes a plurality of transmitting (Tx) paths <b>311</b>(<b>1</b>) to <b>311</b>(Z) (generically referred to as Tx path <b>311</b>) for a transmission that includes a preamble and payload data. When the transmitter <b>310</b> is in the AP <b>101</b>, for DL transmission, the AP <b>101</b> can generate Tx paths <b>311</b> for different respective STAs (e.g., STA <b>1</b> to STA Z).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">One Tx path <b>311</b> for one STA <b>102</b> will now be described in detail. A series of bits are received by the symbol modulator <b>312</b> in the Tx path <b>311</b>. The symbol modulator <b>312</b> performs symbol modulation on the bits of the payload data to data symbols (also known as a constellation symbols). The data symbols can be represented as amplitude and phase, or cosine and sine coefficients, or other nomenclatures, as is understood in the art. Each data symbol may be referred to as a chip. The symbol modulation can be based on symbol modulation schemes such as amplitude-shift keying (ASK), phase-shift keying (PSK), binary PSK (BPSK), quadrature PSK (QPSK), quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), or any other appropriate method of mapping series of data bits to a modulated symbol. The QAM constellations can be specified by cosine and sine coefficients in quadrature.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The tone mapping block <b>314</b> maps or assigns each data symbol to one or more of the sub-carriers, known as tone mapping. The data symbols are provided to the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) block <b>315</b> to transform the data symbols to the assigned sub-carriers in time domain. Other types of inverse Fourier transforms can be performed in other examples. The output from the IFFT block <b>315</b> are OFDMA waveforms in time domain, in parallel for each STA. The cyclic prefix generator <b>316</b> adds a cyclic prefix to the OFDMA waveforms. The parallel to serial converter (P/S) <b>317</b> converts the parallel OFDMA waveforms of multiple STAs into a serial digital signal. The serial digital signal is converted by a digital-to-analog converter <b>318</b> to an analog signal, which is transmitted via an antenna <b>152</b>. The transmission that is transmitted via the antenna <b>152</b> can include the preamble (which can have one or more coded/modulated fields as described in greater detail herein) and the coded/modulated data.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, which illustrates a receiver <b>320</b> for demodulating each received OFDMA signal in accordance with an example embodiment. In some examples, the receiver <b>320</b> may be included within each STA <b>102</b> to decode the received OFDMA signal from the DL transmission of the AP <b>101</b>. In some examples, the receiver <b>320</b> may be included within the AP <b>101</b> to decode received OFDMA signals from the UL transmission of the STAs <b>102</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the receiver <b>320</b> includes an antenna <b>152</b>, an analog-to digital converter (ADC) <b>322</b>, a cyclic prefix removal block <b>323</b>, a fast fourier transform (FFT) block <b>324</b>, and rea plurality of receiving (Rx) paths <b>325</b>(<b>1</b>) to <b>325</b>(Z) (generically referred to as Rx path <b>325</b>) on which data is received and the desired data is recovered. For DL transmission, only one receiving path corresponding to one STA <b>102</b> needs to be processed by the receiver <b>320</b> of the corresponding STA <b>102</b>. For UL transmission, all of the receiving paths, corresponding to all STAs <b>102</b>, can be processed by the receiver <b>320</b> of the AP <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The antenna <b>152</b> of the receiver <b>320</b> receives analog signals from wireless communication frequency channels, such as from the transmitter <b>310</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. The ADC <b>322</b> converts each received analog signal into a digital signal. The cyclic prefix removal block <b>323</b> removes a cyclic prefix from the digital signal. The FFT block <b>324</b> then transforms the cyclic prefix removed digital signal in time domain into data symbols. The data symbols for each STA <b>102</b> from the FFT block <b>324</b> are processed on a respective one of the plurality of Rx paths. For clarity, one Rx path <b>325</b>(<b>1</b>) is indicated by a dashed box. One Rx path <b>325</b> will now be described in detail. Data symbols are provided to a channel equalizer <b>326</b> for equalization, which may help to reduce inter-symbol interference (ISI) and noise effects for better demodulation. The equalized data symbols from the channel equalizer <b>326</b> are input to the symbol demodulator <b>328</b>. The symbol demodulator <b>328</b> uses symbol demodulation to demodulate the data symbols into series of bits for the STA <b>102</b> to recover the data. The receiver <b>320</b> can receive and interpret the preamble of the received signals. When the preamble has one or more coded or modulated fields (as described in greater detail herein), the receiver <b>320</b> can be used to decode or demodulate the preamble.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In UL direction, a transmission including a preamble and payload data is transmitted from each associated STA <b>102</b> to the AP <b>101</b>, in response to the STA <b>102</b> receiving a trigger frame. The trigger frame can include resource allocation information of one or more RUs for the payload data of each associated STA <b>102</b>. In some examples, at least one of the fields of the trigger frame is coded by the transmitter <b>310</b>. After each STA <b>102</b> receives the trigger frame, the STA <b>102</b> (having the transmitter <b>310</b>) can transmit a PPDU containing a preamble and payload data of the STA <b>102</b> over one or more sub-carriers using the received resource allocation information, and modulate the data symbols over the one or more sub-carriers of the one or more RUs. The AP <b>101</b> (having the receiver <b>320</b>) can receive and interpret the transmission from the STAs, which include a preamble and OFDMA signals of the payload data. When the preamble has one or more coded fields (as described in greater detail herein), the receiver <b>320</b> can be used to decode the preamble.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, in some examples the transmitter <b>310</b> includes a Cyclic Shifter <b>330</b>, which can be used to perform cyclic shifting, in time domain, on at least part of the preamble or the data payload. The cyclic shifting can be performed after the IFFT block <b>315</b> and prior to the Cyclic Prefix Generator <b>316</b>. Similarly, the receiver <b>320</b> can include a Cyclic Shifter <b>332</b> for reversing, in time domain and prior to the FFT <b>324</b>, the cyclic shifting that was performed by the Cyclic Shifter <b>330</b> of the transmitter <b>310</b>.

At step <b>2204</b>, the tone mapping block <b>314</b> of the transmitter <b>310</b> tone maps the BPSK modulated L-SIG. At step <b>2206</b>, the IFFT block <b>315</b> performs IFFT in accordance with the tone mapping, arriving at a RL-SIG symbol in time domain without cyclic prefix. At step <b>2208</b>, the Cyclic Shifter <b>330</b> performs cyclic shifting at a specified cyclic shifting distance known by both the transmitter <b>310</b> and the receiver <b>320</b>, to generate a CS-RL-SIG symbol.
