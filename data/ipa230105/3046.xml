Technical Field</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure relates generally to an umbrella stand, and more specifically, to an umbrella stand usable with a table.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Outdoor tables are widely used in both public spaces, such as parks, restaurants, campgrounds, campuses, etc., and private spaces, such as in residential yards. Outdoor tables provide the ability to gather at the table for a meal, play a board game, or visit with friends and family.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In certain conditions, it may be desirable to use an umbrella while sitting at the table. The umbrella may cast shade to provide a cooler environment around the table and to protect those gathered at the table from harmful UV rays. Typically, an umbrella is supported by a pole that extends from the umbrella to the ground, where it may be received in a base located on the ground. When used with a table, the umbrella pole will typically extend through a hole that is formed in the table, and may be received in a base located under the table, or may extend completely to the ground, such that the pole is in direct contact with the ground.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although passing the umbrella pole through a hole in a table may be sufficient for those tables having a hole already formed therein, there are many tables that do not include a hole, and thus, would not be able to accommodate passage of an umbrella pole. Accordingly, when visiting a public area, such as a park or a campground, that may include a table with or without a hole for an umbrella, it may be difficult to plan on using an umbrella at the table.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an adaptable umbrella stand capable of being used on a table having a hole for supporting an umbrella, as well as being used on a table without a hole for supporting an umbrella. Various aspects of the present disclosure address this particular need, as will be discussed in more detail below.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure is directed toward an adaptable umbrella stand configured for supporting an umbrella on a table, regardless of whether the table includes a hole to receive the umbrella pole. If the table does include a center hole, the umbrella stand includes a base plate positionable on an upper surface of the table, and an elongate shaft that may be extended through the hole and connected underneath the table via a bottom cap. Thus, the umbrella stand may be connected to the table via the base plate and the bottom cap being abutted against opposite sides of the table, a portion of which is thereby effectively compressively captured therebetween. If the table does not include a center hole, the base plate may be placed on the upper surface of the table, and a plurality of strap assemblies may be deployed and connected to peripheral edge portions of the table to secure the umbrella stand to the table. In both of the above-described modes of use, the umbrella stand may be capable of supporting the umbrella over the table without any structure extending to and supported by the ground, other than the table itself.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided an umbrella stand for use with an umbrella pole and a table having an upper surface and a peripheral edge. The umbrella stand includes a base plate positionable on the upper surface of the table. A tube is connected to the base plate and includes an opening formed therein sized to receive a portion of the umbrella pole. An elongate shaft is detachably connectable to the base plate so as to extend from the base plate in opposed relation to the tube. The elongate shaft is externally threaded. The umbrella stand further includes a bottom cap having an internally threaded opening extending therethrough and being sized to be threadedly engageable with the elongate shaft. A first strap assembly is coupled to the base plate and includes a first strap and a first table edge clamp coupled to the first strap. A second strap assembly is coupled to the base plate in opposed relation to the first strap and includes a second strap and a second table edge clamp coupled to the second strap. The umbrella stand is useable in a first mode wherein the elongate shaft is connected to the base plate, the bottom cap is connected to the elongate shaft, and the first and second strap assemblies are in a retracted stated with the first and second table edge clamps being disengaged from the peripheral edge of the table. The umbrella stand is useable in a second mode separate from the first mode, wherein the elongate shaft is disconnected from the base plate, and the first and second strap assemblies are extended or deployed, with the first and second table edge clamps being engaged to the peripheral edge of the table. It is contemplated that that the base plate may be outfitted with third and fourth strap assembles, likewise disposed in opposed relation to each other and oriented along an axis which is offset approximately ninety degrees from a common axis along which the first and second strap assemblies reside. In an embodiment wherein the base plate is circularly configured, the first through fourth strap assembles may be spaced at intervals of approximately ninety degrees, with the first and second strap assembles being diametrically opposed to each other, and the third and fourth strap assembles likewise being diametrically opposed to each other.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A position of the bottom cap may be selectively adjustable along the elongate shaft via rotation of the bottom cap relative to the elongate shaft.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The umbrella stand may additionally include a first magnet connected to the first table edge clamp and a second magnet connected to the second table edge clamp, the first and second magnets being configured to facilitate selective magnetic coupling of the first and second table edge clamps, respectively, to the tube.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The umbrella stand may further comprise a first spring in operative communication with the first strap to impart a tensioning force on the first strap.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The elongate shaft may be threadably engageable to the base plate. The umbrella stand may additionally include an externally threaded connector mounted on the elongate shaft and configured to engage with an internally threaded opening on the base plate. A separate plate may be connected to the tube and may extend within the opening of the tube. The plate may have an opening formed therein and alignable with the externally threaded connector when the externally threaded connected is engaged with the base plate.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The first table edge clamp may include a first clamping plate and a second clamping plate moveable relative to the first clamping plate. The first table edge clamp may include an inner corner bracket and an outer corner bracket, with the first clamping plate being on the inner corner bracket and the second clamping plate being on the outer corner bracket.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present disclosure will be best understood by reference to the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">These and other features and advantages of the various embodiments disclosed herein will be better understood with respect to the following description and drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an upper perspective view of an umbrella stand holding an umbrella and connected to a table formed without an umbrella stand hole;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an upper perspective view of an umbrella stand holding an umbrella and connected to a table formed with an umbrella stand hole;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an upper perspective view of the umbrella stand;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a lower perspective view of the umbrella stand;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an upper perspective view of a tube connected to a base plate, which form part of the umbrella stand;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an exploded upper perspective view of the umbrella stand;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an exploded lower perspective view of the tube and base plate;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an upper perspective view of an externally threaded elongate shaft, included in the umbrella stand;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a lower perspective view of the externally threaded elongate shaft aligned with the base plate and tube for use on a table in a first, center support mode;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an upper perspective view of the umbrella stand depicting a bottom cap connected to the elongate shaft extending from the base plate and tube;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a side view of the umbrella stand in the first, center support mode;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is an upper perspective view of a strap assembly included in the umbrella stand;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is an exploded view of the strap assembly;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is an exploded upper perspective view of the table edge clamp;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is an upper perspective view of the umbrella stand depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a partial upper perspective view of the umbrella stand depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Common reference numerals are used throughout the drawings and the detailed description to indicate the same elements.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of certain embodiments of an umbrella stand and is not intended to represent the only forms that may be developed or utilized. The description sets forth the various structure and/or functions in connection with the illustrated embodiments, but it is to be understood, however, that the same or equivalent structure and/or functions may be accomplished by different embodiments that are also intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present disclosure. It is further understood that the use of relational terms such as first and second, and the like are used solely to distinguish one entity from another without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between such entities.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating preferred embodiments of the present disclosure only and are not for purposes of limiting the same, there is depicted an umbrella stand <b>10</b> adapted for use on a table <b>12</b>, regardless of whether the table <b>12</b> includes a hole for an umbrella pole <b>14</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the umbrella stand <b>10</b> connected to a table <b>12</b> without a hole for an umbrella pole <b>14</b>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the umbrella stand <b>10</b> connected to a table <b>12</b> with a hole for an umbrella pole <b>14</b>. The umbrella stand <b>10</b> may include a wide base plate <b>16</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) for distributing weight of the umbrella stand <b>10</b>, the pole <b>14</b>, and the umbrella top on an upper surface of the table <b>12</b>, which helps to stabilize the umbrella on the table <b>12</b>, whether the table <b>12</b> includes a hole, or not. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, when the table <b>12</b> does not include a hole for an umbrella pole <b>14</b>, several straps <b>18</b> incorporated into the umbrella stand <b>10</b> may be extended and connected to the table <b>12</b> to provide stabilization of the umbrella on the table <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, when the table <b>12</b> does include a hole for an umbrella pole <b>14</b>, the straps <b>18</b> may not be required. Instead, the umbrella stand <b>10</b> may include a shaft <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) that extends through the hole and is secured on the underside of the table <b>12</b> with a bottom cap <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Thus, the bottom cap <b>22</b> and wide base plate <b>16</b> may provide opposing forces on the table <b>12</b> to secure the umbrella stand <b>10</b> to the table <b>12</b>. When visiting a public area having tables for public use, the adaptability of the umbrella stand <b>10</b> allows a user to selectively configure the umbrella stand <b>10</b> based on the configuration of the tables <b>12</b>. Accordingly, the flexibility and adaptability of the umbrella stand <b>10</b> provide the user with the assurance that the umbrella can be used whether the table <b>12</b> includes a hole or not.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The umbrella stand <b>10</b> includes a hollow tube <b>24</b> extending along a central axis <b>26</b> and having an upper, distal end portion and a lower, proximal end portion. The hollow tube <b>24</b> may additionally include an outer surface and an inner surface which defines an inner diameter sized to receive an umbrella pole <b>14</b>. Many umbrella poles <b>14</b> have an outer diameter of approximately 1.5 inches, and thus, the inner diameter of the tube <b>24</b> may be slightly larger to facilitate insertion and removal of the umbrella pole <b>14</b>. For instance, the inner diameter of the tube <b>24</b> may be approximately 1.75 inches to accommodate a pole <b>14</b> having an outer diameter of 1.5 inches. However, it is understood that the size of umbrella poles <b>14</b> may vary, such as between 1.125-3.0 inches. Accordingly, the tube <b>24</b> may be available in different sizes with different inner diameters, e.g., between 1.25-3.50 inches without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The upper end portion may terminate at an upper edge and may include external threads extending from the upper edge to define a threaded segment <b>28</b> of the tube <b>24</b>. An intermediate portion of the tube <b>24</b> may include one or more openings <b>30</b> extending therethrough, between the outer surface and the inner surface, with each opening <b>30</b> being internally threaded and adapted to receive a stabilizing screw <b>32</b>. The screw(s) <b>32</b> may be advanceable within a respective opening(s) <b>30</b>, such that a distal end of the screw <b>32</b> may engage with a pole <b>14</b> inserted within the tube <b>24</b> to provide lateral stabilization to the pole <b>14</b> to mitigate swaying of the pole <b>14</b> within the tube <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Stabilization of umbrella poles <b>14</b> received in the tube <b>24</b> may be facilitated through the use of one or more tube adapters that may be insertable within the tube <b>24</b>. Each tube adapter <b>34</b> may include an upper ring, and a plurality of fingers extending from the upper ring.

The tube cap <b>36</b> may be hollow and may be advanced over the umbrella pole <b>14</b> for engagement with the tube <b>24</b>. When engaged with the tube <b>24</b>, the tube cap <b>36</b> may retain any adapters <b>34</b> between the tube cap <b>36</b> and the tube <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The distal end portion of the tube <b>24</b> may include an internal plate <b>37</b> connected thereto. The internal plate <b>37</b> extends across the hollow portion of the tube <b>24</b> in a generally diametrical direction. The internal plate <b>37</b> may include an opening formed therein, which may be centered on the central axis <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The distal end portion of the tube <b>24</b> may also be engaged to a base plate <b>16</b> configured to extend radially outward from the tube <b>24</b> and rest against an upper surface of the table <b>12</b> to provide stabilization to the tube <b>24</b>. In more detail, when the umbrella stand <b>10</b> is connected to a table <b>12</b> and an umbrella is supported by the umbrella stand <b>10</b>, wind may act on the umbrella, which may impart a force on the pole <b>14</b> and the umbrella stand <b>10</b>, which may urge the umbrella stand <b>40</b> to sway or rock on the table <b>12</b>. The configuration of the base plate <b>16</b> may resist such swaying or rocking and distribute the forces over a larger surface area on the table <b>12</b> to protect against damage to the table <b>12</b>. The base plate <b>16</b> may be welded to the tube <b>24</b>, or connected via other means known in the art, such as threaded engagement, etc.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the exemplary embodiment, the base plate <b>16</b> is circular and is centered on the central axis <b>26</b> defined by the tube <b>24</b>. The base plate <b>16</b> includes a generally planar lower surface <b>38</b> and a generally planar upper surface <b>40</b>. An optional decorative plate having a decorative pattern formed therein may be integrated into the base plate <b>16</b> and may define a portion of the upper surface <b>40</b>. The base plate <b>16</b> may include an outer edge that defines an outer diameter, which may be in the range of 4-30 inches, although a more preferred range may be between 8-16 inches. As noted above, a larger base plate <b>16</b> may be capable of distributing stabilizing forces aver a greater surface area of the table <b>12</b>. Thus, if there is a desire to minimize the amount of force transferred to any one point on the table <b>12</b>, a larger base plate <b>16</b> may be used. For instance, in the case of glass tables or tables having a thin tabletop, a larger base plate <b>16</b> may distribute the force over a larger area to protect against damage to the table <b>12</b>. Though the base plate <b>16</b> is preferably circular, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that it may be provided in alternative shapes (e.g. quadrangular) of varying sizes or areas without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The center of the base plate <b>16</b> may include an internally threaded opening <b>42</b> that is aligned with the opening in the internal plate <b>37</b> connected to the tube <b>24</b>. The opening <b>42</b> is configured to engage with an externally threaded connector <b>44</b>, which is mounted on the externally threaded, elongate shaft <b>20</b>. The externally threaded connector <b>44</b> is connected to a mounting plate <b>46</b>, which extends between the externally threaded connector <b>44</b> and an inner surface of the elongate shaft <b>20</b>. When the externally threaded connector is advanced through into the opening <b>42</b> on the base plate <b>16</b>, continued advancement of the externally threaded connector <b>44</b> may result in at least a portion of the externally threaded connector <b>44</b> being received in the opening formed in the internal plate <b>37</b>, which may facilitate alignment of the threaded connector <b>44</b> and the attached elongate shaft <b>20</b> relative to the base plate <b>16</b> and the tube <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The umbrella stand <b>10</b> additionally includes a bottom cap <b>22</b> having a main body <b>48</b> including an opening extending therethrough. A flange <b>50</b> is connected to the main body <b>48</b> and defines an upper clamping surface having an outer diameter that extends beyond that of the main body <b>48</b>. A plurality of ribs <b>52</b> may extend between the flange <b>50</b> and the main body <b>48</b> to enhance gripping of the bottom cap <b>22</b>, and also to provide structural support thereto. The opening in the bottom cap <b>22</b> extends not only through the main body <b>48</b>, but also through the flange <b>50</b>, and thus, the opening extends axially through the entirety of the bottom cap <b>22</b>. The opening may be internally threaded and adapted to engage with the external threads formed on the elongate shaft <b>20</b> to allow for selective positioning of the bottom cap <b>22</b> along the length of the shaft <b>20</b>. In this regard, rotation of the bottom cap <b>22</b> relative to the elongate shaft <b>20</b> in a first rotational direction may result in axial movement of the bottom cap <b>22</b> along the elongate shaft <b>20</b> in a first axial direction. Conversely, rotation of the bottom cap <b>22</b> relative to the elongate shaft <b>20</b> in a second rotational direction, opposite the first rotational direction, may result in axial movement of the bottom cap <b>22</b> along the elongate shaft <b>20</b> in a second axial direction opposite to the first axial direction. The ability to adjust the axial position of the bottom cap <b>22</b> along the elongate shaft <b>20</b> may allow the bottom cap <b>22</b> to accommodate tables <b>12</b> that vary in thickness and apply a clamping force thereto for stabilizing the umbrella stand <b>10</b> to the table <b>12</b>, as will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The umbrella stand <b>10</b> may additionally include at least one pair (and preferably two pairs) of strap assemblies <b>54</b> connected to the base plate <b>16</b> and configured to be connectable to the table <b>12</b> for securing the umbrella stand <b>10</b> to the table <b>12</b>, particularly when the table <b>12</b> does not include a hole which may be used to secure the umbrella stand <b>10</b>. Each strap assembly <b>54</b> may include one of the aforementioned selectively extensible and retractable straps <b>18</b>, each such strap <b>18</b> having a distal end portion connected to a table edge clamp <b>56</b>, and a proximal end portion connected to a spring biased retraction mechanism <b>58</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is an upper perspective views of the retraction mechanism <b>58</b>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is an exploded view of the retraction mechanism <b>58</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The retraction mechanism <b>58</b> includes a main body <b>60</b> having an internal chamber sized to receive most, if not all, of the strap <b>18</b> when the strap <b>18</b> is wound around a spool or rod <b>62</b>. The strap <b>18</b> may be nylon webbing or other strap materials known in the art. The main body <b>60</b> may include a slit or slot formed therein, which allows for passage of the strap <b>18</b> therethrough, as the strap <b>18</b> extends away from the rod <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The rod <b>62</b> includes a first end portion connected to a gear <b>64</b> and a second end portion connected to a plate <b>66</b>. In this regard, rotation of the rod <b>62</b>, as a result of extending or retracting of the strap <b>18</b>, causes rotation of the gear <b>64</b> and the plate <b>66</b>. In particular, extension of the strap <b>18</b> may cause the rod <b>62</b>, gear <b>64</b>, and plate <b>66</b> to rotate in a first rotational direction around a central retraction axis <b>68</b>, as defined by the longitudinal extension of the rod <b>62</b>, while retraction of the strap <b>18</b> may cause the rod <b>62</b>, gear <b>64</b>, and plate <b>66</b> to rotate in a second rotational direction around the central retraction axis <b>68</b>. The rod <b>62</b> may be of sufficient length to extend through the strap <b>18</b> when wound-up, and thus, may be longer than the width of the strap <b>18</b> (i.e., the distance between the opposed, longitudinal edges of the strap <b>18</b>).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The plate <b>66</b>, which is attached to the rod <b>62</b>, opposite the gear <b>64</b>, may be connected to a retraction spring <b>70</b> configured to impart a biasing force on the plate <b>66</b> which urges the plate <b>66</b> to rotate in a direction associated with retraction of the strap <b>18</b>. Thus, the retraction spring <b>70</b> may bias the plate <b>66</b> in the second rotational direction to urge the strap <b>18</b> to retract around the rod <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The gear <b>64</b>, positioned opposite the plate <b>66</b>, may be a circular gear having a plurality of external gear teeth disposed about the central retraction axis <b>68</b>. The gear <b>64</b> may be configured to interface with a lock <b>72</b> having a pawl or finger that is selectively engageable with the gear teeth to prevent rotation of the gear <b>64</b>, as will be described in more detail below. The pawl may be located on a first end portion of the lock <b>72</b>, while an opposing second end portion of the lock <b>72</b> may interface with a torsion spring <b>74</b> which imparts a biasing force on the lock <b>72</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the lock <b>72</b> may be pivotally connected to the main body <b>60</b> to allow for pivotal movement of the lock <b>72</b>, relative to the main body, about a pivot axis <b>76</b> that passes through the lock <b>72</b> between the first end portion and the second end portion. From the perspective shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the lock <b>72</b> may pivot about the pivot axis <b>76</b> in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. The lock <b>72</b> is pivotable in the clockwise direction to assume a locked position, wherein the pawl is engaged with the gear teeth to prevent rotation of the gear <b>64</b>. Pivoting the lock <b>72</b> in the opposing counterclockwise direction may facilitate placing the lock <b>72</b> in an unlocked position, wherein the pawl is disengaged from the gear teeth, which allows for rotation of the gear <b>64</b>. The biasing force imparted on the lock <b>72</b> by the torsion spring <b>74</b> may bias the lock <b>72</b> in the clockwise direction, and thus, toward the locked position.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The lock <b>72</b> may be operatively connected to a button <b>78</b>, or other actuator, which allows for selective manual control of the lock <b>72</b>. The button <b>78</b> may be translatable or moveable relative to the main body <b>60</b> to facilitate movement of the lock <b>72</b> between the locked position and the unlocked position. In particular, the button <b>78</b> may be moved to a first position, wherein the relative position of the button <b>78</b> and the lock <b>72</b> urges the lock <b>72</b> toward the unlocked position. For instance, the button <b>78</b> may engage with the lock <b>72</b> in a manner which overcomes the biasing force of the torsion spring <b>74</b> and forces the lock <b>72</b> to assume the unlocked position such that the pawl is disengaged from the gear teeth. The button <b>78</b> may also be moved to a second position, wherein the relative position of the button <b>78</b> and the lock <b>72</b> allows the lock <b>72</b> to assume the locked position. For instance, when the button <b>78</b> is in the second position, there may be sufficient clearance between the button <b>78</b> and the lock <b>72</b>, such that the biasing force imparted on the lock <b>72</b> by the torsion spring <b>74</b> is able to move the lock <b>72</b> into the locked position. Alternatively, it is also contemplated that the button <b>78</b> and lock <b>72</b> may be configured such that when the button <b>78</b> is in the second position, contact between the button <b>78</b> and the lock <b>72</b> may urge or facilitate placement of the lock <b>72</b> in the locked position.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The button <b>78</b> may be coupled to a button cover <b>80</b>, which may be mounted to the main body <b>60</b>, and which may include an opening <b>82</b> formed therein, which receives the button <b>78</b>. The opening <b>82</b> may be oval shaped and may be sized to allow for translation of the button <b>78</b> therein between the first and second positions.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As noted above, the distal end portion of the strap <b>18</b> is connected to table edge clamp <b>56</b> used to secure the strap <b>18</b> to a peripheral edge of the table <b>12</b>.

The slot <b>106</b> is sized to receive a screw <b>108</b>, which may be advanced through the slot <b>106</b> and received within the threaded hole <b>96</b> formed in the inner extension plate <b>88</b> to facilitate connection between the outer corner bracket <b>86</b> and the inner corner bracket <b>84</b>. When the outer corner bracket <b>86</b> is connected to the inner corner bracket <b>84</b>, the outer clamping plate <b>102</b> may be generally opposed to the inner clamping plate <b>90</b> with the distance therebetween defining a clamping distance.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The table edge clamp <b>56</b> may be configured to allow for selective adjustment of the clamping distance to accommodate use of the table edge clamp <b>56</b> on tables <b>12</b> with varying table thicknesses (e.g., the distance between an upper edge of the table <b>12</b> and a lower edge of the table <b>12</b> at the periphery of the table <b>12</b>). The screw <b>108</b> may slide within the slot <b>106</b> to facilitate adjustment of the clamping distance, by allowing the outer clamping plate <b>102</b> to move relative to the inner clamping plate <b>90</b> along an axis defined by the slot <b>106</b>. When the inner and outer corner brackets <b>84</b>, <b>86</b> have been positioned to define a desired clamping distance, the screw <b>108</b> may be tightened to fix the relative position of the inner and outer corner brackets <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As indicated above, the umbrella stand <b>10</b> may include at least one pair (and preferably two pairs) of strap assemblies <b>54</b> connected to the base plate <b>16</b>.

As the base plate <b>16</b> may be circularly configured, the strap assembles <b>54</b> (four total included in both pairs) may be spaced at intervals of approximately ninety degrees, with the strap assembles <b>54</b> of first pair being diametrically opposed to each other, and the strap assembles <b>54</b> of second pair likewise being diametrically opposed to each other.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The above-described features of the umbrella stand <b>10</b> allow the umbrella stand <b>10</b> to be used in two different modes of use, including a first, central support mode, and a second, peripheral support mode. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows the umbrella stand <b>10</b> in the first, central support mode, with the base plate <b>16</b> resting on top of the table <b>12</b> and the tube <b>24</b> extending upwardly from the base plate <b>16</b>. Although not clearly depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the table <b>12</b> includes a hole, which receives the elongate shaft <b>20</b>, which extends through the hole and protrudes below a lower surface of the table top. The bottom cap <b>22</b> is screwed onto the elongate shaft <b>20</b> and is tightened against the table <b>12</b>, such that the umbrella stand <b>10</b> applies a clamping force on the table <b>12</b> between the base plate <b>16</b> and the flange <b>50</b> of the bottom cap <b>22</b>. The clamping force is sufficient to maintain the position of the umbrella stand <b>10</b> and support an umbrella having a pole <b>14</b> received in the tube <b>24</b>. The use of the umbrella stand <b>10</b> in the first, central support mode may not require use of the extension straps <b>18</b> (though they could still optionally be deployed in the manner described below to supplement the stability of the base plate <b>16</b> facilitated by the use of the bottom cap <b>22</b>). If not used, the table edge clamps <b>56</b> may be stored against the tube <b>24</b> by magnetically connecting the table edge clamps <b>56</b> to the tube <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. When the table edge clamps <b>56</b> are engaged with the tube <b>24</b>, the table edge clamps <b>56</b> may be positioned away from the surface of the table <b>12</b>, in an out-of-the-way location. However, it is contemplated that if the umbrella stand <b>10</b> is to be used exclusively on the same table <b>12</b>, which includes a central hole, and consequently, may not require the ability to transition between the first and second modes, a user may remove the strap assemblies <b>54</b> from the base plate <b>16</b>, or decide against attaching the strap assemblies <b>54</b> to the base plate <b>16</b> at initial assembly of the umbrella stand <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows the umbrella stand <b>10</b> in the second, peripheral support mode.

The umbrella stand <b>10</b> may be secured to the peripheral edge of the table <b>12</b> by extending the straps <b>18</b> from each of the two or four strap assemblies <b>54</b> included on the base plate <b>16</b>. To extend the straps <b>18</b>, the button <b>78</b> on each retraction mechanism <b>58</b> may be moved to its first position to move the internal lock <b>72</b> to its unlocked position, which allows a user to pull on the corresponding strap <b>18</b> with a force sufficient to overcome the biasing force of the retraction spring <b>70</b> to extend the strap <b>18</b> from the main body <b>60</b>. The strap <b>18</b> is extended until the table edge clamp <b>56</b> is beyond the peripheral edge of the table <b>12</b> to allow the table edge clamp <b>56</b> to be positioned adjacent the peripheral edge for adjusting the size of the clamping distance to conform to the thickness of the table <b>12</b>. In particular, the clamping distance may be adjusted to a size which is larger than the thickness of the table <b>12</b> to allow the table edge clamp <b>56</b> to extend over the peripheral edge of the table <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">When the table edge clamp <b>56</b> is positioned at the periphery of the table <b>12</b>, the retraction spring <b>70</b>, acting on the strap <b>18</b>, via the intervening plate <b>66</b> and rod <b>62</b>, may retract any excess slack in the strap <b>18</b> such that the strap <b>18</b> extends between the table edge clamp <b>56</b> and the main body <b>60</b> of the retraction mechanism <b>58</b> under tension. If the clamping distance is only slightly larger than the thickness of the table <b>12</b>, the tension in the strap <b>18</b>, and the appropriately sized configuration of the table edge clamp <b>56</b>, may collectively retain the table edge clamp <b>56</b> against the periphery of the table <b>12</b>. However, if the clamping distance is too big, the clamping distance can be reduced to more closely conform to the thickness of the table <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Once the table edge clamp <b>56</b> is in place, and the strap <b>18</b> is sufficiently tensioned, the button <b>78</b> may be moved to its second position to lock the strap <b>18</b> in place. In this regard, extension or retraction of the strap <b>18</b> may be prevented while the button <b>78</b> remains in the second position.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">This engagement process may be repeated for the strap(s) <b>18</b> and clamp(s) <b>56</b> of the one remaining strap assembly <b>54</b>, or three remaining strap assembles <b>54</b>, included on the umbrella stand <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">When the umbrella stand <b>10</b> is connected to the table <b>12</b> in the second, peripheral support mode, the umbrella stand <b>10</b> is supported on the table <b>12</b> via the base plate <b>16</b>.
