While specific implementations are discussed, it should be understood that this is done for illustration purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other components and configurations may be used without parting from the spirit and scope of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Basic security features of a payment card can include a unique account number, signature panel, expiration date, magnetic stripe, security code, etc. Some payment cards also include a user photo or use a virtual card number or a temporary purchase number as additional security features. Despite all these security features, however, use of a payment card is still not entirely secure, with exposure of the account number printed on the payment card being one of the greatest security vulnerabilities.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">There is a need for improved methods for providing and using a payment card. In one example, a payment card comprises a card substrate and a personalization layer overlaying the card substrate. The personalization layer comprises at least a first region and a second region. The first region includes an account number associated with an account of a user, and the account of the user is maintained by a payment service system that issues the payment card. At least one of the first region or the second region includes a thermochromic ink. The thermochromic ink is an ink that changes color when a temperature increases or decreases. When heat is applied to the first region or the second region of the payment card having the thermochromic ink (e.g., when the user touches the first or second region), a color of the thermochromic ink in the first and/or second region may change. As a result, the account number can be revealed. In some examples, the first region and the second region are substantially identical in color at room temperature such that the account number included in the first region is invisible at room temperature.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Additionally or alternatively, in some examples, the payment card includes a heating element coupled to a near field communication (NFC) chip embedded in the payment card. The heating element can cause a temperature of the payment card to change in response to a signal received from the NFC chip, and the NFC chip can send the signal in response to an interaction of the user with a mobile application executing on a device of the user. Thus, the temperature and the color of the payment card can be controlled by a user interaction on the device of the user (e.g., a mobile phone) and/or through a physical touching of the payment card by the user.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, in some examples, a temperature reading of the payment card can be determined (e.g., based on the color of the payment card) and then used to identify a location of the payment card. The location of the payment card during a transaction helps validate the transaction, for example, by confirming that the color of the card is consistent with the temperature in an expected location of the card. Also, biometric information of the user using the payment card can be obtained to control the temperature adjustment of the payment card by the heating element and to further control whether to reveal or conceal information embedded on the card (e.g., the account number of the payment card), or information shown with a graphical display area of the payment card.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Advantageously, the technology described herein solves an information exposure problem of payment cards. Currently, an account number of a payment card can be easily exposed to strangers, either by unintentional exposure (e.g., the account number is accidentally captured by a photo shared in social networks) or by intentional interception (e.g., the number is remembered and stolen by a person seeing the card). The present technology embeds a security feature where the account number is obfuscated at or around room temperature and is revealed only when the temperature is changed, for example, when a user touches the card or the card is heated with the heating element. This can prevent the account number or other card information from being exposed to people who have a view of the card.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, the present technology embeds additional layers of security features, such as preventing fraudulent transactions based on location detection using the temperature and color of the payment card, preventing information exposure of the payment card from physical touch of unauthorized users, etc. In general, using the thermo-sensitive payment card in a payment service platform as described herein reduces network congestion (e.g., by reducing the degree of fraudulent transactions) and improves privacy, security, and accuracy associated with handling and using the payment card.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The following description provides specific details for a thorough understanding and an enabling description of these implementations. One skilled in the art will understand, however, that the disclosed system and methods may be practiced without many of these details. Additionally, some well-known structures or functions may not be shown or described in detail, so as to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the relevant description of the various implementations. The terminology used in the description presented below is intended to be interpreted in its broadest reasonable manner, even though it is being used in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific implementations of the disclosed system and methods. Some frequently used terms are now described.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The phrases &#x201c;in some examples,&#x201d; &#x201c;according to various examples,&#x201d; &#x201c;in the examples shown,&#x201d; &#x201c;in one example,&#x201d; &#x201c;in other examples,&#x201d; &#x201c;various examples,&#x201d; &#x201c;some examples,&#x201d; and the like generally mean the particular feature, structure, or characteristic following the phrase is included in at least one example of the present invention, and may be included in more than one example of the present invention. In addition, such phrases do not necessarily refer to the same examples or to different examples.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">If the specification states a component or feature &#x201c;may,&#x201d; &#x201c;can,&#x201d; &#x201c;could,&#x201d; or &#x201c;might&#x201d; be included or have a characteristic, that particular component or feature is not required to be included or have the characteristic.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The term &#x201c;module&#x201d; refers broadly to software stored on non-transitory storage medium (e.g., volatile or non-volatile memory for a computing device), hardware, or firmware (or any combination thereof) modules. Modules are typically functional such that they that may generate useful data or other output using specified input(s). A module may or may not be self-contained. An application program (also called an &#x201c;application&#x201d;) may include one or more modules, or a module may include one or more application programs.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In various examples, &#x201c;room temperature&#x201d; can be about 20&#xb0; C. (68&#xb0; F.), can range from about 20&#xb0; C. to about 22&#xb0; C. (72&#xb0; F.), can range from about 20&#xb0; C. to about 25&#xb0; C. (77&#xb0; F.), or can range from about 15&#xb0; C.

Accordingly, the above-described features are merely examples and should not be construed as limiting in any way. Other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter described herein will become apparent from the following description of Figures and Claims.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a payment service network <b>100</b> in accordance with one example embodiment. According to one example, payment service network <b>100</b> includes merchant <b>102</b> that conducts transactions with customer <b>104</b> (or user <b>104</b>) for items <b>106</b> (e.g., goods or services) offered by the merchant <b>102</b>. The payment service network <b>100</b> includes a payment service system <b>108</b> (also referred to as &#x201c;payment service&#x201d; or &#x201c;PSS&#x201d;) coupled to a merchant point of sale (POS) device <b>105</b> and customer device <b>103</b> via a network <b>110</b>, to authorize payment instruments of customer <b>104</b>. Customer <b>104</b> may engage in transactions with merchant <b>102</b> to obtain items <b>106</b>. Customer <b>104</b> may provide, as shown at <b>112</b>, payment instruments to merchant <b>102</b> along with requests for items <b>106</b> offered by merchant <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In various examples, the payment service system <b>108</b> can be or include an online platform for processing payments <b>126</b> as described herein. The payment service system <b>108</b> or online platform can utilize or include one or more server computers, which can be referred to herein as platform servers or payment servers.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Merchant <b>102</b> may utilize POS device <b>105</b> for accepting payment from customer <b>104</b>. POS device <b>105</b> may be any mobile or non-mobile device that includes instances of a POS application that executes on the POS device <b>105</b>. The instances of the POS application may be or include a downloadable application provided by the payment service system <b>108</b>, or embedded software running on an all-in-one POS device provided by the payment service system <b>108</b>. POS device <b>105</b> may further include a wireless communication module with wireless communication capabilities (e.g., NFC, Bluetooth, cellular data, etc.), allowing wireless communication between POS device <b>105</b> and other devices with wireless communication capabilities. For example, POS device <b>105</b> may have an NFC-enabled chip that communicates with other NFC-enabled devices. The POS application may be provided by the payment service <b>108</b> and provide POS functionality to POS device <b>105</b> to enable merchant <b>102</b> (e.g., a business or owners, employees, or agents of the business) to accept payments from customer <b>104</b>. In some types of businesses, POS device <b>105</b> may correspond to a store, restaurant, website, or other place of business of the merchant, and thus, may be a fixed location that typically does not change on a day-to-day basis, or may correspond to an Internet commerce site. In other types of businesses, however, the location of POS device <b>105</b> may change from time to time, such when the merchant operates a food truck, is a street vendor, is a cab driver, etc., or has an otherwise mobile business, e.g., in the case of a merchant who sells goods or services at buyers' homes, places of business, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As used herein, a merchant may include any business engaged in the offering of goods or services for acquisition by customers. Actions attributed to a merchant may include actions performed by owners, employees, website servers, or other agents of the merchant, and thus no distinction is made herein unless specifically discussed. In addition, as used herein, the customer <b>104</b> may include any entity that acquires goods or services from a merchant, such as by purchasing, renting, leasing, borrowing, licensing, or the like. Hereinafter, goods and/or services offered by merchants may be referred to as items, e.g., item <b>106</b>. Thus, a merchant and a customer may interact with each other to conduct a transaction in which the customer acquires item <b>106</b> from merchant <b>102</b>, and in return, customer <b>104</b> provides payment <b>112</b> to merchant <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As used herein, a transaction may include a financial transaction conducted between customer <b>104</b> and merchant <b>102</b>. For example, when paying for a transaction, customer <b>104</b> can provide the amount that is due to the merchant using cash or other payment instrument <b>112</b> (e.g., a debit card, a credit card, a stored-value gift card, a check, through an electronic payment application on device <b>103</b> carried by the customer, or the like). The merchant can interact with POS device <b>105</b> to process the transactions, such as by inputting (e.g., manually, via a magnetic card reader, NFC reader, or an RFID reader, etc.) identifiers associated with payment instrument <b>112</b>. For example, a payment instrument of the customer may include a card having one or more magnetic strips for providing card and customer information when swiped in a card reader. In other examples, other types of payment instruments may be used, such as smart cards having a built-in memory chip that is read by the device when the card is inserted into the reader, such as chips that comply with the Europay, MasterCard, and/or Visa (EMV) standard (e.g., EMV cards). In other examples, other types of payment instruments include cards or computing devices that communicate via radiofrequencies such as radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, near field communication (NFC) devices, etc.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">During the transaction, POS device <b>105</b> can determine transaction information describing the transaction, such as an identifier of the payment instrument (e.g., payment card number, account credentials, or other payment device identifier), an amount of payment received from the customer, the item(s) acquired by the customer, a time, location (e.g., street address, GPS coordinates, IP address, etc.) and date of the transaction, a payment card network <b>140</b> associated with the payment instrument, an issuing bank of the payment instrument, a name or user account of the customer, contact information of the customer, type of currency, IP address of POS device <b>105</b>, IP address of customer device <b>103</b>, and so forth. POS device <b>105</b> can send the transaction information to payment service <b>108</b> over network <b>110</b> (e.g., including the Internet), either substantially contemporaneously with the conducting of the transaction (in the case of online transactions) or later when POS device <b>105</b> is in the online mode (in the case offline transactions).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an offline transaction, POS device <b>105</b> may store information related to the transaction, including, but not limited to, a cost of the transaction, a time of day at which the transaction occurred, a day of the week at which the transaction occurred, a location at which the transaction took place, an item that the customer obtained, an identity and/or contact information of the customer, and a payment instrument used in the transaction. After conducting an offline transaction with customer <b>104</b>, POS device <b>105</b> may provide at least a subset of the stored information to the payment service <b>108</b> over the network <b>110</b>. The network <b>110</b> may represent or include any one or more wired or wireless networks, such as a Wi-Fi network, a cellular network, the Internet, or the like. In an online transaction, POS device <b>105</b> may send this information to payment service <b>108</b> over network <b>110</b> substantially contemporaneously with the transaction with the customer <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">After merchant <b>102</b> receives the payment information from customer <b>104</b>, merchant <b>102</b> may send respective authorization requests, along with information related to the respective transactions, to payment service <b>108</b>, as illustrated at <b>114</b>. Payment service <b>108</b> may include payment processing service <b>126</b> and data store <b>128</b> that stores merchant accounts <b>130</b> and user accounts <b>132</b>, as well as the transaction histories of merchants and users.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The payment processing service <b>126</b> may function to receive the information regarding a transaction from POS device <b>105</b> of merchant <b>102</b> and attempt to authorize the payment instrument <b>112</b> used to conduct the transaction. Payment processing service <b>126</b> may then send an indication of whether the payment instrument has been approved or declined back to POS device <b>105</b>, as illustrated at <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Generally, when a customer <b>104</b> and a merchant <b>102</b> enter into an electronic payment transaction, the transaction is processed by electronically transferring funds from a financial account associated with the customer <b>104</b> to a financial account associated with the merchant <b>102</b>. As such, the payment processing service <b>126</b> may communicate with one or more computing devices of a payment card network <b>140</b> (e.g., MasterCard&#xae; or VISA&#xae;) over network(s) <b>110</b> to conduct financial transactions electronically. Payment processing service <b>126</b> can also communicate with one or more computing devices of one or more banks, processing/acquiring services, or the like over the network <b>110</b>. For example, payment processing service <b>126</b> may communicate with an acquiring bank, an issuing bank, and/or a bank maintaining user accounts for electronic payments. Payment processing service <b>126</b> may also communicate with, or access user and merchant accounts maintained by payment service <b>108</b>. In some examples, the payment processing service <b>126</b> can communicate with one or more entities that perform or manage securities transactions and/or cryptocurrency transactions.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">An acquiring bank may be a registered member of a card association (e.g., Visa&#xae; or MasterCard&#xae;) and/or may be part of a payment card network <b>140</b>. An issuing bank may issue credit cards to buyers (e.g., customer <b>104</b>) and may pay acquiring banks for purchases made by cardholders (e.g., customer <b>104</b>) to which the issuing bank has issued a payment card. Accordingly, in some examples, the computing device(s) of an acquiring bank may be included in the payment card network and may communicate with the computing devices of a card-issuing bank to obtain payment. Further, in some examples, the customer <b>104</b> may use a debit card instead of a credit card, in which case, the bank computing device(s) of a bank corresponding to the debit card may receive communications regarding a transaction in which the customer is participating. Additionally, there may be computing devices of other financial institutions involved in some types of transactions or in alternative system architectures, and thus, the foregoing are merely several examples for discussion purposes.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates merchants <b>102</b> sending the transaction data directly to the payment service <b>108</b> as part of the request to authorize the payment instrument <b>112</b>, in some instances other entities (e.g., banks associated with the merchant <b>102</b> or with customer payment instruments <b>112</b>) may provide transaction data, such as part of a batched, periodic process.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to one example, data store <b>128</b> may be used to store merchant accounts <b>130</b> and user accounts <b>132</b>, among other data. User accounts <b>132</b> may store records of user accounts associated with each user of payment service <b>108</b>. For example, user accounts <b>132</b> may include a first user account <b>134</b> and a second user account <b>136</b>. Each of the accounts of user accounts <b>132</b> may include information related to the respective balance and transaction history associated with each user account. Each of the user accounts <b>132</b> may include one or more balances associated with a payment service and further include access to external bank accounts. For example, first user account <b>134</b> includes transaction account <b>135</b> and investment account <b>138</b>, and second user account <b>136</b> includes transaction account <b>137</b> and investment account <b>139</b>. According to one example, transaction accounts <b>135</b> and <b>137</b> may include stored balances maintained by payment service <b>108</b> on behalf of its users. Investment accounts <b>138</b> and <b>139</b> may be used by users to save a stored balance towards a particular goal or otherwise to allow payment service <b>108</b> to maintain an investment on behalf of its users. Each user account <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> of user accounts <b>132</b> may also include a loan account representing funds that are loaned to the user by the payment service <b>108</b>. Each user account <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> of user accounts <b>132</b> may further include access to external payment card networks (e.g., payment card network <b>140</b>) to facilitate transactions with credit cards, debit cards, and the like.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Furthermore, transaction history for each user account may be stored using an individual log for each user account. For example, first user account <b>134</b> includes transaction activity log <b>142</b> and second user account <b>136</b> includes transaction activity log <b>144</b>. Transaction activity logs <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> may be used to store transaction history for each respective user account, including debits and credits made to the balances thereof. Similarly, transaction history for merchants may be stored in merchant accounts <b>130</b> using an individual log for each merchant.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to one example, each of the user accounts <b>132</b> may include stored values of multiple currencies, such as fiat currency, cryptocurrency, equity value, or other monetary value represented by digital assets. Each of the currencies may be stored directly in each account of user accounts <b>132</b>. Each of the user accounts <b>132</b> may further include access to external accounts that facilitate such currencies (e.g., third party cryptocurrency exchanges/wallets, equity holding accounts, etc.).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to one example, merchant accounts <b>130</b> may store information associated with respective ones of the merchants <b>102</b>. For instance, the merchant accounts <b>130</b> may indicate a class of items offered by respective merchants (e.g., coffee items, collectibles, apparel, etc.), a type of business of the merchant (e.g., restaurant, coffee shop, retail store, etc.), a geographical location of the merchant, and the like.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some instances, a computing device associated with the merchant (e.g., POS device <b>105</b>, servers of the merchant, etc.) determines when the customer visits physical premises or a digital presence of the merchant. For instance, the device <b>103</b> of the customer <b>104</b> may include an application (e.g., an application provided by payment service <b>108</b>) that communicates with POS device <b>105</b> of merchant <b>102</b> via near-field communication protocols (e.g., NFC, Bluetooth, etc.). Therefore, when the customer visits the physical premises of merchant <b>102</b>, for example, POS device <b>105</b> may detect the presence of customer device <b>103</b>. The POS device <b>105</b> may accordingly determine that the customer <b>104</b> is present. In another example, one or both of POS device <b>105</b> and customer device <b>103</b> may share its location (e.g., GPS coordinates) to a common service for determining when customer device <b>103</b> and POS device <b>105</b> are located within a proximity threshold of one another, and for mediating a transaction between customer device <b>103</b> and POS device <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In another example, customer <b>104</b> may utilize customer device <b>103</b> to check in at the merchant location, and POS device <b>105</b> may receive an indication of this check in. When the customer visits a digital presence of merchant <b>102</b> (e.g., mobile app, website, etc.), customer <b>104</b> may log in or otherwise provide information (e.g., a cookie on the device <b>103</b>) from which the merchant <b>102</b> determines that the customer <b>104</b> is at the merchant location. Of course, while a few examples are listed, it is to be appreciated that the merchant <b>102</b> and/or payment service <b>108</b> may determine when the customer <b>104</b> is present at the merchant location in any other number of ways. In each instance, after payment service <b>108</b> receives an indication that customer <b>104</b> is co-located with merchant <b>102</b>, the payment service <b>108</b> may determine whether to send one or more previously expressed item preferences of the customer <b>104</b> to the merchant <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, customer <b>104</b> may desire to receive an instance of a payments application, such as a mobile wallet application, from the payment service <b>108</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates that the customer <b>104</b> may send payment-application requests <b>118</b> to payment service <b>108</b>. In response, payment service <b>108</b> may provide instances of the application <b>120</b> back to customer device <b>103</b>. In addition, payment service <b>108</b> may map an identification of the instance of the application <b>120</b> to the user accounts <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a mobile device and payment application <b>200</b> in accordance with one example embodiment. Mobile device <b>202</b> and POS device <b>206</b> may be computing devices with wireless communication modules <b>203</b> and <b>207</b>, respectively, with wireless communication capabilities (e.g., NFC, Bluetooth, cellular data, etc.), allowing wireless communication therebetween. A payment application <b>204</b> is a payment application provided by the payment service <b>210</b> and executes on a user's mobile device <b>202</b>. POS device <b>206</b> can include a Point of Sale (POS) application <b>208</b> that is associated with one or more merchant systems and can be used by the customer to purchase products or services. The payment application <b>204</b> and POS application <b>208</b> can also be a website provided by payment service <b>210</b> (e.g., payment service <b>108</b>), or any source website or application that provides a portal to send and accept payments for transactions using payment service <b>210</b>. Applications <b>204</b> and <b>208</b> may be accessible through a web browser (e.g., Chrome&#xae; or Safari&#xae;) on the mobile device <b>202</b>, according to one example. In another example, applications <b>204</b> and <b>208</b> can be software applications downloadable via an application store (e.g., Google Play Store&#xae;, Apple App Store&#xae;, etc.). Once accessed or registered into the applications <b>204</b> and <b>208</b>, the web browser or application may remember the credentials (e.g., identification data <b>205</b>) for subsequent visits (for example, through web browser authentication, web cookies, web history, etc.), allowing access to the applications without logging-in to an account again. The description herein is with reference to the payment application <b>204</b> and POS application <b>208</b> as installed applications; however, it will be understood that these applications as authenticated or unauthenticated applications on a web browser is within the meaning of the term. In various examples, the mobile device <b>202</b>, the POS device <b>206</b>, and/or the payment service <b>210</b> can be the same as or can include the customer device <b>103</b>, the POS device <b>105</b>, and/or the payment service <b>108</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Payment application <b>204</b> can include an electronic wallet application, money transfer application (e.g., application for sending and receiving money via email or phone), or any other application having stored therein identification data <b>205</b> linked to user accounts of payment service <b>210</b> or other data linked to one or more payment cards and/or bank accounts, both of which may be used by the owner of the mobile device to initiate transactions. Such transactions can include traditional purchase transactions between customers and merchants or service providers, person-to-person transactions, and the like.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Payment application <b>204</b> can also be used to manage internal payment cards (i.e., virtual payment cards issued by payment service <b>108</b> to users having a user account <b>132</b>). As such, options with respect to internal payment cards can be adjusted and managed using payment application <b>204</b>. For example, when a user account of user accounts <b>132</b> includes multiple payment methods (e.g., credit card, bank account, loan account, etc.), payment application <b>204</b> can set one of those payment methods to be the default method for debits or credits when using an internal payment card. In one example, the color of the virtual card as displayed with the mobile application may change dynamically to match the current color of the physical thermo-sensitive payment card. For example, the mobile payment application <b>204</b> may communicate with a physical payment card <b>212</b> using Bluetooth, NFC, or other wireless communication protocol via onboard electronics embedded within a structure of the payment card <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Collectively, all tools for offering payment are herein referred to as payment instruments. For example, payment instruments can refer to mobile device <b>202</b> running payment application <b>204</b>, internal payment cards, external payment cards, NFC-enabled payment cards, etc. The use of the term payment instrument does not imply a mechanism of use. For example, mobile device <b>202</b> may be utilized via NFC protocols (e.g., NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF), NFC tags, etc.), or via use of software on mobile device <b>202</b> to send messages through web forms, applications, APIs, or messaging applications. As an additional example, payment cards, whether internal (e.g., virtual cards) or external (e.g., physical cards), can be presented to a merchant to be read, or a card number can be entered into a terminal under the control of the merchant or under the control of the customer. A payment instrument can include multiple payment instruments, such as when utilizing mobile device <b>202</b> to enter a payment card number. Throughout this description, specific payment instruments may be discussed, however, the specific payment instruments should not be considered limiting, and persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate instances in which a payment instrument such as a payment card can be substituted for another payment instrument such as a mobile device, and vice versa.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Thermochromic Payment Card</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The customer <b>104</b> (or user <b>104</b>) makes payment to a merchant <b>102</b> through a payment instrument <b>112</b> when conducting a transaction for acquiring item(s) <b>106</b> (e.g., goods or service) from the merchant <b>102</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The payment instrument can be a payment card <b>112</b> such as a credit card, a debit card, a gift card, or the like. In certain examples, the payment card <b>112</b> can be a thermochromic payment card that includes a thermochromic ink in one or more regions of the payment card. The thermochromic ink can be or include an ink, coating, material, and/or pigment that changes color when temperatures increase or decrease. For example, when heat is applied to a region of the payment card <b>112</b> having the thermochromic ink (e.g., by the user <b>104</b> touching or pressing finger(s) on the region and transferring body heat to the card <b>112</b>), the color of the thermochromic ink and the region having the thermochromic ink can change. If the region stores any information (e.g., through a printed pattern of the thermochromic ink), the color change of the thermochromic ink can affect the visibility of the stored information. Thus, by controlling and/or adjusting a temperature of the thermochromic ink on the payment card <b>112</b>, there exists a feasible and efficient way to control and secure the display of the information stored in the payment card <b>112</b>, such as an account number of the payment card <b>112</b>. An example payment card <b>112</b> and associated packaging materials and methods are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>9</b>C</figref> and described below.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a graphic representation of a top or bottom surface of a payment card <b>112</b> at room temperature, in accordance with certain examples. The payment card <b>112</b> includes at least a first region <b>302</b> and a second region <b>304</b>. The first region <b>302</b> can include or correspond to an account number associated with an account of a user. The account of the user can be maintained by a payment service system (e.g., payment service system <b>108</b>) that issues the payment card <b>112</b>. The second region <b>304</b> can include or correspond to certain background portions of the payment card <b>112</b>, such as regions around or adjacent to characters of the account number. In some examples, the second region <b>304</b> can surround the first region <b>302</b> and/or be immediately adjacent to one another. In other examples, the first region <b>302</b> and the second region <b>304</b> can be separated and/or not adjacent to one another.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In certain examples, the first region <b>302</b> and the second region <b>304</b> of the payment card <b>112</b> are designed to be substantially identical in color at room temperature. Since different thermochromic inks can have different colors at different temperatures, a type of thermochromic ink is chosen to ensure the first region <b>302</b> and the second region <b>304</b> are substantially identical color at room temperature. The purpose of such design is to provide a security feature for hiding certain information of the payment card <b>112</b> when the payment card <b>112</b> is left exposed and untouched at an ambient or room temperature, thereby avoiding unnecessary or inadvertent information exposure. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the first region <b>302</b> and the second region <b>304</b> are of similar color (e.g., at room temperature) such that the account number in the first region <b>302</b> is hidden in the background and/or not visible. When the temperature of the first region <b>302</b> or the second region <b>304</b> changes, the colors of the two regions can become differentiated so as to reveal the account number in the first region <b>302</b>. In other words, the account number can be obfuscated unless, for example, a user touches the card <b>112</b> or heat is otherwise applied to the card <b>112</b>. The body heat of the user's finger(s) can cause the color of the first region <b>302</b> or the second region <b>304</b> to change so that the account number stands out or is perceptible.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B-<b>3</b>D</figref> are graphic representations of the payment card <b>112</b> upon application of heat, in accordance with certain examples. In some examples, the first region <b>302</b> includes the thermochromic ink and the second region <b>304</b> does not include the thermochromic ink. Alternatively or additionally, the thermochromic ink can be included in the second region <b>304</b> but not in the first region <b>302</b>, or both regions <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> can include a thermochromic ink (e.g., a different thermochromic ink in each region). In some examples, the first region <b>302</b> is a region containing private or sensitive information of the payment card <b>112</b>. In addition to or instead of including the account number of the payment card <b>112</b>, the first region <b>302</b> can include a subregion <b>308</b> of expiration date information, a subregion <b>310</b> of card verification value (CVV) information, and/or other subregion(s) of other account data (not shown). When a user <b>104</b> touches the payment card <b>112</b>, body heat from the user can change the temperature of a thermochromic ink in the card <b>112</b>, which can cause the color of the thermochromic ink to change.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates an example in which the account number in the first region <b>302</b> includes a thermochromic ink and other regions of the card <b>112</b>, including the second region <b>304</b> and a background region <b>306</b>, do not include a thermochromic ink. Compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the application of heat has caused the color of the account number in the first region <b>302</b> to change and become visible relative to colors in the second region <b>304</b> and the background region <b>306</b>, which do not include a thermochromic ink and have not changed color. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the expiration date in the subregion <b>308</b> of the first region <b>302</b> and the CVV in the subregion <b>310</b> of the first region <b>302</b> may not include the thermochromic ink and/or heat may not have been applied to these subregions, such that the color of the expiration date and the CVV has not changed to reveal the expiration date and CVV information. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> indicates that the color of the first region <b>302</b> can become lighter upon application of heat, it is understood that the thermochromic inks described herein can become darker and/or change hue upon application of heat, in various examples.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> illustrates an example in which the account number, the expiration date and the CVV in the first region <b>302</b> include a thermochromic ink and other regions of the card <b>112</b>, including the second region <b>304</b> and the background region <b>306</b>, do not include a thermochromic ink. Compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, responsive to the application of heat, not only has the account number become visible, but the expiration date in the subregion <b>308</b> and the CVV in the subregion <b>310</b> have also become visible.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> illustrates an example in which the second region <b>304</b> includes a thermochromic ink and the first region <b>302</b> and the background region <b>306</b> do not include a thermochromic ink. Compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the application of heat has caused the color of the second region <b>304</b> to change relative to colors in the first region <b>302</b> and the background region <b>306</b>, which do not include a thermochromic ink and have not changed color. Because the second region <b>304</b> immediately surrounds the first region <b>302</b> in this example, the color change in the second region <b>304</b> renders the account number in the first region <b>302</b> visible.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> illustrates an example in which the first region <b>302</b> and the second region <b>304</b> each includes a different thermochromic ink and the background region <b>306</b> does not include a thermochromic ink. Compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the application of heat has caused the color of the first region <b>302</b> to become lighter and the color of the second region <b>304</b> to become darker, such that the account number in the first region <b>302</b> is visible. The color in the background section <b>306</b> has not changed in this example.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">A secure information exposure mechanism is therefore established based on a security feature of using a type of thermochromic ink that allows an account number or other information on a payment card to be (i) invisible when the card is not in use or is at or near room temperature and (ii) visible when the card is in use, held by a user, or at a temperature above or below room temperature, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref>. While a physical touch of the payment card can be used to heat the card, in other examples, signals can be generated (as described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) to change the temperature of the thermochromic ink embedded in or on the payment card, and further to change a color of the card and render the card number or other information visible based on the color change.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Payment Card Components</heading><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a payment card <b>112</b>, in accordance with certain examples. The payment card <b>112</b> can be made of multiple layers or plastic or other materials laminated together. In certain examples, the payment card <b>112</b> includes at least a card substrate <b>402</b> and a personalization layer <b>404</b>. The card substrate <b>402</b> may include important card information used in conducting financial transactions and/or security features used for preventing unauthorized or fraudulent card uses. For example, the card substrate <b>402</b> may include a magnetic stripe that is encoded with binary information for identifying the card as an authentic card associated with an account of a user. In the depicted example, the card substrate <b>402</b> includes a heating element <b>410</b>, a near field communication (NFC) chip <b>412</b>, a temperature sensor <b>416</b>, and a battery <b>418</b>. The personalization layer <b>404</b> may include card information customized for the account of the user (e.g., an account number and/or the user's name) and additional security features. For example, the personalization layer <b>404</b> can include a first region <b>302</b>, a second region <b>304</b>, and a biometric element <b>414</b>. The first region <b>302</b> can include the account number or other information associated with the account of the user. The account number or other information can be printed or coated on the personalization layer <b>404</b> and/or on an outer surface or inner layer of the card <b>112</b>. The second region <b>304</b> can include one or more background portions of the payment card <b>112</b>, such as regions surrounding or adjacent to the first region <b>302</b>. The first region <b>302</b> and/or the second region <b>304</b> can include a thermochromic ink, as described herein. In some examples, the account number of the payment card <b>112</b> is obfuscated at or near room temperature and is revealed when a user touches the payment card <b>112</b> or when the temperature of the card is otherwise changed (e.g., in response to temperature-changing signals). The heating element <b>410</b>, the NFC chip <b>412</b>, the biometric element <b>414</b>, the temperature sensor <b>416</b>, and the battery <b>418</b> are depicted in dash-lined boxes to indicate that these components can be optional or can reside in other layers of the payment card <b>112</b>. For example, additionally or alternatively, the heating element <b>410</b> can be embedded in the personalization layer <b>404</b> and/or the biometric element can be embedded in the card substrate <b>402</b>, while the temperature sensor <b>416</b> can be optional.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The heating element <b>410</b> is configured to change a temperature of the payment card <b>112</b>. In certain examples, the heating element <b>410</b> is coupled to the NFC chip <b>412</b> embedded in the payment card <b>112</b>. The heating element <b>410</b> receives a signal from the NFC chip <b>412</b> to change the temperature of the payment card <b>112</b>. The NFC chip <b>412</b> communicates with a mobile application executing on a device of the user, e.g., a mobile device <b>103</b>. Based on an interaction of the user with the mobile application, the NFC chip <b>412</b> is configured to receive a signal from the mobile application and transmit a signal to the heating element <b>410</b> to cause the heating element <b>410</b> to change the temperature of the payment card <b>112</b>. For example, a user can set up an alert using the mobile application executing on his/her mobile phone. When an alert event happens, e.g., a credit limit of the payment card <b>112</b> is reached or a transaction using the payment card <b>112</b> fails, the mobile application can generate a signal and transmit the signal to the heating element <b>410</b> through the NFC chip <b>412</b>. Responsive to receiving the signal, the heating element <b>410</b> can heat up one or more regions of the payment card <b>112</b> having the thermochromic ink to change the color of the one or more regions. The changed color of the payment card <b>112</b> provides a visually distinctive alert that calls the user's attention.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Typically, the heating element <b>410</b> and the battery <b>418</b> work together to change a color of the payment card <b>112</b>. The heating element <b>410</b> along with the battery <b>418</b>, in certain examples, can be configured to perform localized heating to a specific region of the payment card <b>112</b> having a thermochromic ink to reveal a message or a card/account number. Therefore, even if another region of the payment card <b>112</b> also has the thermochromic ink, only the specific region where the temperature was increased by the heating element <b>410</b> may change color. In some examples, the heating element <b>410</b> can be configured to receive a signal specifying the color and/or temperature from the mobile application via the NFC chip <b>412</b>, and to change the temperature and color of the payment card <b>112</b> according to different signals. For example, if a credit limit is reached, the heating element <b>410</b> can receive a first signal specifying a first temperature and change the color of a region of the payment card <b>112</b> to red based on the first signal. In another example, if a transaction fails due to insufficient funds, the heating element <b>410</b> can receive a second signal specifying a second temperature and change the color of a region of the payment card <b>112</b> (e.g., the same region) to purple based on the second signal. The card temperature can be chosen such that a resulting color reflects or matches an event of a specific type and/or is associated with a specific merchant. For example, when a determination is made (e.g., by the mobile application) that the payment card is in, near, or being used to make a purchase with a particular merchant, the temperature can be adjusted to achieve a color that matches a color used by the merchant (e.g., as part of trademark or trade dress used by the merchant). In various examples, the colors achievable by a thermochromic ink used in the card can be mapped to specific temperatures (e.g., using a lookup table or mathematical function). Such a mapping can be developed by measuring colors for a variety of colors. Additionally or alternatively, the heating element can perform localized heating of the card to achieve localized temperature changes that present messages to the user. Such messages can include, for example, one or more letters or numbers, a trademark or logo (e.g., for a merchant), and/or information related to an account balance or a recent transaction.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Advantageously, the heating element <b>410</b> combined with the NFC chip <b>412</b> and the mobile application allows the temperature and color of a payment card to be changed without requiring a user to touch the payment card. This automatic color change of the payment card can be used to provide a user with messages, notify a user of issues related to the payment card (e.g., credit or security issues), and/or remind the user to take timely actions. Such notifications can be particularly advantageous in reducing computer and network resource usage and improving user experience.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In certain examples, the payment card <b>112</b> includes the temperature sensor <b>416</b>, which can be part of the heating element <b>410</b> or separate from the heating element <b>410</b>. The temperature sensor <b>416</b> can be configured to obtain a temperature reading of the payment card <b>112</b> and transmit the reading via the NFC chip <b>412</b> to another component and/or device for processing. For example, the temperature sensor <b>416</b> can generate a temperature reading during a transaction involving the payment card <b>112</b> and pass the reading to the NFC chip <b>412</b> for transmitting to a mobile application executing on the device of the user. In certain examples, responsive to receiving the temperature reading, at least one of the device of the user (e.g., mobile device <b>103</b>) or the payment service system <b>108</b> communicating with the mobile device <b>103</b> can use the temperature reading to confirm a physical location of the payment card <b>112</b> during the transaction, and then continue, stop, or report the transaction based on the confirmed physical location. Suppose, for example, that the payment card <b>112</b> is being used to make a transaction at a farmer's market or other outdoor location on the northeastern coast of the United States during winter. If the temperature reading of the payment card <b>112</b> is higher than an expected or actual outdoor temperature at the location, the temperature reading can indicate that the card is not physically present at the location, and this can indicate that the pending transaction is fraudulent. Thus, the mobile application or the payment service system <b>108</b> can stop the transaction, report the transaction, and/or recommend that action be taken (e.g., by the merchant) to confirm that the transaction is not fraudulent. On the other hand, a low temperature reading can indicate that the payment card <b>112</b> is being exposed to a temperature that is consistent with the location of the pending transaction. In such instances, the mobile device <b>103</b> or the payment service system <b>108</b> can permit the transaction to proceed.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some examples, a camera, rather than the temperature sensor <b>416</b> included in the payment card <b>112</b>, can be used to obtain a temperature reading of the payment card <b>112</b>. A user can use the camera associated with the device of the user (e.g., a mobile phone camera) to take a picture of the payment card <b>112</b> involved in a transaction and communicate the picture to a mobile application of the device of the user. The mobile application can then detect the temperature of the payment card <b>112</b> based on the color of the card (e.g., black indicates the temperature is 50-60&#xb0; F., or red indicates the temperature is 70-80&#xb0; F.). Such information can be used to determine whether the payment card is being used in an expected location for a pending transaction. Based on the determined temperature or physical location of the payment card <b>112</b>, the mobile application or the payment service system <b>108</b> can determine whether to continue, stop, or report the transaction. Therefore, the location information determined based on the temperature or color of the payment card <b>112</b> can be used to safeguard transactions and improve security associated with use of the card.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some examples, the payment card <b>112</b> can include a biometric element <b>414</b> to further secure the use of the payment card. The biometric element <b>414</b> can be configured to obtain biometric information from the user and transmit the information to the mobile application executing on the device of the user via the NFC chip <b>412</b>. The mobile application can send a signal to the heating element <b>410</b> to adjust the temperature of the payment card <b>112</b> based on the biometric information. In some examples, when a user puts his or her fingers on the payment card <b>112</b>, the biometric element <b>414</b> can obtain the fingerprint of the user (e.g., through a fingerprint reader included in the biometric element) and transmit the obtained fingerprint to the mobile application. The mobile application can compare the obtained fingerprint with the fingerprint of an assigned user, and further communicate with the heating element <b>410</b> through the NFC chip <b>412</b> to adjust a temperature of the payment card <b>112</b> based on the comparison result. For example, the heating element <b>410</b> can be configured to adjust a temperature of the first region <b>302</b> or the second region <b>304</b> to reveal or conceal the account number in response to the communication received by the NFC chip from the mobile application. By applying heat with the heating element <b>410</b>, for example, the account number can be revealed based on a fingerprint match (e.g., when the user touching the payment card is the assigned user). Likewise, the account number can remain concealed when there is a fingerprint mismatch (e.g., when the user touching the payment card is not the assigned user), by not applying heat with the heating element <b>410</b>. Thus, the account number can be kept hidden when unauthorized users touch the card, thereby improving security. As described, the thermochromic ink may produce certain colors at certain temperatures (e.g., red at 70 degrees, white at 80 degrees, etc). The heating element, in communication with the payment application executing on the device of the user, may be controlled via the mobile application to cause the card to heat to a desired temperature in order to produce a particular color based on a transaction or other event caused by the user. For example, the user may activate an incentive associated with a merchant via the mobile app and a virtual card displayed with the user interface, and consequently cause an animation (e.g., virtual card turns to a color associated with the incentive or the merchant) to appear both on the user interface of the mobile application and also cause a corresponding color to appear on the physical card through temperature control via the heating element and the thermochromic ink.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Additionally or alternatively, in certain examples, the payment card <b>112</b> can include a graphical display, such as an electronic ink (E-Ink) display or an LCD display. The graphical display can be used to present information related to the payment card <b>112</b>, a user of the payment card <b>112</b> (e.g., an image of the user), a transaction made with the payment card <b>112</b> (e.g., a payment amount), or a merchant associated with a transaction made with the payment card <b>112</b> (e.g., a name of the merchant). For example, in some instances, the graphical display can display an account number, an expiration date, and/or a CVV. Additionally or alternatively, the graphical display can be used to display a bar code or a QR code (Quick Response code). For example, the user may receive a gift card that includes a QR code or a bar code that can be presented to a merchant for payment. The graphical display can be used to display the QR code or bar code, which can then be presented to an optical scanner of the merchant for payment. Thus, the graphical display can be used to communicate e-gift card identifier information. Similarly, the graphical display can be used to communicate sports event ticket information, airline ticket information, or concert ticket information.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method <b>500</b> of using a payment card, in accordance with certain examples. A payment card (e.g., payment card <b>112</b>) is provided (step <b>502</b>). The payment card includes an account number associated with an account of a user and has a thermochromic ink. In some examples, the payment card includes a card substrate and a personalization layer overlaying the card substrate. The personalization layer includes a first region and a second region. The first region includes the account number associated with the account of the user. The account of the user is maintained by a payment service system (e.g., the payment service system <b>108</b>) that issues the payment card. At least one of the first region or the second region includes the thermochromic ink. The thermochromic ink is an ink that changes color when temperature increases or decreases. For example, when the user touches the card, body heat from the user can cause a color of the payment card. Additionally or alternatively, when the payment card is exposed to a new ambient temperature, the temperature and color of the payment card can change. In some examples, a temperature sensor in the card can be used to determine when the user has touched the card or when heat has otherwise been applied to (or removed from) the payment card, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In certain implementations, the payment card includes a heating element (e.g., heating element <b>410</b>) and an NFC chip (e.g., the NFC chip <b>412</b>) that communicates with a mobile application executing on a device of the user. The mobile application can determine (step <b>504</b>) that a color of the payment card should be changed (e.g., to reveal the account number or send a message to the user). In response, the user device can send (step <b>506</b>) a signal to the NFC chip on the payment card. The NFC chip can then activate (step <b>508</b>) the heating element to change a temperature and color of the payment card. The heating element can dynamically adjust a temperature of the payment card.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Application of heat to the payment card can cause a color change that reveals the account number of the payment card. Otherwise, the account number of the payment card may remain hidden from view, for example, if the payment card is at or around room temperature. In some examples, when heat is applied to the first region or the second region of the payment card having the thermochromic ink (e.g., when the user touches the first or second region), the color of the first or second region having the thermochromic ink can change. As a result, the account number can be revealed. In some examples, the first region and the second region are substantially identical in color at room temperature such that the account number included in the first region is invisible at room temperature. Advantageously, revealing the account number upon application of heat can prevent unnecessary or inadvertent exposure of the account number or other information on the card, thereby increasing security of the payment card and user account.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Chameleon Card</heading><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some implementations, the payment card <b>112</b> can be or include a metal substrate and/or can have randomized colors or a random color variation across the surface. Such a card can be referred to herein as a &#x201c;chameleon card.&#x201d; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> includes perspective views of front and back sides of a chameleon card <b>600</b>. The front side of the chameleon card <b>600</b> includes at least three regions <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, and <b>606</b>. Each region <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, and <b>606</b> can have a unique or different color based on different thermochromic inks used in each region. The different colors can be present when a temperature of the card <b>600</b> is uniform (e.g., throughout the card) or non-uniform. The thermochromic inks can be selected and positioned to hide key information of the card <b>600</b> while displaying random colors. For example, as depicted, the account number associated with the card can be invisible in the regions <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, or <b>606</b>. When a user touches the card <b>600</b> to apply body heat or a heating element embedded in the card applies heat to the card <b>600</b> in response to receiving a signal, the color of one or more regions <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, or <b>606</b> can change to reveal the account number. Likewise, the back side of the chameleon card <b>600</b> can include regions <b>608</b>, <b>610</b>, and <b>612</b> that display different colors. For example, the regions <b>608</b> and <b>612</b> on the back side may be opposite of the region <b>602</b> on the front side and/or may show different colors (e.g., a darker color) based on a selection and arrangement of the thermochromic inks on the card <b>600</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the colors on the front side and/or the back side of the card <b>600</b> can be arranged to present customized shapes or images. For example, the card <b>600</b> can be designed and colored based on personalized artwork from a cardholder. In general, the chameleon card <b>600</b> can be visually appealing to attract users and improve an overall user experience.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Furthermore, the payment card <b>600</b> may be manufactured in a way such that various semi-reflective or other ink colors are randomly printed across the upper and/or lower surfaces of the card substrate or other layer of the card. In this way, the payment card appears in a chameleon style and may appear to change colors to the user as the card is rotated. This style of card may include thermochromic ink or other ink or dyes (e.g., normal or non-thermochromic) so long as various colors are printed randomly along the surface. In one embodiment, changes in color to the chameleon card may be triggered by a detected change in environmental temperature using the temperature sensor, thermochromic ink, and/or heating element as described above. The various colors or color combinations used to print the card may be selected by the user via input on a user interface associated with the mobile application. For example, the user may select a base color of red for their chameleon card and the resulting card can have random colors of red hues printed on the card. In one embodiment, the payment service may utilize machine learning algorithms to select or suggest complementary colors to at least one desired color selected by a user, and based on users having similar profiles to the selecting user, for printing the various colors on the payment card.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some examples, the randomized coloring can be achieved by varying concentrations of thermochromic pigments across the front and/or back sides of the card <b>600</b>. For example, the front and/or back sides can include a mixture of two or more different thermochromic pigments, and the concentrations of the pigments can be varied to achieve a range of colors on the front and/or back sides. Each of the regions <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, and <b>606</b>, for example, can have a unique combination of the thermochromic pigments. In general, the composition of thermochromic pigments can vary across the card to achieve randomized colors and/or present images at any given temperature.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Chameleon Card Packaging</heading><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts a chameleon card <b>700</b> placed in a packaging container <b>702</b>, in accordance with certain examples.
