Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the electronic device <b>101</b> in the network environment <b>100</b> may communicate with an electronic device <b>102</b> via a first network <b>198</b> (e.g., a short-range wireless communication network), or an electronic device <b>104</b> or a server <b>108</b> via a second network <b>199</b> (e.g., a long-range wireless communication network). According to an embodiment, the electronic device <b>101</b> may communicate with the electronic device <b>104</b> via the server <b>108</b>.

In some embodiments, at least one (e.g., the display device <b>160</b> or the camera module <b>180</b>) of the components may be omitted from the electronic device <b>101</b>, or one or more other components may be added in the electronic device <b>101</b>. In some embodiments, some of the components may be implemented as single integrated circuitry. For example, the sensor module <b>176</b> (e.g., a fingerprint sensor, an iris sensor, or an illuminance sensor) may be implemented as embedded in the display device <b>160</b> (e.g., a display).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The processor <b>120</b> may execute, for example, software (e.g., a program <b>140</b>) to control at least one other component (e.g., a hardware or software component) of the electronic device <b>101</b> coupled with the processor <b>120</b>, and may perform various data processing or computation.

As used herein, each of such phrases as &#x201c;A or B&#x201d;, &#x201c;at least one of A and B&#x201d;, &#x201c;at least one of A or B&#x201d;, &#x201c;A, B, or C&#x201d;, &#x201c;at least one of A, B, and C&#x201d;, and &#x201c;at least one of A, B, or C&#x201d; may include any one of, or all possible combinations of the items enumerated together in a corresponding one of the phrases. As used herein, such terms as &#x201c;1st&#x201d; and &#x201c;2nd&#x201d;, or &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; may be used to simply distinguish a corresponding component from another, and does not limit the components in other aspect (e.g., importance or order). It is to be understood that if an element (e.g., a first element) is referred to, with or without the term &#x201c;operatively&#x201d; or &#x201c;communicatively&#x201d;, as &#x201c;coupled with&#x201d;, &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d;, &#x201c;connected with&#x201d;, or &#x201c;connected to&#x201d; another element (e.g., a second element), it means that the element may be coupled with the other element directly (e.g., wiredly), wirelessly, or via at least a third element.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">As used herein, the term &#x201c;module&#x201d; may include a unit implemented in hardware, software, or firmware, and may interchangeably be used with other terms, for example, &#x201c;logic&#x201d;, &#x201c;logic block&#x201d;, &#x201c;part&#x201d;, or &#x201c;circuitry&#x201d;. A module may be a single integral component, or a minimum unit or part thereof, adapted to perform one or more functions. For example, according to an embodiment, the module may be implemented in a form of an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC).</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">Various embodiments as set forth herein may be implemented as software (e.g., the program <b>140</b>) including one or more instructions that are stored in a storage medium (e.g., internal memory <b>136</b> or external memory <b>138</b>) that is readable by a machine (e.g., the electronic device <b>101</b>). For example, a processor (e.g., the processor <b>120</b>) of the machine (e.g., the electronic device <b>101</b>) may invoke at least one of the one or more instructions stored in the storage medium, and execute it, with or without using one or more other components under the control of the processor. This allows the machine to be operated to perform at least one function according to the at least one instruction invoked. The one or more instructions may include a code generated by a compiler or a code executable by an interpreter. The machine-readable storage medium may be provided in the form of a non-transitory storage medium. Wherein, the term &#x201c;non-transitory&#x201d; simply means that the storage medium is a tangible device, and does not include a signal (e.g., an electromagnetic wave), but this term does not differentiate between where data is semi-permanently stored in the storage medium and where the data is temporarily stored in the storage medium.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">According to an embodiment, a method according to various embodiments of the disclosure may be included and provided in a computer program product. The computer program product may be traded as a product between a seller and a buyer. The computer program product may be distributed in the form of a machine-readable storage medium (e.g., compact disc read only memory (CD-ROM)), or be distributed (e.g., downloaded or uploaded) online via an application store (e.g., PlayStore&#x2122;), or between two user devices (e.g., smart phones) directly. If distributed online, at least part of the computer program product may be temporarily generated or at least temporarily stored in the machine-readable storage medium, such as memory of the manufacturer's server, a server of the application store, or a relay server.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">According to various embodiments, each component (e.g., a module or a program) of the above-described components may include a single entity or multiple entities. According to various embodiments, one or more of the above-described components may be omitted, or one or more other components may be added. Alternatively or additionally, a plurality of components (e.g., modules or programs) may be integrated into a single component. In such a case, according to various embodiments, the integrated component may still perform one or more functions of each of the plurality of components in the same or similar manner as they are performed by a corresponding one of the plurality of components before the integration. According to various embodiments, operations performed by the module, the program, or another component may be carried out sequentially, in parallel, repeatedly, or heuristically, or one or more of the operations may be executed in a different order or omitted, or one or more other operations may be added.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
