id="p-0003" num="0002">Data storage devices (DSDs) are electronic devices with the capability to store information in the form of digital data. DSDs are typically deployed as an integrated part of, or as a removable component configured to interface with, a computing system for the purpose of improving the data transmission and storage capabilities of the system. From the perspective of the computing system, a DSD is typically implemented as a block storage device where the data stored is in the form of one or more blocks, being sequences of bytes or bits having a maximum length, referred to as block size.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">External DSDs are commonly used to supplement the data storage capabilities of a computer system. For example, external DSDs are often standalone physical devices which house an internal storage component, such as a hard disk drive (HDD) or a solid state drive (SSD), that provides a host computing system with an additional portion of non-volatile memory (i.e., the volume of the drive) in which to store digital data. These external drive type devices are connectable to the host computer system via a data path operating over a particular connectivity protocol (e.g., via Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable). In response to being connected to the host computer system, the host computer system recognizes the external drive as a block data storage device such that a user of the device may access the storage of the drive via the data path (e.g., through operation of the host computer). Access to the drive typically enables a user to access (e.g., read, write and/or modify) user data stored on the drive.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some storage devices provide status or state information to users about the functionality of the data storage device, such as by sending information to a host computer device for display on a screen, or by using light emitting diodes (LEDs).

That is, the connected device is physically unable to extract user data stored on the internal drive of the DSD, or to write data to the drive. Alternatively, or in addition, securing the user data may involve obscuring the data as it is stored on, or retrieved from, the DSD (e.g., using an encryption function). in both of the aforementioned approaches the DSD implements a &#x201c;locking&#x201d; operation that secures user data by preventing (or &#x201c;disabling&#x201d;) access to the data, either physically or logically. The DSD provides (or &#x201c;enables&#x201d;) access to the stored user data via a corresponding &#x201c;unlocking&#x201d; operation which enables data transmission through the data path, and/or performs decryption of the user data if required, such that the user may access (e.g., read, write and/or modify) user data stored on the drive.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For a DSD with locking and unlocking functions, it is desired to provide a user of the device with information about whether the user data is presently accessible or whether it is secured. Data storage devices are typically configured to be removably connected (e.g., through USB) to host systems, and to be capable of seamless disconnection from the host. Consequently, many such devices lack a display and an independent power source, such as a battery or a power supply associated with the DSD. One option for providing a user with data access information is to send the information to a host computer system, or other external device, connected to the DSD such that the connected device can then display a representation of the data access state (DA State) of the device (i.e., &#x201c;locked&#x201d; or &#x201c;unlocked&#x201d;) to the user.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">However, once disconnected the external device may no longer receive data access state information for the DSD. As many DSDs are designed to be portable devices used to offer an ad-hoc storage solution, reliance on a constant connection with a host computer, or other device, to provide a user with data access state information is impractical. Another approach is to use LEDs to indicate the DA state of the device, such as by incorporating the LEDs into a housing, or other outwardly exposed portion, of the DSD that is visible to the user. However, LED indicators require power to operate.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Without an independent power source. LEDs are typically powered by the connected external device (e.g., the host computer). As a result, the disconnection of the external device from the DSD prevents a single LED from accurately indicating a locked or unlocked state of the device (i.e., since the user cannot determine whether an unlit LED is correctly indicating an access state, such as unlocked, or whether it is unlit because it is unpowered). The use of multiple LEDs does not solve this problem, since the user cannot determine the DA state in the case that the DSD is unpowered (as all LEDs will be unlit). It is therefore desired to provide a data storage device that ameliorates one or more of these difficulties, or other difficulties, of the prior art or that at least provides a useful alternative.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, there is disclosed an exemplary data storage device (DSD) <b>100</b> that selectively controls access of a user <b>101</b> of the device <b>100</b> to user content data <b>109</b> stored thereon, and provides the user <b>101</b> with corresponding data access state information via a data access state indicator (&#x201c;DA state indicator&#x201d;) <b>140</b> of the device <b>100</b>. Specifically, the DSD <b>100</b> described herein issues control signals to cause the data access state indicator <b>140</b> to indicate the data access state irrespective of whether the data storage device <b>100</b> is powered through a data port <b>106</b>. The data port <b>106</b> is configured to transmit data and power between a host computer system <b>130</b> and the data storage device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, the DSD <b>100</b> may communicate with and obtain power from a host computer <b>130</b> through a USB port <b>106</b> that provides power, as well as enabling the transfer of data between device <b>100</b> and host <b>130</b>. In this case, the host computer <b>130</b> acts as an external power source supplying power to the DSD <b>100</b> via data port <b>106</b>. The disclosed data storage device <b>100</b> is advantageous in that use of the host computer <b>130</b> as a power source can be maintained, while also providing data access information to users even when no power is available from the host computer (e.g., following its disconnection from the device <b>100</b>).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The DA state indicator <b>140</b> is a visual indicator in the described embodiments, configured to visually represent the DA state to the user <b>101</b>. In some examples, the DA state indicator <b>140</b> includes one or more display components integrated, at least partially, into a housing <b>116</b> or enclosure of the DSD. Unlike conventional approaches to visually indicating the DA state of a storage device, examples of the display components described herein are persistent components configured to display a particular visual representation of the data access state, and to retain the visual representation in the absence of an external power source.

Any other type of non-volatile storage media may also be used, including emerging non-volatile memory such as Program in Place or Storage Class Memory (SCM), such as ReRam., PCM, and MRAM. Further, the storage medium <b>108</b> may be a block data storage device, such that the user content data <b>109</b> is written in blocks to the storage medium <b>108</b> and read in blocks from the storage medium <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The host computer <b>130</b> is configured to include a device driver and a data/power interface for communicating with the DSD <b>100</b> and providing it with power. The data and power interface operates over data port <b>106</b>, which may be implemented as, for example, some form of USB port (e.g., USB-A, USB-8, USB-C, mini USB, micro-USB, etc.), a Thunderbolt port, a Power over Ethernet (PoE) port, or a similar port.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The DSD <b>100</b> includes a cryptography engine <b>107</b> configured to receive, interpret and execute commands received from host computer system <b>104</b> according to a predetermined command set, such as for example the standard Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) or serial ATA (SATA) and/or ATA Packet Interface (ATAPI) command set, which is available from Technical Committee T13 noting that identical functionalities can be implemented within Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Opal, Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) and other proprietary architectures.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The cryptography engine <b>107</b> is connected between the data port <b>106</b> and the storage medium <b>108</b> and is configured to use a cryptographic key to encrypt user content data <b>109</b> to be stored on the storage medium <b>108</b>, and to decrypt the encrypted user content data <b>109</b> stored on the storage medium <b>108</b> in response to a request from the host computer system <b>130</b>.

The access controller <b>110</b> is configured to generate a physical enable signal to control the data path <b>104</b> such as to enable or disable the transmission of user content data <b>109</b> between the host computer system <b>130</b> and the non-volatile storage medium <b>108</b> via the data port <b>106</b>. The state of the data path <b>104</b>, as either enabling or disabling data transmission, is referred to as a physical access state of the DSD.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one example, the user content could be stored in a plain (i.e., unencrypted) form, and only the generation of the physical enable signal determines whether the user content data is accessible to the host <b>130</b>. In this case, the device <b>100</b> is in an &#x201c;open&#x201d; mode of operation where the user content data is not subject to encryption and the physical access state therefore determines whether access to the user content data is enabled or disabled. That is, in the locked data access state the unencrypted user content, data is prevented from passing through the data path <b>104</b> to the host computer <b>130</b>.

In a cryptographically unlocked state, the cryptography engine <b>107</b> performs encryption and decryption operations with a particular pre-determined user key associated with the user <b>101</b>. For example, the user key may be set during a configuration step conducted by the user <b>101</b>. In a cryptographically locked state, the user key is unavailable to the cryptography engine <b>107</b>. As a result, data transmitted to or received from the DSD <b>100</b> will be obfuscated compared to the corresponding data generated by the cryptography engine <b>107</b> in the unlocked cryptographic state. In some embodiments, in the restricted mode the DSD <b>100</b> may be configured to obtain the user key via a key transfer process (e.g., involving the host <b>130</b> or other external device as described below), or to derive the user key in response to the authentication of the user <b>101</b> (e.g., by the user <b>101</b> entering an input passcode that matches to a known passcode associated with the DSD <b>100</b>).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The cryptographic state may be independent of the physical access state.

That is, the data access state of the DSD <b>100</b> is &#x201c;locked&#x201d; or &#x201c;unlocked&#x201d; in accordance with the corresponding physical access state. In such implementations, the access controller <b>110</b> is configured to set the enable signal to selectively set the data access state of the device <b>100</b>, to either: an unlocked state to enable transmission of user content data <b>109</b> between the host computer system <b>130</b> and the storage medium <b>108</b> via the data port; or a locked state to disable transmission of user content data <b>109</b> between the host computer system <b>130</b> and the storage medium <b>108</b> via the data port <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In other embodiments, the data access state may be determined based on the cryptographic state, or from both the physical access state and the cryptographic state.

In some examples, a cryptographic key can be transferred to the device <b>100</b> by the host <b>130</b>, or by a separate external device such as a phone. The transfer may occur via networked communication with a remote server, via direct transfer based on a local connection between the devices (e.g., in the case that the separate device is plugged into the DSD).

Authentication may be performed by any one of a variety of authentication processes which verify the identity of the user <b>101</b> as an authorized user to access the stored data <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some examples, user authentication may proceed via the use of an input passcode which is entered into the DSD <b>100</b> via the input components <b>102</b>. For example, in response to the entry of an input passcode by user <b>101</b> into keypad <b>105</b>, corresponding input passcode data (representing the input code) is generated by the components <b>102</b> and transmitted to the access controller <b>110</b>. The, access controller <b>110</b> may compare the input password to a known unlock password, and authenticate the user <b>101</b> in response to a match between the input arid unlock passwords. Following authentication of the user <b>101</b>, the access controller selectively sets the DA state of the data storage device <b>100</b> to a state requested by the user <b>101</b> (e.g., to the unlock state such that the user <b>101</b> can access the data <b>109</b> via host <b>130</b>).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The DSD <b>100</b> includes an enclosure <b>116</b> configured to physically house the components of the device <b>100</b>.

For example, in the automobile industry, electrochromic glass is used to automatically tint rear-view mirrors in various lighting conditions.

Conducting electrodes on either side of both EC layers are used to provide an external voltage and cause a color change. Some electrochromic devices can be categorized into two types: a laminated device which uses a liquid gel, and a solid electrolyte device which uses solid inorganic or organic material.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>, the surface <b>142</b><i>a </i>may be organized as a single electrochromic layer, as multiple continuous layers, or as separate layers in combination with other components (e.g., electrolytics) to form part of an ED. For ease of reference, the disclosure refers to electronic materials of the surface <b>142</b><i>a </i>which includes one or more electrochromic materials organized in any of the aforementioned configurations.

The two outer layers are transparent conductors, with the two middle layers being an EC layer and an ion-storage layer for conducting ions and electrons. The central layer is an electrolyte for separating the two middle layers. Optical absorption occurs when electrons move into the two middle layers from the transparent conductors along with charge balancing ions entering from the electrolyte in the central layer. Other electrochromic devices in alternative embodiments may use more or less layers.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The optical properties of surface <b>142</b><i>a </i>are variable in response to the application of a voltage to the electronic materials.

In such embodiments, display panel <b>142</b><i>d </i>may be implemented using an E ink (e.g., Spectra or Kaleido), or a similar technology. That is, in response to the application of a voltage to the substrate, the label <b>142</b><i>e </i>is selectively imprinted onto panel <b>142</b><i>d</i>, which acts as a persistent visual indicator (i.e., an electronic paper) capable of retaining the imprinted label <b>142</b><i>e </i>without power.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Electrophoretic displays function by causing the controlled migration of microencapsulated particles at specific regions on a substrate in response to an applied voltage. In one embodiment, the substrate includes multiple layers, including a transparent upper electrode layer, a liquid polymer layer containing the microencapsulated particles, and a lower electrode layer. The microencapsulated particles are titanium dioxide particles approximately one micrometer in diameter dispersed in a hydrocarbon oil within the polymer layer. A dark-colored dye is added to the oil, along with surfactants and charging agents that cause the particles to take on an electric charge. This mixture is placed between two parallel, conductive plates (i.e., forming the upper and lower electrode layers) separated by a gap of 10 to 100 micrometres.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">A voltage is applied across the two plates, to cause the particles to migrate electrophoretically to the plate that bears the opposite charge from that on the particles. The migration of the particles to the front (viewing) side of the panel <b>142</b><i>d</i>, causes the panel to appear white at the corresponding region (i.e., since the light is scattered back to the viewer by the titania particles), The migration of the particles to the rear side of the display <b>142</b><i>d </i>causes it to appear dark (i.e., since the incident light is absorbed by the colored dye). Accordingly, dividing the substrate into a number of small picture elements (i.e., pixels) enables the creation of a pattern of reflecting and absorbing regions, and therefore the formation of images (such as label <b>142</b><i>e</i>), in response to the application of the appropriate voltage at each pixel location. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>shows an implementation of an electrophoretic display including two microcapsules controlling two respective pixel regions. Each capsule contains an oily solution containing a black dye (the electronic ink), with numerous white titanium dioxide particles suspended within. The particles are slightly negatively charged, and each one is naturally white. A positive charge to the surface electrode attracts the particles to the top of local capsules, causing the surface of display <b>142</b><i>d </i>to appear white when viewed from direction A (i.e., pixel 1). Reversing the voltage repels the particles to the bottom of local capsules resulting in the black dye moving to the surface of <b>142</b><i>d </i>and turning the pixel black (i.e., pixel 2).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>, label <b>142</b><i>e </i>includes text that is selected to indicate the data access state of the data storage device <b>100</b>.

In other embodiments, label <b>142</b><i>e </i>may be set to a selected icon or image, or to a &#x2018;blank&#x2019; or null label in which all pixel regions are set uniformly to black or white, according to the data access state of the device <b>100</b>. For example, label <b>142</b><i>e </i>may be set to a padlock icon in response to the data access state changing to the locked state. The label <b>142</b><i>e </i>may be set to a null label in response to the data access state changing to the unlocked state, such that the padlock icon is no longer rendered on the panel <b>142</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In another example, label <b>142</b><i>e </i>may be a text label with a static sub-part that remains constant and a variable sub-part which is altered in accordance with the data access state.

In this case, the display <b>142</b><i>d </i>may indicate the data access state with improved power efficiency and/or complexity (i.e., since the number of regions on the substrate to which voltages must be applied in response to a change in data access state is reduced).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>c </i></figref>shows another embodiment in which the data state indicator <b>140</b> includes a panel <b>142</b><i>f </i>configured to include an underlying layer <b>142</b><i>g </i>in combination with a display surface <b>142</b><i>h </i>having a varying optical transparency according to the data access state.

At step <b>402</b>, the controller <b>110</b> receives a lock/unlock event representing an action that triggers a change in the data access state of the DSD <b>100</b>.

In some embodiments, actuation of the &#x201c;Unlock&#x201d; button, or element, of the input components <b>102</b> initiates the unlocking function, where completion of the function (i.e., cause the controller <b>110</b> to generate the unlock event) is subject to the authentication of the user <b>101</b> by a user authentication process. For example, in the case of a password based authentication process, the controller <b>110</b> generates the unlock event in response to an input password of the user <b>101</b> (e.g., a personal identification number (PIN) code entered into the device <b>100</b> via, buttons <b>103</b> or keypad <b>105</b>) matching to an unlock password of the device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">With reference to (2), in some embodiments the access controller <b>110</b> is configured to perform one or more internal functions to cause the generation of lock or unlock events to automatically set the data access state.

This is referred to as the device data transmission idle time. If the data transmission idle time exceeds a threshold value (e.g., 60 minutes), as maintained within memory <b>114</b> of the controller <b>110</b>, then the controller <b>110</b> may generate a lock event to automatically lock the DSD <b>100</b>, such that a corresponding unlock event is required to regain access to the data <b>109</b>. The unlock event may involve the entry of a PIN code, and/or the execution of an entire key transmission and unlock process, to grant the user <b>101</b> access the DSD <b>100</b>.

Assuming an unobstructed space and a source of isotropic transmission, the diffusion of waves in all directions is uniform.

However, the transmitting antenna does not always transmit energy in a spherical wax (isotropic antenna) but may transmit energy in some specific directions according to their design. The capacity and inductance of an antenna are functions of its frequency and physical size. The larger the antenna size, the lower the resonance frequency.
