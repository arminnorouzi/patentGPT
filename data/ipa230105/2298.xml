In Comparative Example 2, the washing process was not performed, so the lithium content in the organic layer was high as 1,335 ppm, and in Comparative Example 3, after washing twice with only water without acetic acid, the content of lithium remaining in the organic layer was relatively high as 435 ppm. Comparative Example 4 was extracted with 100 wt % acetic acid, but the organic layer and the water layer did not separate, so the remaining catalyst impurities could not be removed.
