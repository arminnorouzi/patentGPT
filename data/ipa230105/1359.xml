Because the size of the pore structures is close to those of permanent gases, a zeolite, if appropriately selected, can act as a molecular sieve, functioning analogously to a conventional sand/stone/gravel sieve used on construction sites. Indeed, zeolite membranes have high potential for use in distinguishing minute differences between the shape and size of permanent gases, thus achieving energy-efficient gas separation (Jeon, M. Y. et al., <i>Nature </i>2017, 543, 690-691; Tung, C. T. P. et al., <i>Science </i>2011, 334, 1533-1538).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Separation of mixed material using a zeolite membrane is based on the difference in permeation rates of the constituents of the mixed material permeating the membrane. In the zeolite membrane, permeation is achieved by adsorption, diffusion and desorption. The intrinsic pore structure and surface properties of the zeolite have an influence on this process. In this respect, CHA zeolites with a pore size of 0.37&#xd7;0.42 nm<sup>2 </sup>have a structure suitable for separating CO<sub>2 </sub>having a size of 0.33 nm from N<sub>2 </sub>(0.364 nm) and CH<sub>4 </sub>(0.38 nm).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">If a zeolite is chosen such that its pore size lies between the size of CO<sub>2 </sub>and other larger molecules, the molecular sieve can act as a good CO<sub>2 </sub>separator. In this respect, eight-membered-ring (8 MR) zeolites, whose maximum pore size is 0.43 nm, are promising molecular sieves for the separation of CO<sub>2 </sub>(0.33 nm) from other larger gas molecules such as N<sub>2 </sub>(0.364 nm) and CH<sub>4 </sub>(0.38 nm) (Breck, D. W., John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc.: 1974). Effective CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation is attractive to many researchers because of the importance of regulating flue gas emissions in fossil fuel combustion and in the upgrading of natural gas and biogas. Research is underway to realize high CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation performance of CHA zeolite membranes (Avila et al., Journal of Membrane Science, 2009, 335, 32-36; Li et al., Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, 2010, 49, 4399-4404).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventional zeolite membranes are generally measured under conditions that do not contain moisture in the feed gas. The reason for this is that the moisture contained in the feed gas affects the performance of the membrane and thus prevents smooth gas separation through the membrane. In actual gas separation processes, however, the membrane is often exposed to wet conditions. Examples thereof include flue gas treatment and biogas upgrading. Flue gas generated after combustion of fossil fuel undergoes a desulfurization process. In this process, a large amount of water is injected into flue gas to finally have a composition of CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>O. Since biogas is produced from living organisms, it inevitably contains a large amount of water and has a composition of CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>O. Therefore, in order to use conventional zeolite membranes for the actual flue gas treatment and biogas upgrading processes, it is necessary to completely remove the water contained in the feed gas through a dehydration process. This dehydration process is a major factor that increases the cost of the process and thus limits the application of the membrane process to the actual process.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In flue gas treatment or biogas upgrading processes that require selective separation of CO<sub>2</sub>, moisture is always present, in addition to CO<sub>2 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>, or CO<sub>2 </sub>and CH<sub>4</sub>. Moisture present in the mixed gas serves to hinder the selective adsorption and diffusion of CO<sub>2 </sub>in the zeolite membrane, resulting in a reduction in CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance. In order to prevent the decreased CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance due to moisture, a method of synthesizing zeolite such that the surface of zeolite is hydrophobic has been proposed (Kosinov et al., Journal of Materials Chemistry A, 2014, 2, 13083-13092). Zeolite has a structure in which Si and Al are connected through four crosslinked oxygen atoms. In this regard, when the ratio of Al in the structure is lowered, the surface becomes hydrophobic. The hydrophobic surface has been reported to be less susceptible to moisture and thus result in higher permeance.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the zeolite membrane is fabricated, defects having a size larger than zeolite pores are also formed. These defects provide non-selective passages, thus reducing the selectivity of the membranes. However, it is known that in the presence of moisture, moisture may be adsorbed on the defects and thus contribute to the improvement of separation performance (Hong et al., Chemistry of Materials, 2018, 30, 3346-3358). For this reason, in order to obtain a membrane having optimum separation performance under wet conditions, the defect structures of membranes as well as the surface properties associated with water adsorption should be considered.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Since Si and Al serve as central atoms for forming zeolite structures, the formation of the zeolite structures is greatly affected by the ratio of the two atoms. Thus, the CHA zeolite membranes exhibit various results depending on the Si/Al ratio, thus causing the formation of various defect structures.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">PCT Patent Publication No. WO 2016/006564 A1 discloses a method of preparing a membrane while changing Si/Al. However, the document relates to a membrane for gas separation under dry conditions, wherein the membrane has a problem in which the membrane is not optimized under the condition of a feed gas containing moisture, which is an actual process condition.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, there is a need for a technology for producing a membrane that can exhibit high performance under such actual process conditions containing moisture and can improve economic efficiency.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, as a result of extensive efforts to solve these problems, the present inventors found that, in the preparation of a CHA zeolite membrane, when preparing a membrane using a synthetic precursor having a controlled ratio of Si and Al, unlike conventional zeolite membranes, the hydrophobicity and defect formation of the zeolite membranes are optimized, and thus excellent CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation performance can be obtained even under wet conditions. Based on this finding, the present invention has been completed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a membrane having higher CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation performance than conventional zeolite membranes in both dry and wet conditions and a method of preparing the same.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of separating CO<sub>2 </sub>using the membrane.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the above and other objects can be accomplished by the provision of a method of preparing a CHA zeolite membrane including adding a support including a CHA particle seed layer deposited thereon to a synthetic solution for growing zeolite containing an organic structure-directing agent and Si and Al sources, and performing hydrothermal synthesis, wherein a molar ratio of Si/Al in the synthetic solution for growing zeolite is 5 or more.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of preparing a CHA zeolite membrane including adding a support including a CHA particle seed layer deposited thereon to a synthetic solution for growing zeolite containing an organic structure-directing agent, and a Si source, without containing an Al source, and performing hydrothermal synthesis.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a CHA zeolite membrane produced by the method, wherein the CHA zeolite membrane has a porosity of a defect of 0.1 to 1% and a z-axis tortuosity (tortuosity in a thickness direction) of the defect of 1 to 2.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of separating CO<sub>2 </sub>from a mixture containing CO<sub>2 </sub>and a molecule selected from the group consisting of CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6 </sub>and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8 </sub>using the CHA zeolite membrane.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The patent or application file contains a least one drawing executed in color.

In general, the nomenclature used herein is well-known in the art and is ordinarily used.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the production of a CHA zeolite membrane, it was found that, when a membrane is fabricated using a synthetic precursor having a controlled ratio of Si and Al, the zeolite membrane has optimized hydrophobicity and defect formation and thus high separation performance of CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>even under wet conditions, unlike conventional zeolite membranes.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Therefore, in one aspect, the present invention provides a method of preparing a CHA zeolite membrane including adding a support including a CHA particle seed layer deposited thereon to a synthetic solution for growing zeolite containing an organic structure-directing agent, and Si and Al sources, and performing hydrothermal synthesis, wherein a molar ratio of Si/Al in the synthetic solution for growing zeolite is 5 or more.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Therefore, in another aspect, the present invention provides a method of preparing a CHA zeolite membrane including adding a support including a CHA particle seed layer deposited thereon to a synthetic solution for growing zeolite containing an organic structure-directing agent, and a Si source, without containing an Al source, and performing hydrothermal synthesis.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the present invention, the molar ratio of Si/Al may be 5 or more, preferably 5 to 1,000, more preferably 10 to 1000, 20 to 1,000, 10 to 500, and most preferably 20 to 200.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the present invention, the properties of zeolite are changed depending on the Si/Al ratio of the synthetic solution. Thus, similarly, zeolites having a CHA structure are affected by the Si/Al ratio of the synthetic solution. CHA particles with a low Si/Al ratio are hydrophilic and have many defects, whereas CHA particles with a high Si/Al ratio are hydrophobic and have fewer defects. In the present invention, the hydrophobicity and defect formation of the membrane can be optimized by controlling the Si/Al ratio when synthesizing the CHA zeolite membrane based on this principle. This results in the production of a CHA zeolite membrane having optimal Si/Al content providing excellent CO<sub>2 </sub>separation performance under wet conditions.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Since the Si/Al ratio of the membrane affects not only the hydrophobicity of the membrane but also the formation of the defect structure, it is important to find a Si/Al ratio optimal for CO<sub>2 </sub>separation in a wet condition. In the present invention, CHA zeolite membranes with various Si/Al ratios are produced, and the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation performance of each membrane under wet conditions are identified. As a result, the conditions for the synthesis of CHA zeolite membranes that exhibit the best performance under wet conditions were found.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As the temperature increases, adsorption of water on the membrane decreases. For this reason, the high-temperature wet condition is relatively less affected by water than the low-temperature wet condition. Therefore, a CHA zeolite membrane having optimum temperature-dependent performance is present. This is determined by the Si/Al ratio, which is directly related to the hydrophobicity and defect formation of the membrane. For this reason, it is important to find the optimum Si/Al ratio depending on the temperature. In the present invention, a membrane having an optimized Si/Al ratio depending on the process temperature was produced, so that a CHA zeolite membrane specialized for the temperature of each process may be applied.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the present invention, the support may include at least one selected from the group consisting of alumina, polypropylene, polyethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polysulfone, polyimide, silica, glass gamma-alumina, mullite, zirconia, titania, yttria, ceria, vanadia, silicon, stainless steel and carbon.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the present invention, the organic structure-directing agent may include one or more selected from the group consisting of TMAdaOH (N,N,N-trimethyl adamantylammonium hydroxide), TMAdaBr (N,N,N-trimethyl adamantylammonium bromide), TMAdaF (N,N,N-trimethyl adamantylammonium fluoride), TMAdaCl (N,N,N-trimethyl adamantylammonium chloride), TMAdaI (N,N,N-trimethyl adamantylammonium iodide), TEAOH (tetraethylammonium hydroxide), TEABr (tetraethylammonium bromide), TEAF (tetraethylammonium fluoride), TEACl (tetraethylammonium chloride), TEAI (tetraethylammonium iodide), dipropylamine and cyclohexylamine.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the present invention, the synthetic solution for growing zeolite growth may have a molar ratio of TMAdaOH: SiO<sub>2</sub>: H<sub>2</sub>O: NaOH: Al(OH)<sub>3 </sub>of 1 to 100: 100: 1000 to 20000: 1 to 100: 0 to 20.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the present invention, hydrothermal synthesis may be carried out at a temperature of 100 to 200 &#xb0; C. for 12 to 240 hours.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Typical CHA zeolites are promising for separating CO<sub>2 </sub>from large molecules such as N<sub>2 </sub>(associated with carbon capture after combustion) and CH<sub>4 </sub>(associated with natural gas/biogas upgrading). In particular, the pore size of CHA zeolites (0.37&#xd7;0.42 nm<sup>2</sup>) can distinguish size differences between small molecules such as CO<sub>2 </sub>(0.33 nm) and larger N<sub>2 </sub>(0.364 nm) or CH<sub>4 </sub>(0.38 nm) molecules, and thus can separate CO<sub>2 </sub>through CHA membranes. In addition, the siliceous component of the CHA zeolite can reduce the adsorption capacity of smaller H<sub>2</sub>O molecules (0.265 nm), thus reducing the H<sub>2</sub>O permeation rate. This is highly preferable in ensuring excellent capacity of molecular sieves with selective CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance in the presence of water vapor. In fact, siliceous CHA films with a nominal Si/Al ratio of 100 (CHA_100) exhibited high CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation performance, especially in the presence of water vapor (CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation factor (SF) of &#x2dc;13.4 and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation factor (SF) of &#x2dc;37 at 30&#xb0; C.). These SFs were higher than the corresponding values (CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>SFs of &#x2dc;5.2 and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>SFs of &#x2dc;31) under dry conditions. Such improvement could be ascribed to defect blocking by physisorbed water molecules. Preferably, under wet conditions, the siliceous, hydrophobic CHA membrane (CHA_100) could provide the high CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance of &#x2dc;1.1&#x2212;1.4&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>mol&#xb7;m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>&#xb7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#xb7;Pa<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, which was as high as &#x2dc;14 to 19% of that through bare supports. Finally, the contribution of molecular transport through zeolitic and non-zeolitic parts was quantitatively analyzed by combining information extracted from image processing of fluorescence confocal optical microscopy images with a 1-dimensional permeation model. The result showed that &#x2dc;19% and &#x2dc;20% of the total CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance for CHA_100 were reduced due to transport inhibition by the physisorbed water molecules on the membrane surface and defects, respectively.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the present invention, a secondary growth method was adopted for the fabrication of siliceous CHA membranes. First, a uniform CHA seed layer, which was mainly composed of plate-like CHA particles, was formed on a porous &#x3b1;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>disc via a selective deposition method (Kim, E. et al., <i>Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. </i>2013, 52, 5280-5284). The seed layer was further hydrothermally inter-grown to form a continuous, siliceous CHA membrane. For secondary growth, three different nominal Si/Al ratios of 20, 100, and infinity in the synthetic precursor were used. This approach was used to study the effect of the Si/Al ratio on the membrane properties systematically and, thus, the separation performances. Among the three, the most siliceous and thus most hydrophobic CHA membrane showed much improved separation performance for both CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>mixtures under wet conditions compared to that under dry conditions. In addition, fluorescence confocal optical microscopy (FCOM) revealed that the CHA membranes showed distinctive features in the defect (crack) structure depending on the Si/Al ratios in the synthetic precursors. Image processing of the FCOM images provides correlation between the defect structure and the separation performance quantitatively. Furthermore, this relationship was used to elucidate the effect of the hydrophobicity and defect structure of the CHA membrane on the CO<sub>2 </sub>permselectivities in wet feeds. Finally, the CO<sub>2 </sub>permselectivity of the CHA membranes in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O vapor in the feed was compared with those of CHA and other types of zeolite membranes in the literature, and CHA membranes have excellent performance under both dry and wet conditions were found.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the present invention, it was found that the CHA zeolite membrane prepared by the method described above can provide and maintain a high CO<sub>2 </sub>separation capacity even in a feed condition containing water, regardless of the temperature or pressure of the flue gas.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention provides a CHA zeolite membrane produced by the method, wherein the CHA zeolite membrane has a defect porosity of 0.1 to 1% and a z-axis tortuosity (tortuosity in a thickness direction of the defect) of 1 to 2.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In still another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of separating CO<sub>2 </sub>from a mixture containing CO<sub>2 </sub>and a molecule selected from the group consisting of CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6 </sub>and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8 </sub>using the CHA zeolite membrane.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the present invention, the separation factor of CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>in the flue gas separation process containing water may be 10 to 30, and the separation factor of CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>in the upgrading process of biogas containing water may be 10 to 80.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the use of the CHA zeolite membrane according to the present invention, the separation of carbon dioxide includes all of separation, capturing and removal of carbon dioxide.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to examples.

J. et al., Synthesis and Structure of Pure SiO<sub>2 </sub>Chabazite: The SiO<sub>2 </sub>Polymorph with the Lowest Framework Density. <i>Chem. Commun. </i>1998, 1881-1882). N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantammonium hydroxide (TMAdaOH, 25 wt % in water, Sachem Inc.) was poured into distilled (DI) water in a Teflon beaker. Ethanol (anhydrous 200 proof, &#x2265;99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) was subsequently added to the mixture, followed by the addition of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS 98%, Sigma-Aldrich), which served as the silica source. The synthesis mixture was hydrolyzed overnight at room temperature and was further dried until the ratio of SiO<sub>2 </sub>to water reached &#x2dc;2.4. After that, the synthesis mixture became almost solid. Finally, an HF solution (48%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added dropwise to the solid-like synthesis mixture. The final molar composition was 10 SiO<sub>2</sub>: 5 TMAdaOH: 5 HF: 30 H<sub>2</sub>O. The resultant synthesis mixture was transferred to a Teflon liner in an autoclave for reaction. The autoclave containing the synthesis mixture was placed on a rotating rack in a preheated oven at 155&#xb0; C., and after completing the reaction for 42 hours with rotation, the reaction was quenched with tap water. The resulting particles were recovered by repeating centrifugation and washing five times. In addition, the recovered particles were calcined at &#x2dc;600&#xb0; C. for 12 hours at a ramp rate of 1&#xb0; C&#xb7;min<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>under air flow (200 mL min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The seed deposition procedure has been reported elsewhere (Kim, E. et al., Uniform Si-CHA Zeolite Layers Formed by a Selective Sonication-Assisted Deposition Method. <i>Angew.

Briefly, &#x2014;0.05 g of Si-CHA particles were added to &#x2dc;50 mL of anhydrous toluene in a specially designed glass reactor with flowing argon (&#x2dc;20 mL&#xb7;min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>). After that, an &#x3b1;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>disc sandwiched between two cover glasses was fixed on a comb-shaped Teflon holder and placed in the suspension inside the glass reactor. Detailed information about the placement of the disc on the Teflon holder can be found in (Choi, J. et al., MFI Zeolite Membranes from a- and Randomly Oriented Monolayers. <i>Adsorption </i>2006, 12, 339-360). About 50 mL of anhydrous toluene was poured into the glass reactor under an argon environment. Subsequently, the glass reactor was sealed with Parafilm and ultra-sonicated (UC-10P, JEIO Tech, South Korea) for &#x2dc;20 min.

Despite being the minor portion, the plate-like Si-CHA particles were selectively deposited onto &#x3b1;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>discs to form a uniform seed layer by controlling the access to the disc surface following the above-mentioned approach reported in the previous study by the present inventors. Because of the broad size distribution, the large cubic-like Si-CHA particles were not appropriate for forming a uniform seed layer, which is critical in forming a continuous membrane via the secondary growth methodology (Choi, J. et al., Uniformly a-Oriented MFI Zeolite Films by Secondary Growth. <i>Angew.

First, a certain amount of TMAdaOH, Al(OH)<sub>3 </sub>(for a finite Si/Al ratio), and CAB-O-SIL (CAB-O-Sil&#xae; M-5, Cabot Corporation) as a silica source were added to deionized water, and the mixture was further shaken using a shaking machine (Lab Companion, SI-300R, South Korea) overnight at room temperature. After that, a certain amount of NaOH was added to the well-mixed synthetic precursor, followed by shaking overnight at room temperature. The final molar compositions of the three synthetic precursors for secondary growth were 20 TMAdaOH: 100 SiO<sub>2</sub>: 4,400 H<sub>2</sub>O: 20 NaOH: x Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>, where x=0, 1, and 5 correspond to the nominal Si/Al ratios of infinity, 100, and 20, respectively. The prepared synthetic precursor was poured into a Teflon liner where a seeded &#x3b1;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>disc had been placed vertically with the help of a Teflon holder. The Teflon liner was placed in an autoclave and the autoclave was moved to an oven preheated to 160&#xb0; C. The hydrothermal reaction for secondary growth was carried out at 160&#xb0; C. for 6 days. After the reaction had finished, the autoclave was quenched with tap water. The as-synthesized membranes were recovered from the autoclave, washed with copious water, and dried at room temperature.

Prior to analysis, all samples were coated with Pt-sputtering (Hitachi S-4300). The crystallinity of the Si-CHA zeolites and orientation of the Si-CHA layers and separators were determined through XRD (Rigaku Model D/Max-2,500 V/PC diffractometer, Japan) in the &#x3b8;/2&#x3b8; array using Cu K&#x3b1; radiation (40 kV, 100 mA, &#x3bb;=0.154 nm). Powder XRD patterns of CHA zeolites were generated using the Mercury program (www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk). The CHA Zeolite Decision Information File (CIF) was downloaded from www.iza-online.org. The chemical content from the membrane surface to the portion of the &#x3b1;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>support adjacent to the CHA film was analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX, Hitachi S-4800). This was used to evaluate the hydrophobicity of the separator. In addition, the contact angle of the water droplets on the membrane sample at room temperature was measured using a light microscope (General Type Phoenix 300, Surface Electro Optics) and recorded over time. To investigate the inner structures of the CHA membranes, FCOM (Zeiss LSM-700) was used after the membranes had been impregnated with a fluorescent dye (fluorescein sodium salt, empirical formula: C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>10</sub>Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, Sigma-Aldrich (Product No.: F6377)) having an approximate diameter of &#x2dc;1 nm. In the present invention, membrane staining was performed for 12, 24, and 96 hours. In addition, a simple screening test suitable for excluding highly defective membranes was used. This test involves placing several droplets of 1 mM fluorescent dye solution on the membrane surfaces and observing the dye distribution with time.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The Wicke-Kallenbach mode was adopted for measuring the permeation rates of CO<sub>2 </sub>and N<sub>2 </sub>(or CH<sub>4</sub>). The total pressures of both feed and permeate sides were maintained at 1 atm. In order to examine the effect of water on the membrane, the feed gas was humidified. Specifically, the partial pressures of CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O (or CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O) were 48.5 kPa/48.5 kPa/3 kPa, respectively. A total flow rate of 100 mL&#xb7;min<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>of CO<sub>2 </sub>and N<sub>2 </sub>(or CH<sub>4</sub>) on a dry basis was fed to the membrane, and the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>or CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>mixture permeated through the membrane. The permeate was carried by He sweep gas (100 mL&#xb7;min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and was analyzed on-line by a gas chromatography (GC) system (YL 6100 GC for CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>and YL 6500 GC for CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub>, Young Lin Instruments, South Korea) equipped with a packed column (6 ft&#xd7;&#x215b;&#x2033; Porapak T for CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>and 30 m&#xd7;0.320 mm GS-GasPro for CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub>) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>analysis and a pulsed discharge ionization detector (PDD) for CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>analysis.

In addition, permeation tests with respect to the different feed humidities and longer durations at 50&#xb0; C. were conducted with CHA_100 and co. In order to evaluate the effect of the humidity on the separation performance of the membrane samples at 50&#xb0; C., the permeation tests were conducted at relative humidities of 0%, 26%, 60%, and 100% at 50&#xb0; C. for 12 hours each. The relative humidities of 0%, 26%, 60% and 100% at 50&#xb0; C. correspond to water vapor partial pressures of approximately 0, 3, 7 and 12 kPa, respectively.

As a result, the protruding edges of the cubic-like particles led to rough surfaces in CHA_20 and _&#x221e;. On the other hand, the grains on the top surface of CHA_100 were smooth and larger.

In addition, the poor CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation performance of CHA_20 was similar to that of the CHA membranes reported in a previous study by the present inventors (Kim, E. et al., Chemical Vapor Deposition on Chabazite (CHA) Zeolite Membranes for Effective Post-Combustion CO<sub>2 </sub>Capture. <i>Environ.

The low maximum CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SF of 2.2 was much smaller than the expected value of &#x2dc;10-20 through the CHA membranes, indicating the presence of pronounced, unwanted non-zeolitic parts in CHA_20 (Kim, E. et al., Chemical Vapor Deposition on Chabazite (CHA) Zeolite Membranes for Effective Post-Combustion CO<sub>2 </sub>Capture. <i>Environ.

Compared to CHA_20, CHA_100 and _&#x221e; showed higher maximum CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SFs of &#x2dc;5.2&#xb1;0.1 and &#x2dc;7.3&#xb1;2.0, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref><b>1</b>-<i>c</i><b>1</b>). It was noted that the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SFs monotonically decreased with temperature, similar to the trend of the previously reported SSZ-13 membranes with the maximum CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SF being &#x2dc;10-11 at &#x2dc;20-25&#xb0; C. Among the three membranes in the present invention, CHA_&#x221e; showed the highest maximum CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SF at 30&#xb0; C. under dry conditions. This suggests that a small amount of Al in the secondary growth solution is beneficial for obtaining a less-defective membrane structure. The monotonic increase in the separation performance with the increase in the Si/Al ratio in the synthetic precursor is similar to that observed in a previous study. However, in that paper, it was reported that the use of a small amount of Al in the synthetic precursor (for example, Si/Al ratio of 125) led to the formation of undesired AFI zeolite membranes. However, despite the absence of Al, the synthesis of high-performance CHA membranes was still possible (CHA_&#x221e; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c</i></figref><b>1</b>). To the best of common knowledge, the secondary growth of the CHA seed layer with a nominal Si/Al ratio of infinity in the synthetic precursor is the first example of the fabrication of a high-performance CHA membrane (here, CHA_&#x221e;).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">In addition, the CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance through CHA_100 was higher than that through CHA_&#x221e; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref><b>1</b>-<i>c</i><b>1</b>), even though the corresponding membrane (&#x2dc;9.2 &#x3bc;m) was much thicker than CHA_&#x221e; (&#x2dc;2 &#x3bc;m) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref><b>2</b>-<i>c</i><b>2</b>). Because the permeance across a membrane is generally reciprocal to the membrane thickness, such behavior indicates a beneficial contribution of other membrane properties. Among the possible factors, the good CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance is due to the preferred alignment of the 8 MR channels in CHA_100 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref><b>3</b>). As mentioned above, the XRD peak arising from the (2<o ostyle="single">1</o>0) plane, which is perpendicular to the 8 MR channel in the [100] axis, was pronounced. Furthermore, the intensity of the XRD peak corresponding to the (003) plane, which is perpendicular to the 6 MR pore in the [001] axis, was reduced. This indicates that the 8 MR channel was more aligned along the membrane thickness, while the mass transfer inhibition by the 6 MR pores was significantly weakened. It seems that the preferred alignment of the 8 MR channels helped to increase the CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance, despite the greater thickness of CHA_100. Nevertheless, at this point, it is impossible to exclude the possible contribution of molecular transport through non-zeolitic defects to the higher CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance, and this will be discussed in detail later.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">Previously, Si-CHA zeolite seed particles have been synthesized in the presence of hydrofluoric acid (HF), where F<sup>&#x2212;</sup> served as an anionic counterpart with respect to the cationic structure directing agent (SDA, here TMAda<sup>+</sup>). However, the direct adoption of the synthetic protocol for the secondary growth of the CHA seed layer would not work, apparently due to the dissolution of the pre-deposited CHA seed particles by HF. Recently, the use of TMAdaF as a SDA (which can be considered to have the combined role of TMAdaOH and HF) instead of the conventional TMAdaOH SDA has been shown to be effective for the fabrication of CHA membranes via secondary growth. Nevertheless, the use of TMAdaOH is highly desirable for manufacturing high-performance CHA membranes, because it does not require an additional, sophisticated procedure to obtain TMAdaF.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 2.2: CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>Separation Performance Under Wet Conditions</heading><p id="p-0074" num="0072">Considering the third main component, H<sub>2</sub>O vapor, in the CO<sub>2</sub>-containing streams, the CO<sub>2 </sub>permselectivities of the three CHA membranes under wet conditions are investigated. Specifically, CHA_20, which showed poor CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation performance (maximum SF of &#x2dc;2.2 at 30&#xb0; C.) under dry conditions, also exhibited a low CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation performance (maximum SF of &#x2dc;1.6 at 100&#xb0; C.) under wet conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref><b>2</b>), confirming the pronounced presence of undesired non-zeolitic defects. The increase in the nominal Si/Al ratio of the secondary growth precursor from 20 to 100 led to an improvement in the maximum CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SF from &#x2dc;5.2&#xb1;0.1 under dry conditions to &#x2dc;13.4 &#xb1;1.8 under wet conditions at the same temperature, 30&#xb0; C. (CHA_100 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref><b>1</b>-<i>b</i><b>2</b>). This trend was also observed for CHA_&#x221e; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c</i></figref><b>1</b>-<i>c</i><b>2</b>). However, a difference was found; although the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SF of CHA_100 monotonically decreased with temperature (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref><b>2</b>), that of CHA_&#x221e; showed a maximum CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SFs of &#x2dc;15 in the temperature range of 50-75&#xb0; C., not 30&#xb0; C., under wet conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c</i></figref><b>2</b>). Considering the representative temperature (&#x2dc;50-75&#xb0; C.) of flue gas, the comparable CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SFs of &#x2dc;15 at &#x2dc;50-75&#xb0; C. through CHA_&#x221e; is highly desirable for effective membrane-based carbon capture. Notably, despite the use of the same seed layer, the appropriate choice of Si/Al ratio in the secondary growth precursor was critical for obtaining high-performance CO<sub>2</sub>-permselective CHA membranes. Moreover, the feed composition of the simulated post-combustion flue gas (here, at a CO<sub>2 </sub>partial pressure of &#x2dc;15 kPa) was considered to investigate the separation performance of CHA_100 and _&#x221e; in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O in the feed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). The results are comparable with those observed for equimolar CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>binary feeds (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref><b>2</b>-<i>c</i><b>2</b>). This result could be ascribed to the almost linear adsorption behavior of both CO<sub>2 </sub>and N<sub>2 </sub>molecules inside the CHA zeolites.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">Despite previous results concerning water-assisted CO<sub>2 </sub>permselectivity, the monotonic decrease in the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SF of the SSZ-13 membrane with increased temperature makes it undesirable for practical use. In particular, considering the plausible temperature fluctuations of flue gas streams around the representative temperature (&#x2dc;50&#xb0; C.), establishment of maximum separation performance in the temperature range of &#x2dc;50-75&#xb0; C. is highly desirable. In this respect, CHA_&#x221e; prepared in the present invention, which had a CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SF greater than 10 in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O vapor in a temperature range of &#x2dc;50-75&#xb0; C., meets the above-mentioned requirement for practical use.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">The improved CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation performance under wet conditions can be ascribed to the hydrophobic surface of the CHA membranes. Because of the smaller size of the H<sub>2</sub>O molecule (0.265 nm), preventing the entry of H<sub>2</sub>O into the CHA zeolite pores is not a sound approach for minimizing the H<sub>2</sub>O permeation rate. Instead, the control of the hydrophobicity of the surface of the CHA membranes is effective for reducing the adsorption of H<sub>2</sub>O and, thus, its permeation rate. The EDX analysis shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref><b>2</b>-<i>c</i><b>2</b> reveals that there is a siliceous component near the surface in all three CHA membranes. Considering the trend in the distribution of Al atoms along the membrane thickness, it appears that CHA_20 had a higher portion of Al atoms compared to CHA_&#x221e;. It was noted that the proportion of Si atoms approached zero after passing the interface in CHA_&#x221e;, whereas that in CHA_20 did not reach zero, suggesting the possible existence of CHA zeolites deep inside the &#x3b1;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>disc support. In contrast, a higher siliceous portion was observed throughout the membrane thickness for CHA_100. Accordingly, CHA_100 could be considered to be the most hydrophobic membrane of the three prepared membranes.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">To clarify the hydrophobicities of the CHA membranes, the contact angles of water droplets on the membrane surfaces are measured (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>). The water droplet on CHA_20 was immediately infiltrated into the membrane sample, apparently into the non-zeolitic defects, thus failing a reliable test. CHA_&#x221e;, which clearly contained a lower Al portion than CHA_20 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref><b>2</b> and <b>1</b><i>c</i><b>2</b>), had a water droplet contact angle of &#x2dc;25&#xb0;. This contact angle indicates the lower hydrophobicity of CHA_&#x221e;, especially compared to CHA_100 (contact angle of &#x2dc;80&#xb0;). Unlike highly defective CHA_20, CHA_100 and _&#x221e; both held the water droplet for up to duration of 5 minutes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>), suggesting narrower or fewer defects in these two membranes. Both the EDX and contact angle measurements led us to the conclusion that the surface of CHA_100 was most hydrophobic, followed by CHA_&#x221e;, while the surface of CHA_20 was not continuous, possibly because of the insufficient intergrowth during secondary growth.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">It was noted that the dry CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SF of CHA_&#x221e; was higher that of CHA_100 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref><b>1</b>-<i>c</i><b>1</b>), possibly indicating a lower degree of defects in CHA_&#x221e;. Despite the expected lower degree of defects in CHA_&#x221e;, its wet CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation performance was inferior to that of CHA_100, which showed higher CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance and a marked CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SF at &#x2dc;30&#xb0; C. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref><b>2</b>-<i>c</i><b>2</b>). Because CHA_100 was the most hydrophobic membrane (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref><b>2</b> and <b>14</b>), the degree of CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance reduction arising from the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O vapor was much lower than that for CHA_&#x221e; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref><b>1</b>-<i>b</i><b>2</b> and <b>2</b><i>c</i><b>1</b>-<i>c</i><b>2</b>). Despite the lower CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance, CHA_&#x221e; exhibited significant CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SFs (&#x2dc;9.7-15.2) throughout &#x2dc;30-75&#xb0; C. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c</i></figref><b>2</b>). This steady CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SF at &#x2dc;30-75&#xb0; C. indicates robustness with respect to the plausible temperature-fluctuation of the flue gas or biogas stream of &#x2dc;50&#xb0; C. in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O vapor. Considering that the final CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation performance of CHA membranes with some defects is a coupled function of (1) the non-zeolitic defects associated with the physisorption of H<sub>2</sub>O vapor and (2) intrinsic zeolitic parts, the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation performance shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref><b>2</b>-<i>c</i><b>2</b> needs to be related to the defect structure.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">The good separation performance of CHA membranes under wet conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c</i></figref><b>2</b>) is not expected to deteriorate over time at temperatures below 100&#xb0; C., mainly because of the robust CHA zeolite structure. In order to confirm this expectation, the less hydrophobic CHA_&#x221e; was tested first, because this is more likely to show deactivation if any occurs. The response of CHA_&#x221e; with respect to the simulated CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>feed (a molar composition of 15:85 on a dry basis) at &#x2dc;50&#xb0; C. with relative humidities of 0%, 26%, 60% and 100% was investigated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>). An enhancement in the CO<sub>2 </sub>permselectivity (equivalent to that observed at 50&#xb0; C. in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>b</i></figref>) caused by water vapor was observed immediately after the addition of water vapor (from 0% to 26%) and was maintained. Furthermore, the addition of more water vapor to relative humidities of 60% and 100% reduced the permeances of both CO<sub>2 </sub>and N<sub>2 </sub>molecules to the same extent, so that the corresponding CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SF remained constant at about 27. In addition, the rigorous long-term stability test of CHA_&#x221e; in the simulated CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>feed at 50&#xb0; C. with a relative humidity of 100% confirmed its robustness (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>).

The observation of higher CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>SFs than CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SFs was expected, because the diffusional behavior inside the microporous channels is a function of molecular size (CH<sub>4</sub>; 0.38 nm vs. N<sub>2</sub>; 0.364 nm).

Nevertheless, the wet CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>SFs at 30&#xb0; C. did not increase as much for CHA_100 and decreased for CHA_&#x221e; [(1) dry SF of 30.7 vs. wet SF of 37.2 for CHA_100 and (2) dry SF of 60.8 vs. wet SF of 16.5 for CHA_&#x221e;]. Compared to that in the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>binary mixture, the CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance reduction was more significant in the CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>binary mixture, as the presence of the larger CH<sub>4 </sub>molecule was likely to disfavor the transport of CO<sub>2</sub>. Nevertheless, it was found that for CHA_100, the reduction in CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance was not considerable, whereas that for CHA_&#x221e; was significantly decreased. This can be ascribed to the surface hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, as reflected by the higher and lower contact angles of water droplets of 80&#xb0; for CHA_100 and 25&#xb0; for CHA_&#x221e; , respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>).

Maximum performance should be achieved at &#x2dc;50&#xb0; C., a representative flue gas and biogas temperature, and should be insensitive to small changes in temperature. The low Si/Al ratio in the synthetic precursor could contribute to the formation of more defects in the zeolite membranes (as observed in CHA_20 in the present invention), possibly because of the relatively high polarity and repulsion of the growing zeolite grains. Concerning CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation through SSZ-13 membranes under wet conditions, the permeances of CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, and CH<sub>4 </sub>all decreased at temperatures below 100&#xb0; C., but the corresponding SFs were increased because of the greater inhibition of the slowly permeating, larger N<sub>2 </sub>and CH<sub>4 </sub>molecules by H<sub>2</sub>O. The Si/Al ratio in the synthetic precursor significantly affects the hydrophobicity of the final membrane surface and constituents, whereas defect formation is a sensitive function of thermal processing.

Although it is challenging to determine the contribution of the cracks to the permeation rates in both CHA_20 and _&#x221e; because of the limited optical resolution, the permeation results in both dry and wet conditions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref><b>1</b>-<i>a</i><b>2</b> and <b>2</b><i>c</i><b>1</b>-<i>c</i><b>2</b> confirm that CHA_20 was more defective than CHA_&#x221e;. Thus, the sizes or widths of the cracks in CHA_20 were apparently larger than those in CHA_&#x221e;. Despite the above-mentioned limited resolution, the FCOM images of the thicker CHA_100 membrane indicate that although the cracks also penetrated to the interface, the number of cracks was much larger than those in the other two membranes.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">Considering that the dyeing process is kinetically relevant, the dyeing duration was systematically varied from 12 hours through 24 hours to 96 hours (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>8</b></figref>). This approach is beneficial for obtaining a fundamental understanding of the defect structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>8</b></figref> reveal that the degree of crack dyeing in CHA_20 and _&#x221e; with respect to the dyeing duration was similar. The cracks, which propagated from the membrane surface to the interface, were accessed by the dye molecules after 12 hours (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b><i>a</i></figref><b>2</b>-<b>8</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> and <b>7</b><i>c</i><b>2</b>-<b>8</b><i>c</i><b>2</b>) and saturated after 24 hours (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b><i>a</i></figref><b>3</b>-<b>8</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> and <b>7</b><i>c</i><b>3</b>-<b>8</b><i>c</i><b>3</b>). However, dyeing for 96 hours resulted in a marked difference, while it was almost impossible to distinguish the cracks in CHA_20 because of the extremely high concentration of dye molecules (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b><i>a</i></figref><b>4</b> and <b>8</b><i>a</i><b>4</b>), additional cracks were observed for CHA_&#x221e;, but these ended in the middle section (indicated by the yellow arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b><i>c</i></figref><b>4</b> and <b>8</b><i>c</i><b>4</b>). For better comparison, additional FCOM images are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref>.

Unless the thickness of CHA_100 is similar to those of CHA_20 and _&#x221e;, a fair evaluation of the size and number of defects is challenging. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to conjecture that the size of the defects in CHA_100 was comparable to or smaller than that of CHA_&#x221e;, whereas the number of defects or defect density of CHA_100 was higher than that of CHA_&#x221e;.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">Although the FCOM images provide detailed information about the defect structure, the dyeing process required for FCOM characterizations also can reveal the degree of undesired defects. The inset in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows that the initially transparent water on the permeate side of CHA_20 became colored after 12 hours and that the concentration of dye on the permeate side gradually increased over time up to 96 hours. This was interpreted as a result of the steady passage of dye molecules along the defective cracks. Thus, the size and/or number of defects in CHA_20 were significantly greater than those of the other membranes (CHA_100 and _&#x221e;).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">Combining the FCOM characterization (defect structure inside the CHA membranes) with the water contact angle results (hydrophilicity of the surface on the CHA membranes), a simple and rapid but reliable evaluation tool that can determine the success of a membrane fabrication was developed. Specifically, a dye solution, which was originally allowed to diffuse into the defect structure in the CHA membranes for FCOM characterization, was dropped onto the membrane surface and its diffusion into the membrane was tracked with time (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>). Technically, this tool can be considered as a time-resolved visualization of the water contact angle measurement. Considering that optical characterization is not suitable for the selective characterization of a zeolite membrane having a thickness on the order of 100 nm, simple observation of the diffusional behavior of the dropped dye molecules can provide a useful insight into the formation of undesired structures. First, this simple test (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b><i>a</i></figref>) reveals that all of the dye molecules on CHA_20 penetrated the defects immediately after dropping. This result was consistent with the FCOM images (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>8</b></figref>) and water contact angle results (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>). These characterizations indicate that CHA_20 was the most defective membrane. Secondly, the surface of CHA_100 was more hydrophobic than that of CHA_&#x221e; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b><i>b</i>-<i>c</i></figref>), as already indicated by their respective water contact angles (CHA_100: 80&#xb0; vs. CHA_&#x221e;: 25&#xb0; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>). However, this test does not allow for the differentiation of differences in the defect structures, in contrast to FCOM results. In short, this simple test is thought to be proposed for the first time in the present invention and can be used as a quick screening process to aid in the exclusion of highly defective membranes.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 5: Elucidation of CO<sub>2 </sub>Separation Performance Based on Quantitative Membrane Properties</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0085">To date, the qualitative analysis of defects in zeolite membranes based on the FCOM technique has mainly focused on identifying the defect density and distribution and correlating these factors with the final separation performance However, quantitative information about the size and number of defects and association with the final membrane performance would be useful. Thus, a quantitative analysis of defects in CHA_20, _100 and _&#x221e; was conducted based on an approach reported in a previous study by the present inventors. The resulting processed defects are schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. In the case of CHA_100, the differentiation of bright and dark spots in the FCOM image was not possible because of the presence of broad, extremely bright spots (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>b</i></figref><b>1</b>-<i>b</i><b>3</b>). Therefore, the image processing was performed except for the very bright spot. The quantitative properties extracted from the FCOM images were complemented with a 1-D permeation model, which was used to estimate the representative properties (tortuosity and porosity) of the defects. The relevant properties are summarized in Table 2.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> graphically summarizes the defect size and porosity and the contribution of the defects to the final molar flux of the faster permeating component (i.e., CO<sub>2</sub>). Specifically, the defect sizes for CHA_20, _100 and _&#x221e; were estimated to be 2.8, 3.1 and 1.3 nm, respectively, and the corresponding porosities were 0.19%, 0.30% and 0.08% and 0.13%, respectively. As mentioned above, it appears that the distributions of defects in CHA_20 and _&#x221e; were comparable to each other (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b><i>a</i></figref><b>1</b>-<i>a</i><b>3</b> and <b>6</b><i>c</i><b>1</b>-<i>c</i><b>3</b>), and accordingly, their pixel-based area fractions were similar (Table 2). However, a rigorous analysis based on a combination of image processing and permeation modeling reveals that the defect size (&#x2dc;2.8 nm) in CHA_20 was &#x2dc;2 times of that (1.3 nm) in CHA_&#x221e;. In turn, this fact confirms the lower CO<sub>2 </sub>permselectivity of CHA_20 under dry conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref><b>1</b>) than that of CHA_&#x221e; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c</i></figref><b>1</b>). Furthermore, the CO<sub>2 </sub>molar fluxes passing through the defects in CHA_20 and _&#x221e; at 30&#xb0; C. under dry conditions accounted for 27% and 5% of the total CO<sub>2 </sub>molar flux through the membranes, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). Surprisingly, it was noted that despite the porosity of 0.19%, the molar flux of CO<sub>2 </sub>through the defects in CHA_20 was pronounced, indicating the importance of synthetic (here, nominal Si/Al ratio) or post-treatment methods for the effective reduction of defects in CHA membranes. Indeed, the reduction in porosity from 0.19% to 0.08% could decrease the molar flux through the defects from 27% to 5% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). This is consistent with the previous conclusion showing that a very low number of defects (less than 1%) significantly degrade the zeolite membrane performance In fact, the difference in the defect sizes (2.8 nm for CHA_20 vs. 1.3 nm for CHA_&#x221e;) was key to the substantial change in their CO<sub>2 </sub>permselectivities (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref><b>1</b>-<b>2</b><i>c</i><b>1</b>).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="84pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Tortuosity</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>x-</entry><entry>y-</entry><entry>z-</entry><entry>Area </entry><entry>Porosity</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Sample</entry><entry>direction</entry><entry>direction</entry><entry>direction</entry><entry>fraction<sup>a</sup></entry><entry>(%)<sup>b</sup></entry><entry>Ref.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>SSZ-13</entry><entry>2.17</entry><entry>2.23</entry><entry>1.10</entry><entry>6.85 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;2</sup></entry><entry>0.27</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry>Membrane</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>CHA_20</entry><entry>3.02</entry><entry>3.10</entry><entry>1.35</entry><entry>5.36 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;2</sup></entry><entry>0.24</entry><entry>Present</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>invention</entry></row><row><entry>CHA_100</entry><entry>2.55</entry><entry>2.56</entry><entry>1.58</entry><entry>8.17 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;2</sup></entry><entry>0.30</entry><entry>Present</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>invention</entry></row><row><entry>CHA_&#x221e;</entry><entry>3.81</entry><entry>3.69</entry><entry>1.24</entry><entry>4.86 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;2</sup></entry><entry>0.13</entry><entry>Present</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>invention</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0090" num="0087">As already inferred from the CO<sub>2 </sub>separation performance in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref><b>1</b>-<i>c</i><b>1</b>, the more defective CHA_100 had a lower maximum CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SF (5.2) under dry conditions (for convenience, referred to as dry maximum CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SF) than that of CHA_&#x221e; (7.3). Thus, the visualized defect structure along with the hydrophobicity (as indicated by the water droplet contact angle (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b><i>b</i>-<i>c</i></figref>) and EDX results (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref><b>2</b>-<i>c</i><b>2</b>)) could account for the permeation behavior (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref><b>2</b>-<i>c</i><b>2</b>) of both membranes under wet conditions. The reduction in CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance under wet conditions through CHA_&#x221e; (less hydrophobic) seemingly resulted from the combined adsorption of water vapor in the defects and on the membrane surface. This preserved the high molecular sieving ability for CO<sub>2 </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c</i></figref><b>2</b>). In contrast, CHA_100, which was more hydrophobic and had a larger number of defects, provided high CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance because of the high hydrophobicity thereof. Although some water vapor was adsorbed on the defects, the CO<sub>2 </sub>molecules could pass through the preferentially out-of-plane oriented CHA zeolite channels.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0088">Compared to that under dry conditions, the membrane separation performance under wet conditions is a strongly couple function of the zeolite structure, surface hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, and size/number of defects. Thus, summarized all possible membrane properties relevant to the permeation behavior of CHA_100 and _&#x221e; and their CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>permeation results at 30&#xb0; C. are summarized in Table 3, in which those of another SSZ-13 membrane (for convenience, referred to as SSZ-13 in this section) are also given for comparison. First, the effects of defects (defect (crack) porosity and defect size) on the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SFs of CHA_&#x221e; and SSZ-13 were considered. The porosity difference between the two membranes (0.08% for CHA_&#x221e; and 0.15% for SSZ-13 in Table 2) had a significant effect on their respective dry maximum CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SFs of 7.3 and 4.6. This observation is consistent with the relationship between the porosity and dry maximum CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SF for CHA_20 and _&#x221e;. More specifically, given the similar area fraction of CHA_20 and _&#x221e; (Table 3), the crack size was critical in determining the final separation performance. Thus, the crack size of CHA_100, which could not be determined from its FCOM images, will be less than &#x2dc;3.1 nm to achieve the dry maximum CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SF of 5.2, because the corresponding crack density was higher than that of CHA_&#x221e;

Second, in less hydrophobic CHA_&#x221e;, the CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance (&#x2dc;1.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>mol&#xb7;<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>&#xb7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#xb7;Pa<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) reduced by the surface inhibition was much higher than those (&#x2dc;7.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>mol&#xb7;m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>&#xb7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#xb7;Pa<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) for CHA_100 and SSZ-13 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). Finally, the CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance due solely to the zeolite parts for both CHA_100 and _&#x221e; was estimated. For this purpose, the CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance due to the defect-blocking was subtracted from the dry CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance. Specifically, it was estimated to be as high as 2.1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>mol&#xb7;m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>&#xb7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#xb7;Pa<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>for CHA_100, and this value was higher than the expected value of 1.4&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>mol&#xb7;m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>&#xb7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>&#xb7;Pa<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>in CHA_&#x221e;. This strongly indicates a beneficial role of the aforementioned preferred out-of-plane orientation in CHA_100.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example 6: Comparison in Separation Performance between CHA 100 and &#x221e;</heading><p id="p-0097" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i></figref>shows a summary of the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation performance of CHA_100 and _&#x221e;, as well as those of other zeolite membranes. Only the CO<sub>2 </sub>separation performance measured at &#x2dc;40-50&#xb0; C. under dry and wet conditions is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. As already shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c</i></figref><b>1</b>-<i>c</i><b>2</b>, the CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SFs of CHA_&#x221e; for the wet equimolar CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>mixture were increased compared to those under dry conditions. This trend had been also found for other hydrophobic zeolite membranes (DDR and SSZ-13). However, hydrophilic NaY membranes (Si/Al ratio of &#x2dc;1.5-3) showed the opposite trend. Although these membranes showed a marked CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation performance under dry conditions, they lost this ability completely under wet conditions (water vapor pressure of &#x2dc;2.6 kPa). This indicates the importance of hydrophobicity in membranes for securing high performance under wet conditions, as has been addressed and emphasized above. In addition, CHA_&#x221e; was not significantly hydrophobic (as reflected by the lower water droplet contact angle; 25&#xb0; vs. 80&#xb0; for CHA_100, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>). Accordingly, the CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance for CHA_&#x221e; decreased more under wet conditions. Despite the much lowered CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance in CHA_&#x221e;, some defects, where water vapor was apparently condensed, were beneficial for securing a high CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SF under wet conditions. Nevertheless, the optimal defect size should be satisfied because the wider defects (here, &#x2dc;3.5 nm for CHA_20, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) negated the separation performance regardless of the presence of water vapor in the feed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref><b>1</b>-<i>a</i><b>2</b>). The same trend as that observed for permeation for CHA_100 and _&#x221e; in dry and wet CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>feeds (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>a</i></figref>) was also observed for CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>b</i></figref>), with a minor difference being the comparable CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>SFs under dry and wet conditions. This trend can be explained by the good dry CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>performance through the 8 MR zeolite membranes. Although a negative effect of non-zeolitic defects on the final performance could not be excluded completely, the defects present in CHA_100 and _&#x221e; did not provide a non-selective pathway for the larger CH<sub>4 </sub>molecules under dry conditions. Under wet conditions, water molecules physisorbed in the defects would not contribute to a significant reduction in the CH<sub>4 </sub>permeance. Instead, the transport of the faster permeating species, CO<sub>2</sub>, was inhibited. This reduction in the CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance was still much higher for the less hydrophobic CHA_&#x221e;. Considering the fact that a more hydrophobic DDR membrane (water contact angle of 95&#xb0;) showed a similar pattern to that of CHA_&#x221e; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>b</i></figref>), it appears that an appropriate combination of hydrophobicity and defect density/size is required to achieve high CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation performance under wet conditions. Nevertheless, minimization of defects is always desirable for securing high performance under dry conditions. In particular, CHA_100 showed the highest molar flux of CO<sub>2 </sub>in both CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>binary mixtures, having comparable CO<sub>2 </sub>permselectivities under wet conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). Specifically, the CO<sub>2 </sub>permeances at 50&#xb0; C. under wet conditions were as high as &#x2dc;20-25% of the CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance through bare supports with &#x2dc;150 nm pore size. Finally, although the difference in the kinetic diameters of CH<sub>4 </sub>(0.38 nm) and N<sub>2 </sub>(0.364 nm) was extremely small, the resulting performance in favor of CO<sub>2 </sub>molecules was quite distinct under both dry and wet conditions.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0094">According to the present invention, a uniform CHA seed layer was prepared via the physical attachment of plate-like Si-CHA seed particles to an &#x3b1;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>disc. The limited accessibility for seed particles to reach the surface of the &#x3b1;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>disc was key to obtaining a uniform seed layer. Despite being the minor portion, the plate-like particles dominated the seed layer. The subsequent secondary growth of the seed layer with a synthetic precursor that had nominal Si/Al ratios of 100 and infinity allowed for the formation of continuous CHA membranes (denoted CHA_100 and _&#x221e;, respectively).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0095">The synthesized CHA membranes showed modest CO<sub>2 </sub>SFs (5.2 for CHA_100 and 7.3 for CHA_&#x221e; at 30&#xb0; C.) when using dry CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>binary mixtures. However, they showed improved CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SFs as high as 13.4 for CHA_100 and 9.7 for CHA_&#x221e; at 30&#xb0; C., when using a wet feed. Such performance improvement was ascribed to the defect blocking by physisorbed water molecules and pronounced for more defective CHA_100. The trend observed for CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>separation was similar to that for CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation, but the dry and wet CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>SFs were comparable to each other. Considering the CO<sub>2 </sub>molar flux (relevant to CO<sub>2 </sub>recovery) and CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>SF (relevant to CO<sub>2 </sub>purity) in a coupled way, CHA_100 showed a marked activity for CO<sub>2 </sub>capture in the temperature range of 30-75&#xb0; C. (representative of flue gas temperatures). In addition, the degree of CO<sub>2 </sub>permeance reduction (75%) due to the presence of water vapor in the feed was much larger for less hydrophobic CHA_&#x221e; (water contact angle: 25&#xb0;) than that (39%) observed for CHA_100 (water contact angle: 80&#xb0;), supporting that hydrophobic membrane constituents have desirable roles on membrane performance. In particular, the CO<sub>2 </sub>molar fluxes through zeolitic parts and non-zeolitic parts could be effectively deciphered by complementing the information extracted from the image processing of FCOM images with a one dimensional permeation model. This indicates that increasing hydrophobicity was desirable for securing high CO<sub>2 </sub>permselectivities under a realistic water vapor-containing feed condition, where defects with proper size/density could be well blocked by physically adsorbed water molecules.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading><p id="p-0100" num="0096">According to the present invention, by producing a CHA zeolite membrane having a high Si/Al ratio, a CHA zeolite membrane having high CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2 </sub>and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4 </sub>separation performance even under wet conditions can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0097">In addition, the CHA zeolite membrane has an effect of exhibiting high separation performance even under feed conditions containing water, regardless of the temperature and pressure of the flue gas.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0098">Although specific configurations of the present invention have been described in detail, those skilled in the art will appreciate that this description is provided to set forth preferred embodiments for illustrative purposes and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention.
