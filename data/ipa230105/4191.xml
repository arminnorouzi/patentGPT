The flexible display panel has a bending portion and non-bending portions disposed on two sides of the bending portion respectively. The support device may include two support parts, and each support part may be connected to one non-bending portion of the flexible display panel to support the non-bending portion.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">However, the support device does not support the bending portion of the flexible display panel, and the flexible display panel has a poor rigidity. Thus, the bending portion of the flexible display panel bulges easily, resulting in a poor flatness of the flexible display panel.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the field of display technologies, the foldable display device may be prepared by using a bendable flexible display panel, so as to meet the users' demand for large screen display and improve portability of the display device. The foldable display device is foldable and occupies a relatively small space after being folded, and thus is portable. When the foldable display device is unfolded, the region for displaying images has a relatively large area, and the display effect is</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Generally, the flexible display panel in the foldable display device needs to be supported such that the flexible display panel has a good <sup>-</sup>flatness and impact resistance, thereby ensuring the display effect of the foldable display device. However, in the related art, the support device cannot provide the bending portion of the flexible display panel effectively, resulting in poor rigidity of the bending portion of the flexible display panel. Therefore, in the case that the foldable display device is bent, the bending portion of the flexible display panel bulges backwards easily, which results in poor flatness of the flexible display panel when the foldable display device returns from the bent state to the flat state. Moreover, as the bending portion of the flexible display panel bulges backwards, the creases between the bending portion and the non-bending portion are serious, and the film layer in the flexible display panel is easy to strip off. Therefore, the flexible display panel as a short service life.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Exemplarily, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in the case that the foldable display device <b>00</b> is folded outwardly, the bending portion <b>001</b><i>a </i>of the flexible display panel <b>001</b> bulges towards the side proximal to the support device <b>002</b> supporting the flexible display panel <b>001</b>. Alternatively, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in the case that the foldable display device <b>00</b> is is folded inwardly, the bending portion <b>001</b><i>a </i>of the flexible display panel <b>001</b> bulges towards the side distal from the support device <b>002</b> supporting the flexible display panel <b>001</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">After the foldable display device <b>00</b> is folded outwardly, the flexible display panel <b>001</b> is disposed at the outer side relative to the support device <b>002</b>, That is, the display surface of the flexible display panel <b>001</b> is disposed at the outer side. After the foldable display device is folded inwardly, the flexible display panel <b>001</b> is disposed at the inner side relative to the support device <b>002</b>.
