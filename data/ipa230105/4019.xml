Thus users can select the glasses they need to wear according to timing and their requirements. Most of consumers now have a plurality of glasses with different functions to meet their requirements. For example, the sports glasses need to have ultraviolet resistance due to strong sunlight in the daytime while allow more light to pass through at night because of dim light at night.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">No matter which glasses users pick, the design of the glasses includes lenses held in assembly holes of a frame. By threaded fasteners threaded into screw holes beside the assembly holes of the frame, the lenses are held and fixed in the assembly holes securely.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although the above structure provides expected stable connection between the lenses and the frame, tools are required for assembly and disassembly of the lenses with the assembly holes while in use. A tool for driving threaded fasteners is turned to make the threaded fasteners tight or loose. Thereby the assembly and disassembly of the lenses are not convenient once users don't have a tool at hand.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus there is room for improvement and there is a need to provide novel full frame glasses which address the issues mentioned above.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a pair of full frame glasses in which an upper frame portion and a lower frame portion of a frame are connected and holding lenses in the frame firmly. No tool is required during assembly and disassembly of the lenses so that the assembly and disassembly of the lenses are easier, quicker and more convenient.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to achieve the above object, a pair of full frame glasses of the present invention mainly include a frame and a fixing member. The frame is composed of an upper frame portion, a lower frame portion, and two lens assembly holes. The upper frame portion and the lower frame portion are connected by outer edges on two sides of both the upper and the lower frame portions while the lens assembly holes are formed between the two sides of the upper and the lower frame portions for mounting two lenses therein. A through hole and a mounting fixing hole corresponding to the through hole are located at a middle part of the upper frame portion and a middle part of the lower frame portion respectively. An upper mounting wall is formed behind of the through hole and a lower mounting wall is formed at the back of the mounting fixing hole.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The fixing member includes an elastic mounting portion projecting from the fixing member and corresponding to the through hole and the mounting fixing hole, and an elastic positioning piece which is extending and projecting from the fixing member and located behind the elastic mounting portion. The elastic mounting portion is inserted through the through hole and the mounting fixing hole. An upper mounting projection corresponding to a lower edge of the upper mounting wall of the upper frame portion is projecting from the elastic positioning piece and used for being locked with and positioned by the lower edge of the upper mounting wall. A lower mounting projection corresponding to a lower edge of the lower mounting wall of the lower frame portion is projecting from the elastic positioning piece and used for being locked with and positioned by the lower edge of the lower mounting wall.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The structure and the technical means adopted by the present invention to achieve the above and other objects can be best understood by referring to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exploded view of an embodiment according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded sectional side view of an embodiment according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of an embodiment according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a partial front sectional view of an embodiment according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a sectional side view of an embodiment according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view of an embodiment during replacement of lenses according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a sectional side view of an embodiment during replacement of lenses according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a partial front sectional view of an embodiment during replacement of lenses according to the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In order to learn technical content, purposes and functions of the present invention more clearly and completely, please refer to the following detailed descriptions with the figures and reference signs.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a pair of full frame glasses of the present invention mainly include a frame <b>1</b> and a fixing member <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The frame <b>1</b> consists of an upper frame portion <b>11</b>, a lower frame portion <b>12</b>, and two lens assembly holes <b>13</b>.

A through hole <b>111</b> is located at and penetrating a middle part of the upper frame portion <b>11</b> while an upper mounting wall <b>112</b> is formed at the back of the through hole <b>111</b>. A mounting fixing hole <b>121</b> corresponding to the through hole <b>111</b> of the upper frame portion <b>11</b> is arranged at and penetrating a middle part of the lower frame portion <b>12</b> while a lower mounting wall <b>122</b> is formed behind the mounting fixing hole <b>121</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The fixing member <b>2</b> is provided with an elastic mounting portion <b>21</b> projecting from the fixing member <b>2</b> and an elastic positioning piece <b>22</b> extending and projecting from the fixing member <b>2</b> and located behind the elastic mounting portion <b>21</b>. The elastic mounting portion <b>21</b> is corresponding to and aligned with the through hole <b>111</b> and the mounting fixing hole <b>121</b> of the frame <b>1</b>. An upper mounting projection <b>221</b> corresponding to a lower edge of the upper mounting wall <b>112</b> of the upper frame portion <b>11</b> and a lower mounting projection <b>222</b> corresponding to a lower edge of the lower mounting wall <b>122</b> of the lower frame portion <b>12</b> are projecting from the elastic positioning piece <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">While being assembled, the lenses <b>14</b> are mounted into the lens assembly holes <b>13</b> formed between two sides of the upper frame portion <b>11</b> and the lower frame portion <b>12</b> correspondingly. Then the elastic mounting portion <b>21</b> of the fixing member <b>2</b> is aligned with and inserted through the through hole <b>111</b> of the upper frame portion <b>11</b> and the mounting fixing hole <b>121</b> of the lower frame portion <b>12</b> with a lower part thereof protruding from the mounting fixing hole <b>121</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Now the elastic positioning piece <b>22</b> of the fixing member <b>2</b> is attached closely to a rear end of both the upper mounting wall <b>112</b> of the upper frame portion <b>11</b> and the lower mounting wall <b>122</b> of the lower frame portion <b>12</b> while the upper mounting projection <b>221</b> is locked with and positioned by the lower edge of the upper mounting wall <b>112</b> and the lower mounting projection <b>222</b> is locked with and positioned by the lower edge of the lower mounting wall <b>122</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Thereby the upper and the lower frame portions <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> of the frame <b>1</b> are connected and fixed firmly and the lenses <b>14</b> securely held and positioned in the lens assembly holes <b>13</b> securely, without falling off.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, when users intend to replace the lens <b>14</b> in the lens assembly hole <b>13</b>, they apply a force to pull a lower end of the elastic positioning piece <b>22</b> of the fixing member <b>2</b> so that the lower mounting projection <b>222</b> of the elastic positioning piece <b>22</b> is released from the lower edge of the lower mounting wall <b>122</b> of the lower frame portion <b>12</b>. Thus the upper frame portion <b>11</b> and the lower frame portion <b>12</b> of the frame <b>1</b> are able to be separated from each other. While the upper and the lower frame portions <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> being moved away from each other, the elastic mounting portion <b>21</b> is just leaning against a lower part of the mounting fixing hole <b>121</b> of the lower frame portion <b>12</b> to prevent a gap formed between the separated upper and the lower frame portions <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> from becoming too large. Such design not only prevents the lens <b>14</b> from getting loose and falling off from the lens assembly hole <b>13</b>, but also protects the frame <b>1</b> from deformation and damages. Thereby the lenses <b>14</b> can be replaced. After completing the replacement, the upper frame portion <b>11</b> and the lower frame portion <b>12</b> are moved toward to and become in contact with each other and then the lower mounting projection <b>222</b> is locked with and positioned by the lower mounting wall <b>122</b> again. Thus the lenses <b>14</b> are held and positioned in the lens assembly holes <b>13</b> securely, without falling off.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In summary, compared with techniques available now, the upper frame portion and the lower frame portion hold and fix the lenses firmly by the arrangement of the fixing member in the present glasses. No tool is required during assembly and disassembly of the lenses. Thus the assembly and disassembly of the lenses is easier, quicker and more convenient.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details, and representative devices shown and described herein.
