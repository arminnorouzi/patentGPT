A quantum random number generator (QRNG) is mainly applied in fields such as quantum encryption, quantum communication, and fiber optic communication, but is not limited to these fields.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a conventional optical structure, components such as a fiber beam splitter, a laser, and a detector are separately encapsulated, and a fiber connection is used between the components. On the one hand, each discrete component is large in volume, and a bending radius of an optical fiber is large. As a result, the device is large in volume, pin specifications of the components are not the same, and a layout thereof is complex. In use, the components need to be manually welded to a printed circuit board. On the other hand, the optical fiber is prone to break and is difficult to install and use. In addition, the optical fiber is susceptible to an ambient temperature and vibration, causing a degradation of product performance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The laser has a large volume and an optical fiber with a large turning radius. In use, the optical fiber is likely to change in refractive index due to vibration and a temperature, causing a change in optical intensity. In addition, a driving circuit of the laser is complex, requiring high power consumption for independent temperature control, and the driving circuit is large in overall volume. A process of the fiber beam splitter itself may also cause unequal beam splitting ratio of optical intensity. In order to adjust the beam splitting ratio of the fiber beam splitter, an attenuator is usually added. However, the attenuator requires high voltage accuracy and is difficult to make. Consequently, a difficult of circuit design is greatly increased. Consequently, in the conventional optical structure, the optical fiber is susceptible to an external temperature and vibration, which causes an overall change of an optical system. In a conventional solution, a quantum random number generator device is susceptible to interference of an external environment, and the system is very unstable overall.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An overview of the subject matter detailed in the present disclosure is provided below, which is not intended to limit the protection scope of the claims.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure aims to provide a vacuum fluctuation quantum random number generator chip with a laser, a beam splitter, and photodetectors integrated as a whole.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure provides a quantum vacuum fluctuation quantum random number generator chip based on a photonic integration technology, including a heat sink substrate, a laser, a beam splitter, and at least two photoelectric detectors; wherein the laser is fixed to a first end of the heat sink substrate, the at least two photoelectric detectors are fixed to a second end of the heat sink substrate, the beam splitter is fixed to the heat sink substrate and is located between the laser and the detectors, laser light of the laser propagates through the beam splitter, and the at least two photoelectric detectors are respectively positioned at optical path outlets of the beam splitter.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The vacuum fluctuation quantum random number generator chip further includes a semiconductor cooler, the semiconductor cooler is fixed to the first end of the heat sink substrate, and the laser is fixed to the semiconductor cooler.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The vacuum fluctuation quantum random number generator chip further includes a lens, and the lens is located between a light ray outlet of the laser and an optical path inlet of the beam splitter.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The beam splitter is a Y-waveguide beam splitter, for example, a PLC optical waveguide.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The laser is, but is not limited to, a DFB laser.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">An emission end of the beam splitter is a bevel structure having an angle less than 90&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A quantity of the photoelectric detectors is equal to a quantity of outlet ports of the beam splitter.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this embodiment of the present disclosure, the high-speed quantum random number generator based on a vacuum fluctuation technology can achieve the following beneficial effects:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the present disclosure, by using a photonic integration technology, the laser, the beam splitter, and the photoelectric detectors are coupled and then fixed on the heat sink base for encapsulation.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the vacuum fluctuation QRNG chip includes a heat sink substrate <b>1</b>, a laser <b>2</b>, a beam splitter <b>3</b>, and at least two photoelectric detectors <b>4</b>. The laser <b>2</b> is fixed to a first end of the heat sink substrate <b>1</b>, and serves as a light source of the QRNG. The at least two photoelectric detectors <b>4</b> are fixed to a second end of the heat sink substrate <b>1</b>, and are configured to detect strength of each optical signal sent by the beam splitter <b>3</b>, and separately convert each optical signal into an electrical signal for output. The beam splitter <b>3</b> is fixed to the middle of the heat sink substrate <b>1</b>, and is configured to divide an optical signal emitted by the two laser <b>2</b> into at least two optical signals and output the optical signals.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Specifically, light of the laser <b>2</b> enters the beam splitter <b>3</b>, and the at least two photoelectric detectors <b>4</b> are respectively positioned at optical path outlets of the beam splitter <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A quantity of photoelectric detectors <b>4</b> is equal to a quantity of optical paths that need to be detected at an outlet of the beam splitter <b>3</b>. For example, when the beam splitter <b>3</b> is a two-way optical beam splitter, two photoelectric detectors <b>4</b> are correspondingly disposed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an optional embodiment, the vacuum fluctuation QRNG chip further includes a semiconductor cooler <b>5</b>, configured to control a temperature of the laser <b>2</b>, so as to ensure stability of emergent light of the laser <b>2</b> and a service life of the laser <b>2</b>. Specifically, the semiconductor cooler <b>5</b> is fixed to the first end of the heat sink substrate <b>1</b>, and the laser <b>2</b> is fixed to the semiconductor cooler <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an optional embodiment, the vacuum fluctuation QRNG chip further includes a lens <b>6</b>. The lens <b>6</b> is located between a light ray outlet of the laser <b>2</b> and an optical path inlet of the beam splitter <b>3</b>, and is configured to aggregate a beam emitted by the laser <b>2</b> into the optical path inlet of the beam splitter <b>3</b>, so as to improve optical conductivity. Specifically, both the lens <b>6</b> and the laser <b>2</b> are disposed on the semiconductor cooler <b>5</b>, or may be directly disposed on the heat sink substrate <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a technical solution of this disclosure, the beam splitter <b>3</b> may be a one-division multiway beam splitter, or may be an N-division multiway beam splitter, where N is a natural number greater than 1.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a typical embodiment, the beam splitter <b>3</b> is a Y-waveguide beam splitter, for example, a PLC optical waveguide beam splitter, including one optical path inlet and two optical path outlets. Correspondingly, the vacuum fluctuation QRNG chip includes two photoelectric detectors <b>4</b>, and is respectively located at the two optical path outlets of the beam splitter <b>3</b>. A laser beam emitted by the laser <b>2</b> enters from the optical path inlet of the beam splitter <b>3</b>, and is divided into two beams and then emitted from the two optical path outlets to the two photoelectric detectors <b>4</b>. For example, the beam splitter <b>3</b> may be an equal-ratio optical beam splitter, that is, a split ratio is 50%:50%, or may be an unequal-ratio optical beam splitter, for example, a split ratio may be 40%:60%.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a specific embodiment, an emission end of the beam splitter <b>3</b> is a bevel structure having an angle less than 90&#xb0;. After each split beam is reflected through the bevel, a beam direction rotates and the beam is irradiated on the photoelectric detector <b>4</b>. In another embodiment, an emission end of the beam splitter <b>3</b> may alternatively be a bevel structure at another angle or a vertical plane structure, and it only needs to be ensured that emergent light is accurately received by the photoelectric detector <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the vacuum fluctuation QRNG chip in the present disclosure, the laser <b>2</b>, the beam splitter <b>3</b>, and the photoelectric detectors <b>4</b> each are integrated on the heat sink base <b>1</b> through a photonic integration technology, so that an optical chip laser <b>1</b> and the waveguide component beam splitter <b>3</b> are integrated by coupling. Therefore, not only an optical fiber connection is not required, but also an integrated chip encapsulated as a whole is small in volume and light in weight. In addition, pin specifications are the same, so that mounting on a printed circuit board can be implemented directly by using a machine.
