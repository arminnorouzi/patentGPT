The vehicle according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure includes, but is not limited to, an automobile or an industrial vehicle, and may also include a railroad vehicle, a community vehicle, or a fixed-wing aircraft traveling on a runway. The automobile includes, but is not limited to, a passenger vehicle, a truck, a bus, a motorcycle, or a trolley bus, and may also include another vehicle traveling on a road. The industrial vehicle includes an agricultural vehicle or a construction vehicle. The industrial vehicle includes, but is not limited to, a forklift or a golf cart. The agricultural vehicle includes, but is not limited to, a tractor, a cultivator, a transplanter, a binder, a combine, or a lawn mower. The construction vehicle includes, but is not limited to, a bulldozer, a scraper, a power shovel, a crane vehicle, a dump truck, or a road roller. The vehicle includes a man-powered vehicle. The classification of the vehicle is not limited to the above examples. For example, the automobile may include an industrial vehicle traveling on a road, and one type of vehicle may fall within a plurality of classes. The vessel according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure includes a jet ski, a boat, or a tanker.
