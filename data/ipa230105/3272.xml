They have been used in the automotive industry to provide an additional spring element in shock absorber systems to prevent damage from occurring to the shock absorber in case of excessive impacts.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The use of volume-compressible materials such as cellular, in particular micro-cellular polyurethane foams has been gaining relevance in recent years due to the advantageous properties of these volume-compressible materials. The production of jounce bumpers, i.e. the base bodies of those jounce bumpers from these volume-compressible materials is generally known in the art, inter alia from documents EP A 62 83, EP A 36 994, EP A 250 969, DE A 195 48 770 and DE A 195 48 771.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A number of users have in the past relied on of rubber materials instead of volume-compressible materials. Rubber or similar materials have a reduced compression capability in direct comparison with volume-compressible materials, but at the same time also have a higher block length in the direction of the longitudinal axis. For some applications, increased block length is a desired property leading to a certain reluctance in adopting the use of otherwise advantageous volume-compressible materials.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It has therefore been an object of the invention to provide a jounce bumper which overcomes the challenges mentioned hereinabove as far as possible. In particular, it was an object of the invention to suggest jounce bumper, the base body of which can be made from volume-compressible material, but at the same time provides larger block length without adversely affecting the dampening and suspension characteristics afforded by the volume-compressible material.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention achieves the object by suggesting a jounce bumper of the aforementioned type, wherein the base body further comprises at least one secondary spring element integrated within the base body, wherein the secondary spring element is resiliently deformable between a first length in the uncompressed state and a second length in the compressed state, the second length being smaller than the first length, and partially or completely made of a compact second material.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In terms of the invention, compact materials are understood to be non-cellular and insofar not or at least less volume-compressible. The length reduction in the direction of the longitudinal axis with these materials is typically compensated at least in part by a radial expansion inwards and/or outwards.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention is thus based upon the realization that by integrating a secondary spring element having material properties that lead to reduced compressibility affords an increase of the block length of the jounce bumper as a whole. On its way towards reaching the compressed state, the secondary spring element resists the compression in the axial direction within the limits determined by its spring rate, which can be selected based upon customer-specific requirements. At the same time, the primary spring element, i.e. the base body, can still be made of volume-compressible material which affords a sensitive, i.e. &#x201c;soft&#x201d; initial deformation resistance such that the jounce bumper is an ideal compromise between purely volume-compressible jounce bumper and purely compact jounce bumpers: The deformation resistance is soft in the initially deformation stages, but increasingly progressive as deformation increases, including an increased block length which is defined by the length of the secondary spring element in its compressed state.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">By integrating the secondary spring element into the volume of the base body, the invention suggests a singular part where in prior art solutions the jounce bumper would typically be amended with additional supporting members such as stiffening rings or the like in attempts to create a progressive stiffening of the jounce bumper. The invention thus suggests a jounce bumper having improved suspension properties while at the same time affording a simplified installation on the vehicle suspension system, in particular by protecting and shielding the secondary spring element from environmental influences.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a preferred embodiment, the base body at least partially, and preferably completely encapsulates the secondary spring element. Further particularly, the secondary spring element is encapsulated by the base body in a substantially cavity-free manner.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a further preferred embodiment, the secondary spring element is configured to have a predetermined block length when in the compressed state.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a further preferred embodiment, the first spring element comprises a first spring rate and a secondary spring element comprises a second spring rate that is lower than the first spring rate or equal to the spring rate. The spring rate is understood to mean the ratio by which the respective spring element can be compressed relative to its uncompressed basic state. As an example, a spring element of 100 mm length in its basic state and 30 mm in its fully compressed state (block length) would have a spring rate of 70%. A lower spring rate thus indicates that the block length relative to the length in the uncompressed state is increased.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further preferably, the spring rate of the first spring element (without the second spring element) is in the range of more than 65%, preferably 70% or more. Alternatively or additionally, the spring rate of the second spring element is in the range of 70% or less, preferably 65% or less.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a further preferred embodiment, the secondary spring element is selected from the list of:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0015">coil spring, preferably helical</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0016">wave spring,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0017">a plurality of ring elements, preferably disk springs or washers, spaced apart from one another in the direction of the longitudinal axis, or</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0018">a resiliently deformable cage.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">In a preferred embodiment, in particular in case of using one of the elements from the aforementioned list, the secondary spring element is stiffer in a radial direction than the primary spring element. In this the radial direction is understood to be perpendicular to the direction of the longitudinal axis. This allows a more homogeneous deformation of the primary spring element in the axial direction, since the radial expansion is restricted by the secondary spring element. This in turn allows the jounce bumper to be designed narrower, i.e. having a reduced width relative to its length. As a consequence thereof, also the surrounding parts of e.g. the vehicle or vehicle suspension system can be dimensioned more efficiently.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">Alternatively or additionally, the secondary spring element preferably is softer (as opposed to stiffer) in the longitudinal direction than the primary spring element. This allows for desired deformation behavior (soft initially and progressively stiff subsequently) while at the same time contributing to an increased block length.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">In a further preferred embodiment, the first material is a cellular polyisocyanate polyaddition product.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">The base body here can be composed of an elastomer, but it can also be composed of a plurality of elastomers which are present in layers, in shell form or in another form or also in a mixture with one another. The polyisocyanate polyaddition products are preferably constructed on the basis of microcellular polyurethane elastomers, on the basis of thermoplastic polyurethane or from combinations of said two materials which may optionally comprise polyurea structures.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">Microcellular polyurethane elastomers which, in a preferred embodiment, have a density according to DIN 53420 of 200 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>to 1100 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, preferably 300 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>to 800 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, a tensile strength according to DIN 53571 of 2 N/mm<sup>2</sup>, preferably 2 N/mm<sup>2 </sup>to 8 N/mm<sup>2</sup>, an elongation according to DIN 53571 of 300%, preferably 300% to 700%, and a tear strength according to DIN 53515 of preferably 8 N/mm to 25 N/mm are particularly preferred.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">The elastomers are preferably microcellular elastomers on the basis of polyisocyanate polyaddition products, preferably having cells with a diameter of 0.01 mm to 0.5 mm, particularly preferably 0.01 to 0.15 mm.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">Elastomers on the basis of polyisocyanate polyaddition products and the production thereof are known in general and described numerously, for example in EP A 62 835, EP A 36 994, EP A 250 969, DE A 195 48 770 and DE A 195 48 771.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">Production customarily takes place by reacting isocyanates with compounds which are reactive to isocyanates.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">The elastomers on the basis of cellular polyisocyanate polyaddition products are customarily produced in a mold in which the reactive starting components are reacted with one another. Suitable molds here are generally customary molds, for example metal molds, which, on the basis of their shape, ensure the three dimensional shape according to the invention of the spring element. In one embodiment, the contour elements are integrated directly in the casting mold; in a further embodiment, they are retrospectively incorporated into the concentric basic body. In a preferred embodiment, the concentric spring element is cooled for this purpose until it solidifies, preferably with liquid nitrogen, and processed in this state.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028">The polyisocyanate polyaddition products can be produced according to generally known methods, for example by the following starting substances being used in a single or two stage process:</p><p id="p-0026" num="0000">(a) isocyanate,<br/>(b) compounds reactive to isocyanates,<br/>(c) water and optionally<br/>(d) catalysts,<br/>(e) blowing agents and/or<br/>(f) auxiliary and/or additional substances, for example polysiloxanes and/or fatty acid sulfonates.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029">The surface temperature of the inner wall of the mold is customarily 40&#xb0; C. to 95&#xb0; C., preferably 50&#xb0; C. to 90&#xb0; C. The production of the molded parts is advantageously carried out at an NCO/OH ratio of 0.85 to 1.20, wherein the heated starting components are mixed and brought in a quantity corresponding to the desired molded part density into a heated, preferably tightly closing molding tool. The molded parts are cured for 5 minutes to 60 minutes and then can be removed from the mold. The quantity of the reaction mixture introduced into the molding tool is customarily dimensioned in such a manner that the molded bodies obtained have the density already presented. The starting components are customarily introduced into the molding tool at a temperature of 15&#xb0; C. to 120&#xb0; C., preferably of 30&#xb0; C. to 110&#xb0; C. The degrees of compression for producing the molded bodies lie between 1.1 and 8, preferably between 2 and 6. The cellular polyisocyanate polyaddition products are expediently produced according to the &#x201c;one shot&#x201d; method with the aid of high pressure technology, low pressure technology or in particular reaction injection molding technology (RIM) in open or preferably closed molding tools. The reaction is carried out in particular by compression in a closed molding tool. The reaction injection molding technology is described, for example, by H. Piechota and H. Rohr in &#x201c;Integralschaumstoffe&#x201d;, Carl Hanser-Verlag, Munich, Vienna 1975; D. J. Prepelka and J. L. Wharton in Journal of Cellular Plastics, March/April 1975, pages 87 to 98 and U.

The procedure of creating the base body can otherwise virtually remain the same.
