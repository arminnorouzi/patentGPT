The systems and methods described herein are generally directed to determining cable routes for a railway infrastructure via a graphical user interface (GUI) during a design, installation and/or repair phase of the railway, for example. Railway infrastructure refers to one or more railways and railway equipment or devices associated with the operation of one or more railways.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there is illustrated a railway management system <b>100</b> for determining at least one cable route. A computing device <b>102</b> is configured to cause a GUI to be provided on a display device <b>122</b>. The GUI is provided in order to display graphical representations of railway infrastructure, such as, for example, cable routes between various positions of the railway infrastructure and any associated cable routing parameters for the cable routes. A user may interact with the GUI via one or more input devices <b>124</b>. For example, the user may interact with the GUI to request a cable route between two positions. By way of another example, the user may interact with the GUI to view a given cable route and/or to view any cable routing parameters associated with a given cable route. The display device <b>122</b> may be any suitable display device, for example, such as a cathode ray tube display screen, a light-emitting diode display screen, a liquid crystal display screen, a touch screen, or any other suitable display device. The input device(s) <b>124</b> may include a keyboard, a mouse, a touch pad, a joy stick, a light pen, a track ball, a touch screen, or any other suitable input device for interacting with the GUI. In embodiments where the display device <b>122</b> is a touch screen device, the input device(s) <b>124</b> include the display device <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the illustrated embodiment, the computing device <b>102</b> communicates with another computing device <b>120</b> over one or more networks <b>110</b> to cause the GUI to be displayed on the display device <b>122</b>, as the display device <b>122</b> and the input device <b>124</b> are connected to the computing device <b>120</b>. The network(s) <b>110</b> may include a public network (e.g., the Internet) and/or a private network. The network(s) <b>110</b> may include one or more of a personal area networks (PAN), local area networks (LAN), mesh networks, metropolitan area networks (MAN), wide area networks (WAN), Wi-Fi networks, cellular networks and any other suitable networks. The computing devices <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may each be any suitable computing device, such as a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a mainframe, a server, a distributed computing system, a cloud computing system, a portable computing device, a mobile phone, a tablet, or the like. By way of example, the GUI may be provided via a web browser running on the computing device <b>120</b> (e.g., a laptop computer). The web browser may send queries to the computing device <b>102</b> (e.g., a server) and receive the information for display in the web browser from the computing device <b>102</b>. In alternative embodiments, the network <b>110</b> and the computing devices <b>120</b> may be omitted, such that the display device <b>122</b> and/or the input device <b>124</b> are directly connected to the computing device <b>102</b>. For example, the GUI may be provided via a software application running on the computing device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the computing device <b>102</b> is configured to display a cable routing plan via the GUI. The cable routing plan may specify a plurality of conduits (also referred to as &#x201c;ducts&#x201d;) and/or troughs that may be used to route one or more cables. The cable routing plan may specify a plurality of existing cables that are routed through the conduits and/or troughs. The cable routing plan may specify one or more new cables that are to be routed through the conduits and/or troughs. The cable routing plan may specify one or more devices, systems, power sources, signal sources, equipment, pull boxes, any other suitable electrical equipment, systems or devices, that are available for routing and/or have cables routed thereto and/or therethrough. The cable routing plan may include one or more cable routing parameters associated with any given cable, cable route, and/or component (e.g., devices, systems, power sources, signal sources, equipment, pull boxes, etc.). The cable routing parameters may include one or more of: containment types; route lengths, length of cable route segments in a global cable route network; cable types (e.g., cable is for power, signalling, or communication); one or more cable sizes, gauges or capacity; and information on one or more conduits and/or troughs along with available space in such conduits or troughs.

The cable route request is received via the GUI. More specifically, the user may be able to make the cable route request via the map interface using the input device(s) <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, the cable route request is provided by a user requesting a cable route between two positions, such as between two components of the railway infrastructure, via a GUI. For example, the user may click on the map interface with a mouse to select the first position and/or the second position.

Step <b>210</b> may include determining the cable route and/or the cable routing parameters based on the cable route request and the railway infrastructure information and/or the cable information obtained from the database(s). The at least one cable route may be determined based on the railway infrastructure information obtained at step <b>208</b>. The determined cable route and the associated cable routing parameters may be verified to confirm that there is no conflicts with the cable route and the associated cable routing parameters. In some embodiments, an optimal route between the first position and the second position is determined from a plurality of possible routes between the first position and the second position. In some embodiments, determining the at least one cable route includes determining a plurality of routes between the first position and the second position that have spare capacity and could be used as a cable route. In some embodiments, determining the at least one cable route includes obtaining the at least one cable route from the cable route request (e.g., the cable routing plan). In some embodiments, determining the cable routing parameters includes obtaining one or more cable routing parameters from the request e.g., the cable routing plan). In some embodiments, one or more diversions of a cable route provide in the cable route request and/or one or more corrections to a cable route provided in the cable route request is/are determined. The at least one cable route determined at step <b>210</b> between the first position and the second position may be based on the diversion(s) and/or correction(s) to one or more cable routes provided in the cable route request.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">At step <b>212</b>, the at least one cable route between the first position and the second position is displayed on the GUI. In some embodiments, cable route is displayed by displaying a listing of components in a path between the first position and the second position. With additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref>, a specific and non-limiting example illustrates a listing of components, including pull boxes, of the railway infrastructure is provided in modular window after the user has selected the first and second position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>. The listing of components may include pull boxes, troughs, ducts, etc. In some embodiments, displaying the at least one cable route includes overlaying the at least one cable route on the cable routing plan on the map interface of the GUI.

With additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref>, an example GUI illustrate the mapping interface having displayed thereon the determined cable route. The cable routing parameters may also be displayed on the GUI at step <b>212</b>. The cable routing parameters may be displayed when a request is made via the GUI to display the cable routing parameters for a given cable route. Alternatively, the cable routing parameters may be automatically displayed. With additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>G and <b>3</b>H</figref>, example GUIs illustrate the mapping interface having displayed thereon cable routing parameters pertaining to the ducts/troughs in the determined cable route and cable routing parameters pertaining to the pull boxes in the determined cable route, respectively.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, a plurality of possible cable routes are displayed on the GUI. A given one of the plurality of possible cable routes may be selected by the user and the cable routing parameters associated with the selected route may be displayed on the GUI. In other words, the selected cable route may be highlighted in the GUI to visualize its path and show information on the selected cable route. By way of example, the cable routing parameters shown on the GUI may include the type of containment, a route length, length of cable route segments in a global cable route network, the type of cable, the size, gauge or capacity of the cable, and the number of connections for the first and second position, current and maximum capacity of the conduit for cable route, along with available space in such conduit. The user may be able to select one of a plurality of routes between the first position and the second position to view the cable routing parameters in order to decide which cable route to use. The user may then select one of the possible cable routes as the cable route to use for routing the cable in the physical railway infrastructure. The method <b>200</b> may be repeated a number of times to determine cables routes between various positions of the railway infrastructure.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, the plurality of possible cable routes are determined, at least in part, based on one or validation processes. In one example, a design validation can be performed on one or more possible cable routes, and those of the possible cable routes which do not pass the design validation may be highlighted or otherwise indicated as such via the GUI, or alternatively may not be displayed via the GUI. The design validation may include verifying whether the possible cable routes exhibit any discontinuities, whether the possible cable routes clash with existing infrastructure, such as existing cables, or the like, whether the cables could be exposed to interference from equipment or other cables. For instance, if cables are associated to telecommunications, some spacing may be required between the cable and the existing infrastructure elements, or between the cables and other proposed cables and/or infrastructure elements planned to be built. In another instance, the placement of high voltage cabling may be subject to various requirements, such as keeping appropriate distance from infrastructure elements (whether existing or planned) where passengers or other people may be located. The design validation may use drawings or other representations of the possible cable routes (e.g. CAD drawings) to compare with existing known infrastructure elements. When a possible cable route is identified as clashing or otherwise not being compatible with existing infrastructure elements, the possible cable route may not be validated and is indicated as such via the GUI.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">By way of another example, a regulatory validation can be performed on one or more possible cable routes. The regulatory validation may include evaluating, based on drawings or other representations of the possible cable routes (e.g. CAD drawings), whether the possible cable routes comply with established regulations (e.g., code) in effect in a particular jurisdiction. For instance, the possible cable routes may be evaluated against established regulations regarding clearance for locating cables overhead of a railway. In another instance, the possible cable routes may be evaluated against established regulations regarding capacity limits for cable containment.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the GUI may be used to present various information about whether or not different possible cable routes pass the above-mentioned validations. For example, after a user selects a particular possible cable route using the GUI, the selected cable route can be subjected to the design validation and/or the regulatory validation. The GUI may then be used to present results of the validation processes to the user. In the event that the selected route does not meet the design and/or regulatory requirements used as part of the validation processes, the user may be notified, and prompted to select a different possible cable route.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, the method <b>200</b> includes receiving a selection of one or more options for the cable route. For example, the user may select via the GUI one or more of: a cable type of the cable of the cable route, a cable size, gauge or capacity of the cable of the cable route, a type of containment for the cable route, one or more conduits or troughs to use for the cable route. The method <b>200</b> may validate the selection of the one or more options to confirm that there is no conflict with the determined cable route and the associated cable routing parameters. In some embodiments, the method <b>200</b> includes receiving a search request of one or more options to select for the one or more options for the cable route. In embodiments in which one or more validation processes are performed, the selected options for possible cable routes may also be evaluated for compliance with existing regulations and/or for clashes with existing infrastructure. In the event that a particular selected parameter results in a possible cable route not passing a particular validation process, the GUI may present an indication of which selected option(s) resulted in the failure of the validation process, and may also recommend one or more alternative options which would rectify the failure.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, the method <b>200</b> includes determining a type of cable protection required for the determined cable route. The type of cable protection to use may be determined based on a distance of the cable route from the railway and/or an installation depth of the cable route. Moreover, the information displayed may include depth of installation, depth of existing infrastructure, including ducts/troughs, etc.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, the method <b>200</b> includes receiving a request for information on an element displayed on the GUI and displaying on the GUI the information associated with the element. For example, the element may be the cable of the cable route, the first or second position, the conduit or troughs, etc. The information displayed may be one or more of the cable routing parameters, an image of where the element is installed and/or to be installed, and/or a CAD file or other file (e.g., a PDF file) associated with the element.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the method <b>200</b> further includes performing a fill calculation to determine the current fill percentage of a given conduit or trough relative to the maximum capacity of the given conduit or trough.
