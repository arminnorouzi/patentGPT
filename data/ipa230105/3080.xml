The optical property is typically one or more of tint, transmittance, absorbance, and reflectance. For example, one well known electrochromic material is tungsten oxide (WO<sub>3</sub>). Tungsten oxide is a cathodically tinting electrochromic material in which a tinting transition, bleached (untinted) to blue, occurs by electrochemical reduction. When electrochemical oxidation takes place, tungsten oxide transitions from blue to a bleached state.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electrochromic materials may be incorporated into, for example, windows for home, commercial and other uses. The tint, transmittance, absorbance, and/or reflectance of such windows may be changed by inducing a change in the electrochromic material, that is, electrochromic windows are windows that can be darkened and lightened reversibly via application of an electric charge. A small voltage applied to an electrochromic device of the window will cause it to darken; reversing the voltage causes it to lighten. This capability allows control of the amount of light that passes through the windows, and presents an opportunity for electrochromic windows to be used as energy-saving devices.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While electrochromism was discovered in the 1960s, electrochromic devices, and particularly electrochromic windows, still unfortunately suffer various problems and have not begun to realize their full commercial potential despite much recent advancement in electrochromic technology, apparatus, and related methods of making and/or using electrochromic devices.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thin-film devices, for example, electrochromic devices for windows, and methods of manufacturing are described. Embodiments include electrochromic window lites having two or more tinting (or coloration) zones, where there is only a single monolithic electrochromic device on the lite. Certain embodiments include constructs, e.g. laminates, IGUs and the like, that have two EC lites, panes, where one of the panes has EC zones, and the other pane may have a monolithic EC device coating or also be a zoned EC coating. Tinting zones are defined by virtue of the means for applying potential to the device and/or by a resistive zone between adjacent tinting zones. For example, sets of bus bars are configured to apply potential across separate zones (areas) of the device and thereby tint them selectively. The advantages include no visible scribe lines in the viewable area of the EC window due to, e.g., cutting through the EC device to make separate devices that serve as tinting zones. Embodiments that include two EC panes may include a multi-zone EC pane where the zones are formed by cutting through the EC device coating, i.e. the other EC pane is used to mask or otherwise conceal or ameliorate the visual distraction caused by the through cuts on the other pane.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One embodiment is an electrochromic window lite including a monolithic EC device on a transparent substrate, the monolithic EC device including two or more tinting zones, each of said two or more tinting zones configured for operation independent of the others and each having a pair of associated bus bars, where the two or more tinting zones are not separated from each other by isolation scribes. That is, the EC device stack is not cut through, but rather is intact as a monolithic device. For example, there may be two tinting zones on the lite and the associated bus bars arranged are located at opposing edges of the lite (e.g., vertically oriented), wherein a set of bus bars is associated with each of the two tinting zones.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Bus bars may be configured to enhance coloring of tinting zones. In certain embodiments, bus bars have varying width along their length; the varying width of the bus bars may enhance the tinting front and/or promote selective tinting in a particular tinting zone via voltage gradients. In other embodiments, bus bars may be composites, having both high electrically conductive regions and resistive regions, configured to enhance tinting fronts and/or promote selective tinting in a particular tinting zone via voltage gradients. One embodiment is directed to an electrochromic window lite comprising a monolithic EC device on a transparent substrate and at least one pair of lengthwise variable bus bars configured to produce a tint gradient zone on the monolithic EC device when energized.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In certain embodiments, the two or more tinting zones are separated by a resistive zone which inhibits, at least partially, the flow of electrons, ions or both across the resistive zone. Resistive zones may, e.g., be parallel to bus bars and/or orthogonal to bus bars. Resistive zones may include modification of the EC device and/or one or both transparent conductor layers (TCOs) of the EC device. Monolithic EC lites having two or more tinting zones may be integrated into insulating glass units (IGUs) and/or laminates (singly or as part of an IGU). The mate lite may or may not also be an electrochromic lite, and may or may not also have tinting zones.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">One embodiment is directed to an electrochromic window lite comprising a monolithic EC device disposed on a transparent substrate and a resistive zone. The monolithic EC device is comprised of first and second transparent conductor layers and an EC stack between the first and second transparent conductor layers. The resistive zone in one of the first and second transparent conducting layers. The resistive zone has a higher electrical resistance than a portion of the one of the first and second transparent conducting layers outside the resistive zone. In one case, the resistive zone is a linear region in the one of the first and second transparent conducting layer with thinner or absent material.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Certain aspects of the disclosure pertain to an electrochromic window lite that may be characterized by the following features: a monolithic EC device on a transparent substrate, the monolithic EC device comprising: two or more tinting zones, each of the two or more tinting zones configured for operation independent of the others and having an associated pair of bus bars. In certain embodiments, the two or more tinting zones contain only a partial cut through the uppermost TCO of the monolithic EC device to form a resistive zone between each of said two or more tinting zones. An associated pair of bus bars means that each zone may have a pair of bus bars that are exclusive to that zone and not shared with any other zone, or two or more zones may share a common bus bar, but in either case no two zones share the same pair of bus bars.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In certain embodiments, the associated bus bars located at opposing edges for each of the two tinting zones. In certain embodiments, the electrochromic window lite is incorporated into an insulated glass unit, which may have a mate lite that is (i) not an electrochromic lite or (ii) a monolithic electrochromic lite with a single tinting zone, or (iii) a monolithic electrochromic lite with two or more tinting zones (where the tinting zones of the mate lite may be aligned with those of the electrochromic window lite), or (iv) an electrochromic lite with three or more tinting zones. In such embodiments, the electrochromic window lite may be configured to tint in one or more tinting zones to &#x3c;1% T.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some implementations, the resistive zone substantially spans across the monolithic EC device. In some implementations, the resistive zone is between about 1 nm wide and about 10 nm wide. In certain embodiments, the resistive zone is formed by removing between about 10% and about 90% of the uppermost TCO material along the resistive zone. As an example, the resistive zone may be formed by laser irradiation of the uppermost TCO. As a further example, each of the two or more tinting zones associated bus bars are formed by laser irradiation during formation of the resistive zone by cutting through a single bus bar.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Other aspects of the disclosure pertain to methods of forming a monolithic EC device comprising two tinting zones, where the methods may be characterized by the following operations: (a) forming the monolithic EC device; (b) applying a single bus bar to the top TCO of the monolithic EC device; (c) cutting through the single bus bar along its width; and, (d) cutting at least part way through the top TCO, but not through the electrode layer adjacent to the top TCO, to form a resistive zone between the two tinting zones. In certain embodiments, operation (c) forms separate bus bars for each of the two tinting zones from the single bus bar. In some implementations, operations (c) and (d) are performed in a single cutting step.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some implementations, the resistive zone substantially spans the width of the monolithic EC device. In certain embodiments, the resistive zone is between about 1 nm wide and about 10 nm wide. In certain embodiments, the resistive zone is formed by removing between about 10% and about 90% of the uppermost TCO material along the resistive zone. As an example, the resistive zone may be formed by laser irradiation of the uppermost TCO.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Zoning in EC windows may be used in certain applications, e.g., a window is made darker at the top to control glare, while the bottom portion is lighter so user view is maintained and more light still enters the room than would otherwise with a monolithic EC coating fully tinted to reduce glare.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another aspect of the disclosure concerns electrochromic window lites (panes) characterized by the following features: an EC device on a transparent substrate, the EC device comprising bus bars; a region of the transparent substrate that is not covered by the EC device, where the region capable of providing, when not mitigated, a bright spot or bright region when the EC device is tinted; and an obscuring material over the region, wherein the material has a lower transmittance than the substrate. In some embodiments, the region is a pinhole, a scribe line, or an edge line.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Yet another aspect of the disclosure concerns methods of obscuring a potentially bright area produced by a region of a transparent substrate that is not covered by an EC device. Such methods may be characterized by the following operations: (a) providing an electrochromic lite having the EC device coating on a substrate; (b) identifying a site of the potentially bright area on the substrate; and (c) applying an obscuring material to the site. The obscuring material has a lower transmittance than the substrate. In certain embodiments, the region is a pinhole, a scribe line, or an edge line.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">These and other features and advantages will be described in further detail below, with reference to the associated drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The following detailed description can be more fully understood when considered in conjunction with the drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts fabrication of an IGU with an EC lite and associated tinting schemes.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> depict an IGU having an EC lite with two tinting zones delineated by laser scribe, and associated tinting schemes, respectively.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> depict fabrication of an IGU with an EC lite having tinting zones configured on a monolithic EC device and associated tinting schemes, respectively.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> depicts various tinting schemes as a function of tinting front of tinting zones.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>D and <b>3</b>E</figref> depict fabrication of an IGU having two EC lites, where each of the EC lites has two tinting zones, and associated tinting schemes, respectively.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-C</figref> depict fabrication of an IGU with an EC lite and associated tinting schemes, respectively.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>D-H</figref> depict EC lites, each having a gradient tinting zone.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> depict fabrication of an IGU with an EC lite and associated tinting schemes, respectively.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> depicts a perspective and a cross section of an EC device having two tinting zones separated by a resistive zone.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref> depicts a perspective and a cross section of an EC device having two tinting zones by virtue of a resistive zone.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref> shows graphs of V<sub>TCL </sub>for two transparent conducting oxide layers of an EC device configured with a resistive zone created by inhibiting the electrical conductivity of only one of the transparent conducting oxide layers.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref> depicts a tinting pattern of the EC lite described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>G to <b>5</b>K</figref> depict EC devices configured with a resistive zone created by inhibiting the electrical conductivity of only one of the transparent conducting oxides.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> depicts a resistive zone establishing a closed perimeter defining a separate tinting zone.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> depicts a resistive zone establishing an open perimeter defining a separate tinting zone.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts using resistive zones for multi EC lite patterns/displays.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts a building facade using resistive zones to create words and/or ornamental designs.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts a building facade using gradient zoning across multiple IGUs.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Certain embodiments are directed to optical devices, that is, thin-film devices having at least one transparent conductor layer. In the simplest form, an optical device includes a substrate and one or more material layers sandwiched between two conductor layers, one of which is transparent. In one embodiment, an optical device includes a transparent substrate and two transparent conductor layers. Certain embodiments described herein, although not limited as such, work particularly well with solid state and inorganic electrochromic devices.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts fabrication of an IGU, <b>120</b>, with an EC lite, <b>100</b>, which includes a monolithic EC device and associated pair of bus bars, <b>105</b>, which energize the device each via a transparent conductor, the pair of transparent conductors sandwich the EC materials between them so that a potential can be applied across the device materials. The IGU is fabricated by combining EC lite <b>100</b> with a spacer, <b>110</b>, and a mate lite, <b>115</b>, along with the appropriate sealants and wiring (not shown) to the bus bars. In some applications, a second set of spacer and mate lite may be added (i.e. Triple Pane IGU). The two mate lites may be of different types. As depicted on the bottom half of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the IGU can be transparent (left), tinted to an intermediate state (middle) or fully tinted (right). However, there is no possibility of tinting the viewable area of the lite in different areas or &#x201c;zones.&#x201d; Conventional technology does exist to achieve this end, however.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> depicts an IGU, <b>220</b>, having an EC lite, <b>200</b>, with two tinting zones delineated by laser scribe, <b>225</b>. Each tinting zone has an associated pair of bus bars, <b>205</b> and <b>207</b>, respectively. The EC lite <b>200</b> may be incorporated into an IGU, <b>220</b>, as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Scribe line <b>225</b> cuts through both of the transparent conductor layers which sandwich the electrochromic materials, along with the EC device layer(s), so that there effectively two EC devices, one corresponding to each tinting zone, on the EC lite <b>200</b>. Scribe line <b>225</b> may not be visually discernible when the EC lite is not tinted, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, i.e. in the untinted state (bleached or neutral state).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> depicts three possible tinting schemes of IGU <b>220</b>. As shown, IGU <b>220</b> may have the top zone tinted and the bottom zone untinted (left), the top zone untinted and the bottom zone tinted (middle) or both the top and bottom zones tinted (right). Although such windows offer flexibility in tinting, when both zones are tinted, scribe line <b>225</b> is visually discernible and is unattractive to an end user because there is a bright line across the middle of the viewable area of the window. This is because the EC material in the area has been destroyed and/or deactivated from the scribe line that cut through the device. The bright line can be quite distracting; either when one is looking at the window itself, or as in most cases, when the end user is trying to view things through the window. The bright line against a tinted background catches one's eye immediately. Many approaches have been taken to create tinting zones in optical devices, but they all involve some sort of physical segmentation of a monolithic optical device into two or more individually operable devices. That is, the functionality of the EC device is destroyed along the scribe line, thus effectively creating two devices from a monolithic single device. Certain embodiments described herein avoid destroying the EC device function between adjacent tinting zones.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">One approach to overcoming the visually distracting bright line created by a laser scribe in the viewable area of an EC lite is to apply a tinted material to the lite, e.g. on the scribe line or on an opposing side of the lite, in order to obscure or minimize the light passing through the scribe area. Thus, when tinting zones adjoining the scribe are tinted, the scribe line will be less discernible to the end user. When neither of the adjoining tinting zones is tinted, the tinted material in the scribe line area will be almost or completely indiscernible because it is a thin tinted line against a large untinted background, which is harder to see than a bright line against a tinted background. The thin tinted line need not be opaque, a limited amount of absorption of the visible spectrum can be used, e.g., absorption that will tone down the bright line created when the full spectrum emanates through scribe line <b>225</b>. Methods for obscuring pinhole defects in optical devices are described in, for example, described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/610,241, filed Mar. 13, 2012, and described in PCT Application Serial No. PCT/US2013/031098 filed on Mar. 13, 2013, which are both hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Whether obscuring pin holes, scribe lines, edge lines, or the like, the methods obscure bright areas on EC devices, e.g. by applying tinted material to such areas to make them harder to see to the end user. Edge lines exist where a coating such as a monolithic electrochromic coating, does not extend to the spacer of an IGU (e.g., element <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). In this region, a bright line or wider area is visible when viewing the IGU directly. As understood by those of skill in the art, the obscuring methods described in the present application and in PCT/US2013/031098 have equal applicability to pin holes, edge lines, scribe lines, and the like. The methods described in the aforementioned patent application are particularly useful for obscuring scribe or edge lines in the visible area of an optical device such as an EC device. One embodiment is a method of obscuring a scribe line in the viewable area of an EC window, the method including applying a method used to obscure pinholes as described in the aforementioned US/PCT Patent application. For example, one method includes applying a tinted material to the scribe line and optionally the area adjacent the scribe line. In another example, the glass at the bottom of the scribe line trench (and optionally some adjoining area) is altered so as to diffuse light that passes therethrough, thus ameliorating the &#x201c;bright line&#x201d; effect.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Tinting Zones</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As discussed above, certain embodiments described herein avoid destroying the EC device functionality between adjacent tinting zones. Though scribe lines may be visually obscured by application of tinted materials to the lite as described above, the inventors have found that it may be often preferable to maintain the functional integrity of a monolithic EC device, rather than scribe it into discrete devices and thus conventional tinting zones. The inventors have discovered that tinting zones may be created by: 1) configuring the powering mechanism (e.g. bus bars, wiring thereto and associated powering algorithms) of the optical device appropriately, 2) configuring the EC device such that adjacent tinting zones are separated by a resistive zone, or 3) combination of 1) and 2). For example, number 1) may be achieved by appropriately configuring one or more bus bars such that they can be activated independently of other bus bars on the same monolithic EC device. Thus tinting zones are created without the need to physically separate individual EC devices to create corresponding tinting zones. In another example, a resistive zone allows coloration and bleaching of adjacent tinting zones on a single EC device without destroying functionality in the resistive zone itself. A resistive zone can refer to an area of the monolithic optical device, e.g. an EC device, where the function is impaired but not destroyed. Typically, the functionality in the resistive zone is merely slowed relative to the rest of the device. Impairment might include diminished capacity for ion movement in one or more of the layers of the EC device and/or reduced density of the ions. The change in EC stack properties and/or ion density maybe done during deposition /fabrication of the EC stack or post-deposition through a thermal/laser irradiation treatment. For example, one or more EC device layers may be made denser than it otherwise would be in the bulk functioning device and therefore be able to hold fewer ions and/or allow ion passage through the denser material, and therefore color less intensely than the bulk device, but still function. A resistive zone is achieved in at least one of the following ways: i) the electrical resistivity of one or both of the transparent conductor layers is impaired, ii) one or both of the transparent conductor layers is cut, without cutting through the optical device stack therebetween, iii) the function of the optical device stack (not including the transparent conductor layers) is impaired, and iv) combinations of i)-iv). For example, a resistive zone may be created where one or both of the transparent conductor layers is fabricated thinner or absent, e.g. along a linear region, so as to increase electrical resistivity along the linear region of the resistive zone. In another example, one of the transparent conductor layers may be cut along the width of the device, while the other transparent conductor is left intact, either of uniform thickness or thinner, along the resistive zone. In yet another example, the function of the EC device may be inhibited along a line, so that it resists ion transport, while the transparent conductor layers may or may not be altered along the same line. Resistive zones are described in more detail below in terms of specific, but non-limiting examples. If the resistive zone is in one of the transparent layers, the other transparent layer may be left intact (e.g., uniform composition and thickness).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Configuring Powering Mechanism of EC Devices</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">One embodiment is an electrochromic window lite including a monolithic EC device on a transparent substrate, the monolithic EC device including two or more tinting zones, each of the two or more tinting zones configured for operation independent of the others and having an associated pair of bus bars. In certain embodiments, the two or more tinting zones are not separated from each other by isolation scribes; that is, the EC device and associated transparent conductors do not have isolation scribes that cut through any of these layers. For example, there may be two tinting zones on the EC lite and two pairs of bus bars, wherein each pair is associated with a tinting zone and both pairs are located at or near opposing edges of the EC lite e.g., the bus bars may be vertically oriented at or near opposing vertical edges with a set of bus bars for each of the two tinting zones. Such lites may be integrated into insulating glass units (IGUs).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> depicts fabrication of an IGU, <b>300</b>, with an EC lite, <b>305</b> having two tinting zones (upper and lower tinting zones) configured on a monolithic EC device. In this example, there are no laser scribes or other physical sectioning (e.g. bifurcation) of the monolithic EC device or transparent conductor layers on the lite. Each of bus bar pairs, <b>205</b> and <b>207</b>, is configured to energize independently of each other. Thus, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, IGU <b>300</b> has three tinting schemes besides the untinted state (bleached or neutral state) depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows these three tinting schemes where the top zone may be tinted while the bottom zone is not (left), the bottom zone may be tinted while the top zone is not (middle), or both zones may be tinted (right). In contrast to an EC lite having two distinct EC devices by virtue of being divided by a scribe line, each tinting zone of lite <b>305</b>, when tinted, has a &#x201c;tinting front&#x201d; <b>310</b>. A tinting front can refer to an area of the EC device where the potential applied across the devices TCOs by the bus bars reaches a level that is insufficient to tint the device (e.g. by movement of ions through the layers of the device to balance charge). Thus, in the example depicted, the tinting front <b>310</b> corresponds roughly to where the charge is bleeding off into the area of the transparent conductor that is between the pair of bus bars that are not energized.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The shape of a tinting front may depend upon the charging characteristics of the transparent conductors, the configuration of the bus bars, wiring and powering thereto, and the like. The tinting front may be linear, curved (convex, concave, etc.), zigzag, irregular, etc. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> depicts the tinting front <b>310</b> as a linear phenomenon; that is, the tinting front <b>310</b> is depicted as located along a straight line. As another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> depicts various tinting schemes as a function of tinting front of each of the tinting zones, in this case lower and upper tinting zones. In the illustrated example, the tinting front is curved (e.g., concave or convex) along the tinting front. In certain embodiments, it may be desirable that when both tinting zones are tinted, the tinting of the EC lite is total and uniform. Thus a convex tinting front may be desirable, so a complimentary concave tinting front may be used in an adjacent zone, or another convex tinting front may be used to ensure sufficient charge reaches the entire device for uniform tinting. In certain cases, the tinting front may not be a clean line as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C</figref>, but rather have a diffuse appearance along the tinting front due to the charge bleeding off into the adjacent tinting zone which is not powered at the time.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the case where two adjacent zones are tinted, but one zone's tinting level is different than the other, e.g., where one zone is tinted to 5% T and the other adjacent zone tinted to 20% T, there may be no noticeable tinting front. That is, the two zones' tinting may blends into each other for a uniform gradient tinting appearance, e.g. resembling a shading effect, where the coloration is darkest in one zone and appears to gradually lighten into and including the adjacent zone. In the event that individual tinting zones on a monolithic EC device have aesthetically unappealing coloration fronts, one may apply tinting voltages to all zones, but where the tinting voltages to individual zones are the same or different. One embodiment is a method of controlling a monolithic EC device coating, including tinting two adjacent zones simultaneously by virtue of selective application of voltage to different areas of the monolithic EC device.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In certain embodiments, when the EC lite with tinting zones is incorporated into an IGU or a laminate for example, the mate lite may also be an EC lite, having tinting zones or not. Insulated glass unit constructions having two or more (monolithic) EC lites are described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,270,059, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Having two EC lites in a single IGU has advantages including the ability to make a near opaque window (e.g. privacy glass), where the percent transmission (% T) of the IGU is &#x3c;1%. Also, if the EC lites are two-state (tinted or bleached) there may be certain tinting combinations made possible, e.g. a four-tint-state window. If the EC lites are capable of intermediate states, the tinting possibilities may be virtually endless. One embodiment is an IGU having a first EC lite having two or more tinting zones and a mate lite that is a monolithic EC lite. In another embodiment, the mate lite also has two or more tinting zones. In this latter embodiment, the tinting zones may or may not be the same in number or aligned with the tinting zones of the first EC lite with which it is registered in the IGU. Exemplary constructs illustrating these descriptions follow.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> depicts fabrication of an IGU, <b>325</b>, having two EC lites, <b>305</b> and <b>320</b>, where each of the EC lites has two tinting zones, each of the tinting zones created by appropriately configured bus bar pairs, <b>205</b> and <b>207</b> at or near two opposing edges. In this illustrated example, the tinting zones of EC lites <b>305</b> and <b>320</b> are registered, that is, they are aligned with each other and of the same area, but this need not be the configuration. For example, the tinting fronts from opposing EC lites <b>305</b> and <b>320</b> could overlap each other when tinted in another embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> depicts IGU <b>325</b> in an untinted state (bleached or neutral state). Also, each of the tinting zones is capable of only two states, tinted or bleached. Even so, this enables a wide range of tinting schemes for IGU <b>325</b>. Besides the untinted state, IGU <b>325</b> is capable of many tint states (e.g., eight tint states). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> depicts three of the possible tint states (i.e. where one EC lite of IGU <b>325</b> is tinted in one of the three configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> depicts another five possible tint states for IGU <b>325</b>. If the top tinting zones of both EC lites are tinted simultaneously, and the bottom two zones are not, then the top half of the IGU is very dark, while the bottom is untinted (top left IGU). If both of the top tinting zones are not tinted, and the bottom two zones are tinted, then the bottom half of the IGU is very dark, while the top is untinted (top middle IGU). If all four zones of the EC lites are tinted, then the entire window is very dark (top right IGU). For example, the combined tinting of all tinting zones in two registered EC lites can achieve &#x3c;1% T. If one of the top zones in the EC lites is tinted and both of the bottom zones are tinted, then the tint state on the bottom left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> is created. Likewise, if one of the bottom zones is tinted and both of the top zones are tinted, then the tint state on the bottom right of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> is created.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">One embodiment is an IGU having two or more EC lites, wherein at least two of the two or more EC lites includes multiple tinting zones as described herein. The tinting zones may be formed physically in the coating, i.e. by bifurcation of a monolithic coating, forming a resistive zone in a monolithic EC coating, or both; or a monolithic coating with no resistive zones may be controlled by selective application of voltages to different areas to form tinting zones. One embodiment is an IGU or laminate having two or more EC lites, where a first of the two or more EC lites includes multiple tinting zones created by conventional isolation scribes, and a second of the two or more EC lites includes tinting zones as described herein by techniques other than isolation scribes.

Day lighting transoms are very common. For example, creating &#x201c;virtual transoms&#x201d; with a piece of glass and thus removing the frame and associated glazier labor has a cost benefit as well as better sight lines. Also, having a variety of tint states such as those depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>E</figref> allows for customization of room lighting based on the amount and location of the sun striking individual windows.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Certain embodiments pertain to methods of transitioning an EC lite having two or more tinting zones. In one embodiment, an EC lite having three or more tinting zones is transitioned across the three or more tinted zones from a first zone at one edge of the device, to a second adjacent tinting zone, and then to a third tinting zone, adjacent to the second zone. In other words, the tinting zones are used to give the effect of drawing a physical shade across the window, without actually having a physical shade, since EC windows may eliminate the need for physical shades. Such methods may be implemented with conventional zoned EC lites or those described herein. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-C</figref> with respect to an EC lite of an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, an EC lite, <b>400</b>, is configured with a first set of bus bars, <b>405</b>, a second set of bus bars <b>407</b>, and a third set of bus bars, <b>409</b>. The three sets of bus bars are configured so as to create three tinting zones, respectively. Although EC lite <b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is incorporated into an IGU, <b>420</b>, using a spacer <b>410</b> and a mate lite <b>415</b>, lamination to a mate lite (EC lite or otherwise) or use as a single EC lite is also possible.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, assuming that each of the tinting zones is tinted as a two-state zone, then the three tinting zones may be activated sequentially, e.g. from top to bottom as depicted, to create a physical shade effect, i.e. as if one were lowering a roller shade or drawing a Roman shade over the window. For example, the top zone may be fully tinted, then the second zone may be fully tinted, finally the third zone may be fully tinted. The tinting zones could be sequentially tinted from the bottom up or in the middle and then the upper and lower zones tinted, depending upon the desired effect.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Another method is to tint the tinting zones as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, except that before transition in a particular tinting zone is complete, transition in an adjacent tinting zone begins, which can also create a shading effect. In the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, the top tinting zone's tinting is initiated (top left), but before tinting is complete in the top zone, the middle zone's tinting is initiated. Once the top zone's tinting is complete, the middle zone's tinting is not yet complete (top center). At some point during the transition of the middle zone, the bottom zone's tinting is initiated. Once the middle zone's tinting is complete, the bottom zone's tinting is not yet complete (top right), thus the top and middle zones are fully tinted and the bottom zone's tinting is yet to be completed. Finally, the bottom zone is fully tinted. Using tinting zones with intermediate state capability, rather than two-state &#x201c;tint or not,&#x201d; will increase the possible variations of tinting schemes.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Lengthwise Variable Bus Bars</heading><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In certain embodiments, an EC lite may be configured to have one or more tint gradient zones. In these embodiments, the EC lite has an EC device, such as, e.g., a monolithic EC device on a transparent substrate, and also has at least one pair of bus bars with geometry and/or material composition that varies along their lengths to vary electrical resistance lengthwise (lengthwise variable bus bars). This variation in resistance can produce a lengthwise gradient in the voltage applied to the EC device supplied across bus bars (V<sub>app</sub>) and a lengthwise gradient in the local effective voltage (V<sub>eff</sub>) in the EC device. The term V<sub>eff </sub>refers to the potential between the positive and negative transparent conducting layers at any particular location on the EC device. The lengthwise gradient of the V<sub>eff </sub>may generate a corresponding tint gradient zone that varies lengthwise in a region between the pair of bus bars when energized. In these embodiments, the lengthwise variable bus bars will have resistance profiles along their lengths that are functions of both the local bus bar geometry and resistivity. In certain embodiments, the bus bars are designed so that the resistance is lowest at one end of the bus bar and highest at the other end of the bus bar. Other designs are possible, such as designs where the resistance is lowest in the middle of a bus bar and highest at the ends of the bus bar. A description of voltage profiles in various EC devices powered by bus bars can be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/682,618, titled &#x201c;DRIVING THIN FILM SWITCHABLE OPTICAL DEVICES,&#x201d; filed on Nov. 20, 2013, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">EC devices configured, e.g., as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>D and <b>4</b>E</figref>, in addition to being capable of tinting in a gradient fashion as depicted, may also, e.g. upon application of sufficient voltage, tint to a uniform coloration. For example, a maximum (and uniform) tinting may be achieved across the monolithic device coating by application of sufficient voltage using bus bars also configured to apply a gradient voltage (and give the gradient tinting shown).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The local material composition of a bus bar may determine its local resistivity. It is contemplated that the bus bar material composition, and therefore the bus bar resistivity may vary along the length of the bus bar in certain embodiments. The resistivity can be tailored based on various compositional adjustments known to those of skill in the art. For example, resistivity can be adjusted by adjusting the concentration of a conductive material in the bus bar composition. In some embodiments, bus bars are made from a conductive ink such as a silver ink. By varying the concentration of silver in the ink along the length of the bus bar, one can produce a bus bar in which the resistivity likewise varies along the length. The resistivity can also be varied by other compositional adjustments such as the local inclusion of resistive materials in the bus bar or the variation of the composition of a conductive component to adjust its resistivity. Slight variations in composition can change the resistivity of certain conductive materials such as conductive polymers. In certain embodiments, the electrical conductivity of the bus bar material is constant, but the thickness and/or width of the bus bar varies along its length.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The value of the voltage that can be applied at any position on the bus bar is a function of the location where the bus bar connects to an external power source and the resistance profile of the bus bar. A bus bar may be connected to the source of electrical power at locations where the bus bar has least resistance, although this is not required. The value of the voltage will be greatest at the locations where the power source connection attaches to the bus bars. The decrease in voltage away from the connection is determined by the distance from the connection and the resistance profile of the bus bars along the path from the connection to the point where voltage is measured. Typically, the value of voltage in a bus bar will be greatest at the location where an electrical connection to the power source attaches and least at the distal point of the bus bar. In various embodiments, a bus bar will have lower electrical resistance at an end proximal to the connection to the electrical source and a higher resistance at a distal end (i.e. the resistance is higher at the distal end than at the proximal end).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Each of the lengthwise variable bus bars may have linearly, stepped, or otherwise varying geometry and/or material composition along its length. For example, a bus bar with lengthwise-varying geometry may have its width, height, and/or other cross-sectional dimension linearly tapering from the proximal end to the distal end. As another example, a bus bar may be comprised of multiple segments with stepwise decreasing widths or other dimensions from the proximal end to the distal end. In yet another example, a bus bar may have a material composition that varies lengthwise to increase electrical resistivity between proximal and distal ends.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>D and <b>4</b>E</figref> depict EC lites, <b>425</b> and <b>435</b> respectively, each having a monolithic EC device on a transparent substrate and a pair of bus bars. The width of each of the bus bars varies along its length. This geometric lengthwise variation in the bus bars may produce a tint gradient zone (gradient in lengthwise direction) on the monolithic EC device when energized.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> depicts an EC lite, <b>425</b>, including bus bars <b>430</b>. Each of the bus bars <b>430</b> has a varying width along its length that linearly tapers lengthwise. In certain embodiments, the variation in width between the two ends may be between about 10% and about 100% from the average width over the length of the bus bar. In one embodiment, the variation in width may be between about 10% and about 80% from the average width over the length of the bus bar. In another embodiment, the variation in width may be between about 25% and about 75% from the average width over the length of the bus bar. In this example, not drawn to scale, the bus bars <b>430</b> are widest at the top of EC lite <b>425</b> and linearly taper lengthwise to their thinnest width near the bottom of lite <b>425</b>. Because of the varying width, bus bars <b>430</b>, when energized, establish a voltage gradient. For example, when energized, bus bars <b>430</b> have their highest effective voltage at the top, and their lowest voltage at their bottom portion; a voltage gradient is established along the bus bars. As depicted in the right portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>, a corresponding tinting gradient is established by virtue of the voltage gradient. Thus a tint gradient zone is established. Bus bars of varying width can be used in one or more zones of an EC lite having two or more zones as described herein. In this illustrated example, a single tint gradient zone is established across an EC lite. Although a linearly tapered width is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>, a non-linearly tapered width can be used in other cases.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In certain embodiments, the tapering of the bus bars need not be a smooth taper. For example, a bus bar may have a stepped down width along its length (i.e. stepwise width variation along its length). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref> depicts an EC lite, <b>435</b>, having a monolithic EC device and bus bars that have stepped widths along their lengths. Each bus bar has three segments with stepped down widths along its length. Each bus bar has a first width that spans a first portion, <b>440</b>, of the length of the bus bar. Adjacent to the first portion, is a second portion, <b>445</b>, of the length of each bus bar. The second portion has a second width shorter than the first width. Finally, adjacent to the second portion and having a third width, is a third portion, <b>450</b> of each bus bar. The net tinting gradient effect may be the same as or similar to the smooth linearly taper bus bars described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>. One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that varying the width of the bus bars can be done in other patterns, such as thicker in the middle than at the ends, etc. without escaping the scope of embodiments described herein, that is for an EC lite having bus bars of varying widths configured to create one or more tint gradient zones, and corresponding tinting effects, on a monolithic EC device.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Electrically Resistive Bus bars</heading><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In certain embodiments, a bus bar with uniform cross-section and electrical conductivity characteristics is used to create the required electrical gradient from one end of the bus bar to the other end. This is achieved by taking advantage of voltage drop along a bus bar. That is, a bus bar of sufficient resistivity, e.g. a sufficiently thin bus bar of highly conductive material or a bus bar made of more resistive, though still conductive material, such that there is a voltage drop along the bus bar's length when voltage is applied to one end. It can be shown that:</p><p id="p-0067" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x394;<i>V</i><sub>L</sub>=(<i>R</i><sub>B</sub><i>*J*W</i><sub>0</sub><i>*L</i>)<sup>2</sup>/2 where:<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">&#x394;V<sub>L </sub>is voltage drop along Bus bar at a distance L from point of application of power</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">R<sub>B </sub>is the resistance per unit length of the Bus bar</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">J is the leakage current density of the EC window</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">W<sub>0 </sub>is the width of the EC window</p><p id="p-0072" num="0000">Thus, for a window where the bus bar is powered at one end only, if:</p><p id="p-0073" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>RB</i>&#x3e;(&#x394;<i>V/L</i><sub>0</sub>)*(2<i>/I</i><sub>EC</sub>) where:<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0074" num="0070">&#x394;V is the required voltage drop along the bus bar</p><p id="p-0075" num="0071">I<sub>EC </sub>is the net current draw for the EC device</p><p id="p-0076" num="0072">L<sub>0 </sub>is the length of the EC window</p><p id="p-0077" num="0073">Then the electrically resistive bus bar will act as a resistance path in the circuit and be able to provide adequate drop in voltage along its length. Since the Transmission of the EC window is proportional to the V_eff, and the drop in the voltage along the Bus bar (&#x394;V) reduces the V_eff as described previously, the (&#x394;V/L<sub>0</sub>) terms represents the gradient of the shading/Tvis from one end to the other, e.g. a small part (small L<sub>0</sub>) with a large voltage drop along the bus bar from end to the other will have a very pronounced Tvis shading/gradient, while for a large part will need a larger voltage drop along the bus bar to maintain the same shading along its length. Thus, the bus bar properties, e.g. height, width, material, though having a uniform cross section, can be selected during fabrication to provide the required shading from one end to the other. This enables ease of design/manufacturing to avoid complex-geometry bus bars, while still providing a gradient in the optical properties across the window. For example, one can fabricate a thin bus bar that has a voltage drop across its length to create a gradient shading.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Dual Powered Bus Bar</heading><p id="p-0078" num="0074">In certain embodiments described above, the bus bars, particularly those in the &#x201c;electrically resistive bus bar&#x201d; embodiments described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>G</figref>, can be powered from one end of the bus bars (as described above) or both ends of each bus bar(as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>H</figref>). Powering bus bars from both ends provides additional control over the gradients/shading of the EC window. For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>H</figref> (top left), a voltage is applied to the top ends of the two bus bars that power each of the TCO's of the EC device coating. The bottom ends are also in electrical communication through leads (depicted here as &#x201c;open&#x201d;). A voltage gradient is established over the length of the bus bars, in this example substantially equal gradients across the bus bars of substantially the same length. This results in a voltage gradient across the TCO's and a corresponding tinting gradient across the monolithic EC device coating. By using a dual lead configuration, one can &#x201c;flip&#x201d; the tinting gradient (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>H</figref>, top right) by applying voltage at the bottom of the bus bars and establishing the opposite tinting gradient (depicted vertically here).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0075">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>H</figref>, bottom, one of ordinary skill in the art can see that multiple combinations are possible by suitable selections of V_applied_<b>1</b>, V_applied_<b>2</b> and bus bar pattern and RB.

A voltage gradient may be established along the length of the bus bars by virtue of the resistive portions <b>465</b><i>a </i>and <b>465</b><i>b. </i>That is, the top highly conductive portions <b>460</b><i>a </i>may have the highest voltage, and the middle highly conductive portions <b>460</b><i>b </i>may have a somewhat lower voltage because the more resistive portions <b>465</b><i>a </i>creates an IR voltage drop between the middle portions <b>460</b><i>b </i>and portions <b>460</b><i>a. </i>Likewise the bottom-most highly conductive portions <b>460</b><i>c </i>may have the lowest voltage because the more resistive portions <b>465</b><i>b </i>lie between them and the middle highly conductive portions <b>460</b><i>b </i>preventing some of the electrical current from flowing from middle portion <b>460</b><i>b </i>to lower portion <b>460</b><i>c. </i>The net effect may be a tint gradient zone, for example, the one depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref>. Highly electrically conductive portions <b>460</b> may be of the same or different conductive material, and likewise, less electrically conductive portions <b>465</b> may be comprised of the same or different conductive material. The key is that portions <b>465</b> are less electrically conductive than their adjacent neighbors <b>460</b>. Using this technology, a wide variety of voltage and/or resistance patterns may be established in order to create corresponding tint gradient zones in an EC lite. In addition, a combination of bus bars of lengthwise varying width and those bus bars configured as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref> may be used. For example, each as partners in a bus bar pair and/or in individual tint gradient zones on an EC lite.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Remotely Controlled Resistive Nodes</heading><p id="p-0084" num="0080">In certain embodiments, the less electrically conductive portions, <b>465</b> have variable resistance whose resistance can be varied between 1 mOhm-1 kOhm to dynamically adjust the tint gradient zones, i.e. when no zoning is required, elements <b>465</b> are in the low resistance state. That is the bus bar segments <b>460</b> and <b>465</b>, collectively, act as a single bus bar of low resistitivity. When zoning is desired, elements <b>465</b> are switched to a higher resistance state (than bus bar segments <b>460</b>) when zoning is desired. The resistance of the element can also be varied to modulate the gradient in the Tvis (lower resistance for lower gradient). The element <b>465</b> can be an electronic control element that can modulated remotely (e.g. wireless/Bluetooth/Zigbee etc.) and can be triggered by automated EC control intelligence and/or manually by user input. The control element may be a component of an onboard controller, that is, an EC controller that is integrated with, in, part of the IGU.

For example, consider a specific cross section (orthogonal to the bus bars) of a monolithic EC device coating having bus bars of different configuration along each side. If the voltage profile, gradient, along one bus bar is different than the voltage profile of the other bus bar, then various tint gradients can be achieved. Thus, with different combinations of bus bar configurations on a single EC coating, almost endless variations in the gradients are possible.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Low Leakage Current Requirements</heading><p id="p-0086" num="0082">The EC device tinting or clearing operation can be divided into a drive step and hold step, e.g. where there is a ramp in voltage followed by a constant voltage, respectively. For monolithic EC device coatings without physical breaks/scribes/resistance zones, but having tint zones as described herein, it is especially important that the leakage current of the device is as low as possible. This is because, the leakage current can normalize or diffuse out any gradients setup due to conduction over the TCOs and change in the V_applied.

Resistive zones are described in more detail below.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Resistive Zones With or Without Configuring Powering Mechanism of EC Devices</heading><p id="p-0091" num="0087">In certain embodiments, resistive zones are configured in the monolithic EC device. These resistive zones may allow for more uniform tinting fronts, e.g., when used in combination with bus bar powering mechanisms described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, an EC lite, <b>500</b>, much like EC lite <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, is configured with two pairs of bus bars for creating two tinting zones, in this example (as depicted) a top and a bottom zone. EC lite <b>500</b> may be incorporated into an IGU, <b>510</b>, with a spacer <b>110</b> and a mate lite <b>115</b> as depicted. A major difference between lite <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and lite <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is that lite <b>500</b> does not have a laser scribe <b>225</b> across the lite to bifurcate the EC device into two devices. Lite <b>500</b> has a single EC device over the viewable area of the lite. However, the EC device on lite <b>500</b> includes a resistive zone, <b>505</b>, that spans the width of the EC device. The heavy dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> indicates the approximate position of resistive zone <b>505</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0088">As depicted in the IGU construct <b>510</b>, resistive zone <b>505</b>, like laser scribe <b>225</b>, may not be visible to the naked eye when the EC lite's zones are not tinted. However, unlike laser scribe <b>225</b>, when adjacent tinting zones of EC lite are tinted, resistive zone <b>505</b> may not be visually discernible to the naked eye. This is illustrated schematically in the right portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>. The reason resistive zone <b>505</b> tints is because it is not a physical bifurcation of the EC device into two devices, but rather a physical modification of the single EC device coating and/or its associated transparent conductors within a resistive zone. The resistive zone is an area of the EC device where the activity of the device is impeded, specifically through higher electrical resistivity and/or greater resistance to ion movement and/or lower ion density compared to the remainder of the EC device. Thus one or both of the transparent conductors may be modified to have increased electrical resistivity in the resistive zone, and/or the EC device stack may be modified so that ion movement is slower in the resistive zone relative to the EC device stack in the adjacent tinting zones. The modifications may be made during deposition of the EC device or post deposition through a thermal and/or laser treatment. The EC device still functions, tints and bleaches, in this resistive zone, but at a slower rate and/or with less intensity of tint than the remaining portions of the EC device. For example, the resistive zone may tint as fully as the remainder of EC device in the adjacent tinting zones, but the resistive zone tints more slowly than the adjacent tinting zones. In another example, the resistive zone may tint less fully than the adjacent tinting zones, and at a slower rate.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> is a perspective and a cross section, X-X, of EC lite <b>500</b> as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>. The cross section, X-X, spans the upper and lower tinting zones (tinting zones <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, respectively) of EC lite <b>500</b> as well as resistive zone <b>505</b> (only the bus bars on the top TCO are depicted in cross section X-X, they are orthogonal to resistive zone <b>505</b> in this example). Cross section X-X (lower portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>) is not to scale, but rather a schematic representation of the structure of EC lite <b>500</b>. On the glass substrate is an EC device including a first transparent conducting oxide layer, TCO 1, a second transparent conductive oxide layer, TCO 2, and sandwiched in between the TCOs is an EC stack which contains one or more electrochromic materials, e.g., the transitions of which are driven by intercalation/de-intercalation of ions, such as lithium ions. Resistive zone <b>505</b> is an area in the EC device where one or more layers of the EC device have their function impaired, either partially or completely, but device function is not cut off across the zone. For example, one or both of the TCOs has a higher resistance to electrical flow in resistive zone <b>505</b> than in the tinting zones. Thus, e.g., if tinting zone 1 is activated, electrons flow across the TCOs at a given rate, but that flow is restricted along resistive zone <b>505</b>. This allows the electrons to be sufficiently retained in tinting zone 1 and thus leak more slowly across resistive zone <b>505</b> than otherwise would be the case if TCO function had not been impaired there.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0090">Resistive zone <b>505</b> could be thought of as a &#x201c;dam&#x201d; for electrical and/or ionic flow, impairing rate of flow (either ionic current or electronic current) across it, the flow can be partially or fully impaired in one or both TCOs, for example. Due to the restricted or slowed rate of electrical flow across resistive zone <b>505</b>, ion intercalation in the EC stack between the TCOs at resistive zone <b>505</b> is also impaired. Because the EC device is not physically cut into two devices, this is unlike conventional devices having zones created by physical bifurcation of one more layers of a single device coating. Resistive zone <b>505</b> may have physical impairment of ion flow in one or more of the EC material layers. In one example, both the top and bottom TCO's electrical conductivity is impaired, either partially or fully, in resistive zone <b>505</b>, but the function of the EC device stack layers is substantially unchanged. Thus, when one tinting zone is tinted and the adjacent zone is not-tinted, the device will tint under resistive zone <b>505</b>. When adjacent tinting zones are both tinted, there is no bright line discernible to the end user, because the device tints under resistive zone <b>505</b>. In embodiments where ion flow is impaired in resistive zone <b>505</b>, the device may still color, but more slowly than the bulk device. This rate difference in coloring may or may not be visually discernible to the end user.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0091">Resistive zone <b>505</b> may be fabricated, for example, by exposure of the area at the resistive zone <b>505</b> to irradiation, e.g. laser or heat source, in order to modify but not destroy the function at resistive zone <b>505</b>. For example, one or both of the TCO layers may be heated sufficiently to change the morphology while retaining the function, albeit impaired relative to the remainder of the TCO layers in the tinting zones. In certain embodiments, it is advantageous to impair the function of only one TCO in a resistive zone. Resistive zones may also be created by impairing the function of one or more layers of the EC device (including, or not, one or both TCOs) by chemical doping. For example, in one embodiment the lower TCO is treated along a line (at resistive zone <b>505</b>, e.g.) with heat and oxygen to create a more resistive TCO at the resistive zone. In another embodiment, one or both TCOs are fabricated thinner along the resistive zone than the rest of the TCOs, e.g. TCO material may be removed, but not cut through, along the resistive zone. In another example heating along the zone may densify the EC materials while having no effect on the TCO layers; or may affect the TCO layers as well.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0092">In certain embodiments, the resistive zones may be narrow, e.g. between about 1 &#x3bc;m and 1000 &#x3bc;m wide, or may be wider, e.g. between about 1 mm and about 10 mm wide. Because the EC materials in resistive zones tint and do not necessarily leave a bright line contrast effect typical of conventional laser isolation scribes, there is less concern as to the width of the described resistive zones. Thus, in other embodiments, a resistive zone may be, for example, wider than 1 mm, wider than 10 mm, wider than 15 mm, etc.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0093">In the embodiment described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B, and <b>5</b>C</figref>, each of the tinting zones has its own unique pair of bus bars. Thus tinting zones can be colored independently by virtue of operation or the respective bus bar pairs at each tinting zone. In other embodiments, multiple tinting zones may be configured to share a common bus bar, while still being independently controllable.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref> depicts a perspective (top portion) and a cross section Y-Y (bottom portion) of an EC lite, <b>510</b>, having two tinting zones of variable tinting level by virtue of a resistive zone, <b>515</b>. In this illustrated example, a single set of three bus bars, <b>525</b>(<i>a</i>), <b>525</b>(<i>b</i>), and <b>520</b>, is used with two tinting zones. Cross section, Y-Y, of EC lite <b>510</b> spans left and right tinting zones (tinting zones 1 and 2, respectively) of lite <b>510</b> as well as resistive zone <b>515</b>. Resistive zone <b>515</b> runs parallel to and between (approximately in the middle of EC lite <b>510</b>) bus bars <b>520</b> and <b>525</b>(<i>a</i>) and bus bar <b>525</b>(<i>b</i>) (from top to bottom as depicted in the perspective at the top of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>). Cross section Y-Y (lower portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>) is not to scale, but rather is a schematic representation of the structure of EC lite <b>510</b>. On the glass substrate is an EC device including a first transparent conducting oxide layer, TCO 1, a second transparent conductive oxide layer, TCO 2, and sandwiched in between TCO 1 and TCO 2 is an EC stack which contains one or more electrochromic materials, e.g., the transitions of which are driven by intercalation/de-intercalation of ions, such as lithium ions. In this example, resistive zone <b>515</b> is an area of TCO 2, where the TCO function is impaired but not eliminated. For example, TCO 2 may have its function impaired along a line.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref> includes two graphs showing plots of the local voltage V<sub>TCL </sub>in TCO 1 and TCO 2 of the EC lite, <b>510</b>, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref> that drives transition. At the left, a graph shows a curve <b>526</b> of the local values of V<sub>TCL </sub>in the TCO 1. At the right, a graph shows a curve <b>528</b> of the local values of V<sub>TCL </sub>in the TCO 2. In this example, when the EC device is energized, the bottom TCO 1 has a local voltage potential V<sub>TCL </sub>across its span similar to that of a typical transparent conductor for an EC device. According to curve <b>526</b> of V<sub>TCL </sub>in TCO 1, the voltage increases slightly in the middle away from where bus bars <b>525</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>525</b>(<i>b</i>) are disposed on TCO 1 where voltage is applied due to the sheet resistance and current passing through TCO 1. The increase will be near bus bar <b>525</b>(<i>a</i>) and bus bar <b>520</b> because of the higher current in this area due to higher voltage potential between bus bar <b>525</b>(<i>a</i>) and bus bar <b>520</b>. But TCO 2, by virtue of resistive zone <b>515</b>, has a higher V<sub>TCL </sub>in tinting zone 1 than in tinting zone 2. According to curve <b>528</b> V<sub>TCL </sub>in TCO 2, the slight voltage drops between the left hand side where bus bar <b>520</b> is disposed on TCO 2 and the resistive zone due to sheet resistance and current passing through TCO 2. At the resistive zone <b>515</b>, the voltage sharply drops. The voltage slightly drops between the resistive zone <b>515</b> and the right hand side due to sheet resistance and current passing through TCO 2. The value of V <sub>eff </sub>at any location between the bus bars is the difference in values of curves <b>130</b> and <b>125</b> at that position on the x-axis corresponding to the location of interest. The result is that tinting zone 1 has a higher V<sub>eff </sub>than tinting zone 2 and thus tinting zone 1 colors more darkly than tinting zone 2. This is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref>. On the left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref>, a visible coloration difference is seen in window <b>510</b> corresponding to the location of resistive zone <b>515</b> and the rather abrupt drop in voltage in TCO 2 as reflected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref>. However, this visual coloration difference need not be so; that is, for example, if resistive zone <b>515</b> is sufficiently &#x201c;leaky&#x201d;, and allows voltage to flow across the top TCO in a smooth gradient (or if window <b>510</b> is configured without resistive zone <b>515</b> and the voltage applied to TCO 2 is insufficient to overcome a voltage drop across TCO 2) then a gradual transition from darker to lighter results (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>F</figref>, right side) due to the voltage drop over. Of course, the two tinting zones can be configured as upper and lower portions when installed in a building, and they need not be side by side as depicted.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>G</figref> depicts an EC lite, <b>530</b>, configured with a resistive zone created by inhibiting the electrical conductivity of only one of the transparent conducting oxides. The EC lite is much like the one described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref>, but in this embodiment one of the TCOs is cut through along the resistive zone (cut <b>550</b>), while the other TCO is left intact. The EC device stack is unchanged in the resistive zone, only the top TCO is cut. The EC lite <b>530</b> has two sets of bus bars, <b>535</b> and <b>540</b>. Bus bar set <b>535</b> powers the lower TCO 1, while bus bar set <b>540</b> powers the top TCO 2. The lower portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>G</figref> shows cross section Z-Z. The EC device will still at least partially color along the resistive zone by virtue of one of the TCOs being fully intact, monolithic, along with the EC stack. While there is a narrow region of the opposite TCO 2 missing, there is sufficient voltage potential established between the intact TCO 1 and the edge of the cut (opposing) TCO 2 along the resistive zone to allow coloration of the EC device in the resistive zone, albeit more slowly than if both TCOs were intact along the resistive zone. The resistive zone may color more lightly when only one of the tinting zones is powered, while with both tinting zones powered, the resistive zone may fully tint or approximate full tinting. Each portion of TCO 2 can be powered independently of TCO 1. In this way, separate zones, tinting zone 1 and tinting zone 2, may, e.g., be tinted more effectively. Since there is a cut through the TCO 2, if only one zone is powered, a tinting level of V<sub>TCL </sub>is only established in that tinting zone. The cut in TCO 2 aids in establishing and maintaining a uniform tinting front. In this example, since the TCOs are a type of moisture barrier, EC lite <b>530</b> may be incorporated into an IGU where the EC device is hermetically sealed within the volume of the IGU, and/or a top coat may be used to hermetically seal the device, with our without lamination to a substrate. A top coat would fill the open trench cut through TCO 2.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0097">In certain embodiments, it may be more desirable to cut the bottom TCO 1 rather than the top TCO 2. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>H</figref> shows EC lite, <b>530</b><i>a, </i>where the cut, <b>550</b><i>a, </i>is made only through the bottom TCO 1. In this example, the top TCO 2 may maintain its hermeticity by virtue of an intact top transparent conductor layer. The EC material may fill in the trench made by cut <b>550</b><i>a, </i>and thus tint along with the trench in TCO 1 that it fills, providing an area of inhibited coloration rate such as a resistive zone.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0098">In certain embodiments, it may more desirable to cut the top TCO 2 rather than the bottom TCO 1. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>G</figref> shows EC lite, <b>530</b>, where the cut, <b>550</b>, is made only through the top TCO 2. An advantage of this embodiment may be that the cut can be made after the EC device is fabricated, for example, by laser processing performed after sputter coating.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0099">The bus bars <b>535</b> and <b>540</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>G and <b>5</b>H</figref> need not be parallel, e.g. the bus bars powering each TCO can be orthogonal to each other. Also, the single monolithic TCO need not have two bus bars, but it is desirable so as to have more control over tinting of the individual tinting zones. Bleaching function would work the same way but in reverse polarity to bleach the tinting zones. In the embodiments described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>D-<b>5</b>H</figref>, the bus bars are configured parallel to the resistive zone; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>I and <b>5</b>J</figref>, like in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, e.g., the bus bars are configured orthogonally to the resistive zone.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0100">In certain embodiments, there are no bus bars in the viewable area of the EC device, that is, in the area within the spacer of the IGU. Certain conventional EC technologies rely on bus bars running through the viewable area because of slow switching kinetics that would otherwise occur and/or due to ion conductor layer leakage currents that do not allow the EC device to switch across the entire viewable area of larger IGUs (e.g. about a meter wide or more where bus bars would otherwise be configured outside the viewable area at the edges of this width) without such bus bars in the viewable area to provide the extra voltage needed to compensate for the leakage current. Certain embodiments described herein, e.g. where cuts are made through one of the TCOs but not the EC device stack itself, do not require bus bars in the viewable area because they include EC devices with very low leakage current. Examples of such devices are described in U.S. patent Ser. No. 12/814,279, filed Jun. 11, 2010, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. For example, the embodiments described where the resistive zone includes a cut through one of the TCOs include examples where there are no bus bars in the viewable area of the EC device.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>I</figref> depicts an EC lite, <b>555</b>, configured with a resistive zone, <b>570</b>, created by inhibiting the electrical conductivity across one of the transparent conducting oxides, in this example a cut is made through the TCO nearer the substrate. The EC lite is much like the one described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, but in this embodiment one of the TCOs is cut through along the resistive zone (cut <b>570</b>), while the other TCO is left intact. The EC device stack is unchanged in the resistive zone area, only the bottom TCO is cut. The EC lite <b>555</b> has two sets of bus bars, <b>560</b> and <b>565</b>. Bus bar set <b>560</b> powers both the upper and the lower TCOs in tint zone 1 (TCO 1 and TCO 2), while bus bar set <b>565</b> powers tint zone 2. The lower portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>I</figref> shows cross section V-V (only the bus bars on TCO 2 are depicted). The EC device will still at least partially color along the resistive zone by virtue of one of the TCOs being fully intact, monolithic, along with the EC stack. While there is a narrow region of the opposite TCO 1 missing, there is sufficient voltage potential established between the intact TCO 2 and the edge of the cut (opposing) TCO 1 along the resistive zone to allow coloration of the EC device in the resistive zone, albeit more slowly than if both TCOs were intact along the resistive zone. The resistive zone may color more lightly when only one of the tinting zones is powered, while with both tinting zones powered, the resistive zone may fully tint or approximate full tint. Each portion of TCO 1 can be powered independently of TCO 2. In this way, separate zones, tinting zone 1 and tinting zone 2, may, e.g., be tinted more effectively. Since there is a cut through the TCO 1, if only one zone is powered, a tinting level V<sub>TCL </sub>is only established in that tinting zone. The cut in TCO 1 aids in establishing and maintaining a uniform tinting front. In this example, since the TCOs are a type of moisture barrier, EC lite <b>555</b> may be incorporated into an IGU where the EC device is hermetically sealed within the volume of the IGU, and a top coat may not be necessary because TCO 2 remains intact, although in one embodiment a top coat is applied to TCO 2. Because the bus bars in EC lite <b>555</b> are orthogonal to the resistive zone <b>570</b>, the tinting front is also orthogonal to the bus bars.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>J</figref> depicts an EC lite, <b>555</b><i>a, </i>configured with a resistive zone, <b>570</b><i>a, </i>created by inhibiting the electrical conductivity across one of the transparent conducting oxides, in this example a cut is made through the TCO distal the substrate. The EC lite is much like the one described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>I</figref>, but in this embodiment TCO 2 is cut through while TCO 1 is left intact. The EC device stack is unchanged in the resistive zone area, only the top TCO is cut. The EC lite <b>555</b><i>a </i>has two sets of bus bars, <b>560</b> and <b>565</b>. Bus bar set <b>560</b> powers both the upper and the lower TCOs in tint zone 1 (TCO 1 and TCO 2), while bus bar set <b>565</b> powers tint zone 2. The lower portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>J</figref> shows cross section T-T (only the bus bars on TCO 2 are depicted). The EC device will still at least partially color along the resistive zone by virtue of one of the TCOs being fully intact, monolithic, along with the EC stack. While there is a narrow region of the opposite TCO 2 missing, there is sufficient voltage potential established between the intact TCO 1 and the edge of the cut (opposing) TCO 2 along the resistive zone to allow coloration of the EC device in the resistive zone, albeit more slowly than if both TCOs were intact along the resistive zone. The resistive zone may color more lightly when only one of the tinting zones is powered, while with both tinting zones powered, the resistive zone may fully tint or approximate full tinting. Each portion of TCO 2 can be powered independently of TCO 1. In this way, separate zones, tinting zone 1 and tinting zone 2, may, e.g., be tinted more effectively. Since there is a cut through the TCO 2, if only one zone is powered, a tinting level of V<sub>TCL </sub>is only established in that tinting zone. The cut in TCO 2 aids in establishing and maintaining a uniform tinting front. In this example, since the TCOs are a type of moisture barrier, EC lite <b>555</b><i>a </i>may be incorporated into an IGU where the EC device is hermetically sealed within the volume of the IGU, and a top coat may be necessary because TCO 2 is cut through, in one embodiment a top coat is applied to TCO 2. Because the bus bars in EC lite <b>555</b><i>a </i>are orthogonal to the resistive zone <b>570</b><i>a, </i>the tinting front is also orthogonal to the bus bars.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0103">When two bus bars ends of opposite polarity are located proximate each other on an intact TCO, hot spots can result. Hot spots are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/452,032, filed Apr. 20, 2012 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. When using TCOs that are cut through, e.g. as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>J</figref>, hot spots may be avoided because the proximate bus bars of a TCO layer cannot electrically communicate with each other through the TCO. However, to avoid stress on the underlying EC device in the area along the resistive zone formed by cutting through TCO, the ends of the bus bars may be configured so they are not directly over (aligned with) the cut made for the resistive zone.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0104">One embodiment is an EC lite as described herein, where a resistive zone is formed by partially cutting through one or both of the TCOs. For example, in one embodiment, e.g. analogous the embodiment described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>J</figref>, the top TCO is only cut part way through, rather than cut through. In this way a resistive zone is established and the hermiticity of the EC device, imparted by the top TCO is left at least partially intact. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>K</figref> depicts another example.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>K</figref> depicts an EC lite, <b>575</b>, configured with two resistive zones, <b>580</b><i>a </i>and <b>580</b><i>b, </i>created by inhibiting the electrical conductivity across one of the transparent conducting oxides. In this example, partial cuts are made through the TCO distal the substrate (TCO 2). The EC lite is much like the one described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>J</figref>, but in this embodiment TCO 2 is not cut through, but only some TCO material is removed to form resistive zones <b>580</b><i>a </i>and <b>580</b><i>b. </i>For example, laser ablation is used to remove material only down to a fraction of the depth of the ITO. In one embodiment, between about 10% and about 90% of the TCO material is removed along the zone, in another embodiment between about 25% and about 75% of the TCO material is removed, in yet another embodiment between about 40% and about 60% of the material is removed. By removing only part of the TCO material, a resistive zone is fabricated while not exposing the EC stack to the ambient. Lite <b>575</b> has three tint zones, by virtue of having two resistive zones. The EC lite <b>575</b> has three sets of bus bars, <b>560</b>, <b>565</b> and <b>566</b>. Bus bar set <b>560</b> powers both the upper and the lower TCOs in tint zone 1 (TCO 1 and TCO 2), bus bar set <b>565</b> powers tint zone 2, and bus bar set <b>566</b> powers tint zone 3. Each tint zone can be independently controlled via powering the bottom TCO, and independently charging the TCO 2 bus bars, depending upon which zone tinting is desired. Because the resistive zones have a higher sheet resistance relative to the bulk TCO, charge loss over this barrier is slow and allows the powered zone to fully tint while the tinting front approximates the position of the resistive zone.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0106">The lower portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>K</figref> shows cross section S-S (only the bus bars on TCO 2 are depicted). The EC device will still at least partially color along the resistive zone by virtue of TCO 2 being fully intact, monolithic, along with the EC stack. The resistive zone may color more lightly when only one of the tinting zones is powered, or not at all, depending on its width and the thickness of the TCO in the resistive zone. With adjacent tinting zones powered, the resistive zone may fully tint or approximate full tinting. In this example, since the TCOs are a type of moisture barrier, EC lite <b>575</b> may be incorporated into an IGU where the EC device is hermetically sealed within the volume of the IGU, and a top coat may be necessary because TCO 2 is at least partially cut through, in one embodiment a top coat is applied to TCO 2. Because the bus bars in EC lite <b>575</b> are orthogonal to the resistive zones <b>580</b><i>a </i>and <b>580</b><i>b, </i>the tinting front is also orthogonal to the bus bars and approximates the line defined by the resistive zones.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0107">Note, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>K</figref>, the bus bars ends are substantially coextant with the resistive zones. In one embodiment, bus bar material is applied and then the resistive zones are formed by cutting through the bus bar material and at least some of the top TCO. In certain embodiments the top TCO is cut through, while not cutting the EC device stack through (a portion of the EC stack may be cut, but sometimes not through the IC material so as not to form electrical shorts along the resistive zone). By applying, e.g., only two lines of bus bar material (e.g. silver based ink) and firing the bus bars, the resistive zones and individual bus bar pairs can be fabricated in the same process by cutting through the bus bar material and into or through the top TCO simultaneously. This saves process steps. The bus bar on the bottom TCO 1 is cut through without cutting through the bottom TCO. In one embodiment the bus bars on the top TCO are formed by cutting through along with the top TCO, either fully or partially cut, while the bottom bus bars are applied separately to each tinting zone. In certain embodiments, each tinting zone's bus bars are applied individually to each tinting zone. The latter may be done to avoid the aforementioned hot spots, e.g. when cutting through the bus bar and TCO in the same process, the ends of the newly formed bus bars are necessarily aligned with the cut in the TCO, since they were from the same cutting process.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Resistive Layer through EC Stack Changes to Speed/Coloration Efficiency</heading><p id="p-0112" num="0108">In certain embodiments, a resistive zone can be created by changing the electrochromic behavior of one or more layers of the EC stack vs. applied voltage. In this case, the resistive zone provides a resistance to coloration rather than electrical resistance per se. For example, the resistive zone may color slowly or less deeply (higher Tvis) compared to the rest of the device at same V<sub>eff</sub>. This can be achieved by, for example, 1) reducing the dose of ions (typically Li<sup>+</sup>) causing the electrochromic reaction, 2) changing the properties of the electrochromic layers (EC, CE) such that the optical change per ion is reduced (i.e. reduced coloration efficiency), 3) reducing ion mobility in the EC and/or CE layers in the resistive zone, and/or 4) increasing the thickness of the IC layer and/or reducing ion mobility in the IC layer such that it is harder for the ions to move across the IC layer. Any of these changes can be done during deposition and/or post fabrication. For example, local heating of the EC stack due thermal/laser irradiation can be used, or for example, selectively altering deposition rate and/or oxidation state in the resistive zone relative to the bulk device.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0109">Certain embodiments concern methods of fabricating apparatus and devices described herein. One embodiment is a method of forming an EC lite having two or more tinting zones, the method including a) forming a EC device (e.g., a monolithic EC device), b) applying a single bus bar to the top TCO of the monolithic EC device, and c) cutting through the bus bar and at least part way through the top TCO thereby fabricating said two or more tinting zones each having separate bus bars on the top TCO by virtue of c.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0110">Resistive zones need not be linear as depicted, but rather may be of any shape. For example, for desired effects, one might choose a resistive zone that is zigzagged, curved or irregularly shaped along adjacent tinting zones.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0111">In certain embodiments, resistive zones are used to define a perimeter, closed or open, of a region of an EC window, that is, a sub-portion (area) of a monolithic EC device. For example, these resistive zones can be used to highlight particular symbols or shapes in the viewable region of the EC window. One embodiment with such a resistive zone is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>. For example, an end user may wish to have an area of the EC window that does not tint, or that becomes tinted more slowly, than the remainder of the tintable EC window.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> depicts an EC lite, <b>600</b>, which includes a single pair of bus bars, <b>105</b>, as well as a resistive zone, <b>605</b>. In this example, the resistive zone is in the shape of a closed rectangle (as indicated by the dotted line). Resistive zone <b>605</b> may not be visually discernible to the naked eye. In one embodiment, resistive zone <b>605</b> is configured such that the portions of the TCOs of the EC device in the resistive zone (as indicated by the dotted line) have a higher electrical resistance than the portions of the TCOs in the remainder of the EC device on either side of the resistive zone (in this example both outside and inside the rectangular perimeter zone), but the resistive zone still passes charge. In this embodiment, when the EC device is tinted, the area around the resistive zone <b>605</b> tints first, the tinting front slowing when it reaches the rectangular closed resistive zone <b>605</b>. This momentarily, e.g. for a period of minutes, gives the effect of a small untinted view port in a larger tinted window. As the charge bleeds beyond the resistive zone and into the untinted rectangular region within the zone, this gives the effect of the small untinted view port closing as it tints. In another embodiment, resistive zone <b>605</b> is configured such that the portions of the TCOs of the EC device in the resistive zone (as indicated by the dotted line) have a very high resistance to electrical charge as compared to the portions of the TCOs in the remainder of the EC device on either side of the resistive zone (in this example both outside and inside the rectangular perimeter zone), that is, the resistive zone effectively blocks electrical charge. In this embodiment, when the area outside the zone is tinted, the area inside the zone may never tint because the charge may not be able to pass the resistive barrier <b>605</b>. This gives the effect of a small untinted view port in a larger tinted window, so long as the EC device is tinted. In another embodiment, resistive zone <b>605</b> is configured such that the portions of the TCOs of the EC device in the resistive zone (as indicated by the dotted line) and in the region within the resistive zone have a very high resistance to electrical charge as compared to the portions of the TCOs in the remainder of the EC device on the outside of the resistive zone.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> shows a similar EC lite, <b>610</b>, having a resistive zone, <b>615</b>, which is &#x201c;open&#x201d; by virtue of a gap, <b>620</b>, in the perimeter. In this example, the resistive zone <b>615</b> is configured to block electrical charge. When the EC device is tinted, the area around the resistive zone <b>615</b> tints first, the tinting front slowing when it reaches the rectangular closed resistive zone <b>615</b>, except at the open portion <b>620</b>, where the tinting front gives the effect of &#x201c;pouring in&#x201d; or &#x201c;filling in&#x201d; (as indicated by the two dotted arrows) the rectangular region within resistive zone <b>615</b>. Eventually, when the area inside resistive zone <b>615</b> is tinted, resistive zone <b>615</b> may no longer be discernible to the naked eye, as the EC device colors under the zone, as described above. Configuring resistive zones in such a way can be used to achieve permanent or transient tinting effects on EC windows, e.g., to display a logo or words in a transient manner for presentation during marketing purposes, or to achieve tinted and non-tinting zones on an EC lite. EC lites so configured can be incorporated into IGUs as describe and/or laminated with mate lites.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Multi-EC Lite Patterns</heading><p id="p-0118" num="0114">Embodiments described can also be used to create patterns that encompass more than one IGU, laminate or other construct containing one or more monolithic EC lites. For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, an EC lite, <b>700</b>, is configured with a resistive zone or zones, such that a portion, <b>710</b>, of the EC lite does not color, or colors less intensely than the bulk device (the dotted lines are only to depict where the portion <b>710</b> is on the EC lite). Four similarly configured lites <b>700</b> are arranged so that when colored, they form a display, such as the letter &#x201c;O&#x201d; in this example.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0115">Many such lites can be configured for display purposes, e.g. on a curtain wall or facade of a building for advertising purposes. Since EC monolithic EC lites can be made quite large, e.g., 6 feet&#xd7;10 feet, very large words, symbols, ornamental designs and the like can be made for retail facades, schools, military installations, airports and the like. Moreover, since e.g. laminates and/or IGUs can have two or more registered EC lites, and each EC lite of any laminate and/or IGU can have tinting features as described herein, many possibilities for changing words, symbols and/or ornamental designs are possible. For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a glass facade, <b>800</b>, has eight 5&#x2032;&#xd7;10&#x2032; triple pane IGUs, each IGU having three EC lites, each EC lite is patterned with resistive zones such that different words can be displayed on the facade. In this example, the letters of the words are approximately 6&#x2032; high, however any pattern, size or arrangement is possible. In one embodiment, the facade includes a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; mode where no words are displayed, rather the glass is tinted uniformly across all eight IGUs. The multi-EC lite pattern can be used for skylights, facades, or any place where such displays are desired, e.g. in large skylights at airports or other buildings, words and/or symbols, changing or not, can be communicated to aircraft.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0116">Gradient zoning can also be done across multiple EC lites, e.g. laminates and/or IGUs, for example as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts a glass facade, <b>900</b>, having eight 5&#x2032;&#xd7;10&#x2032; IGUs. In this example, each IGU has a single EC lite, each configured with a monolithic EC device coating and appropriate bus bars and electrical control (e.g. dual feed bus bars as described above) so that each IGU can fully bleach, fully tint, or create gradient coloration across the entire monolithic EC coating. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the facade can be made to tint in a gradient from dark to light, from top to bottom, respectively (top facade), tint uniformly across all IGUs (middle facade) or e.g. tint in a gradient from dark to light, from bottom to top, respectively.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0117">One of ordinary skill in the art, armed with this disclosure, would appreciate that tint gradient zones can be used with resistive zones and this combination is within the scope of the embodiments described herein. For example a single EC lite, or a facade, can be made to both tint with gradients and display words, symbols and the like.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0118">Although the foregoing embodiments have been described in some detail to facilitate understanding, the described embodiments are to be considered illustrative and not limiting.
