Neither the virtual hard drive nor the one or more virtual disk files contained in the virtual hard drive of such conventional VM systems are capable of being compressed (or uncompressed). Accordingly, regardless of whether VM's in the plurality of VM's in the conventional VM systems are active or inactive, each of the plurality of VM's remain unchanged in size, thereby occupying hardware space and resources. As active VM's are required to perform more and more functions, and greater and greater processes, more and more resources are required to support functioning of these active VM's. However, with resources and hardware space being occupied by inactive VM's, operation of the conventional VM systems become strained.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hence, there is a need for more robust and scalable solutions for implementing VM management, and, more particularly, to methods, systems, and apparatuses for implementing VM management using hardware compression.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A further understanding of the nature and advantages of particular embodiments may be realized by reference to the remaining portions of the specification and the drawings, in which like reference numerals are used to refer to similar components.

The computing system or a compression system might compress a virtual hard drive (specifically, one or more virtual disk files contained in the virtual hard drive) associated with each of the identified one or more first VM's that are determined to be currently inactive. In some cases, the computing system might perform or continue to perform one or more (computing) operations using each of the identified one or more second VM's that are determined to be currently active.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to some embodiments, compressing the virtual hard drive associated with each of the identified one or more first VM's might comprise performing high-speed compression on the virtual hard drive associated with each of the identified one or more first VM's that are determined to be currently inactive. In some cases, the compression system or the computing system might compress the virtual hard drive (specifically, the one or more virtual disk files contained in the virtual hard drive) at a rate of 100-500 Mb/s compression, a rate of 500-1000 Mb/s compression, a rate of 1-15 Gb/s compression, a rate of 15-20 Gb/s compression, or greater.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Alternatively, or additionally, compressing the virtual hard drive associated with each of the identified one or more first VM's might comprise compressing the virtual hard drive associated with each of the identified one or more first VM's by at least 60%, such that each of the identified one or more first VM's is compressed to 40% or less of its original size. In some cases, compressing the virtual hard drive associated with each of the identified one or more first VM's might comprise compressing the virtual hard drive associated with each of the identified one or more first VM's by at least 70%, such that each of the identified one or more first VM's is compressed to 30% or less of its original size. Alternatively, or additionally, compressing the virtual hard drive associated with each of the identified one or more first VM's might comprise compressing one or more virtual machine disk files associated with each of the identified one or more first VM's using at least one VM control file associated with at least one first VM.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the computing system might receive a request to use at least one third VM among the one or more first VM's that are determined to be currently inactive.

In this manner, hardware resources and hardware space may be utilized more efficiently, by releasing resources and space by the compression of inactive VM's (thereby avoiding needless occupation of resources and space by inactive VM's; with only the compressed virtual hard drive and uncompressible portions of the inactive VM's being stored).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The following detailed description illustrates a few exemplary embodiments in further detail to enable one of skill in the art to practice such embodiments.

In a non-limiting example, a virtual hard drive having an original size of 4 GB was reduced in size to about 1.3 GB when the virtual disk files (e.g., .vmdk files) that are contained in the virtual hard drive <b>320</b> were compressed using the techniques described herein. In some instances, the compression system <b>305</b> might perform high-speed compression on the virtual hard drive (specifically, on the virtual disk files or the .vmdk files <b>325</b>), in some cases, achieving a compression rate of 100-500 Mb/s, 500-1000 Mb/s, 1-15 Gb/s, 15-20 Gb/s, or greater. According to some embodiments, compression of the virtual hard drives <b>320</b> or the virtual disk files <b>325</b> might be performed using the corresponding VM control file(s) <b>315</b> associated with the virtual hard drives <b>320</b> or the virtual disk files <b>325</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, and referring to the non-limiting example <b>300</b>&#x2032;, previously inactive VM's (such as inactive VM's <b>310</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, or the like), after becoming active (e.g., in response to receiving a request to use such previously inactive VM's, in response to receiving a request from a user to log into such previously inactive VM's, in response to a computing system spinning up or activating such previously inactive VM's, and/or the like), may be uncompressed by compression system <b>305</b>.

In the non-limiting example above regarding the virtual hard drive having an original size of 4 GB having been reduced in size to about 1.3 GB when the virtual disk files (e.g., .vmdk files) that are contained in the virtual hard drive were compressed using the techniques described herein, the compression system <b>305</b> might uncompress the virtual disk files (e.g., .vmdk files) back to their original size of 4 GB. When uncompressed, the VM, which contains the virtual hard drive whose virtual disk files (e.g., vmdk files) have been uncompressed back to their original size, may be executed normally without adverse effect(s) to the VM. In some instances, the compression system <b>305</b> might perform high-speed uncompression on the virtual hard drive <b>335</b> (specifically, on the virtual disk files or the .vmdk files <b>330</b>&#x2032;), in some cases, achieving a uncompression rate of 100-500 Mb/s, 500-1000 Mb/s, 1-15 Gb/s, 15-20 Gb/s, or greater. According to some embodiments, uncompression of the virtual hard drives <b>335</b> or the virtual disk files <b>330</b> might be performed using the corresponding VM control file(s) <b>340</b> associated with the virtual hard drives <b>335</b> or the virtual disk files <b>330</b>, thereby activating VM's <b>345</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In another non-limiting embodiment, most virtual machines in the inventory of a company might be virtual desktops.

A programmer might have written scripts to invoke the compression board to compress/uncompress the logical volumes during the shut down and initialization processes, respectively.

In this manner, the reduction in the overall storage requirements may be leveraged by 30-40%&#x2014;that is, leveraging a system that compresses virtual hard drives (i.e., the virtual disk files contained in the virtual hard drives) associated with VM's that are not currently in use (i.e., inactive), and only uncompresses virtual hard drives (i.e., the virtual disk files contained in the virtual hard drives) associated with VM's that are in use (or requested to be used).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>D</figref> (collectively, &#x201c;<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>&#x201d;) are flow diagrams illustrating a method <b>400</b> for implementing VM management using hardware compression, in accordance with various embodiments.
