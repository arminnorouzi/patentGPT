Existing magnetic resonance systems pose various challenges for clinicians intending to use MRI for interventional radiology. Access to the patient while the patient is positioned in the bore of the MR scanner is typically restricted by the geometry of both the table of the MR scanner on which the patient is positioned and the electronic interfaces intended to dock removable tables to the scanner.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">For example, such electronic interfaces of exemplary MR scanners are commonly located at floor level at the front of the scanner bore. The patient table contains a mating electrical connector allowing for the transmission of power and data, including signals from integrated coils located underneath the patient support of the table. As a result of the table geometry and electrical connection, the clinician may be forced to lean across the table to access the patient in the bore. In addition, as the desire for high quality images and higher strength magnets has risen, the length of the bore has increased. This means the patient is positioned comparatively deeper into the bore of the MR scanner, requiring the clinician to move even deeper into the bore to accomplish interventional procedures. Depending on the bore geometry and physical size of the clinician, it may not even be possible for the clinician to carry out his or her task.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Aside from being ergonomically awkward, this can pose risks to the clinician and patient, such as the entanglement in intravenous medication tubing (and subsequent inadvertent disruption of delivery of such medication), compression of vital structures of the patient, and hampering of the clinician's ability to perform both the procedure required as well as any emergency interventions that may be needed. Additionally, due to the singular nature of the electronic connection between the table and the scanner, access to the data from the MR machine or the associated integrated coils can also be restricted, limiting the ability to link in to monitors, data capture machines, or other equipment that would help the clinician better visualize the area of interest in real time.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">There are several aspects to the current invention: an accessory kit for use with an MR scanner and MR scanner table for use during interventional procedures, a method of appropriately utilizing the accessory kit, an MR Imaging system for access during interventional procedures, and a method of configuring an MR imaging system for access during interventional procedures.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, an accessory kit <b>100</b> is provided for use with an MR scanner <b>150</b> and an MR scanner table <b>152</b> during interventional procedures using magnetic resonance imaging. The accessory kit <b>100</b> includes a patient support <b>110</b> configured to be positioned on the MR scanner table <b>152</b> and having a surface extending between a proximal end <b>114</b> and a distal end <b>112</b> , wherein at least one recess <b>116</b> is defined in the patient support <b>110</b> and extends inwardly from a perimeter of the patient support <b>110</b> toward a central region of the patient support <b>110</b>, the at least one recess <b>116</b> being positioned at a distal end portion of the patient support <b>110</b> and adapted to at least partially receive a medical professional during interventional procedures. The accessory kit <b>100</b> also includes an electrical connection adapter <b>130</b> configured to be interposed between the MR scanner <b>150</b> and the MR scanner table <b>152</b>, thereby creating or extending a gap <b>142</b> between the MR scanner <b>150</b> and the MR scanner table <b>152</b> when the electrical connection adapter <b>130</b> is interposed between the MR scanner <b>150</b> and the MR scanner table <b>152</b>. The electrical connection adapter <b>130</b> has an external enclosure <b>140</b>; a proximal connector <b>132</b> positioned at a proximal end of the external enclosure <b>140</b>, the proximal connector <b>132</b> being configured to electrically couple the electrical connection adapter to a connector <b>134</b> of the MR scanner <b>150</b>; and a distal connector <b>136</b> positioned at a distal end of the external enclosure <b>140</b>, the distal connector <b>136</b> being configured to electrically couple the electrical connection adapter <b>130</b> to a connector <b>138</b> of the MR scanner table <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The at least one recess <b>116</b> of the accessory kit <b>100</b> can include at least one cutout <b>118</b> in at least one side of the patient support <b>110</b>. Also, the patient support <b>110</b> can include a structural spine <b>122</b>, wherein the structural spine <b>122</b> runs at least a portion of the length of the patient support <b>110</b> and has a thickness no less than the thickness of a proximal end portion of the patient support at the proximal end <b>112</b> of the patient support. The thickness of the structural spine <b>122</b> can increase in a longitudinal direction extending from the proximal end <b>112</b> to the distal end <b>114</b> of the patient support <b>110</b>. The at least one recess <b>116</b> can extend to the distal end <b>114</b> of the patient support <b>110</b> such that a width of the patient support <b>110</b> at the distal end <b>114</b> is narrower than a width of the patient support <b>110</b> at the proximal end <b>112</b>. The width of the distal end <b>112</b> of the patient support can be selected to be no greater than 10 cm. The patient support <b>110</b> can replace a surface of a conventional MR scanner table <b>152</b>. The patient support <b>110</b> can also include at least one filler plate <b>120</b> positionable to fill in the at least one recess <b>116</b>. The patient support <b>110</b> is preferably composed only of materials which are compatible with magnetic resonance imaging environments, and the patient support can be composed of non-ferromagnetic, non-conducting, and non-metallic composite materials.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The patient support <b>110</b> can include indicia configured to aid in alignment of a region of interest to an isocenter of the MR scanner. Also, the length of the gap <b>142</b> created or extended by the electrical connection adapter <b>130</b> is between 0.25 m and 1 m. The electrical connection adapter <b>130</b> can also include additional ports <b>144</b> for supplemental power and data output, the enclosure <b>140</b> of the electrical connection adapter <b>130</b> can be configured and positionable to permit a medical professional to kneel on its top <b>141</b> it, and the enclosure <b>140</b> of the electrical connection adapter <b>130</b> can also include ergonomic surfaces configured for enhancing comfort of the medical professional.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The gap <b>142</b> created or extended by the electrical connection adapter <b>130</b> and the at least one recess <b>116</b> are longitudinally co-located. For example, they can be co-located when the patient support <b>110</b> is positioned on the MR scanner table <b>152</b>, the electrical connection adapter <b>130</b> is interposed between the MR scanner <b>150</b> and the MR scanner table <b>152</b>, and the patient support <b>110</b> is moved relative to the MR scanner table <b>152</b> towards a bore of the MR scanner <b>150</b> and the proximal end <b>112</b> of the patient support <b>110</b> extends into the bore of the MR scanner <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring specifically to embodiments selected for illustration purposes, the accessory kit <b>100</b> comprises a patient support <b>110</b> and an electrical connection adapter <b>130</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the patient support <b>110</b> is configured to attach to the existing surface of the MR scanner table <b>152</b> and to fit within the bore of the MR scanner <b>150</b>. In another embodiment, the patient support <b>110</b> may instead replace the existing surface of the MR scanner table <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a preferred embodiment, the patient support is comprised of composite materials which are compatible with the magnetic resonance environment (e.g. materials which are non-conducting, non-ferromagnetic, and non-metallic). The patient support <b>110</b>, like existing table tops, may further comprise integrated MR coils or electrical connections intended to attach to MR coils. In a preferred embodiment, the patient support <b>110</b> may further comprise crosshairs or other surface markings at the point at which the isocenter of the MR scanner <b>150</b> will be located when the patient support <b>110</b> is fully extended into the bore of scanner <b>150</b>. This allows enhanced alignment of the area of interest of the patient during the interventional procedure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The patient support <b>110</b> has a first end, proximal to the scanner bore (the proximal end <b>112</b>) and a second end, distal to the scanner bore (the distal end <b>114</b>) and attached to the scanner table <b>152</b>. Provision is made at the distal end <b>114</b> of the patient support <b>110</b> to create at least one recess <b>116</b> to at least partially receive the body of a clinician.
