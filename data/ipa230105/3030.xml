In one example, a wood post bracket secures a wood post directly to the rim joist, to the reinforcing block, and to the substructure of the deck's wood framing system. The bracket thus allows the rim joist, reinforcing block, and deck framing to work together to reinforce the vertical wood post quickly and easily with a code compliant installation.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another example, a wood post bracket can be used to secure the base plate of a post mount to the deck's wood framing system, while also reinforcing the substructure and rim joist of the wood framing system.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As discussed above, one common style of decking system comprises vertically oriented posts that are supported by a wood substructure or framing system that includes joists. The posts are typically secured to the joists by fasteners (e.g., lag bolts or lag screws) which are drilled directly through the posts and joists, without any pre-drilled holes being formed in either the posts or the joists.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Current building codes require that outward movement of a post (i.e., movement in a direction away from the joist to which the post is secured) is not greater than a threshold. Conventionally, the outward movement of the post may be limited by securing a reinforcing block to the post, on the opposite side of the post from the joist. For instance, the fastener may be lagged through the joist, post, and reinforcing block, so that the post is held between the joist and the reinforcing block. However, building codes that are scheduled for implementation in the coming years not only further limit the permitted outward movement of the post, but also limit the permitted inward movement (i.e., movement in a direction toward the joist to which the post is secured) and lateral movement (i.e., sideways movement of the post along the joist to which the post is secured). Although a reinforcing block as described above may provide adequate protection against outward movement of a post, and may also provide some protection against inward movement, the reinforcing block does little to limit the lateral movement of the post. Thus, conventional methods of securing posts to joists are unlikely to ensure compliance with the expected changes in the building codes.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Examples of the present disclosure provide a bracket that may be installed on and under the rim joist of a decking system and a reinforcing block. The bracket includes a sleeve or pocket into which the post may be inserted, and includes apertures so that fasteners may be driven through the rim joist, sleeve, post, and reinforcing block. The bracket acts as a counter pivot to loads exerted on the post in all directions, so that outward, inward, and lateral movement of the post is minimized. The bracket allows the full width and height of the rim joist and the reinforcing block to work together as a counter balance, pushing and pulling in opposite directions to transfer and distribute pressures and loads directly to the deck substructure, as opposed to using just the width of the rim joist for structural reinforcement of the post.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an isometric view of one example of a bracket <b>100</b> according to the present disclosure. It should be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is not necessarily to scale (e.g., some dimensions may be exaggerated to better show the features of the bracket <b>100</b>). In one example, the bracket <b>100</b> is formed as a single, unitary piece fabricated from stamped metal. In other words, no fasteners are required to hold the different components or sections of the bracket <b>100</b> together.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As illustrated, the bracket <b>100</b> generally takes the form of an upside down &#x201c;T.&#x201d; Specifically, the bracket <b>100</b> comprises a planar base <b>102</b> having a generally rectangular shape.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">At the center of the base <b>102</b> is a hollow sleeve <b>104</b> that extends from the base <b>102</b> at approximately a ninety degree angle (i.e., perpendicular relative to the base <b>102</b>). The sleeve <b>104</b> may be sized and shaped to accommodate a wooden post, i.e., such that a wooden post can be inserted into the sleeve <b>104</b>. Thus, in one example, the sleeve <b>104</b> may comprise four sides arranged to form a rectangular tube (i.e., a tube having a rectangular cross section) whose dimensions are sized such that a 4 inch by 4 inch post can be held snugly within the hollow interior of the tube.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one example, two of the four sides of the sleeve <b>104</b> (i.e., two non-adjacent sides) each include a gap <b>112</b>, such that there are breaks in the perimeter of the sleeve's cross section. In this case, the sleeve <b>104</b> may appear to be formed in two halves that are spaced apart from each other, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Forming the gaps <b>112</b> in the two sides of the sleeve <b>104</b> may reduce the amount of material required to fabricate the bracket <b>100</b>. Alternatively or in addition, one or more of the sides of the sleeve <b>104</b> may include cutouts or windows cut into the planar surface of the side to further reduce material usage. However, in other examples, the sleeve <b>104</b> may be formed to have a continuous perimeter (e.g., without gaps or cutouts in any of the sides). In this case, the sleeve <b>104</b> may appear to be formed as a single, solid piece.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A first end <b>106</b> of the sleeve <b>104</b> is coupled directly to the base <b>102</b>, such that the first end <b>106</b> of the sleeve <b>104</b> is closed. However, a second end <b>108</b> of the sleeve <b>104</b> defines an opening <b>110</b> into which the post may be inserted, as described in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring back to the base <b>102</b>, the base <b>102</b> may further include a first end <b>114</b> and a second end <b>116</b>. The first end <b>114</b> and the second end <b>116</b> of the base <b>102</b> may be spaced equidistant from the sleeve <b>104</b> (e.g., such that the sleeve <b>104</b> is positioned midway between the first end <b>114</b> and the second end <b>116</b>). In one example, the first end <b>114</b> comprises a first flange <b>118</b> that extends from the base <b>102</b> at approximately a ninety degree angle (i.e., perpendicular relative to the base <b>102</b>, or parallel relative to the sleeve <b>104</b>). Similarly, the second end <b>116</b> may comprise a second flange <b>120</b> that extends from the base <b>102</b> at approximately a ninety degree angle (i.e., perpendicular relative to the base <b>102</b>, or parallel relative to the sleeve <b>104</b> and first flange <b>118</b>). The first flange <b>118</b> and the second flange <b>120</b> may extend from the base <b>102</b> in the same direction as the sleeve <b>104</b>. In one example, at least one of the first flange <b>118</b> and the second flange <b>120</b> may be hinged, e.g., such that the first flange <b>118</b> and the second flange <b>120</b> can rotate or bend to some degree around a respective bending axis <b>136</b> and <b>138</b>, where the bending axes <b>136</b> and <b>138</b> run substantially parallel to the first flange <b>118</b> and the second flange <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one example, the bracket <b>100</b> may further comprise a plurality of tabs <b>122</b> coupled to the perimeter of the second end <b>108</b> of the sleeve <b>104</b>. In one example, a tab <b>122</b> may extend from each corner of the second end <b>108</b> of the sleeve <b>104</b>, and the tabs <b>122</b> may be coupled to non-adjacent sides of the sleeve <b>104</b>. For instance, in one example, a first tab <b>122</b> and a second tab <b>122</b> may extend outward from the sleeve <b>104</b>, in a direction toward the first end <b>114</b> of the base <b>102</b>.

For instance, a lag screw may be inserted through each aperture of the first plurality of apertures <b>616</b> and the second plurality of apertures <b>620</b> and lagged into the wood of the first wood mounting block <b>700</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Optionally, a second wood mounting block <b>706</b> may also be inserted into the sleeve <b>604</b> of the wood post bracket <b>600</b> (e.g., following the direction of the arrow <b>630</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). However, in some examples, the sleeve <b>604</b> may be left empty (i.e., no wood mounting block may be inserted in the sleeve <b>604</b>). The second wood mounting block <b>706</b> may have the same dimensions as the first wood mounting block <b>700</b> (e.g., may comprise a 2&#x2033;&#xd7;6&#x2033; board).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, the wood post bracket <b>600</b> may next be positioned such that the lip <b>626</b> of the mounting plate <b>610</b> rests along the top of a third wood mounting block <b>708</b>. The third wood mounting <b>708</b> block may, in turn, be secured to a rim joist <b>710</b> of a wood deck framing system (e.g., similar to the wood frame <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>E</figref>).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As illustrated in <b>7</b>C, a post mount <b>712</b> may next be placed over the mounting plate <b>610</b> of the wood post bracket <b>600</b>. As discussed above, the post mount <b>712</b> may include a base plate <b>714</b> and a support pipe <b>716</b> extending upward from the base plate <b>714</b>. The base plate <b>714</b> may include a plurality of (e.g., four) apertures (not shown). The base plate <b>714</b> may be positioned such that each aperture in the base plate <b>714</b> is aligned with an aperture <b>622</b> of the third plurality of apertures <b>622</b> in the mounting plate <b>610</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The post mount <b>712</b> may be secured to the wood post bracket <b>600</b> (and, thus, secured to the wood deck framing system) by inserting a third plurality of fasteners (e.g., lag screws) <b>718</b> through the apertures in the base plate <b>714</b>, through the third plurality of apertures <b>622</b> of the mounting plate <b>610</b>, and into the first or third wood mounting block <b>700</b> or <b>708</b> (depending upon the locations of the apertures). For instance, a lag screw may be inserted through each aperture of the base plate <b>714</b> and the third plurality of apertures <b>622</b> and lagged into the wood of the first or third wood mounting block <b>700</b> or <b>708</b>. In one example, a decking surface material (i.e., the visible surface material of the deck structure, as opposed to the invisible, supporting substructure of framing) may be positioned between the mounting plate <b>610</b> of the wood post bracket <b>600</b> and the base plate <b>714</b> of the post mount <b>712</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref> illustrates the post mount <b>712</b> fully installed using the wood post bracket <b>600</b> to reinforce. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a top view of the fully installed post mount <b>712</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>D</figref>, using the wood post bracket <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> to reinforce. In other words, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> represents a top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> additionally shows how the rim joist <b>710</b>, first wood mounting block <b>700</b>, second wood mounting block <b>706</b>, and third wood mounting block <b>708</b> are arranged relative to other portions of a deck's wood framing system, namely, deck joists <b>720</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Thus, the wood post bracket <b>600</b> allows the full length of the rim joist <b>710</b> and the wood mounting blocks <b>700</b>, <b>706</b>, and <b>708</b> to work together to counter balance the top pull load on the post mount <b>712</b> in any direction. Specifically, the rim joist <b>710</b> and the wood mounting blocks <b>700</b>, <b>706</b>, and <b>708</b> push and pull in opposite directions to transfer and distribute pressures and loads directly to the deck sub structure, as opposed to using just the width of the rim joist <b>710</b> for structural reinforcement of the post mount <b>712</b>. Thus, the wood post bracket <b>400</b> provides a stable installation platform for the post mount <b>712</b> while also reinforcing the deck substructure.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Although various embodiments which incorporate the teachings of the present disclosure have been shown and described in detail herein, those skilled in the art can readily devise many other varied embodiments that still incorporate these teachings.
