communication.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Background Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Standards of a wireless local area network (LAN) technique are formulated by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)802.11 that is a wireless LAN technique standardization association, and standards of the wireless LAN technique include IEEE80.111/a/b/g/n/ac/ax.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In IEEE 802.11ax discussed in Patent Literature 1, high peak throughput of up to 9.6 Gbps and improvement in communication speed under a congested situation are realized by orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To further improve the throughput, the Task Group formulating the standard of IEEE 802.11be as a subsequent standard of IEEE 802.11ax is started.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventionally, an access point (AP) of IEEE 802.11 establishes connection with a station (STA) through a single frequency channel, and performs communication. In the IEEE 802.11be standard, a technique enabling one AP to establish connection with an STA through a plurality of frequency channels including a 2.4 GHz band, a 5 GHz band, and a 6 GHz band, and to perform communication is being studied.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the IEEE 802.11be standard, the technique enabling the AP to establish connection with the STA through the plurality of frequency channels and to perform communication is being studied; however, in a case where the AP transmits a Beacon frame through the plurality of frequency channels, a power consumption and a processing load are increased.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, transmission of the Beacon frame only through a representative frequency channel is being studied. However, for example, in a case where the AP establishes connection with a second communication apparatus through a second frequency channel while the AP transmits the Beacon frame only through a first frequency channel and communicates with a first communication apparatus, the second communication apparatus cannot receive the Beacon frame. When the second communication apparatus cannot receive the Beacon frame, for example, the second communication apparatus cannot acquire basic information for synchronization, and cannot take synchronization. In addition, in a case where the communication apparatus uses a power saving function, the communication apparatus cannot acquire the above-described basic information, and cannot know a timing when the communication apparatus returns from a power saving state.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0010"

A configuration described in the following exemplary embodiment is merely illustrative, and the present invention is not limited to the illustrated configuration.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a network configuration constructed by a communication apparatus <b>102</b> in the present exemplary embodiment. The communication apparatus <b>102</b> is an access point (AP) having a function of constructing a network <b>101</b>. The network <b>101</b> including the communication apparatus <b>102</b> and communication apparatuses <b>103</b> to <b>106</b> is illustrated. The communication apparatus <b>102</b> and the communication apparatuses <b>103</b> and <b>106</b> support the IEEE 802.11be standard, and can perform communication complying with the IEEE 802.11be standard through the network <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, the communication apparatuses <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, and <b>106</b> can establish connection through a plurality of frequency channels in a plurality of frequency bands, and can perform multi-link communication. The plurality of frequency bands indicates a sub-GHz band, a 2.4 GHz band, a 3.6 GHz band, a 4.9 GHz and 5 GHz band, a 60 GHz band, and a 6 GHz band. For example, the communication apparatus <b>102</b> can establish, with the communication apparatus <b>103</b>, connection through a first frequency channel in the 2.4 GHz band and connection through a second frequency channel in the 5 GHz band, and can perform communication through both connections. In this case, the communication apparatus <b>102</b> maintains the connection through the second frequency channel in parallel with the connection through the first frequency channel. Further, the established connection may be called link. In addition, the communication apparatus <b>102</b> may establish not connections in different frequency bands but a plurality of connections through different frequency channels in the same frequency band.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, the communication apparatuses <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, and <b>106</b> can perform communication by using band widths of 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, 160 MHz, and 320 MHz.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In contrast, each of the communication apparatuses <b>104</b> and <b>105</b> does not support the multi-kink communication (hereinafter, referred to as multi-link communication non-supporting apparatus). The multi-link communication non-supporting apparatus may be a communication apparatus supporting IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax standards, or a communication apparatus supporting IEEE 802.11be standard but not supporting the multi-link communication.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the present exemplary embodiment, each of the communication apparatuses <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, and <b>106</b> includes one or more wireless local area network (LAN) control units.
