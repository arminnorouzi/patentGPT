The applications of this phenomenon are numerous, but it has proven particularly advantageous for treating wounds. Regardless of the etiology of a wound, whether trauma, surgery, or another cause, proper care of the wound is important to the outcome. Treatment of wounds or other tissue with reduced pressure may be commonly referred to as &#x201c;negative-pressure therapy,&#x201d; but is also known by other names, including &#x201c;negative-pressure wound therapy,&#x201d; &#x201c;reduced-pressure therapy,&#x201d; &#x201c;vacuum therapy,&#x201d; &#x201c;vacuum-assisted closure,&#x201d; and &#x201c;topical negative-pressure,&#x201d; for example. Negative-pressure therapy may provide a number of benefits, including migration of epithelial and subcutaneous tissues, improved blood flow, and micro-deformation of tissue at a wound site. Together, these benefits can increase development of granulation tissue and reduce healing times.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is also widespread acceptance that cleansing a tissue site can be highly beneficial for new tissue growth. For example, a wound or a cavity can be washed out with a liquid solution for therapeutic purposes. These practices are commonly referred to as &#x201c;irrigation&#x201d; and &#x201c;lavage&#x201d; respectively. &#x201c;Instillation&#x201d; is another practice that generally refers to a process of slowly introducing fluid to a tissue site and leaving the fluid for a prescribed period of time before removing the fluid. For example, instillation of topical treatment solutions over a wound bed can be combined with negative-pressure therapy to further promote wound healing by loosening soluble contaminants in a wound bed and removing infectious material. As a result, soluble bacterial burden can be decreased, contaminants removed, and the wound cleansed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While the clinical benefits of negative-pressure therapy and/or instillation therapy are widely known, improvements to therapy systems, components, and processes may benefit healthcare providers and patients.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">New and useful systems, apparatuses, and methods for treating tissue in a negative-pressure therapy environment are set forth in the appended claims. Illustrative embodiments are also provided to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, in some embodiments, a dressing for treating tissue may be a composite of dressing layers, including a contact layer, a manifold layer, and an adhesive drape. The contact layer may include a perforated polymer film in some embodiments. The manifold layer may include a manifold having one or more of strips of spacer fabric in or coupled to the manifold in some examples. The manifold may include an open-cell foam in some examples. The one or more strips of spacer fabric may be inlaid partially or fully transverse in the manifold. In some examples, the one or more strips of spacer fabric may extend parallel across the manifold. In other examples, the one or more strips of spacer fabric may extend in one or more angles across the manifold. The strips of spacer fabric may allow for controlled contraction of the dressing in a manner that is tunable. In some embodiments, the dressing may be coupled to the patient such that the strips of spacer fabric may be oriented parallel to a tissue site, such as a linear wound. A negative pressure may be applied to the manifold layer and the strips of spacer fabric may promote medial or lateral contraction of the dressing to pull the linear wound closed. The lateral contraction of the dressing provided by the strips of spacer fabric may be propagated to tissue underlying the linear wound, reducing the chance of dehiscence and drawing the wound or edges of an incision together. Embodiments of the dressing may allow for a reduction in healing complications and promote healing of the tissue site. In some embodiments, the strips of spacer fabric may allow for preferential contraction in certain areas of the dressing to allow the dressing to conform around specific geometries or anatomies.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">More generally, some embodiments of a dressing may include a manifold and a spacer fabric. The manifold may have a first side configured to face the tissue site, a second side opposite the first side, a thickness between the first side and the second side, a first portion, and a second portion. The spacer fabric may extend between the first portion and the second portion and may comprise a first layer coupled to the first portion, a second layer coupled to the second portion, and a spacer layer extending between the first layer and the second layer. The first layer and the second layer may be perpendicular to the first side of the manifold.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some embodiments of a dressing may include a manifold having a first side configured to face a tissue site, a second side opposite the first side, and a thickness between the first side and the second side. The dressing may further include a channel extending into the manifold on the second side and having a depth measured from the second side. A spacer fabric may be disposed in the channel, wherein the spacer fabric may comprise a first layer, a second layer, and a spacer layer extending between the first layer and the second layer. The first layer and the second layer may be perpendicular to the first side of the manifold.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other embodiments of a dressing for treating a tissue site with negative pressure may include a tissue interface comprising two or more strips of spacer fabric and a manifold between each strip of spacer fabric. In some embodiments, the two or more strips of spacer fabric may be at an angle relative to one another. In some embodiments, the two or more strips of spacer fabric may be configured to bias against contraction of the manifold parallel to the strips of spacer fabric.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet other embodiments of a dressing for use in treating a tissue site with negative pressure may comprise a manifold and a connective structure. The manifold may have a first side configured to face the tissue site, a second side opposite the first side, a thickness between the first side and the second side, a first portion, and a second portion. The connective structure may be coupled to the first portion and the second portion and may extend in an extension direction across the manifold. The dressing may be configured to anisotropically contract such that the dressing may be configured to contract more in a first direction than in a second direction, wherein the first direction is perpendicular to the extension direction of the connective structure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A system for treating a tissue site with negative pressure is also described herein, wherein some embodiments of the system may comprise a dressing, a fluid conductor configured to be fluidly coupled to the dressing, and a negative-pressure source configured to be fluidly coupled to the fluid conductor. The dressing may comprise a manifold, a spacer fabric, and a cover. The manifold may have a first side configured to face the tissue site, a second side opposite the first side, a thickness between the first side and the second side, a first portion, and a second portion. The spacer fabric may extend between the first portion and the second portion and may comprise a first layer coupled to the first portion, a second layer coupled to the second portion, and a spacer layer extending between the first layer and the second layer. The first layer and the second layer may be perpendicular to the first side of the manifold. The cover may be configured to be disposed over the manifold and the spacer fabric.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A method for treating a tissue site with negative pressure is also described herein, wherein some example embodiments include applying a tissue interface to the tissue site, covering the tissue interface with a cover to form a sealed space containing the tissue interface, fluidly coupling a fluid conductor to the tissue interface, fluidly coupling the fluid conductor to a negative-pressure source, and applying negative pressure from the negative-pressure source to the tissue interface through fluid conductor. The tissue interface may comprise a manifold and a spacer fabric. The manifold may have a first side configured to face the tissue site, a second side opposite the first side, a thickness between the first side and the second side, a first portion, and a second portion. The spacer fabric may extend between the first portion and the second portion and may comprise a first layer coupled to the first portion, a second layer coupled to the second portion, and a spacer layer extending between the first layer and the second layer. The first layer and the second layer may be perpendicular to the first side of the manifold. The method may further comprise contracting the tissue interface in response to an application of negative pressure to the tissue interface, wherein the tissue interface is configured to anisotropically contract such that the tissue interface is configured to contract more in a first direction than in a second direction, wherein the first direction is perpendicular to an extension direction of the spacer fabric.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Other objectives, advantages, and a preferred mode of making and using the claimed subject matter may be understood best by reference to the accompanying drawings in conjunction with the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example embodiment of a therapy system that can provide negative-pressure treatment and instillation treatment in accordance with this specification;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded view of an example of a tissue interface that can be associated with some embodiments of the therapy system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a top view of an example layer that can be associated with some embodiments of the tissue interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a top detail view taken at reference <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a side view of the layer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a side detail view taken at reference <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an exploded view of another example layer that can be associated with some embodiments of the tissue interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a side detail view of the layer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a top view of another example layer that can be associated with some embodiments of the tissue interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a top view of another example layer that can be associated with some embodiments of the tissue interface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a side view of the layer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an isometric view, with a portion shown in cross-section, of a linear wound; and</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an isometric view, with a portion shown in cross-section, of a portion of an example embodiment of a therapy system being deployed over a linear wound.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The following description of example embodiments provides information that enables a person skilled in the art to make and use the subject matter set forth in the appended claims, but it may omit certain details already well-known in the art. The following detailed description is, therefore, to be taken as illustrative and not limiting.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example embodiment of a therapy system <b>100</b> that can provide negative-pressure therapy with instillation of topical treatment solutions to a tissue site in accordance with this specification.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The term &#x201c;tissue site&#x201d; in this context broadly refers to a wound, defect, or other treatment target located on or within tissue, including but not limited to, a surface wound, bone tissue, adipose tissue, muscle tissue, neural tissue, dermal tissue, vascular tissue, connective tissue, cartilage, tendons, or ligaments. The term &#x201c;tissue site&#x201d; may also refer to areas of any tissue that are not necessarily wounded or defective, but are instead areas in which it may be desirable to add or promote the growth of additional tissue. For example, negative pressure may be applied to a tissue site to grow additional tissue that may be harvested and transplanted. A surface wound, as used herein, is a wound on a body that is exposed to the external environment, such as an injury or damage to the epidermis, dermis, and/or subcutaneous layers. Surface wounds may include ulcers or closed incisions, for example. A surface wound, as used herein, does not include wounds within an intra-abdominal cavity. A wound may include chronic, acute, traumatic, subacute, and dehisced wounds, partial-thickness burns, ulcers (such as diabetic, pressure, or venous insufficiency ulcers), flaps, and grafts, for example.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The therapy system <b>100</b> may include a source or supply of negative pressure, such as a negative-pressure source <b>105</b>, and one or more distribution components. A distribution component is preferably detachable and may be disposable, reusable, or recyclable. A dressing, such as a dressing <b>110</b>, and a fluid container, such as a container <b>115</b>, are examples of distribution components that may be associated with some examples of the therapy system <b>100</b>. As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the dressing <b>110</b> may comprise or consist essentially of a tissue interface <b>120</b>, a cover <b>125</b>, or both in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A fluid conductor is another illustrative example of a distribution component. A &#x201c;fluid conductor,&#x201d; in this context, broadly includes a tube, pipe, hose, conduit, or other structure with one or more lumina or open pathways adapted to convey a fluid between two ends. Typically, a tube is an elongated, cylindrical structure with some flexibility, but the geometry and rigidity may vary. Moreover, some fluid conductors may be molded into or otherwise integrally combined with other components. Distribution components may also include or comprise interfaces or fluid ports to facilitate coupling and de-coupling other components. In some embodiments, for example, a dressing interface may facilitate coupling a fluid conductor to the dressing <b>110</b>. For example, such a dressing interface may be a SENSAT.R.A.C.&#x2122; Pad available from Kinetic Concepts, Inc. of San Antonio, Tex.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The therapy system <b>100</b> may also include a regulator or controller, such as a controller <b>130</b>. Additionally, the therapy system <b>100</b> may include sensors to measure operating parameters and provide feedback signals to the controller <b>130</b> indicative of the operating parameters. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for example, the therapy system <b>100</b> may include a first sensor <b>135</b> and a second sensor <b>140</b> coupled to the controller <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The therapy system <b>100</b> may also include a source of instillation solution. For example, a solution source <b>145</b> may be fluidly coupled to the dressing <b>110</b>, as illustrated in the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The solution source <b>145</b> may be fluidly coupled to a positive-pressure source, such as a positive-pressure source <b>150</b>, a negative-pressure source such as the negative-pressure source <b>105</b>, or both in some embodiments. A regulator, such as an instillation regulator <b>155</b>, may also be fluidly coupled to the solution source <b>145</b> and the dressing <b>110</b> to ensure proper dosage of instillation solution (e.g. saline) to a tissue site. For example, the instillation regulator <b>155</b> may comprise a piston that can be pneumatically actuated by the negative-pressure source <b>105</b> to draw instillation solution from the solution source during a negative-pressure interval and to instill the solution to a dressing during a venting interval. Additionally or alternatively, the controller <b>130</b> may be coupled to the negative-pressure source <b>105</b>, the positive-pressure source <b>150</b>, or both, to control dosage of instillation solution to a tissue site. In some embodiments, the instillation regulator <b>155</b> may also be fluidly coupled to the negative-pressure source <b>105</b> through the dressing <b>110</b>, as illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Some components of the therapy system <b>100</b> may be housed within or used in conjunction with other components, such as sensors, processing units, alarm indicators, memory, databases, software, display devices, or user interfaces that further facilitate therapy. For example, in some embodiments, the negative-pressure source <b>105</b> may be combined with the controller <b>130</b>, the solution source <b>145</b>, and other components into a therapy unit.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In general, components of the therapy system <b>100</b> may be coupled directly or indirectly. For example, the negative-pressure source <b>105</b> may be directly coupled to the container <b>115</b> and may be indirectly coupled to the dressing <b>110</b> through the container <b>115</b>. Coupling may include fluid, mechanical, thermal, electrical, or chemical coupling (such as a chemical bond), or some combination of coupling in some contexts. For example, the negative-pressure source <b>105</b> may be electrically coupled to the controller <b>130</b> and may be fluidly coupled to one or more distribution components to provide a fluid path to a tissue site. In some embodiments, components may also be coupled by virtue of physical proximity, being integral to a single structure, or being formed from the same piece of material.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A negative-pressure supply, such as the negative-pressure source <b>105</b>, may be a reservoir of air at a negative pressure or may be a manual or electrically-powered device, such as a vacuum pump, a suction pump, a wall suction port available at many healthcare facilities, or a micro-pump, for example. &#x201c;Negative pressure&#x201d; generally refers to a pressure less than a local ambient pressure, such as the ambient pressure in a local environment external to a sealed therapeutic environment. In many cases, the local ambient pressure may also be the atmospheric pressure at which a tissue site is located. Alternatively, the pressure may be less than a hydrostatic pressure associated with tissue at the tissue site. Unless otherwise indicated, values of pressure stated herein are gauge pressures. References to increases in negative pressure typically refer to a decrease in absolute pressure, while decreases in negative pressure typically refer to an increase in absolute pressure. While the amount and nature of negative pressure provided by the negative-pressure source <b>105</b> may vary according to therapeutic requirements, the pressure is generally a low vacuum, also commonly referred to as a rough vacuum, between &#x2212;5 mm Hg (&#x2212;667 Pa) and &#x2212;500 mm Hg (&#x2212;66.7 kPa). Common therapeutic ranges are between &#x2212;50 mm Hg (&#x2212;6.7 kPa) and &#x2212;300 mm Hg (&#x2212;39.9 kPa).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The container <b>115</b> is representative of a container, canister, pouch, or other storage component, which can be used to manage exudates and other fluids withdrawn from a tissue site. In many environments, a rigid container may be preferred or required for collecting, storing, and disposing of fluids. In other environments, fluids may be properly disposed of without rigid container storage, and a re-usable container could reduce waste and costs associated with negative-pressure therapy.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A controller, such as the controller <b>130</b>, may be a microprocessor or computer programmed to operate one or more components of the therapy system <b>100</b>, such as the negative-pressure source <b>105</b>. In some embodiments, for example, the controller <b>130</b> may be a microcontroller, which generally comprises an integrated circuit containing a processor core and a memory programmed to directly or indirectly control one or more operating parameters of the therapy system <b>100</b>. Operating parameters may include the power applied to the negative-pressure source <b>105</b>, the pressure generated by the negative-pressure source <b>105</b>, or the pressure distributed to the tissue interface <b>120</b>, for example. The controller <b>130</b> is also preferably configured to receive one or more input signals, such as a feedback signal, and programmed to modify one or more operating parameters based on the input signals.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Sensors, such as the first sensor <b>135</b> and the second sensor <b>140</b>, are generally known in the art as any apparatus operable to detect or measure a physical phenomenon or property, and generally provide a signal indicative of the phenomenon or property that is detected or measured. For example, the first sensor <b>135</b> and the second sensor <b>140</b> may be configured to measure one or more operating parameters of the therapy system <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the first sensor <b>135</b> may be a transducer configured to measure pressure in a pneumatic pathway and convert the measurement to a signal indicative of the pressure measured. In some embodiments, for example, the first sensor <b>135</b> may be a piezo-resistive strain gauge. The second sensor <b>140</b> may optionally measure operating parameters of the negative-pressure source <b>105</b>, such as a voltage or current, in some embodiments. Preferably, the signals from the first sensor <b>135</b> and the second sensor <b>140</b> are suitable as an input signal to the controller <b>130</b>, but some signal conditioning may be appropriate in some embodiments. For example, the signal may need to be filtered or amplified before it can be processed by the controller <b>130</b>. Typically, the signal is an electrical signal, but may be represented in other forms, such as an optical signal.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The tissue interface <b>120</b> can be generally adapted to partially or fully contact a tissue site. The tissue interface <b>120</b> may take many forms, and may have many sizes, shapes, or thicknesses, depending on a variety of factors, such as the type of treatment being implemented or the nature and size of a tissue site. For example, the size and shape of the tissue interface <b>120</b> may be adapted to the contours of deep and irregular shaped tissue sites. Any or all of the surfaces of the tissue interface <b>120</b> may have an uneven, coarse, or jagged profile.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the tissue interface <b>120</b> may comprise or consist essentially of a manifold. A manifold in this context may comprise or consist essentially of a means for collecting or distributing fluid across the tissue interface <b>120</b> under pressure. For example, a manifold may be adapted to receive negative pressure from a source and distribute negative pressure through multiple apertures across the tissue interface <b>120</b>, which may have the effect of collecting fluid from across a tissue site and drawing the fluid toward the source. In some embodiments, the fluid path may be reversed or a secondary fluid path may be provided to facilitate delivering fluid, such as fluid from a source of instillation solution, across a tissue site.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the cover <b>125</b> may provide a bacterial barrier and protection from physical trauma. The cover <b>125</b> may also be constructed from a material that can reduce evaporative losses and provide a fluid seal between two components or two environments, such as between a therapeutic environment and a local external environment. The cover <b>125</b> may comprise or consist of, for example, an elastomeric film or membrane that can provide a seal adequate to maintain a negative pressure at a tissue site for a given negative-pressure source. The cover <b>125</b> may have a high moisture-vapor transmission rate (MVTR) in some applications. For example, the MVTR may be at least 250 grams per square meter per twenty-four hours in some embodiments, measured using an upright cup technique according to ASTM E96/E96M Upright Cup Method at 38&#xb0; C. and 10% relative humidity (RH). In some embodiments, an MVTR up to 5,000 grams per square meter per twenty-four hours may provide effective breathability and mechanical properties.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some example embodiments, the cover <b>125</b> may be a polymer drape, such as a polyurethane film, that is permeable to water vapor but impermeable to liquid. Such drapes typically have a thickness in the range of 25-50 microns. For permeable materials, the permeability generally should be low enough that a desired negative pressure may be maintained. The cover <b>125</b> may comprise, for example, one or more of the following materials: polyurethane (PU), such as hydrophilic polyurethane; cellulosics; hydrophilic polyamides; polyvinyl alcohol; polyvinyl pyrrolidone; hydrophilic acrylics; silicones, such as hydrophilic silicone elastomers; natural rubbers; polyisoprene; styrene butadiene rubber; chloroprene rubber; polybutadiene; nitrile rubber; butyl rubber; ethylene propylene rubber; ethylene propylene diene monomer; chlorosulfonated polyethylene; polysulfide rubber; ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA); co-polyester; and polyether block polyamide copolymers. Such materials are commercially available as, for example, Tegaderm&#xae; drape, commercially available from 3M Company, Minneapolis Minnesota; polyurethane (PU) drape; polyether block polyamide copolymer (PEBAX), for example; and INSPIRE 2301 and INSPIRE 2327 polyurethane films, commercially available from Expopack Advanced Coatings, Wrexham, United Kingdom. In some embodiments, the cover 125 may comprise INSPIRE 2301 having an MVTR (upright cup technique) of 2600 g/m<sup>2</sup>/24 hours and a thickness of about 30 microns.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">An attachment device may be used to attach the cover <b>125</b> to an attachment surface, such as undamaged epidermis, a gasket, or another cover. The attachment device may take many forms. For example, an attachment device may be a medically-acceptable, pressure-sensitive adhesive configured to bond the cover <b>125</b> to epidermis around a tissue site. In some embodiments, for example, some or all of the cover <b>125</b> may be coated with an adhesive, such as an acrylic adhesive, which may have a coating weight of about 25-65 grams per square meter (g.s.m.). Thicker adhesives, or combinations of adhesives, may be applied in some embodiments to improve the seal and reduce leaks. Other example embodiments of an attachment device may include a double-sided tape, paste, hydrocolloid, hydrogel, silicone gel, or organogel.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The solution source <b>145</b> may also be representative of a container, canister, pouch, bag, or other storage component, which can provide a solution for instillation therapy. Compositions of solutions may vary according to a prescribed therapy, but examples of solutions that may be suitable for some prescriptions include hypochlorite-based solutions, silver nitrate (0.5%), sulfur-based solutions, biguanides, cationic solutions, and isotonic solutions.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In operation, the tissue interface <b>120</b> may be placed within, over, on, or otherwise proximate to a tissue site. If the tissue site is a wound, for example, the tissue interface <b>120</b> may partially or completely fill the wound, or it may be placed over the wound. The cover <b>125</b> may be placed over the tissue interface <b>120</b> and sealed to an attachment surface near a tissue site. For example, the cover <b>125</b> may be sealed to undamaged epidermis peripheral to a tissue site. Thus, the dressing <b>110</b> can provide a sealed therapeutic environment proximate to a tissue site, substantially isolated from the external environment, and the negative-pressure source <b>105</b> can reduce pressure in the sealed therapeutic environment.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The fluid mechanics of using a negative-pressure source to reduce pressure in another component or location, such as within a sealed therapeutic environment, can be mathematically complex. However, the basic principles of fluid mechanics applicable to negative-pressure therapy and instillation are generally well-known to those skilled in the art, and the process of reducing pressure may be described illustratively herein as &#x201c;delivering,&#x201d; &#x201c;distributing,&#x201d; or &#x201c;generating&#x201d; negative pressure, for example.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In general, exudate and other fluid flow toward lower pressure along a fluid path. Thus, the term &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; may refer to a location in a fluid path relatively closer to a source of negative pressure or further away from a source of positive pressure. Conversely, the term &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; may refer to a location further away from a source of negative pressure or closer to a source of positive pressure. Similarly, it may be convenient to describe certain features in terms of fluid &#x201c;inlet&#x201d; or &#x201c;outlet&#x201d; in such a frame of reference. This orientation is generally presumed for purposes of describing various features and components herein. However, the fluid path may also be reversed in some applications, such as by substituting a positive-pressure source for a negative-pressure source.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Negative pressure applied across the tissue site through the tissue interface <b>120</b> in the sealed therapeutic environment can induce macro-strain and micro-strain in the tissue site. Negative pressure can also remove exudate and other fluid from a tissue site, which can be collected in container <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, the controller <b>130</b> may receive and process data from one or more sensors, such as the first sensor <b>135</b>. The controller <b>130</b> may also control the operation of one or more components of the therapy system <b>100</b> to manage the pressure delivered to the tissue interface <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, controller <b>130</b> may include an input for receiving a desired target pressure and may be programmed for processing data relating to the setting and inputting of the target pressure to be applied to the tissue interface <b>120</b>. In some example embodiments, the target pressure may be a fixed pressure value set by an operator as the target negative pressure desired for therapy at a tissue site and then provided as input to the controller <b>130</b>. The target pressure may vary from tissue site to tissue site based on the type of tissue forming a tissue site, the type of injury or wound (if any), the medical condition of the patient, and the preference of the attending physician. After selecting a desired target pressure, the controller <b>130</b> can operate the negative-pressure source <b>105</b> in one or more control modes based on the target pressure and may receive feedback from one or more sensors to maintain the target pressure at the tissue interface <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, the controller <b>130</b> may have a continuous pressure mode, in which the negative-pressure source <b>105</b> is operated to provide a constant target negative pressure for the duration of treatment or until manually deactivated. Additionally or alternatively, the controller may have an intermittent pressure mode. For example, the controller <b>130</b> can operate the negative-pressure source <b>105</b> to cycle between a target pressure and atmospheric pressure. For example, the target pressure may be set at a value of 135 mmHg for a specified period of time (e.g., 5 min), followed by a specified period of time (e.g., 2 min) of deactivation. The cycle can be repeated by activating the negative-pressure source <b>105</b>, which can form a square wave pattern between the target pressure and atmospheric pressure.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some example embodiments, the increase in negative-pressure from ambient pressure to the target pressure may not be instantaneous. For example, the negative-pressure source <b>105</b> and the dressing <b>110</b> may have an initial rise time. The initial rise time may vary depending on the type of dressing and therapy equipment being used. For example, some therapy systems may increase negative pressure at a rate of about 20-30 mmHg/second, and other therapy systems may increase negative pressure at a rate of about 5-10 mmHg/second. If the therapy system <b>100</b> is operating in an intermittent mode, the repeating rise time may be a value substantially equal to the initial rise time.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some example dynamic pressure control modes, the target pressure can vary with time. For example, the target pressure may vary in the form of a triangular waveform, varying between a negative pressure of 50 and 135 mmHg with a rise rate of negative pressure set at a rate of 25 mmHg/min. and a descent rate set at 25 mmHg/min. In other embodiments of the therapy system <b>100</b>, the triangular waveform may vary between negative pressure of 25 and 135 mmHg with a rise rate of about 30 mmHg/min and a descent rate set at about 30 mmHg/min.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the controller <b>130</b> may control or determine a variable target pressure in a dynamic pressure mode, and the variable target pressure may vary between a maximum and minimum pressure value that may be set as an input prescribed by an operator as the range of desired negative pressure. The variable target pressure may also be processed and controlled by the controller <b>130</b>, which can vary the target pressure according to a predetermined waveform, such as a triangular waveform, a sine waveform, or a saw-tooth waveform. In some embodiments, the waveform may be set by an operator as the predetermined or time-varying negative pressure desired for therapy.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the controller <b>130</b> may receive and process data, such as data related to instillation solution provided to the tissue interface <b>120</b>. Such data may include the type of instillation solution prescribed by a clinician, the volume of fluid or solution to be instilled to a tissue site (&#x201c;fill volume&#x201d;), and the amount of time prescribed for leaving solution at a tissue site (&#x201c;dwell time&#x201d;) before applying a negative pressure to the tissue site. The fill volume may be, for example, between 10 and 500 mL, and the dwell time may be between one second to 30 minutes. The controller <b>130</b> may also control the operation of one or more components of the therapy system <b>100</b> to instill solution. For example, the controller <b>130</b> may manage fluid distributed from the solution source <b>145</b> to the tissue interface <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, fluid may be instilled to a tissue site by applying a negative pressure from the negative-pressure source <b>105</b> to reduce the pressure at the tissue site, drawing solution into the tissue interface <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, solution may be instilled to a tissue site by applying a positive pressure from the positive-pressure source <b>150</b> to move solution from the solution source <b>145</b> to the tissue interface <b>120</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the solution source <b>145</b> may be elevated to a height sufficient to allow gravity to move solution into the tissue interface <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The controller <b>130</b> may also control the fluid dynamics of instillation by providing a continuous flow of solution or an intermittent flow of solution. Negative pressure may be applied to provide either continuous flow or intermittent flow of solution. The application of negative pressure may be implemented to provide a continuous pressure mode of operation to achieve a continuous flow rate of instillation solution through the tissue interface <b>120</b>, or it may be implemented to provide a dynamic pressure mode of operation to vary the flow rate of instillation solution through the tissue interface <b>120</b>. Alternatively, the application of negative pressure may be implemented to provide an intermittent mode of operation to allow instillation solution to dwell at the tissue interface <b>120</b>. In an intermittent mode, a specific fill volume and dwell time may be provided depending, for example, on the type of tissue site being treated and the type of dressing being utilized. After or during instillation of solution, negative-pressure treatment may be applied. The controller <b>130</b> may be utilized to select a mode of operation and the duration of the negative pressure treatment before commencing another instillation cycle.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded view of an example of the tissue interface <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, illustrating additional details that may be associated with some embodiments in which the tissue interface <b>120</b> comprises more than one layer. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the tissue interface comprises a first layer, such as a contact layer <b>205</b>, and a second layer, such as a manifold layer <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, the contact layer <b>205</b> may be disposed adjacent to the manifold layer <b>210</b>. For example, the contact layer <b>205</b> and the manifold layer <b>210</b> may be stacked so that the contact layer <b>205</b> is in contact with the manifold layer <b>210</b>. The contact layer <b>205</b> may also be heat-bonded or adhered to the manifold layer <b>210</b> in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the contact layer <b>205</b> optionally includes a low-tack adhesive, which can be configured to hold the tissue interface <b>120</b> in place while the cover <b>125</b> is applied. The low-tack adhesive may be continuously coated on the contact layer <b>205</b> or applied in a pattern.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The contact layer <b>205</b> may comprise or consist essentially of a means for controlling or managing fluid flow. In some embodiments, the contact layer <b>205</b> may be a fluid control layer comprising or consisting essentially of a liquid-impermeable, elastomeric material. For example, the contact layer <b>205</b> may comprise or consist essentially of a polymer film, such as a polyurethane film. In some embodiments, the contact layer <b>205</b> may comprise or consist essentially of the same material as the cover <b>125</b>. The contact layer <b>205</b> may also have a smooth or matte surface texture in some embodiments. A glossy or shiny finish finer or equal to a grade B3 according to the SPI (Society of the Plastics Industry) standards may be particularly advantageous for some applications. In some embodiments, variations in surface height may be limited to acceptable tolerances. For example, the surface of the contact layer <b>205</b> may have a substantially flat surface, with height variations limited to 0.2 millimeters over a centimeter.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, the contact layer <b>205</b> may be hydrophobic. The hydrophobicity of the contact layer <b>205</b> may vary, but may have a contact angle with water of at least ninety degrees in some embodiments. In some embodiments the contact layer <b>205</b> may have a contact angle with water of no more than 150 degrees. For example, in some embodiments, the contact angle of the contact layer <b>205</b> may be in a range of at least 90 degrees to about 120 degrees, or in a range of at least 120 degrees to 150 degrees. Water contact angles can be measured using any standard apparatus. Although manual goniometers can be used to visually approximate contact angles, contact angle measuring instruments can often include an integrated system involving a level stage, liquid dropper such as a syringe, camera, and software designed to calculate contact angles more accurately and precisely, among other things. Non-limiting examples of such integrated systems may include the FT&#x212b;125, FT&#x212b;200, FT&#x212b;2000, and FT&#x212b;4000 systems, all commercially available from First Ten Angstroms, Inc., of Portsmouth, Va., and the DTA25, DTA30, and DTA100 systems, all commercially available from Kruss GmbH of Hamburg, Germany. Unless otherwise specified, water contact angles herein are measured using deionized and distilled water on a level sample surface for a sessile drop added from a height of no more than 5 cm in air at 20-25&#xb0; C. and 20-50% relative humidity. Contact angles herein represent averages of 5-9 measured values, discarding both the highest and lowest measured values. The hydrophobicity of the contact layer <b>205</b> may be further enhanced with a hydrophobic coating of other materials, such as silicones and fluorocarbons, either as coated from a liquid, or plasma coated.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The contact layer <b>205</b> may also be suitable for welding to other layers, including the manifold layer <b>210</b>. For example, the contact layer <b>205</b> may be adapted for welding to polyurethane foams using heat, radio frequency (RF) welding, or other methods to generate heat such as ultrasonic welding. RF welding may be particularly suitable for more polar materials, such as polyurethane, polyamides, polyesters and acrylates. Sacrificial polar interfaces may be used to facilitate RF welding of less polar film materials, such as polyethylene.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The area density of the contact layer <b>205</b> may vary according to a prescribed therapy or application. In some embodiments, an area density of less than 40 grams per square meter may be suitable, and an area density of about 20-30 grams per square meter may be particularly advantageous for some applications.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, for example, the contact layer <b>205</b> may comprise or consist essentially of a hydrophobic polymer, such as a polyethylene film. The simple and inert structure of polyethylene can provide a surface that interacts little, if any, with biological tissues and fluids, providing a surface that may encourage the free flow of liquids and low adherence, which can be particularly advantageous for many applications. Other suitable polymeric films include polyurethanes, acrylics, polyolefin (such as cyclic olefin copolymers), polyacetates, polyamides, polyesters, copolyesters, PEBAX block copolymers, thermoplastic elastomers, thermoplastic vulcanizates, polyethers, polyvinyl alcohols, polypropylene, polymethylpentene, polycarbonate, styreneics, silicones, fluoropolymers, and acetates. A thickness between 20 microns and 100 microns may be suitable for many applications. Films may be clear, colored, or printed. More polar films suitable for laminating to a polyethylene film include polyamide, co-polyesters, ionomers, and acrylics. To aid in the bond between a polyethylene and polar film, tie layers may be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, or modified polyurethanes. An ethyl methyl acrylate (EMA) film may also have suitable hydrophobic and welding properties for some configurations.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The contact layer <b>205</b> may have one or more passages, which can be distributed uniformly or randomly across the contact layer <b>205</b>. The passages may be bi-directional and pressure-responsive. For example, each of the passages generally may comprise or consist essentially of an elastic passage that is normally unstrained to substantially reduce liquid flow, and can expand or open in response to a pressure gradient. As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the passages may comprise or consist essentially of perforations <b>215</b> in the contact layer <b>205</b>. Perforations <b>215</b> may be formed by removing material from the contact layer <b>205</b>. For example, perforations <b>215</b> may be formed by cutting through the contact layer <b>205</b>. In the absence of a pressure gradient across the perforations <b>215</b>, the perforations <b>215</b> may be sufficiently small to form a seal or fluid restriction, which can substantially reduce or prevent liquid flow. Additionally, or alternatively, one or more of the passages may be or may function as an elastomeric valve that is normally closed when unstrained to substantially prevent liquid flow, and can open in response to a pressure gradient. In some examples, the passages may comprise or consist essentially of fenestrations in the contact layer <b>205</b>. Generally, fenestrations are a species of perforation, and may also be formed by removing material from the contact layer <b>205</b>. The amount of material removed and the resulting dimensions of the fenestrations may be up to an order of magnitude less than perforations.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, the perforations <b>215</b> may be formed as slots (or fenestrations formed as slits) in the contact layer <b>205</b>. In some examples, the perforations <b>215</b> may comprise or consist of linear slots having a length less than 4 millimeters and a width less than 1 millimeter. The length may be at least 2 millimeters, and the width may be at least 0.4 millimeters in some embodiments. A length of about 3 millimeters and a width of about 0.8 millimeters may be particularly suitable for many applications, and a tolerance of about 0.1 millimeter may also be acceptable. Such dimensions and tolerances may be achieved with a laser cutter, for example. Slots of such configurations may function as imperfect elastomeric valves that can substantially reduce liquid flow in a normally closed or resting state. For example, such slots may form a flow restriction without being completely closed or sealed. The slots can expand or open wider in response to a pressure gradient to allow increased liquid flow.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The manifold layer <b>210</b> generally comprises or consists essentially of a manifold <b>220</b> and one or more strips of spacer fabric <b>225</b> coupled to the manifold <b>220</b>. The manifold <b>220</b> can provide a means for collecting or distributing fluid across the tissue interface <b>120</b> under pressure. For example, the manifold <b>220</b> may be adapted to receive negative pressure from a source and distribute negative pressure through multiple apertures across the tissue interface <b>120</b>, which may have the effect of collecting fluid from across a tissue site and drawing the fluid toward the source.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a closure device <b>910</b>, such as, for example, stitches <b>915</b>, close the linear wound <b>905</b>. Other closure devices <b>910</b>, such as epoxy or staples may be utilized to close the linear wound <b>905</b>. The linear wound <b>905</b> may include a portion through an epidermis <b>920</b>, dermis <b>925</b>, and subcutaneous tissue <b>930</b> of a patient.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, after the linear wound <b>905</b> is closed or prepared as described above, the dressing <b>110</b> may be disposed proximate to the linear wound <b>905</b>. The geometry and dimensions of the tissue interface <b>120</b>, the cover <b>125</b>, or both may vary to suit a particular application or anatomy. For example, the dressing <b>110</b> may be cut to size for a specific region or anatomical area, such as for amputations. The dressing <b>110</b> may be cut without losing pieces of the tissue interface <b>120</b> and without separation of the tissue interface <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The tissue interface <b>120</b> can be placed over, on, or otherwise proximate to the linear wound <b>905</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the contact layer <b>205</b> forms an outer surface of the dressing <b>110</b>, and can be placed over the tissue site, including the linear wound <b>905</b> and epidermis <b>920</b>. The contact layer <b>205</b> may be interposed between the manifold layer <b>210</b> and the tissue site, which can prevent direct contact between the manifold layer <b>210</b> and the linear wound <b>905</b> and epidermis <b>920</b>. In some embodiments, the strips of spacer fabric <b>225</b> are oriented substantially parallel to the linear wound <b>905</b>. For example, the extension direction D<sub>E </sub>of the one or more strips of spacer fabric <b>225</b> may be substantially parallel to the linear wound <b>905</b>. In some embodiments, the tissue interface <b>120</b> may be placed on the tissue site, such that the linear wound <b>905</b> is between two strips of spacer fabric <b>225</b>.

In some embodiments, one or more of the attachment devices may comprise or consist essentially of an adhesive <b>1005</b>. In some examples the adhesive <b>1005</b> may be, for example, a medically-acceptable, pressure-sensitive adhesive that extends about a periphery, a portion, or an entire surface of each of the cover <b>125</b>. In some embodiments, for example, the adhesive <b>1005</b> may be an acrylic adhesive having a coating weight between 25-65 grams per square meter (g.s.m.). Thicker adhesives, or combinations of adhesives, may be applied in some embodiments to improve the seal and reduce leaks. In some embodiments, such a layer of the adhesive <b>1005</b> may be continuous or discontinuous. Discontinuities in the adhesive <b>1005</b> may be provided by apertures or holes (not shown) in the adhesive <b>1005</b>. The apertures or holes in the adhesive <b>1005</b> may be formed after application of the adhesive <b>1005</b> or by coating the adhesive <b>1005</b> in patterns on a carrier layer, such as, for example, a side of the cover <b>125</b>.

In some embodiments, the adhesive <b>1005</b> can be disposed only around edges of the cover <b>125</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> also illustrates one example of a fluid conductor <b>1010</b> and a dressing interface <b>1015</b>. As shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the fluid conductor <b>1010</b> may be a flexible tube, which can be fluidly coupled on one end to the dressing interface <b>1015</b>. The dressing interface <b>1015</b> may be an elbow connector. In some examples, the tissue interface <b>120</b> can be applied to the tissue site before the cover <b>125</b> is applied over the tissue interface <b>120</b>. The cover <b>125</b> may include an aperture <b>1020</b>, or the aperture <b>1020</b> may be cut into the cover <b>125</b> before or after positioning the cover <b>125</b> over the tissue interface <b>120</b>. The position of the aperture <b>1020</b> may be off-center or adjacent to an end or edge of the cover <b>125</b>. In other examples, the aperture <b>1020</b> may be centrally disposed. The dressing interface <b>1015</b> can be placed over the aperture <b>1020</b> to provide a fluid path between the fluid conductor <b>1010</b> and the tissue interface <b>120</b>. In other examples, the fluid conductor <b>1010</b> may be inserted directly through the cover <b>125</b> into the tissue interface <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">If not already configured, the dressing interface <b>1015</b> may be disposed over the aperture <b>1020</b> and attached to the cover <b>125</b>. The fluid conductor <b>1010</b> may be fluidly coupled to the dressing interface <b>1015</b> and to the negative-pressure source <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Negative pressure from the negative-pressure source <b>105</b> can be distributed through the fluid conductor <b>1010</b> and the dressing interface <b>1015</b> to the tissue interface <b>120</b>. The tissue interface <b>120</b> may contract in response to the application of negative pressure. In some embodiments, the manifold layer <b>210</b> of the tissue interface <b>120</b> is configured to anisotropically contract. For example, under an applied negative pressure, the manifold layer <b>210</b> may contract more in a first direction <b>1025</b> than in a second direction <b>1030</b>. The first direction <b>1025</b> may be perpendicular to the extension direction D<sub>E </sub>of the one or more strips of spacer fabric <b>225</b>. The preferential contraction along the first direction <b>1025</b> by the manifold layer <b>210</b> acts to pull the epidermis <b>920</b> toward the linear wound <b>905</b> aiding in closing the linear wound <b>905</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The contact layer <b>205</b> can protect the epidermis <b>920</b> from irritation that could be caused by expansion, contraction, or other movement of the manifold layer <b>210</b>. The contact layer <b>205</b> can also substantially reduce or prevent exposure of a tissue site to the manifold layer <b>210</b>, which can inhibit growth of tissue into the manifold layer <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Although the strips of spacer fabric <b>225</b> are shown oriented parallel to the linear wound <b>905</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, it will be understood that in some embodiments, a tissue interface <b>120</b> may be applied to a tissue site wherein the one or more strips of spacer fabric <b>225</b> are oriented at an angle with respect to the linear wound <b>905</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the tissue interface <b>120</b> may be tuned to preferentially contract along the extension direction D<sub>E </sub>of the one or more strips of spacer fabric <b>225</b> by modifying the material properties of the spacer fabric <b>225</b> and/or the manifold <b>220</b>. In such embodiments, the strips of spacer fabric <b>225</b> may be oriented perpendicular to the linear wound <b>905</b> to aid in closure of the linear wound <b>905</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The systems, apparatuses, and methods described herein may provide significant advantages over prior dressings. For example, closure of the linear wound <b>905</b> may be promoted by orienting the strips of spacer fabric <b>225</b> parallel to the linear wound <b>905</b> when the dressing <b>110</b> is applied to the tissue site. Contraction of the manifold layer <b>210</b> more in a first direction, perpendicular to the linear wound <b>905</b>, may be propagated by the manifold layer <b>210</b> and the cover <b>125</b> to the epidermis <b>920</b>, dermis <b>925</b>, and the subcutaneous tissue <b>930</b>. The anisotropic contraction provided by the spacer fabric may reduce the chance for dehiscence and aids in drawing the edges of the linear wound <b>905</b> together.
