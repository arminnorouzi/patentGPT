The QCL information may include at least one of information (RS related information) that relates to an RS that is in a QCL relation, and information (QCL type information) that indicates a QCL type. The RS related information may include information such as an RS index (e.g., an SSB index or a Non-Zero-Power CSI-RS (NZP CSI-RS) resource Identifier (ID)), an index of a cell in which the RS is arranged, and an index of a Bandwidth Part (BWP) in which the RS is arranged.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0042">According to Rel. 15 NR, both of an RS of the QCL type A and an RS of the QCL type D or only the RS of the QCL type A may be configured as a TCI state of at least one of a PDCCH and a PDSCH to the UE.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0043">In a case where a TRS is configured as the RS of the QCL type A, the TRS is unlike a DeModulation Reference Signal (DMRS) of the PDCCH or the PDSCH, and the same TRS is periodically transmitted over a long period of time.

The information may be information (e.g., TCI field presence information, intra-DCI presence information or a higher layer parameter TCI-PresentInDCI) that indicates whether the TCI field is present or absent in the DCI. The information may be configured to the UE by, for example, the higher layer signaling.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0056">In a case where TCI states of more than 8 types are configured to the UE, the TCI states of 8 types or less may be activated (or indicated) by using an MAC CE. The MAC CE may be referred to as a TCI States Activation/Deactivation for a UE-specific PDSCH MAC CE. The value of the TCI field in the DCI may indicate one of the TCI states activated by the MAC CE.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0057">In a case where the TCI field presence information that is set as &#x201c;enabled&#x201d; is configured to a CORESET for scheduling a PDSCH (a CORESET used to transmit a PDCCH for scheduling a PDSCH) for the UE, the UE may assume that a TCI field is present in the DCI format 1_1 of the PDCCH transmitted on the CORESET.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0058">In a case where the TCI field presence information is not configured to the CORESET for scheduling the PDSCH, or the PDSCH is scheduled by the DCI format 1_0, and in a case where a time offset between reception of DL DCI (DCI for scheduling the PDSCH) and reception of a PDSCH associated with the DCI is a threshold or more, the UE may assume that a TCI state or a QCL assumption for the PDSCH is identical to a TCI state or a QCL assumption applied to the CORESET used to transmit a PDCCH for scheduling the PDSCH to determine QCL of a PDSCH antenna port.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0059">In a case where the TCI field presence information is set as &#x201c;enabled&#x201d;, and in a case where a TCI field in DCI in a Component Carrier (CC) for scheduling (PDSCH) indicates an activated TCI state in the CC to be scheduled or a DL BWP, and the PDSCH is scheduled by the DCI format 1_1, the UE may use a TCI that conforms to a value of a TCI field in a detected PDCCH including DCI to determine QCL of the PDSCH antenna port. In a case where a time offset between reception of DL DCI (for scheduling the PDSCH) and reception of a PDSCH associated with the DCI (the PDSCH scheduled by the DCI) is a threshold or more, the UE may assume that a DM-RS port of a PDSCH of a serving cell is quasi-co-located with an RS in a TCI state related to a QCL type parameter given by an indicated TCI state.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0060">In a case where a single slot PDSCH is configured to the UE, the indicated TCI state may be based on an activated TCI state in a slot including a scheduled PDSCH.
