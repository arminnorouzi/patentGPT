FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates generally to a flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) and an electronic device including the same.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An FPCB may be used as a medium for transmitting electrical signals to various electronic components of an electronic device. Because an FPCB for a board-to-board or component-to-component (or board) connection may be at least partially bent, it is possible to reduce space constraints for disposing the various components in the electronic device and operatively connecting the various components to each other.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, a hot bar method may be used to bond an FPCB to another printed circuit board (PCB). The hot bar method bonds the FPCB to the PCB by placing a pad portion of the FPCB (e.g., a portion where conductive pads are formed and bonded to the PCB) on the PCB, and then pressurizing and heating the FPCB using a hot bar.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a hot bar process, positioning the pad portion of the FPCB on the PCB may require very high precision. To this end, alignment marks may be defined in and formed on the pad portion of the FPCB and the PCB, respectively.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An alignment mark in the pad portion of the FPCB may be formed to be substantially transparent or semi-transparent by removing some of layer(s) of the FPCB, or may be formed to allow transmission like a through hole via.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An alignment mark of the PCB may be formed as a copper foil layer having a specified shape (e.g., a square). The pad portion of the FPCB may be accurately positioned on the PCB by identifying the alignment mark of the PCB located below the alignment mark formed on the pad portion of the FPCB, through the alignment mark formed on the pad portion of the FPCB.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, because an FPCB has a limited wiring density, the FPCB may have a limit in connecting electronic components having a large number of terminals requiring electrical connections to each other within a limited mounting space.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To address such a problem, a rigid FPCB (RFPCB), which includes a rigid portion having mechanical strength and a flexible portion that may extend from the rigid portion and be at least partially bent, may be used. Because the RFPCB may be formed of a plurality of layers to have a high wiring density, and may have the flexible portion that may be bent, the RFPCB may contribute to high integration of electronic components and miniaturization of an electronic device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, alignment is still required to bond conductive pads disposed in a rigid portion of the RFPCB with conductive pads of a PCB, and it may be difficult to define an alignment mark in the rigid portion of the RFPCB. Because the rigid portion of the RFPCB includes a structure in which a plurality of layers are stacked, even when some of the layers are removed, it may be difficult for the rigid portion to have a transmittance required to identify an alignment mark of the PCB below the RFPCB. In addition, because wiring lines constituting a circuit pattern of the RFPCB are often three-dimensionally connected to the pads in the rigid portion, it may be difficult to define a through hole via that allows the identification of the PCB alignment mark, without interfering with paths to be routed with the pads.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, an aspect of the disclosure is to provide an RFPCB including a plurality of layers with a way for identifying a position alignment with a PCB, and an electronic device including the same.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an aspect of the disclosure, an RFPCB is provided, with which it is possible to identify a position alignment with a PCB while having a high wiring density by being formed in multiple layers.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another aspect of the disclosure, position alignment with a PCB may be identified through an alignment mark defined in a protrusion extending from a rigid portion of an RFPCB.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another aspect of the disclosure, through a multi-layered RFPCB including an area for identifying a position with respect to a PCB, a defect rate in bonding the RFPCB to the PCB may be reduced while reducing constraints of space required to operatively connect electronic components to each other.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, an electronic device is provided, which includes a PCB including a first alignment mark formed on a first surface of the PCB, and a RFPCB including a plurality of layers, a rigid portion disposed on the first surface of the PCB, a flexible portion extending from the rigid portion, and a first protrusion formed as one of the plurality of layers protruding and extending from the rigid portion. A second alignment mark corresponding to the first alignment mark of the PCB is defined in the first protrusion. The first protrusion overlaps at least partially with the first alignment mark of the PCB.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure, an RFPCB is provided, which includes a plurality of layers bonded to a PCB, a rigid portion disposed on a first surface of the PCB, a flexible portion extending from the rigid portion, and a first protrusion formed as one of a plurality of layers protruding and extending from the rigid portion.
