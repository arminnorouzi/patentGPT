Pedicle screws are typically available in different length and diameter and are used for a wide variety of indications such as open conventional surgery and minimally invasive spinal surgery. Typically, a longitudinal member is fastened to two or more vertebral anchors with the help of set screws or others similar fasteners on either side of the spine. Occasionally, the height of the screws inserted in to the vertebrae does not match up, particularly if more than two screws are inserted on each side. Uneven height of the head of the pedicle screw makes it harder for installation of the longitudinal member. If such a situation is encountered, the surgeon typically addresses it by utilization of reduction tools or a washer to raise the height of the pedicle screw. Occasionally, a previously inserted pedicle screw may need to be backed out a few turns such that the longitudinal member may be well seated inside the tulip of the pedicle screw. These manures can be tedious and time consuming. Loss of fixation is also a concern if a screw has to be backed out for alignment purposes. In minimally invasive cases, height alignment of the screws is even more critical because of limited access to the hardware.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It will be advantageous to have adjustable height pedicle screws, which allow elongation or shortening such that some of the aforementioned difficulties encountered during spinal instrumentation can be mitigated.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Most current designs of pedicle screws have a fixed height of the head of the screw in relation to the screw shaft. Intraoperative height adjustment is sometimes necessary for anchoring the longitudinal members, particularly in patients requiring multi-segmental fixation. Most surgeons tend to either utilize washers or back out the pedicle screws when there is a height mismatch. Backing out the screws may compromise the quality of fixation. Additionally, it is difficult to adjust the height of the pedicle screw during minimally invasive spinal surgery with currently available devices. Finally, it may be also be advantageous to further adjust the height of the pedicle screws after placement of the longitudinal member but before final tightening of the construct.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Described herein is a variable height pedicle screw that may be utilized during spinal surgery. The overall length of the pedicle screw can be lengthened or shortened.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also, several methods of accomplishing elongation or shortening of the rod are described. The lower threaded stationary portion of the screw mounted on the vertebra is coupled with a variable height upper portion of the pedicle screw. Incremental elongation is achieved by means of a helical ramp. A combination of features such as a variable height ramp, pressure distribution ramp and a positive ratchet locator may be utilized, as disclosed in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Alternatively, a height adjusting sleeve is utilized in another embodiment, which engages with left hand and right hand external mounting threads of the stationary lower and variable upper components. By rotating the height adjusting sleeve, incremental elongation of the pedicle screw is accomplished.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another embodiment, the variable height upper portion may telescope into the stationary threaded lower portion to accomplish overall shortening of the pedicle screw. The pedicle screw head design may be fixed or polyaxial. One or more lugs may be utilized to facilitate forced rotation and height adjustment of the pedicle screw.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, in several situations where the longitudinal member is well seated within the head, it may be advantageous to alter the height of the vertebral anchors after rod installation. One example of such a situation would be further reduction of residual deformity in patients with spondylolisthesis after hardware installation, whereby the height of the distal vertebral pedicle screw can be elongated, forcing further improvement in vertebral alignment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another instance during scoliosis surgery, residual rotational deformity is frequently left after installation of hardware. By elongating the height of the pedicle screw on the convex side of the deformity after hardware installation, the surgeon would be able to achieve further derotation. In a similar manner, a vertebral height could be shortened on the concave side of the deformity. In this setting, the pedicle screws are pulled towards the longitudinal member by collapsing the screw height, thus enabling further rotatory correction.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In particular embodiments, the pedicle screw includes: a longitudinal screw portion; and, an adjustable height component that is capable of being co-axially and adjustable affixed to the longitudinal screw portion, and that is capable of being axially adjusted intraoperatively with respect to the longitudinal screw portion.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In certain embodiments, the height of the adjustable height component is capable of being adjusted intraoperatively before or after installation of the longitudinal screw portion.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In certain embodiments, the adjustable height screw component includes an internally threaded portion capable of accepting a polyaxial screw or a monoaxial screw.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In certain embodiments, the polyaxial screw or monoaxial is configured for accepting a rod compression screw.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In certain embodiments, the height adjustable component has at least one positive ratchet locator for incremental height adjustment.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In certain embodiments, the pedicle screw further includes a variable height engagement ramp.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In certain embodiments, the variable height component ramp is positioned at an end of the longitudinal screw portion that is adjacent to the adjustable height component.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In certain embodiments, the variable height component ramp is at an end of the adjustable height component that is adjacent to the longitudinal screw portion.
