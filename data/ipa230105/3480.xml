To mitigate this issue, the AR-15 features a selectively employable cover to protect the large ejection port opening when it is not being fired. The standard ejection port cover assembly is composed of a stamped steel cover plate, rod, C-clip and torsion spring. While these parts come assembled onto a complete weapon from the factory, those assembling their own weapon or looking to upgrade their weapon with aftermarket parts may experience difficulties during removal or installation. Additionally, the standard cover can experience some performance issues depending on tolerances, abuse and environmental debris. Prior to the addition of the forward assist mechanism, the rod that mounts the cover could simply be pushed out the rear once the C-clip is removed. Depending on tolerancing, sometimes that is not possible with modern upper receivers that include this common feature. If disassembly from the front is required, the barrel assembly must be removed which requires specialized tools. Additional issues arise from the C-clip itself which is used to retain the rod. This part is especially small, can be difficult to handle for installation/removal and can be dislodged and easily lost during use. The torsion spring that powers the cover can sometimes cause issues if it is out-of-tolerance or tolerance stack issues arise. This can allow the short spring arm that normally sits against the receiver to slip past it. When this happens, the cover loses its spring pressure and then flops around when it is in the open position. Installation of the cover also requires pre-loading of the spring, which can be troublesome as the spring is small and difficult to manipulate without a tool. In most cases, this pre-loading has to be performed while also installing a detent or rod. Removal of the dust cover sometimes involves compression of this small spring, which may only be possible via a fingernail or a tool (e.g., see UTG Quick Install Dust Cover by LEAPERS). The steel cover plate typically works well but as a thin metal stamping, it can sustain detrimental deformation in use which can affect how well it remains closed and how well it functions to seal the ejection port. Finally, the detent mechanism that retains the cover in the closed position is permanently installed into the steel cover plate. While this is not typically a problem, it can make a detailed cleaning difficult if grit gets into the system and painting or refinishing the plate would have to be done in the &#x201c;as assembled&#x201d; state for those trying to upgrade the weapon.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following presents a simplified summary relating to one or more aspects and/or embodiments disclosed herein. As such, the following summary should not be considered an extensive overview relating to all contemplated aspects and/or embodiments, nor should the following summary be regarded to identify key or critical elements relating to all contemplated aspects and/or embodiments or to delineate the scope associated with any particular aspect and/or embodiment. Accordingly, the following summary has the sole purpose to present certain concepts relating to one or more aspects and/or embodiments relating to the mechanisms disclosed herein in a simplified form to precede the detailed description presented below.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some embodiments of the disclosure may be characterized as an ejection port cover assembly including an ejection port cover, a fixed pin, a spring-loaded pin, a user interface surface, and a torsion spring. The fixed pin can be configured to rotate within a first hinge opening of a firearm receiver portion. The spring-loaded pin can be configured to rotate within and selectively engage with a second hinge opening of the firearm receiver portion. The user interface surface can extend radially outward from the spring-loaded pin. The torsion spring can be configured to apply a torsional bias to the user interface surface and to bias the spring-loaded pin away from the fixed pin along a common axis, and wherein when installed on the firearm receiver portion, the torsion spring in combination with the user interface surface biases the ejection port cover toward an open position.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other embodiments of the disclosure may also be characterized as a firearm including a receiver portion and an ejection port cover, the cover including a fixed pin and a spring-loaded pin. The receiver portion can include an ejection port, a first hinged opening, and a second hinged opening. The first hinged opening is at a first end of the ejection port and the second hinged opening is at a second end of the ejection port, such that the hinged openings bookend the ejection port. The fixed pin selectively mates with the first hinged opening and the spring-loaded pin selectively mates with the second hinge opening. The spring-loaded pin is configured for removal from the second hinge opening while the fixed pin is mated with the first hinge opening, thereby enabling tool-less removal of the ejection port cover from the receiver portion.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other embodiment of the disclosure may further be characterized as a firearm ejection port cover assembly including an ejection port cover, a fixed pin, a spring-loaded pin, a spring, and a pin extension. The fixed pin can be configured for selective mating with a first hinge opening of a firearm receiver portion. The spring-loaded pin can be configured for selective mating with a second hinge opening of the firearm receiver portion, wherein the spring-loaded pin is configured for removal from the second hinge opening while the fixed pin is mated with the first hinge opening, thereby enabling tool-less removal of the ejection port cover from the firearm receiver portion. The spring can be engaged with the spring-loaded pin, for instance, being wrapped around the spring-loaded pin. The pin extension can extend from the spring-loaded pin engaged with the spring and configured to (1) bias the ejection port cover into an open position and (2) be used in removing the spring-loaded pin from the second hinge opening.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various objects and advantages and a more complete understanding of the present disclosure are apparent and more readily appreciated by referring to the following detailed description and to the appended claims when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of an exterior of an ejection port cover;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an interior of the ejection port cover of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an exploded view of the interior of the ejection port cover of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a flag of a spring-loaded pin being rotated;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the flag of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> being used to compress a spring for removal or insertion of the ejection port cover;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a profile view of the flag and spring of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an ejection port cover as it would be seen from within a firearm receiver when installed;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates details of a spring-loaded pin;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an end view of the spring-loaded pin of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates a top view of the spring-loaded pin of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates a receiver with hinge openings;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates a method of tool less installation of an ejection port cover according to an embodiment of this disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates a method of tool less removal of an ejection port cover according to an embodiment of this disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present disclosure relates generally to an ejection port cover.

As compared to the default and detached position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, one can see that the flag <b>116</b> is rotated about 180 from the default position when installed on a firearm and in the closed position, and this coils the spring <b>118</b> to generate an opening force on the ejection port cover <b>101</b>. Moving between the open and closed positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>7</b></figref> can occur via rotation about an axis <b>106</b> that passes through two pins <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. When affixed to a firearm, these two pins <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> are largely unseen as they fit into hinge openings such as <b>1102</b> and <b>1104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. The axis <b>106</b> is offset from a plane aligned with and coincident with an interior surface <b>112</b> of the ejection port cover <b>101</b>. An outer surface <b>114</b> is arranged opposite to the interior surface <b>112</b>. A first of the two pins can be a spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> and a second of the two pins can be a fixed pin <b>104</b>. While the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> is arranged toward a front of the firearm, in other embodiments, the spring-loaded pin can be arranged toward the rear of the firearm and the fixed pin can be arranged toward the front of the firearm. The spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> can be arranged through two apertures <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> on an inside (facing out of the page in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of the ejection port cover <b>101</b>. The spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> is biased by the spring <b>118</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) toward an extended position (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), or toward a front of the firearm, but a user can push the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> rearward and compress the spring <b>118</b> such that the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> is withdrawn from and clears a hinge opening in the receiver such that the ejection port cover assembly <b>100</b> can be removed or installed. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> show close ups of the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> in a rearward position that would allow tool-less removal or installation of the ejection port cover.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The flag <b>116</b> may be a unique structure from the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b>, or may be fixed thereto, or formed as a homogenous unit with the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b>. As a result, the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> may or may not rotate with rotation of the flag <b>116</b>. More importantly, is the interfacing between the flag <b>116</b> and the spring <b>118</b>, wherein rotation of the flag <b>116</b> causes rotation of part of the spring <b>118</b> such that torsional energy is stored in the spring <b>118</b>. More specifically, one end of the spring <b>118</b> can be fixed to the cover, for instance, via a straight portion <b>136</b> arranged in an elongated depression <b>134</b> (see detail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), and the opposing end can be fixed to the flag <b>116</b>. When the ejection port cover assembly <b>100</b> is attached to a firearm, a backside of the flag <b>116</b> (the side going into the page in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) presses against the receiver, and as the ejection port cover <b>101</b> is rotated from the open position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> toward the closed position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b> or <b>7</b></figref>, the flag <b>116</b> remains pressed against the receiver while the spring rotates and stores energy. This energy enables the ejection port cover to quickly rotate open when released from the closed position.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the illustrated embodiment, the flag <b>116</b> interfaces with the spring <b>118</b> to enhance the user's ability to interface with and move the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> toward a rear of the firearm. The flag <b>116</b> may be arranged within a notch <b>120</b> such that the flag <b>116</b> cannot be moved rearward unless the flag <b>116</b> is rotated sufficiently to clear a rear edge <b>122</b> of the notch <b>120</b>. This is typically performed while the ejection port assembly <b>100</b> is in an open position. The flag's <b>116</b> interface with the notch <b>120</b> helps prevent accidental removal of the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> when the ejection port cover <b>101</b> is in the open position. The spring <b>118</b> not only provides a linear bias on the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b>, but also provides a torsional bias rotating the flag <b>116</b> toward a position where it is arranged within the notch <b>120</b>. In other words, the spring <b>118</b> tends to keep the pin <b>102</b> in a position where it cannot easily be moved rearward due to the flag's <b>116</b> seating within the notch <b>120</b>. Only via user rotation of the flag <b>116</b> against the torsional bias of the spring <b>118</b> can the flag <b>116</b> be rotated into a position where the user can then pull the flag <b>116</b> rearward and disengage the end of the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> from the corresponding hinge opening (e.g., <b>1102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) in the receiver. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the flag <b>116</b> rotated sufficiently to allow rearward movement of the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. One can see that the flag <b>116</b> has rotated sufficiently to clear the rear edge <b>122</b> of the notch <b>120</b> and that it could be rotated further while still allowing the pin <b>102</b> to be pulled rearward. This linear compression of the spring <b>118</b> biases the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> toward a front of the firearm or an extended position, and if the user does not continue to move the flag <b>116</b> backward, the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> will move into the extended or forward position where it extends into the corresponding hinge opening in the firearm receiver. In some embodiments, the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> can include a portion near the flag <b>116</b> with a wider radius than a portion toward the fixed pin <b>104</b>. The transition between these two portions <b>146</b> can include a sharp edge <b>146</b> between the two portions and this edge <b>146</b> can interface with the spring <b>118</b> and compress the spring <b>118</b> when the flag <b>116</b> is moved rearward.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an embodiment, a rib <b>124</b> can be arranged as a stop for the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> such that it cannot be excessively moved toward a rear of the firearm and potentially exit the aperture <b>108</b>. The length of the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> can be such that removal (intentional or unintentional) of the pin <b>102</b> from the apertures <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> is very difficult if not impossible. In other words, the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> can be longer than a gap or dimension between facing surfaces of the rib <b>124</b> and the rib <b>128</b>. Said another way, the length of the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> is such that when the pin <b>102</b> is moved fully rearward and impinges on the rib <b>124</b>, the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> is still long enough to remain at least partially within the aperture <b>108</b>, and thus unable to be easily removed from the ejection port cover <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> being rotated to a position where it can be moved rearward and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> show a next step in the removal or installation process, where the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> is moving rearward having cleared the rear edge <b>122</b> of the notch <b>120</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> is in a fully-rearward position with a rear end impinged upon and stopped by the rib <b>124</b>. As seen, even in this fully-rearward position, a front end of the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> is still inside and mated with the aperture <b>108</b>, thereby preventing the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> from easily being removed from the ejection port cover assembly <b>100</b>. As seen, the apertures, <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>, can be arranged within two ribs <b>128</b> and <b>126</b>, respectively, of a plurality of ribs arranged along a length of the ejection port cover assembly <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The spring <b>118</b> not only biases the pin <b>102</b> into an extended position, and biases the flag <b>116</b> into a position where the pin <b>102</b> cannot be withdrawn, but also biases the ejection port cover <b>101</b> toward an open position (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Traditional ejection port covers also include a torsion spring for this purpose, but do not utilize this spring for the three-way-purpose of (1) biasing the ejection port cover toward an open position, (2) biasing a flag, and also (3) biasing a spring-loaded pin. This disclosure not only allows easier and tool-less installation and removal of the ejection port cover assembly <b>100</b>, as well as an easy-to-access flag <b>116</b> that is restricted from rearward movement until the flag <b>116</b> is rotated sufficiently to clear the notch <b>120</b>, but does so without the addition of a secondary spring. Instead, the same torsion spring that biases the ejection port cover toward the open position during firing, also biases the spring-loaded pin into an extended position and biases the flag into a locked position in the notch. Accordingly, the spring is referred to as a tool-less tri-way spring.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the ejection port cover <b>100</b> is installed and rotated to a closed position, the flag <b>116</b> is pressed against the receiver and winds the spring <b>118</b> as the ejection port cover <b>100</b> is closed. A flag indentation <b>132</b> is arranged adjacent to and rearward of the rib <b>128</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. This flag indentation <b>132</b> can be shaped like the flag <b>116</b> with slightly larger inner dimensions such that the flag <b>116</b> can nestle into the flag indentation <b>132</b> when the ejection port cover <b>101</b> is in a close position. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> for an example of the ejection port cover <b>100</b> in the closed position and at least a portion of the flag <b>116</b> nestled in the flag indentation <b>132</b>. The receiver is hidden from view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> to better allow visibility of the ejection port cover assembly <b>100</b> components when the ejection port cover <b>100</b> is in the closed position. This not only makes for a more compact design, but also creates a natural lock on the flag <b>116</b> to prevent the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> from being driven toward a rear of the firearm when the ejection port cover <b>100</b> is closed. In other words, the flag indentation <b>132</b> prevents rearward movement of the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> and the flag <b>116</b> when the ejection port cover <b>101</b> is in the closed position, and the notch <b>120</b> prevents rearward movement of the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> and the flag <b>116</b> when the ejection port cover <b>101</b> is in the open position.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The spring <b>118</b> has a coiled shape and wraps around a middle section <b>130</b> of the pin <b>102</b>. At a rear end of the spring <b>118</b>, the spring <b>118</b> straightens and extends tangentially from the pin <b>102</b> (and perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the pin <b>102</b>) and into an elongated depression <b>134</b> that holds the straight portion <b>136</b> of the spring. This straight portion <b>136</b> can be referred to as a first straight portion <b>136</b>. At the front end of the spring, the spring <b>118</b> straightens in a direction roughly parallel to a longitudinal axis of the pin (in practice this second straight <b>138</b> section can be slightly angled relative to the longitudinal axis of the pin <b>102</b>, for instance to help secure the second straight section <b>138</b> to the flag <b>116</b>). The second straight section <b>138</b> is seated within a flag notch <b>140</b> in a portion of the flag <b>116</b> where a base of the flag <b>116</b> meets the pin <b>102</b>. The spring <b>118</b> can be arranged entirely on the inside <b>112</b> of the cover <b>100</b> such that when the cover <b>100</b> is closed, the spring <b>118</b> is concealed from outside view and hence from dirt and dust and accidental damage from typical field handling (e.g., see AR Overmolded Ultimate Dust Cover by SRIKE INDUSTRIES for an example of an exposed spring). The springs of existing ejection port covers are exposed to the outside when the cover is in the closed or open state.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The pin <b>102</b> can have two diameters (as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>8</b></figref>): a first smaller diameter stretching from the flag <b>116</b> rearward where the spring <b>118</b> wraps around the pin <b>102</b>; and a second larger diameter from the flag <b>116</b> forward and including that portion of the pin <b>102</b> that enters a corresponding hinge opening (e.g., <b>1102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) in the receiver. The flag <b>116</b> can be tapered as it extends away from the pin <b>102</b> (i.e., a widest portion where the flag <b>116</b> meets the pin <b>102</b> and a narrowest portion furthest from the pin <b>102</b>). This tapering is best seen in the side profile view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">During initial assembly of the ejection port cover <b>100</b>, when the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> is first assembled into the cover <b>100</b>, the spring-loaded pin <b>102</b> can be elastically bent to allow installation in the ejection port cover <b>100</b>. This may be needed where the pin <b>102</b> is longer than a distance between the two apertures <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, for instance as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. However, this elastic deformation is not possible nor intended to be called upon by a consumer.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates a method of installing the ejection port cover onto a firearm. The Installation <b>1200</b> involves inserting the rear fixed pin of the ejection port cover (e.g., <b>104</b>) into a corresponding hinge opening in the receiver (Block <b>1202</b>). This can be performed before, in parallel, or after, rotation of the flag by a sufficient amount to clear the notch (Block <b>1204</b>) followed by a rearward pull of the spring-loaded pin (Block <b>1206</b>). The ejection port cover can then be pivoted, with the fixed pin acting as a focal point of the pivot (Block <b>1208</b>), and the spring-loaded pin can be aligned with the corresponding hinge opening in the receiver (Block <b>1210</b>). The user can then release the flag allowing the spring-loaded pin to enter the corresponding hinge opening (Block <b>1212</b>). The ejection port cover, via a torsional bias from the spring, will naturally move to the open position unless the user presses the cover into the closed position where a ball end plunger can hold the ejection port cover in a closed position.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates a method of removing the ejection port cover from a firearm. Removal <b>1300</b> involves rotation of the flag by a sufficient amount to clear the notch (Block <b>1302</b>) followed by a rearward pull of the spring-loaded pin (Block <b>1304</b>). The ejection port cover can then be pivoted, with the fixed pin acting as a focal point of the pivoting (Block <b>1306</b>), until the spring-loaded pin clears the receiver. The fixed pin is then free to be removed with the ejection port cover (Block <b>1308</b>) and the flag can be released (Block <b>1310</b>).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The herein disclosed ejection port cover is primarily composed of polymer, which provides the typical benefits of reduced weight and resistance to corrosion. However, a unique benefit in this application is that the ejection port cover tends to break before it deforms to the point of not functioning correctly (e.g., failing to seal the port or interfering with movement of the bolt). This makes it easy to identify when a part has failed and needs to be replaced. This is especially important when the temptation for a weapon owner or an armorer is to bend a metal cover back into a &#x201c;functional&#x201d; state instead of outright replacing it. This can create substandard performance similar to when an aluminum magazine is &#x201c;repaired&#x201d; in such a manner.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Lip</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The ejection port cover can include an ovular lip <b>144</b> on an inside surface <b>112</b> that fits snugly within the ejection port of the firearm thereby minimizing liquid, debris, dirt and other particles and objects entering the receiver and chamber of the firearm. Use of a polymer for the ejection port cover means that this lip <b>144</b> can be formed with tighter tolerance to the dimensions of the firearm's ejection port. This is because the lip <b>144</b> will not cause metal-on-metal interfacing with the ejection port and can therefore be molded to have a tighter fit to the ejection port (i.e., rubbing is less problematic with a polymer lip <b>144</b> than a metal one). Additionally, the polymer is more malleable than metal, and via deformation can form a tighter seal with the ejection port than traditional metal ejection port covers. For instance, the ovular lip <b>144</b> could be dimensioned to match or oven overlap the ejection port such that some deformation of the ovular lip <b>144</b> occurs when the ejection port cover <b>100</b> is closed.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Cover Lock</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A cover lock assembly <b>150</b> can be arranged at least partially within the circumference of the lip <b>144</b> and may even interrupt a continuous path of the lip <b>144</b>. The cover lock assembly <b>150</b>, like the lip <b>144</b>, can be arranged on an interior surface <b>112</b> of the ejection port cover <b>100</b>. The cover lock assembly <b>150</b> can include a ball-end plunger detent <b>152</b> configured to selectively mate with a locking indent on the receiver when the ejection port cover <b>100</b> is closed thereby securing the ejection port <b>100</b> in a closed state despite the bias of the spring <b>118</b>. The cover lock assembly <b>150</b> can be disassembled by a consumer without specialized tools. The cover lock assembly <b>150</b> also includes a forward-facing ramp <b>154</b> and a rearward-facing ramp <b>156</b> arranged on opposing sides of the detent <b>152</b>. These ramps <b>154</b>, <b>156</b> are arranged and angled such that movement of the firearm's bolt carrier group across either ramp <b>154</b>, <b>156</b> will back drive the detent <b>152</b> and open the ejection port cover <b>100</b> when the weapon is operated. In other words, when the ejection port cover <b>100</b> is closed, the cover lock assembly <b>150</b> protrudes inward toward a center of the chamber and bolt such that when the bolt is racked it impinges one of these two ramps <b>154</b>, <b>156</b> and puts enough torque on the ejection port cover <b>100</b> to back drive the detent <b>152</b> (see depressed detent <b>152</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) and allow the detent <b>152</b> to disengage from the locking detent in the receiver. This in turn allows the spring <b>118</b> to rotate the ejection port cover <b>100</b> from the closed position to the open position thereby allowing the discharge of spent cartridges during firing.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The detent <b>152</b> can be manufactured from steel or another material having greater impact and flex resistance than polymers. Some known detents are formed from a polymer, but see rapid degradation as the polymer detent rubs against the hard-anodized aluminum upper receiver (e.g., the POLYFLEX Dust Cover sold by STRIKE INDUSTRIES).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The terms and expressions employed herein are used as terms and expressions of description and not of limitation, and there is no intention, in the use of such terms and expressions, of excluding any equivalents of the features shown and described or portions thereof.
