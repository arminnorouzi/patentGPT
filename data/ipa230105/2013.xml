When the box sampler reaches the seabed, the counterweight gets triggered first, then the sampling tube is inserted into submarine sediments by the gravity, and next closed shovel rotates to cut the bottom sediments and puts the collected bottom sediments into the sampling box. Due to the large cross-section of the sampling cylinder, the sediments are slightly disturbed or basically-undisturbed during sampling. In this way, the collected sample is columnar and tens of centimeters long, which basically maintains the original structure. The box sampler facilitates the study of the physical mechanics and structures of the sediments and provides conditions for the study of the fauna in the sediments and the enrichment of manganese nodules at the seabed.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">At present, the box sampler is typically launched and recovered by the cooperation between an A-frame and a winch on the ship. However, when in use, the box sampler is inconvenient to operate due to its bulkiness. Especially in the rough sea, the box sampler severely shakes when launched and recovered, which requires several operators to manually stabilize the box sampler. As a result, the A-frame and the sampling device is likely to be damaged by collision due to mighty shaking, and the manual stabilization process may threaten the safety of the operators.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The primary objective of the present disclosure is to solve the above problem by providing a device for launching and recovering a box sampler. The device can be conveniently operated, is safe and reliable, and saves manpower.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To achieve the above objective, the present disclosure adopts the following technical solutions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A device for launching and recovering a box sampler includes a suspension coop, a rail assembly, a moving mechanism, a power unit, and a lifting frame.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The rail assembly is fixedly arranged on a deck; the moving mechanism is arranged on the rail assembly and can move along the rail assembly.

The frame includes two triangular frame bodies, which are fixedly arranged on the base in parallel. Articulation holes are formed in both the top end and the front end of the frame, and the actuating device is fixedly arranged on the base and is located on the outer side of the frame.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, the lifting frame includes the upper frame, a lower frame, and a connecting rod, where the connecting rod connects the upper frame to the lower frame, and an open end of the lower frame is articulated with the suspension coop.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, the actuating device includes a power device and gears, where the gears are in transmission connection with the power device and are meshed with the rack.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, the moving mechanism further includes guide mechanisms, where the guide mechanism is detachably arranged at a side edge of the base and is located on a side of the base, which is not provided with the actuating device. The guide mechanism is provided in the guide rail.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, the guide mechanism includes a bracket and two guide wheels, where the bracket is detachably connected to the base. The two guide wheels are detachably arranged on a lower surface of the bracket.

Compared with the previous operation of stopping the shaking of the box sampler by multiple persons, the operation greatly saves manpower and reduces the risk of danger to the operators.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a structure diagram of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a partial structure of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a structure diagram of a moving mechanism of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a side view of the moving mechanism of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a front view of the moving mechanism of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a structure diagram of a lifting frame of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a using process of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Reference numerals: <b>1</b>, rail assembly, <b>11</b>, rack, <b>12</b>. guide rail, <b>2</b>. moving mechanism, <b>21</b>. base, <b>22</b>. sliding wheel; <b>23</b>. frame, <b>24</b>. actuating device, <b>241</b>. power device, <b>242</b>. gear, <b>25</b>. guide mechanism, <b>251</b>. bracket, <b>252</b>. guide wheel, <b>3</b>. power unit, <b>4</b>. lifting frame, <b>411</b>. upper frame, <b>412</b>. lower frame, <b>413</b>. connecting rod, and <b>42</b>. suspension coop.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present disclosure will be further described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a device for launching and recovering a box sampler of the present disclosure includes a suspension coop <b>42</b>, a rail assembly <b>1</b>, a moving mechanism <b>2</b>, a power unit <b>3</b>, and a lifting frame <b>4</b>, where the rail assembly <b>1</b> is fixedly arranged on a deck.

In this case, the connecting rod <b>413</b> is parallel to the rail assembly <b>1</b>, and the suspension coop <b>42</b> is articulated with the lower frame <b>412</b> and is open upwards. At this time, the moving mechanism <b>2</b> moves to be within an action range of the A-frame under the action of the actuating device <b>24</b>, and a cable is pulled by the winch on the ship to be rove through a pulley of the A-frame to lift the box sampler into the suspension coop <b>42</b>. Meanwhile, the cable is pulled by the winch to be kept tightened, but the box sampler is kept in the suspension coop. When the A-frame swings towards the stern of the ship, the moving mechanism <b>2</b> moves to the stern, and the power unit <b>3</b> starts to extend till the connecting rod <b>413</b> turns over to be perpendicular to the rail assembly <b>1</b>. In this case, the suspension coop is located below the stern and is kept open upwards all the time. When the suspension coop enters water, the cable is pulled back by the winch to lift the box sampler out of the suspension coop and then is released till a closed shovel is triggered to complete sampling in a way that the box sampler is brought into contact with a seabed. When the box sampler is recovered and is about to come out of the water, the winch lifts the box sampler into the suspension coop, the cable is pulled by the winch to be kept tightened, the power unit <b>3</b> starts to retract till the connecting rod <b>413</b> is parallel to the rail assembly <b>1</b>, and the moving mechanism <b>2</b> moves to a proper position of the deck under the action of the actuating device <b>24</b> to facilitate sampling. During the entire process of launching and recovering the box sampler, the operation is easy and convenient, the movement is smooth. It is not necessary to stop the box sampler from shaking by operators, which saves manpower and reduces the risk of danger to the operators.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It should be noted that in the description of the present disclosure, orientations or position relationships are indicated by terms, such as &#x201c;front end&#x201d;, &#x201c;rear end&#x201d;, &#x201c;left&#x201d;, &#x201c;right&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, and &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; based on the drawings.
